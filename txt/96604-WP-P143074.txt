Non-Technical Summary
A.       Introduction
As a small and open economy, Belarus’ development perspectives are intrinsically linked to
its ability to produce and sell goods and services competitively in the global marketplace.
While Belarus is an open economy, its trade links are concentrated both in terms of products and
markets. Mineral goods –most importantly refined oil and potassium chloride - are the main export
product accounting for more than 1/3 of total exports. Non mineral exports, including most
importantly machinery, vehicles and transport equipment are mostly exported to Russia and other
CIS markets, which account for 74 percent of non-mineral exports while the share of EU countries
in Belarus non-mineral exports account for less than 15 percent. Importantly, Belarus has
gradually lost market share internationally in many of its major employment generating
manufacturing products, including transport equipment (tractors, dump trucks, diesel powered
trucks) and machinery. At the same time, rising commodity prices resulted in increasing
concentration of Belarus’ export bundle in minerals and chemical products, making Belarus more
vulnerable to commodity price shocks. With Russia’s WTO accession in 2012 competitive
pressures on Belarus’ major market for non-mineral exports have further intensified. As Belarus is
accelerating its own negotiations with the WTO, understanding the challenges and opportunities
faced by the country’s exporters is critical to putting in place an effective adaptation strategy that
will enhance competitiveness and ensure Belarus can take full advantage of more open market
access.1

The objective of this note is to analyze the economic impacts of Belarus’ potential accession
to the WTO.2 The note utilizes a modern computable general equilibrium model of the economy
of Belarus3 to simulate impacts on the economy as a whole and on individual sectors. Importantly,
the model incorporates liberalization of and foreign direct investment in business services (in
addition to liberalization of trade in goods where major commitments are already binding under
the customs union). The model is consistent with both economic theory and the substantial and
growing empirical literature that have shown that foreign direct investment and the wide
availability of business services results in total factor productivity gains to the manufacturing
sector and the economy broadly4 The results are intended to inform policy decisions with regard to

  See World Bank (2012) for a broader discussion of structural reforms and the role of state owned
enterprises in the economy of Belarus.

  The Working Party on the accession of Belarus to the World Trade Organization was established on
October 27, 1993, and held its first meeting in June 1997. The latest meeting of the Working Party was held
in May 2005, but bilateral market access negotiations are ongoing. Due to the fact that Belarus is a member
of the ECU (with Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia), Russian accession has resulted in Belarus adopting
many of the commitments of Russia to WTO members (such as tariff commitments and limitations on trade
distorting subsidies in agriculture), without Belarus obtaining the rights of a member of the WTO. Since
2010, Belarus has reinvigorated its own accession process with WTO members.
3
  At the requests of the Governments of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, a similar model was
employed to assess the impacts of their WTO accession initiatives. (See Jensen, Rutherford and Tarr (2007)
for the Russian Federation; and Jensen and Tarr (2008) for Kazakhstan.) A detailed technical description of
the model and utilized data inputs is included in the technical paper.

  Focusing on the effects on manufacturing specifically in transition economies, Berulava (2011) finds that
liberalization reforms in telecommunications, electric power, railway transport, road transport, and water
distribution sectors as well as in banking sector indeed stimulate expansion of export activities of
manufacturers. Examining the reform process of the Czech Republic, Arnold, Javorcik, and Mattoo, (2011)
find a positive and statistically significant correlation between firm performance in downstream
manufacturing and the overall liberalization of services on one hand and the presence of foreign providers of
services, and the extent of privatization of services industries on the other. Shepotylo and Vakhitov (2012)
found similar results in Ukraine. Zhang, Tang, and Findlay (2010) assess the productivity effects of services
trade liberalization on Chinese manufacturing firms. They find that service liberalization and service
outsourcing led to a significant increase in total factor productivity of firms located in east China. According
                                                           v
the World Trade Organization (WTO) accession process, and in particular the negotiations of
commitments on trade in services, and a broader, accompanying strategy to improve
competitiveness and enhance the positive impact of WTO membership while mitigating potential
risks.

Specifically, the note presents simulation results of the following scenarios:

       Impact of adopting reduction in customs union external tariffs consistent with
        Russia’s WTO commitments: As member of the customs union Belarus is obliged to
        adopt reductions in the unified external customs union tariff consistent with Russia’s
        commitments to the WTO. This will result in a gradual reduction in the unweighted
        average tariff from 10 percent in 2012 to 7.8 percent in 2020. These tariff changes will
        have to be adopted regardless of whether Belarus itself joins the WTO.
       Impact of Belarus’s potential WTO accession: Aside of the tariff related commitments
        which are already binding in the context of the customs union, Belarus’s own WTO
        accession would have substantial impacts on the economy as commitments will include
        areas such as rights of investors in business services, customs regulations, product
        standards, especially in food and agricultural, trade related intellectual property and trade
        related investment measures. The impact of the following specific policy changes are
        estimated: i) improved market access for sectors that have been subject to anti-dumping
        actions in export markets; ii) reduction of discriminatory barriers against foreign suppliers
        of services in the Belarussian market; iii) reduction of non-discriminatory barriers in the
        Belarussian market; and iv) adoption of WTO consistent phyto-sanitary and sanitary
        standards. The results are presented both for the overall impact of adopting these reforms
        and for each policy measure separately.

The simulation results suggest that Belarus could reap significant welfare gains not only
from tariff reductions but more importantly from full WTO membership. Adopting the
reduction in external customs union tariffs, consistent with Russia’s WTO commitments is
expected to result in aggregate net welfare gains, equal to 1 percent of aggregate consumption (0.5
percent of gross domestic product (GDP). In addition, we estimate that the net welfare gains of
WTO accession to Belarus will equal a permanent increase of 8.2 percent of Belarusian
consumption (or 4.0 percent of GDP) in the medium term:

       The most substantial expansion of output occurs in the business services sectors. All
        business service sectors are expected to expand as a result of lower barriers to foreign
        investment and WTO induced liberalization. Four service sectors, insurance,
        communications, other professional service and rail and other transportation services are
        expected to register output increases of more than 9 percent. Employment expands the
        most in insurance, other professional services and other financial services. Overall, the
        estimated direct welfare gain related to the expansion service sectors following the
        reduction of discriminatory and non-discriminatory regulatory barriers amounts to 7.2
        percent of consumption or 3.5 percent of GDP. Moreover, more competitive business
        services will also imply indirect benefits through linkages with the manufacturing sector
        (see next bullet).
       The manufacturing sector is also expected to expand. We estimate that most
        manufacturing sectors will expand slightly in the medium term and more strongly in the
        long run.5 The reduction in regulatory barriers in service sectors expected under WTO
        commitments will bring in additional service varieties and lower costs of using business
        services. This in turn would lower the cost of doing business and result in a productivity

to Arnold, Javorcik, Lipscomb, and Mattoo, (2012), policy reforms in services sectors played a major role in
the transformation of the manufacturing sector in India, allowing greater foreign and domestic competition
with greatly improved regulation.

  In the long run, the only manufacturing sectors that we estimate will decline are wood and wood products
(3.4 percent), machinery and equipment (0.8 percent) and electrical and optical equipment (0.8 percent).
                                                         vi
        improvement for the manufacturing sector as users of business services. We see that the
        cost of business services falls in all sectors, with the most significant decreases (by about
        14-16 percent) expected in other professional services and insurance. Sectors that most
        intensely use business services, especially business services that experience the largest
        decrease in their prices, will see their costs fall the most. In addition, sectors that export
        will see an improvement of their export prices due to the small real depreciation of the
        exchange rate; and five sectors will obtain improved market access in export sectors. Due
        to the combination of these impacts, the four manufacturing sectors that we estimate will
        expand the most in the long run (percentages output increase in parentheses) are:
        food, beverages and tobacco (5.1 percent); chemicals (7.1 percent); textiles and textile
        products (4.2 percent);pulp and paper production (4.5 percent); and leather and leather
        products (13.7 percent).


       Agriculture is expected to see small positive impacts. The results suggest a small
        increase in the output of agriculture in the medium term of 0.8 percent. In the long run,
        however, where the economy has time to adjust to a new higher level of capital stock, we
        estimate that WTO accession will lead to an expansion of the agriculture sector of 6.3
        percent. Thus, despite the fact that we incorporate a reduction by 25 percent in the ad
        valorem equivalent of the non-tariff barriers that protect agriculture, we do not estimate an
        adverse impact of WTO accession on agriculture. In part this is explained by the fact that
        we do not assume a reduction of agricultural subsidies as part of the WTO accession
        scenario. As part of the obligations of the Republic of Belarus in the Eurasian Customs
        Union (ECU), Belarus must reduce it trade-distorting agricultural subsidies approximately
        consistent with Russian levels under Russia’s WTO commitments--which should be
        sufficient for Belarus to meet WTO accession requirements. So like with tariffs, the
        subsidy reduction should not be considered an additional obligation of Belarus due to its
        WTO accession.

However, despite the expected overall positive impact, the analysis also reveals
vulnerabilities in several key sectors. As a result of Russia’s tariff reduction under its WTO
commitments, Belarus will experience preference erosion in Russian markets. While many sectors
would expand in response to the reduction in the external custom union tariff, tariff changes will
induce significant output declines in some sectors, most notably in transport equipment (-11
percent); leather and footwear (-7.8 percent); and pulp and paper production (-5.5 percent). In
addition to these Customs Union tariff induced contractions, Belarus accession to the WTO would
also be expected to adversely affect certain sectors. In the long run, the manufacturing sectors that
we estimate will decline are wood and wood products (3.4 percent), machinery and equipment (0.8
percent) and electrical and optical equipment (0.8 percent), with three sectors experiencing
contractions larger than 1 percent of output: wood and wood products (-2.7 percent); forestry and
related services activities (-3.4 percent); and mining and quarrying except energy (-4.5 percent).
This is mainly due to reallocation of labor and capital as increased profitability of the services
sectors (and other expanding sectors) induces them to bid up wages and the return on capital which
attracts capital and labor away from the rest of the economy.

The following sections present the simulation results in more detail and point to possible policy
implications of the findings.

B.        Impact of Reductions in External Tariffs of the Customs Union
In spite of not yet being WTO member, Belarus will be obliged to adopt the common
external customs union tariff, consistent with Russia’s commitments to WTO. As part of its
WTO accession commitments, the Russian Federation has agreed to substantial tariff reductions to
be implemented in phases between 2011 and 2020. As a member of the Belarus- Kazakhstan-
Russia Customs Union, Belarus has committed to implement the tariff reductions Russia has
agreed as part of Russia’s WTO accession commitments. As a result of Russia’s commitments to
the WTO the (unweighted) average tariff will gradually fall from 10 percent in 2012 to 7.8 percent
by the year 2020. Commitments include reductions in the tariffs for manufactured goods from 9.4
percent to 7.2 percent and for agricultural products from 13.3 percent to 11.2 percent. More than
one-third of the tariff lines were adjusted immediately after Russia’s WTO accession, while the
remaining tariff lines will be reduced gradually. By using 2011 as our benchmark equilibrium, we
take the initial implementation of the common external tariff of the Customs Union by Belarus in
2010 and 2011 as part of the initial status quo or “benchmark” equilibrium; and we assess the
implications for Belarus of the reductions in the common external tariff of the Customs Union
after 2011, that is, from 2012 until 2020.
                                                                     viii
           Belarus is expected to gain 1.1 percent of consumption (0.5 percent of GDP) as a result of
           implementing the tariff reductions agreed by Russia as part of Russia’s WTO accession
           commitments.6 In column 7 of Table S-1, we show our estimates of the impacts of these tariff
           changes on Belarus until 2020. The estimated gains of 1.1 percent of consumption are the net
           impact of two aspects of the tariff reductions by Customs Union members: (i) a gain of 2.0 percent
           of consumption from improved resource allocation and productivity impacts in Belarus; and (ii) a
           loss of 0.9 percent of consumption from erosion of tariff preferences in the markets of Russia and
           Kazakhstan. Although we estimate output expansion for many sectors, we also estimate that the
           tariff changes will induce significant output declines in several sectors. The most notable sector
           output declines are: transport equipment, 11 percent; leather and footwear, 7.8 percent; and pulp
           and paper production, 5.5 percent. The expected output declines emphasize the need for Belarus to
           improve its international competitiveness as part of comprehensive adaptation strategy. Impacts on
           the output by sector of implementing Russia’s tariff commitments are shown in Table S-2.

           implement the common external tariff of the Customs Union.

C.      Impact of WTO Accession
WTO accession will have substantial implications for economic policies beyond tariff
commitments. As part of accession negotiations, Belarus is expected to schedule commitments in
areas such as rights of investors in business services, customs regulations, product standards,
especially in food and agricultural, trade related intellectual property and trade related investment
measures. These commitments –which unlike tariff commitment are subject to Belarus’ own
negotiations with WTO member states - will imply wide-ranging reforms in Belarus’ regulatory
environment.

The negotiations of commitments related to trade in services are particularly important.
Unlike trade in goods, trade in services is not impeded by tariff and non-tariff border measures.
Most barriers to service trade are national regulatory measures. In Belarus, various regulatory
requirements currently prevent market access and foreign investment in key sectors, including
financial, telecommunications, professional and transport services (see Box S-1 for an overview of
prevailing barriers). As part of the WTO negotiation process Belarus is likely to be expected to
address some of the regulatory provisions and practices that may hamper market access. Under the
General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), WTO members are obliged to progressively
liberalize trade in services and ensure that domestic regulatory measures do not create unnecessary
barriers to trade in services. Although WTO accession will obligate Belarus to take on
liberalization commitments in many of the key business services sectors such as financial services
and telecommunications, the GATS is designed to allow flexibility in the negotiation process and
specific service commitments may vary substantially both across countries and within countries
across different sectors. This offers considerable room for tailoring commitments, but it also offers
an opportunity to selectively open up service sectors and lock-in reform under international
agreement, especially in those sectors where liberalization promises to generate economic gains.
Moreover, even in a liberalized environment, governments retain the ability to address public
policy objectives through more market-oriented (e.g. less distorting) regulations, for example
prudential regulations in banking and universal service obligations.

The WTO process could therefore provide an important external anchor for structural and
regulatory reforms to boost service sector development. Despite some promising growth trends
in particular service sectors, most notably ICT, overall the service sector remains small for its level
of income, in terms of contribution to GDP (Figure S-1). This is the result of Belarus inherited
industrial structure with a large manufacturing sector, but also related to restrictive policy and
regulatory frameworks in several service sectors, including financial services, communications and
professional services (Figure S-2). There is strong evidence that liberalization and more
competition leads to lower prices, better quality and wider choice for consumers. Enabling the
provision of services by the private sector, allowing foreign investment and eliminating restrictions
that create non-competitive and inefficient market structures can all contribute to more productive
service sectors. These direct benefits in terms of improved service sector performance, in turn,
work their way through the economic system and help to improve supply conditions for many
other producers that rely on service inputs, such as telecommunications, financial and transport
services are important inputs for all sectors of the economy.

Box S-1. Service Sector Regulations in Belarus

Like in other countries service sectors in Belarus are subject to a range of regulatory
requirements.7 Licensing, limitations on foreign investment entry, quality and safety
requirements, and recognition of qualifications for professionals are examples of regulations
typically imposed in service industries. While these requirements are generally intended to achieve
legitimate policy objectives, such as consumer protection, financial sector stability, environmental
protection, public safety etc., by restricting market entry, operation and hence competition they can
pose barriers to the development of these sectors and in particular to cross border trade in services.
While the focus of the GATS is naturally on discriminatory regulations that impose different
treatment on foreign suppliers, non-discriminatory regulations (e.g. those that apply to all suppliers
alike) may also become subject to WTO commitments if they are deemed to pose barriers to trade.
The table below summarizes some of the most pertinent regulatory barriers in nine service sectors
in Belarus.
                                             Rail Transport
Non-                Market Structure: Railway passenger and cargo transport services are provided
discriminatory by a monopoly state-owned company Belarusian Railways which is under the
                    Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Republic of Belarus.
                    Licenses: are not issued to private firms, foreign or domestic.
                    Investments: Equity ownership by foreign companies or domestic private
                    companies in rail transport services, either in whole or in part, has not been
                    allowed.
                                                Insurance
Non-                Restrictions on services: Insurers with over 49 percent private equity
Discriminatory participation –foreign or domestic- are prohibited from providing the following
                    insurance services: insurance services to state owned companies; motor vehicle
                    third party liability insurance; work injury and occupational diseases; life, health
                    and personal accident insurance for state employees if compulsory; property
                    insurance for buildings owned by private persons; agricultural insurance for
                    crops and livestock; medical insurance for foreign visitors without insurance;
                    carrier liability for dangerous cargos; and any mandatory insurance service.
                    Licensing: both foreign and domestic firms face a complicated and costly
                    licensing procedure including a requirement to deposit and hold Euro 5 million
                    in Belarusian banks.
                    Other Services: Insurance companies (both foreign and domestic) are prohibited
                    from providing other kinds of services, such as banking or securities services.
                    Reinsurance: Regarding reinsurance, under certain conditions, insurers must
                    make a compulsory cession to the state company Belarusian National
                    Reinsurance Organization (Belarus Re).
Discriminatory Quantitative restriction on foreign ownership: The share of foreign insurers in
                    the aggregate share capital of insurers domiciled in Belarus may not exceed 30
                    percent. When this is exceeded, the supervisor will no longer register companies
                    with foreign ownership shares.
                    Cross-border insurance supply by foreign insurance companies. Belarusians
                    or foreign companies operating in Belarus are not allowed to insure their
                    property from a foreign firm located outside the country; this includes

   The provision of many services is characterized by market imperfections, including asymmetric
information, externalities and parts of sectors are natural monopolies. This is mainly for three reasons: (1)
services are usually intangible and cannot be inspected by consumers before they are bought; (2) services
that require specialized distribution networks (e.g., the grid in electricity distribution (but not the production
or sale to final consumers), the track-bed in rail transportation or the pipeline in gas distribution (but not the
production of sale to final consumers)) are characterized by the prevalence of natural monopolies or
oligopolies in parts of the sector; and (3) services tend to be tailored for specific customers and thus
contract-enforcing institutions arguably assume greater importance in services. Optimal regulation would
attempt to overcome the potential inefficiencies that can arise as a result of these service characteristics
without preventing competition or imposing excessive costs on suppliers of services.

                  automobile or life insurance services.
                                          Banking Sector
Non-              Licensing: A license for accepting deposits from physical persons can be
discriminatory    obtained only after 2 years following registration of the bank, or if the bank has
                  at least 200 percent of the minimum capital requirement.
                  Services restrictions: Banks are prohibited from offering insurance services.
Discriminatory    Direct Branching: Foreign banks may not enter Belarus as a branch of the
                  foreign headquarters bank.
                  Quantitative Restriction on Foreign Ownership: The maximum foreign equity
                  participation as a whole banking system (in Belarusian and foreign banks) is
                  regulated by the National Bank so that it may not exceed 50 percent.
                                           Legal Services
Discriminatory    Licensing: Foreign nationals are prohibited from providing legal services in
                  Belarus. This powerful restraint gives foreign nationals very limited
                  opportunities to engage in legal services in Belarus, and is in violation of some
                  international agreements, including the reciprocity agreement on legal services
                  with Lithuania.
                  Direct Branching: Foreign law firms are not allowed to enter Belarus as a
                  branch.
                                    Accounting and Auditing Services
Non-              Licensing: To obtain a work permit accountants and auditors must have 3-years
discriminatory    of experience and pass a qualification exam administered by the Ministry of
                  Finance.
Discriminatory    Direct Branching: Foreign firms may not enter as a branch of a multinational
                  firm.
                                           Air Transport
De-Facto          Airport Services: By law transport terminal services, airport services, operation
Discriminatory    and maintenance of air routes and air traffic control in Belarus are classified as
                  natural monopolies. In practice, these services are provided mainly by state
                  firms.
                  Market Entry: Although there are no legal restrictions on market entry, there
                  are no foreign airlines that provide domestic air services in Belarus.
                  Direct Investment: The maximum foreign ownership of domestic airline
                  companies would be decided by the regulator of the industry and, in practice, a
                  controlling or blocking stake would likely be retained by the state. Although
                  the legally permitted equity participation of foreign firms is 100 percent, in
                  practice, foreign equity ownership equals zero. This suggests some restrictions
                  in practice.
Non-              Market structure: There is a monopoly of state companies.
Discriminatory
Discriminatory Subsidies: The Government only subsidizes domestic companies.
                                         Retail Trade
Non-           Restrictions on large-scale stores: The market share of a single retailer is
discriminatory constrained to less than 20 percent. When reaching this limit, the retailer would
               not be able to expand the business within a given administrative territory.
               Factors affecting investment: Acquisition of commercial land is not permitted
               for either Belarusian or foreign companies. Local authorities in Belarus have
               special departments to screen investment; all investment projects are scrutinized
               and assessed.
               Local government requirements: The opening hours and the list of products the
               outlet may sell are usually restricted.
               Statutory government monopolies: In Belarus, the government has a monopoly
               in the distribution of petroleum and petroleum products.
                               Fixed Line Telephone Services
                                          xii
    Non-                  Licensing: While there is no restriction on establishment new firms, no new
    discriminatory        license is being issued. Entering the market by acquiring a stake in Beltelecom
                          or establishing a joint venture in or with Beltelcom will require approval of the
                          President.


                                     Mobile telephone services
    Non-           Interconnection: Beltelecom has a monopoly for connecting other networks,
    discriminatory i.e. wireless carriers and Internet Service Providers can interconnect via
                   Beltelecom only. Direct interconnection agreements between carriers are
                   prohibited.
                   Restrictions on certain types of services: Private mobile telephone service
                   providers are not permitted to own international gateway. Beltelecom is a
                   monopoly provider of international gateway exchange in Belarus.
    Discriminatory Equity Restrictions. Although Velcom is a wholly owned foreign company, in
    de facto       practice, it appears difficult to enter the market without Beltelecom as a joint
                   venture partner. Beltelecom kept an equity stake in MTS (51 percent) and BeST
                   (Life, 20 percent), despite the fact that MTS operates as a majority owned
                   company in other countries.

    Our central WTO scenario estimates the impact of four different types of policy changes:

         1. Improved market access through improved rights in antidumping investigations for
            WTO members: Given that WTO members have improved legal rights in antidumping
            investigations in their export markets, we assume that five Belarusian sectors that have
            been subject to antidumping actions in export markets receive slightly improved market
            access. This is implemented as a small exogenous increase in their export price.
         2. Reduction of discriminatory barriers in service sectors: Given the important role of
            services negotiations in WTO accession, we assume that discriminatory barriers that
                                                   xiii
        Belarus maintains against foreign suppliers of services are reduced by fifty percent of
        their ad valorem equivalents.
    3. Reduction of non-discriminatory barriers in service sectors: Given that non-
       discriminatory barriers against service providers (that is, barriers that impact both
       Belarusian and foreign services suppliers) that limit market access of WTO members fall
       under the purview of the GATS scheduling negotiations, we assume that non-
       discriminatory services barriers in services are reduced by 25 percent of their ad valorem
       equivalents.
    4. Adoption of Phyto-Sanitary standards consistent with WTO requirements: Ad valorem
       equivalents of WTO inconsistent sanitary and phyto-sanitary barriers in agriculture are
       reduced by 25 percent.

The WTO scenario does not incorporate further tariff reductions. As pointed out in the
previous section, because of Belarus’ membership in the Customs Union and Russia’s membership
in the WTO, tariffs are not subject to negotiations, as Belarus will have to adopt the external
customs union tariff which is consistent with Russia commitments to the WTO. WTO accession
should not result in any further tariff reductions beyond what Belarus will implement as part of the
Customs Union. Nor will Belarus have to reduce trade-distorting agricultural subsidies below what
is required as part of its membership in the ECU.

The estimates suggest that in the medium term, WTO accession would increase the welfare
(or real income) of Belarusian nationals by 8.2 percent of private consumption per year or
4.0 percent of GDP per year. In our long run model (what we call the steady-state in the table)
we allow the capital stock to endogenously adjust to the improved investment climate. In the long
run, we estimate that Belarus would gain 16.0 percent of the value of consumption each year, or
7.8 percent of GDP each year. We estimate real wages would increase by about 3.8 percent in the
medium term and 7.1 percent in the long term. Slightly less than one percent of the labor force
would have to change employment.

The most substantial expansion of output occurs in the business services sectors, especially
insurance, communications and professional services that expand by more than nine percent
of output. Although there are several manufacturing sectors that slightly contract (most notably
wood and wood products and mining and quarrying other than energy), we estimate that most
manufacturing sectors will expand slightly (in the medium term and more strongly in the long run.
This includes expansions in food products, textiles and textile products, pulp and paper products
and chemicals. We estimate a small increase in the output of the agriculture sector of 0.8 percent in
the medium term and 6.3 percent in the long term. See Table S-2 for all sector output results from
WTO accession in both the in both the medium term and long run.

Among the different policy measures, the reduction of discriminatory and especially non-
discriminatory barriers in service sectors is expected to generate the most significant welfare
gains. To assess the contributions to the estimated welfare gains of each of our four components of
WTO accession of Belarus, we execute four simulations in which we only change the one policy.
In columns 2, 3, 4 and 5 of Table 1, we show that the most important contributors to the estimated
gains in welfare of Belarus from WTO accession are the reductions of discriminatory and
especially non-discriminatory barriers against suppliers of services. The fifty percent reduction in
the discriminatory barriers against foreign suppliers of services is estimated to result in a gain of
1.7 percent of consumption per year; and a 25 percent reduction of the ad valorem equivalent of
the non-discriminatory barriers that adversely impact both Belarusian and foreign service
providers is estimated to lead to a welfare gain of 5.5 percent of consumption per year. The
reduction in the barriers against suppliers of services increases profitability for services suppliers
in Belarus, thereby inducing new entry by service providers. Belarusian businesses will then have
improved access to services in areas like telecommunication, banking, insurance, transportation
and other business services. Econometric evidence indicates that additional service suppliers in the
business services sectors should lower the cost of doing business and result in a productivity

                                                     xiv
      improvement for users of these goods in manufacturing and throughout the economy, and our
      model assessments endogenously incorporate these productivity improvements. In comparison, the
      improved market access (under antidumping provisions) and adoption of phyto-Sanitary standards
      (SPS) are estimated to generate a combined welfare increase of 0.5 percent of consumption.

      To assess which services sector reforms are likely to yield the greatest gains, we assess the
      impact of policy reforms in eight key business services sectors. We also assess the impact of
      reduction of the ad valorem equivalents of discriminatory and non-discriminatory barriers
      separately, at the levels of reduction consistent with our WTO accession scenario: fifty percent of
      discriminatory barriers and 25 percent for non-discriminatory barriers.8 Our results are presented in
      Table S-3. We find that the greatest gains from any single services sector reform come from
      reduction of non-discriminatory barriers in the rail and other transport sector (2.3 percent of
      consumption), followed by the trade sector (2.0 percent of consumption). Rail and other transport
      is the sector with the highest ad valorem equivalent of services barriers in our dataset and also
      constitutes a substantial 4.1 percent of the aggregate value-added in the economy of Belarus. The
      trade sector is the largest sector in Belarus, so even though the ad valorem equivalents of the
      barriers are not high, the costs of the low barriers are high. The greatest gains from reduction of
      discriminatory barriers are in the “other financial services” sector, which includes banking (1.1
      percent of consumption). Despite a zero estimated gain for reduction of foreign discriminatory
      barriers in insurance, rail transport and air transport, we believe there would be gains from
      reduction of the barriers against foreigners in these sectors. As explained in the text, the model
      takes a very conservative approach to estimation of the impacts of reform when the initial foreign
      share is zero (as in rail and air transport) or where the sector share is very small (as in insurance).

Reforms

        We believe that these percentage reductions in the ad valorem equivalents of the services barriers are
      conservative estimates of the average reductions likely to be achieved, but the cuts may be more or less is
      any particular sector. But these estimated gains in particular sectors could be seen as the expected gains from
      reform in the individual sector of these cuts, independent of WTO commitments.
                                                                xv
D.       Policy Implication
The WTO accession process offers an important opportunity to Belarus to promote
regulatory reforms, especially in service sectors, which would boost productivity and
competitiveness. Unlike in the trade for goods where liberalization is focused primarily on the
removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers, service liberalization implies the creation of a competitive
and non-discriminatory regulatory environment. As part of its WTO negotiation and adaptation
strategy, the government will need to review the existing regulatory environment in those service
sectors subject which will likely be subject to WTO commitments. Deregulating services is a
complex task that needs to carefully balance the potential benefits of more open markets with other
legitimate policy objectives. Steps to deregulate therefore need to be accompanied by efforts to
establish sound and independent regulatory and supervisory infrastructures.9 Targeted
liberalization measures to remove barriers to competition and open up markets could contribute to
higher productivity, lower cost and broader access to services. The analysis in this paper indicates
that particular consideration should be given to the elimination of non-discriminatory barriers. The
results suggest that such reforms would substantially increase the productivity and competitiveness
of the economy of Belarus, resulting in substantial increases in the incomes of the citizens of
Belarus. Increasing the performance of service sectors matters not only because the service sector
itself remains small in terms of value added and exports, but also because services are critical
inputs for many other sectors. Enabling the competitive provision of financial, transport,
logistical, communication and other business services is an important pillar of an overall strategy
to strengthen competitiveness, especially of the tradable sector. Given the deep forward linkages
services have with the rest of the economy, efficiency improvements in intermediate commercial
services are innately linked to the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy.

  Marel (2012) and Shepard and Marel (2013) find that after deregulation in a particular services sector, the ability to
successfully export services depends on how well domestic (regulatory) institutions govern these deregulated markets in
terms of private sector development.

Main Report

A.       Introduction and Summary of Key Results
1.      The Working Party on the accession of Belarus to the WTO was established on October
27, 1993, and held its first meeting in June 1997. The latest meeting of the Working Party was held
in May 2005, but bilateral market access negotiations are ongoing. Due to the fact that Belarus is a
member of the ECU (with Russia and Kazakhstan), the accession of Russia to the WTO has
provided added impetus to Belarus to accede to the WTO. Russian accession has resulted in
Belarus adopting many of the commitments of Russia to WTO members (such as tariff
commitments and limitations on trade distorting subsidies in agriculture), without obtaining the
rights of a member of the WTO. Possibly motivated by this fact, since 2010, there has been
substantial work between the WTO members and the Government of Belarus.10

2.      Despite the obligations of the Government of Belarus under the Customs Union, WTO
accession is expected to have substantial impacts on the economy as commitments or reform will
include areas such as rights of investors in business services, customs regulations, product
standards, especially in food and agricultural, trade related intellectual property and trade related
investment measures. The Government of Belarus has requested this quantitative assessment of the
consequences of WTO accession in Belarus that would attempt to assess the overall impact of
these changes.

3.       We develop and modern, innovative computable general equilibrium model of the
economy of Belarus to undertake this assessment. Crucially, the model is constructed to be
consistent with both economic theory and the substantial and growing empirical literature that
have shown that foreign direct investment and the wide availability of business services results in
total factor productivity gains to the manufacturing sector and the economy broadly.11

4.       We find that WTO accession would be expected to increase the welfare (or real income) of
Belarusian nationals by 8.2 percent of private consumption per year.12 Our decomposition analysis
finds that it is the reduction of barriers against suppliers of services that is the most important
contributor to the gains in welfare of Belarus. A fifty percent reduction in the discriminatory
barriers against foreign suppliers of services is estimated to result in a gain of 1.7 percent of
consumption; and a 25 percent reduction of the ad valorem equivalent of the non-discriminatory
barriers that adversely impact both Belarusian and foreign service providers is estimated to lead to
a welfare gain of 5.5 percent of consumption per year.

5.      Further decomposition of our WTO scenario into impacts of individual services sector
reforms shows that the greatest gains from any single services sector reform comes from reduction

   An updated Factual Summary by the WTO Secretariat on the status of the accession of Belarus to the WTO
was circulated in November 2012. In March 2013, a set of follow-up questions and answers by the
Government of Belarus were circulated by the WTO Secretariat. For a list of documents available on WTO
accession by the WTO Secretariat see http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/a1_belarus_e.htm.
11
   For the theoretical literature, see, for example, Markusen (1989) and Francois (1990). See Francois and
Hoekman (2010) for a survey of more than a dozen empirical studies that support this finding. Support
comes from a variety of sources including studies that use firm level data, such as Arnold et al. (2011) for
the Czech Republic, Fernandes and Paunov (2012) for Chile, Arnold et al. (2012) for India, and Shepotylo
and Vakhitov (2012) for Ukraine. Examples of studies that use cross country growth regressions are
Fernandes (2009) for the Transition economies and Mattoo et al. (2006).

   Our calculations based on the national accounts data for 2011 of Belstat show private consumption at 47.1
percent of GDP, with a statistical discrepancy in the GDP components of 2.6 percent. In our model, we must
eliminate statistical discrepancies and we have private consumption at 49.0 percent of GDP. For the Belstat
data,    see:     http://belstat.gov.by/en/ofitsialnaya-statistika/otrasli-statistiki/natsionalnye-scheta/osnovnye-

of non-discriminatory barriers in the in the rail and other transport sector (2.3 percent of
consumption), followed by the trade sector (2.0 percent of consumption). The greatest gains from
reduction of discriminatory barriers is in the “other financial services” sector, which includes
banking (1.1 percent of consumption).

6.       We also identify and quantify where two potential complementary structural reforms can
significantly contribute to the growth and competitiveness of the economy of Belarus. We call
these reforms complementary because they are mostly independent of WTO accession and we
model them independently. In particular, we find that a more aggressive fifty percent reduction in
the ad valorem equivalents of the non-discriminatory barriers against services providers than what
may be required by WTO accession could have an even more substantial impact on the
productivity, competitiveness and output of the Belarusian economy than WTO accession; we
estimate a gain of 11.7 percent of consumption from a fifty percent reduction in the ad valorem
equivalents of these barriers. And based on data on the relative productiveness of various sectors in
Belarus by type of ownership, we find that institutional reforms that would lead to over time to a
fifty percent reduction in the state sector share of the economy in favor of the private sector would
lead to a large dramatic increase in the productivity, competitiveness and output of the economy of
Belarus. We estimate that the welfare of Belarus would increase by 36.2 percent of consumption
per year under our central modeling assumptions of privatization. By increasing the productivity
and competitiveness of Belarusian firms, we find both of these complementary reforms would lead
to a reduction of imports, contrary to WTO accession. We hope that by identifying these
complementary reforms to WTO accession, we may be able to assist the Government in its efforts
to use the WTO accession process as a vehicle to make the economy more competitive.

7.      We conduct extensive sensitivity analysis of both our WTO accession and privatization
scenarios, with respect to modeling assumptions and parameter values. Although there is a large
variance in the estimated gains from privatization depending on the modeling assumptions, the
estimated gains from privatization are always very large.

8.      Finally, we also assess the impact on Belarus of its implementation of Russia’s WTO tariff
commitments as part of its Customs Union membership commitments. We exclude tariff reduction
from the WTO accession scenario for Belarus, since Belarus has agreed to reduce tariffs as part of
its Customs Union membership and intends to accede to the WTO at the level of Russia’s tariff
commitments. To be clear, we do not assess the impact on Belarus of its initial implementation of
the common external tariff in 2010. Rather, we quantify the impact of the lowering of the common
external tariff of the Customs Union. This has benefits and costs for Belarus: benefits from better
resource allocation in Belarus where production will be better aligned with world prices, and better
access to internationally competitive goods and technologies; costs from an erosion of tariff
preferences for Belarusian exporters in the markets of Russia and Kazakhstan. On balance, we
assess gains to Belarus from the lowering of the common external tariff.

9.      In Section 2, we provide an overview of the model and a brief literature review. The key
data are explained in Section 3. Results for WTO accession are explained in Section 4. The
complementary reforms of non-discriminatory reform of services and privatization are discussed in
Sections 6 and 7, respectively. We conduct sensitivity analysis in Section 8 and offer conclusions
in Section 9.


B.      Overview of the Model
Literature Review and General Model Features

10.     Given that commitments to foreign investors in services are a key aspect of WTO
accession negotiations, as well as modern Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), there have also been



                                                     2
several papers in recent years that examine foreign director investment (FDI) in services.13
Markusen, Rutherford and Tarr (2005) introduced a stylized CGE model with FDI in services and
Dixit-Stiglitz endogenous productivity effects. These key features were developed into a full CGE
models and used to analyze WTO accession of Russia by Jensen et al. (2007) and Rutherford and
Tarr (2008; 2010) and in Kazakhstan by Jensen and Tarr (2008).14 Given the importance of
preferential commitments to foreign investors in services, the model was extended to incorporate
preferential commitments to foreign investors in services and applied to Kenya by Balistreri and
Tarr (2011) and Armenia by Jensen and Tarr (2012). This paper builds on the algebraic structure
of these latter two models, but extends it to incorporate productivity increases from Privatization.

11.      Here we provide a general description of the structure. A mathematical description of the
model is included as Appendix 7. There are 35 sectors in the model shown in Table 4. Figure 1
depicts the structure of production in a representative sector. Primary factors include skilled and
unskilled labor; mobile capital; sector-specific capital in imperfectly competitive sectors; and
primary inputs imported by multinational service providers, reflecting specialized management
expertise or technology of the firm. The existence of sector specific capital in several sectors
implies that there are decreasing returns to scale in the use of the mobile factors and supply curves
in these sectors slope up.

12.      There are three categories of firms in the model: (1) perfectly competitive goods and
services sectors; (2) imperfectly competitive goods sectors; and (3) imperfectly competitive
services sectors with foreign direct investment. The cost, production and pricing structures in the
three categories differ widely. The model is a small open economy model in which we
disaggregate the ROW region into four regions: (1) the European Union; (2) Russia-Kazakhstan;
(3) the rest of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) plus Georgia; and (3) the Rest of
the World (ROW). In the imperfectly competitive sectors, this requires introducing different firm
types with distinct cost structures for each region. We retain the small open economy model
framework, so only Belarus is modeled fully.

Perfectly Competitive Goods and Services Sectors

13.      Regardless of sector, all firms minimize the cost of production. In the fourteen competitive
goods and services sectors, goods or services are produced under constant returns to scale and
where price equals marginal costs with zero profits. This includes agriculture, mining and several
services sectors such as public services, health and education. In these sectors, products are
differentiated by country of origin, i.e., we employ the Armington assumption. All goods
producing firms (including imperfectly competitive firms) can sell on the domestic market or
export. Firms optimize their output decision between exports and domestic sales based on relative
prices and their constant elasticity of transformation production function. Having chosen how
much to allocate between exports and domestic sales, firms also optimize their output decision
between exports to the four possible export regions, based on relative prices the four regions and
their constant elasticity of transformation production function for shifting output between the
regions.


13
   A more complete survey of the literature may be found in Tarr (2013) or Francois and Hoekman (2010).
14
   Earlier efforts to include services in CGE models of trade were Dee et al. (2003), Konan and Maskus
(2006), and Brown and Stern (2001). Konan and Maskus had an interesting application in Tunisia, but did
not incorporate FDI in services or productivity impacts for additional services providers. Brown and Stern
(2001) and Dee et al. (2003) employ multi-country numerical models with many of the same features of
Markusen, Rutherford and Tarr. Their models, however, contain only three sectors, agriculture,
manufacturing and services, and are thus rather stylized. Results in the Brown and Stern paper depend
crucially on capital flows between nations. For example, they estimate that Japan will lose from multilateral
liberalization of barriers to FDI service providers because Japan is a capital exporting nation. In Dee et al.,
(2003) welfare results depend largely on rent capture. The productivity effect from the impact of service
sector liberalization on product variety is not mentioned in the results of Brown and Stern and are interpreted
as of little relevance in Dee et al.
                                                           3
Goods Produced Subject to Increasing Returns to Scale

14.      Goods in these thirteen sectors (and IRTS services) are differentiated at the firm level.
Each firm produces a unique variety that is differentiated in the demand functions of users of the
goods. Users of the differentiated goods have an elasticity of substitution for the different varieties
that is known as the Dixit-Stiglitz elasticity of substitution. Larger values of this elasticity imply
the goods are closer substitutes. We assume that manufactured goods may be produced
domestically or imported for firms in any region in the model. Firms in these industries set prices
such that marginal cost (which is constant) equals marginal revenue; and there is free entry, which
drives profits to zero. For domestic firms, costs are defined by observed primary factor and
intermediate inputs to that sector in the base year data. Foreigners produce the goods abroad at
constant marginal cost but incur a fixed cost of operating in Belarus. The cif import price of
foreign goods is simply defined by the import price, and, by the zero profits assumption, in
equilibrium the import price must cover fixed and marginal costs of foreign firms. Firms set prices
using the Chamberlinian large group monopolistic competition assumption within a Dixit-Stiglitz
framework, which results in constant markups over marginal cost for both foreign firms and
domestic firms.

15.      In the models of Russian WTO accession of Jensen, Rutherford and Tarr (2007) and
Rutherford and Tarr (2008), domestic firms faced a perfectly elastic demand curve on export
markets and they exported at marginal costs. In this model, all imperfectly competitive domestic
firms (both goods and services producers) face a downward sloping demand curve in each of their
four export markets. Consistent with firm level product differentiation, we assume that the
elasticity of demand in each of the export markets is the Dixit-Stiglitz elasticity of demand. Firms
then set marginal revenue equal to marginal costs in each of the three export markets; then the
export market contribute to the quasi-rents of the firm and affect the entry and exit decisions of
firms. Introducing downward sloping demand curves into the model means that there are possible
terms of trade affects to consider in this model that were not present in the Jensen, Rutherford and
Tarr model.15

16.     For simplicity we assume that the composition of fixed and marginal cost is identical in all
firms producing under increasing returns to scale (in both goods and services). This assumption in
our Dixit-Stiglitz based Chamberlinian large-group model assures that output per firm for all firm
types remains constant, i.e., the model does not produce rationalization gains or losses.

17.     The number of varieties affects the productivity of the use of imperfectly competitive
goods based on the standard Dixit-Stiglitz formulation. The effective cost function for users of
goods produced subject to increasing returns to scale declines in the total number of firms in the
industry.

Service Sectors that are produced under Increasing Returns to Scale and Imperfect
Competition

18.     These eight services sectors are telecommunications; insurance; banking and other
financial services; air transport; road transport; rail and other transportation services; other
professional services; and trade, including wholesale and retail services. In these services sectors,
we observe that some services are provided by foreign service providers on a cross border basis
analogous to goods providers from abroad. But a large share of business services are provided by
service providers with a domestic presence, both multinational and Belarusian.16 Our model
allows for both types of foreign service provision in these sectors. There are cross border services

15
   Balistreri and Markusen (2009) show that since Chamberlinian firms consider the impact of their own
actions on the group price, the role for optimal tariffs is significantly reduced.
16
   One estimate puts the world-wide cross-border share of trade in services at 41 percent and the share of
trade in services provided by multinational affiliates at 38 percent. Travel expenditures 20 percent and
compensation to employees working abroad 1 percent make up the difference. See Brown and Stern (2001,
Table 4).
                                                        4
allowed in these sectors and they are provided from abroad at constant costs—this is analogous to
competitive provision of goods from abroad. The elasticity of substitution for services from firms
with a domestic presence (either foreign or domestic) is three in our central scenario. Cross border
services, however, are not as good substitutes; the elasticity of substitution between cross border
services and services provided by firms with a domestic presence is 1.5.17

19.      Crucial to the results, we allow multinational service firm providers to establish a presence
in Belarus in order to compete with Belarusian firms directly. As in the goods sectors, services
that are produced subject to increasing returns to scale are differentiated at the firm level. Firms in
these industries set prices such that marginal cost (which is constant) equals marginal revenue; and
there is free entry, which drives profits to zero. We assume firm level product differentiation and
employ the Chamberlinian large group monopolistic competition assumption within a Dixit-
Stiglitz framework. Given our assumption on the composition of fixed and variable costs, we have
constant markups over marginal cost for both foreign firms and domestic firms, i.e., no
rationalization impacts.

20.      For domestic firms, costs are defined by observed primary factors and intermediate inputs
to that sector in the base year data. When multinationals service providers decide to establish a
domestic presence in Belarus, they will import some of their technology or management expertise.
That is, foreign direct investment generally entails importing specialized foreign inputs. Thus, the
cost structure of multinationals differs from national only service providers. Multinationals incur
costs related to both imported primary inputs and Belarusian primary factors, in addition to
intermediate factor inputs. Foreign provision of services differs from foreign provision of goods,
since the service providers use Belarusian primary inputs. Domestic service providers do not
import the specialized primary factors available to the multinationals. Hence, domestic service
firms incur primary factor costs related to Belarusian labor and capital only. These services are
characterized by firm-level product differentiation. For multinational firms, the barriers to foreign
direct investment affect their profitability and entry. Reduction in the constraints on foreign direct
investment will induce foreign entry that will typically lead to productivity gains because when
more varieties of service providers are available, buyers can obtain varieties that more closely fit
their demands and needs (the Dixit-Stiglitz variety effect).

Productivity Increase from Privatization

21.     In the Privatization scenario, we implement a labor productivity increase based on data
discussed below. In this scenario, we assume that skilled and unskilled labor (but not other factors
of production) become more productive in sectors according to the estimates we have for the
predicted increase in labor productivity. A formal characterization is provided in Appendix 7,
following equation 10.


C.      Key Data
Ad Valorem Equivalence of Barriers to Foreign Direct Investment in Services
Sectors

22.     Several of the business services sectors are crucial inputs into the manufacturing sector
and efficient, competitive business services sectors are key to the development of a Belarusian
economy that can compete in the increasingly integrated global marketplace. Estimates of the ad
valorem equivalents of the barriers to FDI in services are important to the results. Consequently, to
obtain a good picture of the regulatory regimes Irina Kolesnikova conducted extensive interviews



17
    Daniels (1985) found that service providers charge higher prices when the service is provided at a
distance.
                                                       5
of government regulatory agencies and industry associations18 in the relevant sectors and utilized
official government reports, academic studies and a 160 page survey of the regulatory regimes in
the key business services sectors in Belarus. We focus on insurance, banking, fixed line and
mobile telecommunications services, air transportation, road transportation, and rail, water and
other transportation services, professional services (we base the estimates on legal, accounting and
auditing services) and retail services.

23.      As a first step in the process, the methodology involved converting the answers and data of
the questionnaires and interviews into two indices of restrictiveness in each industry: a non-
discriminatory index and a discriminatory index. The literature refers to these indices as Services
Trade Restrictiveness Indices (STRIs). Some restrictions only apply to foreign firms, such as
maximum foreign equity shares in firms in a sector or licensing restrictions that apply to foreigners
only. These kinds of restrictions as the basis of the discriminatory STRIs. Other restrictions apply
to domestic as well as foreign firms regardless of their national origin. Examples include: blocking
entry of all firms to a sector (e.g., reserving the sector for state firms); prohibitions on banks from
selling insurance; limitations on the size of retail businesses, their market share in a region or their
hours of operation. These kinds of restrictions are the basis of our non-discriminatory STRIs. Since
WTO accession involves commitments regarding both discriminatory and non-discriminatory
barriers, we estimate the ad valorem equivalents of both types of barriers and simulate reductions
in both types of barriers as part of WTO accession.19

24.     Our methodology builds on a series of studies supported by the Australian Productivity
Commission. First, these authors calculated STRIs in several business services sectors. This
included studies by McGuire, Schuele and Smith (2000), McGuire and Schuele (2000), Kalirajan
(2000) and Nguyen-Hong (2000). STRIs were calculated and, crucially, ad valorem equivalents
were aso estimated (usually in separate studies). Since we need to use the regressions of the
Australian authors for the ad valorem equivalents estimates, we first score the regulatory barriers
indices consistent with the STRI methodology employed by the Australian authors. Details of the
scoring and calculations for both discriminatory and non-discriminatory STRIs in Belarus for the
ten services sectors mentioned above may be found in Kolesnikova (2014a).

25.      The second step in the methodology involves converting the STRIs into ad valorem
equivalents. We rely on econometric estimates by Warren (2000) in telecommunications (for both
fixed line and mobile), Kalirajan et al., (2000) in financial services (for both banking and
insurance), Kang (2000) in transportation services (for all four transportation sectors), Nguyen-
Hong (2000) in professional services (for both accounting and auditing, and legal services) and
Kalirajan (2000) for retail distribution services. Except for Warren, in all studies the authors
regressed a measure of the price or costs of services against their STRIs and other relevant
variables in a cross-country regression at a point in time to determine the impact of the regulatory
barriers on the price of services.20 Through these regressions, the authors estimated the ad valorem
equivalents of the regulatory barriers in the countries of their sample.




18
   The interviews included the following Ministries of the Republic of Belarus: the National Bank, several
departments of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of the Economy,
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Communications and “Informatization.” Firms and associations interviewed
in Belarus included: Beltelecom, Association of Belarusian Banks, Belarusian Association of Insurers,
Belarusian Association of Accountants and Auditors, Belarusian Association of Accountants, Belarusian
Association of International Road Carriers, VELCOM, Belarusian Union of Lawyers, law firm of
Stepanovski, Papakul and Partners, Economic Journal (Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta).
19
    The WTO Guidelines Scheduling Services Commitments notes that non-discriminatory measures that
limit market access of WTO members fall under the purview of the GATS scheduling negotiations. In
particular, World Trade Organization (2001, p.4) states:“all measures falling under any of the categories
listed in Article XVI:2 must be scheduled, whether or not such measures are discriminatory.”
20
   Warren estimated quantity impacts and then, using elasticity estimates and a measure of the quantity of
telephone subscribers in each country, was able to obtain price impacts and ad valorem equivalents.
                                                        6
26.      Take banking services as an example. Kalirajan et al., (2000) use the net interest margin
of banks as their performance variable. From their estimation, the ad valorem equivalent (in
percentage terms) of the STRI in banking services may be calculated from the following
relationship:

        (1)

100 * ( NIM i  NIM i 0 ) / NIM i 0  100 * ( NIM i / NIM i 0  1)  100 * (e0.73*STRIi  1) ,
where NIMi is the net interest margin in banking in country i, NIM i0 is the net interest margin
when all restrictions in banking are removed in country i, and STRIi is the services trade
restrictiveness index in banking in country i. In equation 1, the denominator is a price measure
without any restrictions. In our model, and in Table 4, we convert the ad valorem equivalents with
the unrestricted price in the denominator (as estimated by Kolesnikova, 2014a) to an ad valorem
equivalent (AVE) with the domestic price with restrictions in the denominator.21 The conversion
implies that our AVEs have a maximum of 100 percent.

Share of the Output of the Sector produced by Multinational Service providers

27.      The impact of liberalization of barriers to foreign direct investment in business services
sectors on the demand for labor in these sectors will depend on the share of the output of the sector
sold by multinationals. Given that we have five regions in the model: Belarus, Russia plus
Kazakhstan, Rest of the CIS plus Georgia, European Union and the ROW, we need ownership
shares for each of the regions of our model for all eight of the sectors of our model with foreign
direct investment. The results of our calculations are in Table 6. Details of the calculations may be
found in Kolesnikova (2014b).

28.      A brief summary of the sources is as follows. In air transportation, Kolesnikov used data
from official websites on flights of non-Belarusian airlines, aircraft types and their seating
capacity, and data of Belstat on passenger turnover. In road transport, Belstat revenue data were
used along with expert opinion of “BAMAP,” the Association of International Road Carriers of
Belarus. In rail transportation, Belarusian railways hold a monopoly on passenger and cargo
traffic. In telecommunications, data were obtained from publications of the Ministry of
Communications and Information of Belarus as well as Belstat. In banking, data from Bankscope
was accessed. In addition, the National Bank of Belarus provided data on the assets of banks,
owners-shareholders of the bank and the percent of the bank owned by each owner-shareholder.
The market share of each bank was defined based on the bank’s assets as a share of total bank
assets in Belarus. In insurance, we had a list of the insurance companies in Belarus from Axco.
Kolesnikova used insurance premia data from the Ministry of Finance of Belarus and data on the
foreign ownership share of companies from the Belarusian Association of Insurers to calculate the
ownerhip shares, based on shares of insurance premia. In legal services, data were obtained from
the National Statistical Committee of Belarus (Belstat) for the total foreign share, and decomposed
into the regions of our model based on expert interviews (law firm of Stepanovski, Papakul &
Partners, and the Union of Lawyers of the Republic of Belarus) and data from the Registry of the
Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Belarus. In accounting and auditing, Kolesnikova used
experts’ interviews (from the Ministry of Finance: Department of Control and Audit, the General
Directorate of Regulation of Accounting and Auditing; and the Belarusian Association of
Accountants and Auditors) and data from the Register of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of

21
   In particular, let AVE = ad valorem equivalent with the unrestricted world price as the base, or
denominator; let D=domestic price before reform, and W = unrestricted world price. We have
    (2) (D-W)/W = AVE = (D/W) - 1, where we take the AVE from Kolesnikova (2014a), but for
         exposition purposes we take AVE as a ratio, not percentage. Rearranging (2) , we have
    (3) W/D = 1/[AVE+1].
                   Multiplying (2) by W/D and using (3), we have
    (4) (D-W)/D = AVE*W/D = AVE /[AVE+1].

Belarus. Finally, in retailing, the total foreign share was obtained from Belstat data, but we were
unable to obtain data on the decomposition of the foreign share among the foreign regions of our
model.

Social Accounting Matrix

Going from the Input-Output Table to our Social Accounting Matrix

29.     The backbone of the CGE model is the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM).22 The primary
data sources were data from the Belarussian National Accounts23 and the Input-Output (IO) tables
for 2011 at basic and consumer prices. These are produced by the National Statistical Committee
of the Republic of Belarus (Belstat).24 Other data sources are discussed below. We provide an
overview of the construction of the SAM here, and a full and detailed description in Appendix 4.

30.      While most of the data are taken from the IO tables, some values are available only in the
National Accounts. These include the current account balance (adjusted by net lending), data on
factor income of the government and households, compensation of employees from abroad as well
as savings of the representative household and of the government.25 Despite the fact that the IO
table was balanced, due to the acquisition of data from multiple data sources to expand the IO table
into a Social Accounting Matrix, initially our SAM for Belarus was not balanced. It was necessary
to assure a balance between supply and demand; income and expenditure for all agents; and sector
revenues with payments. To obtain these balances, as balancing items we used transfers from
abroad to the government and transfers from the representative household to the government.26

31.      Tax rates on exports, consumption, investment and government are calculated using the IO
table and a matrix of taxes and subsidies on products available from Belstat. We report the former
two in Table 4, but suppress reporting of the latter two since, given fixed investment and
government spending in our model, they cannot impact the results.27 Additional detailed
information on trade and transport margins as well as on imports (separately for intermediate,
private, public and investment demand) were also provided to the World Bank by Belstat as
supplementary data to the IO table.

Regarding factors of production, the initial IO table includes only labor and capital. To be able to
distinguish between skilled and unskilled labor according to the level of education, we
disaggregate labor remuneration in the SAM, while holding total labor remuneration constant. We
obtained data on the number of employees by education level and economic activity for 201228 that
we use to calculate the shares of skilled and unskilled labor in total employment by sector. We
assume that employees with post-secondary education and a second group referred to as
possessing “professional technical” education represent skilled workers. We aggregated the rest to
unskilled labor (secondary special education, general secondary and basic education). For labor
remuneration, we assume the wage rate in agriculture for all unskilled labor. For skilled workers,
we take the average wage across all sectors for workers with “professional technical” education
and apply this to this class of workers in each sector, and the wage in manufacturing for workers

   The IO table was provided to the World Bank for this project by Belstat and is not publicly available. We
would like to express our deep gratitude for the excellent support and cooperation provided to this project by
Belstat for these data and for several other datasets that are not publicly available.

   Transfers from the representative household to the government usually consist of current taxes on income
or wealth, as well as of payments for property income and social contributions, social benefits other than
social transfers in kind. For further documentation, including discussion of some additional minor
adjustments, see Appendix 4.

with post-secondary education.29 The process gives us total remuneration to skilled and unskilled
workers, which we use to calculate the shares of total labor compensation to the skilled and
unskilled categories. The resulting disaggregated value-added shares for labor as well as value-
added shares for capital are shown in Table 5.

32.      As shown in Table 4, the final SAM includes 35 sectors. However, the initial IO table
includes only 30 sectors with highly aggregated services. In order to be able to examine the effects
of services trade liberalization as a part of WTO accession, we decompose some services. We
employ additional data on value-added for subsectors provided to the World Bank by Belstat. In
particular, we disaggregate three of the services sectors of the initial IO table. The sector mapping
and the shares of value-added of the aggregate sectors are as follows. Transport and
communications is: communication, 20 percent; air transport, 1percent; road transport, 27 percent;
and rail, water and other transport, 52 percent. Financial activities is: insurance, 3 percent; other
financial services 97 percent. Real estate, renting and business services to consumers is: Real
estate, renting and business services to consumers, 61 percent; other professional services, 39
percent. In the disaggregation, we assume that IO shares of the subsectors are identical to the
aggregate sector.

Export and Import Data by Sector with Decomposition of Rest of the World

33.      Using the IO tables for 2011 as a base for the SAM, we only have data on imports and
exports with the ROW. These trade flows are illustrated in Table 6. However, as different trade
regimes apply to different trade partners of Belarus, we decompose the ROW into four regions
with three of them being the most important trading partners of the country: CIS and Georgia,
ECU, the European Union (EU) and the ROW (see Table 4). We classify commodity trade within
the CU as well as with the CIS countries (including Georgia) as free trade according to the
plurilateral and bilateral regional trade agreements. Most Favored Nation (MFN) status is applied
to the EU and ROW.30

34.      Regarding trade flows by region of our model, we hold the total trade flows from the IO
table constant and calculate import and export shares by region and sector of our model using trade
data supplied to us by Belstat in the 2007 version of the Harmonized System (HS). As the National
Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus classifies the trade flows by the main economic
activity31 of the company that exports or imports, not by a particular HS product group, we had to
aggregate the data to the sectors of our model. We used a few tables of concordance (between HS
2007 and HS 1996 as well as between HS 1996 and ISIC Rev. 3/NACE Rev. 1). Concerning
services trade, we calculate regional trade shares using the data provided to us by Belstat in the
special national classification, which is not harmonized with any international classification.
Mapping the categories of the Belarusian national classification to the sectors of the model allows
us to calculate the import and export shares for the abovementioned regions. The resulting trade
flows by trading partner are presented in Table 5.

Dixit-Stiglitz Elasticities

35.      It was necessary for us to obtain estimates of the Dixit-Stiglitz product variety elasticities
of substitution for the imperfectly competitive sectors in our model. In fact, since we do not have
rationalization gains in our model, results will differ from a competitive model only to the extent
that there is a Dixit-Stiglitz variety externality. Thus, we based our classification of goods sectors
into perfectly competitive or imperfectly competitive based on the Dixit-Stiglitz elasticity values.

   The main economic activities (also included in the IO table) are classified according to the Belarusian
“General State Classificatory of Economic Activities” (OKED Rev.1) which is based on NACE Rev 1 and
ISIC Rev.3.

High Dixit-Stiglitz values means the results will be very close to perfectly competitive, and we
classified the sector as perfectly competitive.

36.      Based on data for the years 1994-2003, Christian Broda, Joshua Greenfield and David
Weinstein (2006) estimated Dixit-Stiglitz product variety elasticities of substitution at the 3 digit
level in 73 countries. Belarus was not one of the countries in their dataset. Among the 73 countries,
there were three Transition countries bordering Belarus (Latvia, Lithuania and Poland), plus four
other Transition countries in Central Europe: Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia. As a
country that was also one of the Republics of the former Soviet Union, we chose Lithuania as the
closest proxy for Belarus. We explain in Appendix 1 how we mapped the 3 digit elasticities for
130 goods sectors estimated by Broda et al. into the sectors of our model. The mapping and
resulting elasticities by relevant sector in our model are shown in Table A1.

Antidumping Actions against Belarus and Export Price Increase

37.     In antidumping and countervailing duty actions, WTO members are guaranteed an injury
determination in which the antidumping duty will not be applied if it is found that the domestic
industry was not injured by the imports. Non-WTO members are not assured of an injury hearing.
Consequently, Belarus may expect some small improved market access as a result of WTO
membership to the extent that antidumping has been an issue in certain sectors.

38.     Based on a global database maintained at the World Bank, in Appendix 2 we list the
antidumping and countervailing duty actions against Belarus and estimate price increases by sector
for Belarus as a result of WTO membership. We list the country that initiated the case against
exports from Belarus, the product exported by Belarus and the date the case was initiated. The
expected price increases by sector as a result of WTO accession are listed in Table 4. We expect
only modest price increases for Belarus in several sectors, in part due to our assessment that the
injury determination does not typically prevent the imposition of the antidumping duty. The
database is described in Bown (2014).

Estimated Labor Productivity by Type of Ownership and Productivity Increases

39.      In this section we describe how we estimated the increase in labor productivity by sector
of the Belarusian economy as a result of shifting some of the ownership from state firms to the
private sector. We regard this estimate as a long run estimate obtained as a result of creating an
institutional environment for growth of the private sector. This could include conversion of state
owned companies to private companies; but the private sector is likely to grow faster and create
private sector jobs in an institutional environment that is more favorable to it.

40.     In preparation for the World Bank Country Economic Memorandum for Belarus (see
World Bank, 2012), Belstat provided data to the World Bank on value-added and employment by
six aggregate sectors and by three classes of ownership: (i) state owned enterprises, (ii) mixed
ownership and (iii) private companies. Data are available from 2004 to 2010 inclusive. We use
these data to calculate labor productivity by sector and class of ownership by dividing value-added
in the sector and class of ownership by employment in the corresponding sector and class of
ownership. We then calculate the weighted average labor productivity in each of the six sectors in
the year 2010, using the share of value-added in the sector as the weights of the three labor
productivities.

41.     In our counterfactual scenarios, we assume that in each of our six aggregate sectors, the
state share is decreased by 50 percent and the private sector share increases by an identical
amount. Then we calculate the predicted weighted average labor productivity in the counterfactual,
assuming unchanged labor productivities of the separate classes of ownership. Taking the ratio of
the new productivity index to the productivity index using the 2010 data, we calculate the
percentage increase in productivity by sector from the increase in the private sector share of the
economy. We map each of the 35 sectors in our model to one of the six aggregate sectors (the

                                                     10
mapping is shown in Table 4). In the counterfactual scenario, we assume that labor productivity
increases by the percentages we have calculated. The productivity increases that we assume for
each sector in our privatization scenario are listed in Table 4. Details of the methodology,
including the data and calculations, are provided in Appendix 3.

42.      As shown in Table 4, we map 16 of our sectors to the aggregate “Industry” sector. Based
on Belstat data, we calculate a zero productivity increase for the Industry sector, and thus, a zero
productivity increase in 16 of our sectors.32 As explained in World Bank (2012), however, the state
industry sector, especially the refinery sector, receives oil at less than market prices. This is an
implicit subsidy, but it is not accounted for by Belstat. In general, value-added should be adjusted
for taxes or subsidies. Had we adjusted for this implicit subsidy, the state companies in the
Industry sector would have lower value-added and labor productivity, and we would have
estimated a productivity increase from privatization. Our estimates of the productivity increase of
privatization should be considered conservative (or biased down) to the extent that we failed to
account for the subsidy from state firms receiving energy products at below market prices.

Non-Tariff Measures and their Ad Valorem Equivalents (AVEs)

43.      Traditional command and control non-tariff barriers to trade, such as quotas and bans on
imports, have largely been eliminated. Research based on a new multi-agency task force database
has shown, however, that regulatory measures, especially sanitary and SPS measures have become
a very important barrier to trade.33 In the CIS, experts have identified the State Standards system
(GOST) inherited from the Soviet Union as a major obstacle to an effectively functioning SPS
system that is not a barrier to trade. For example, the Asian Development Bank (2013, p.11) has
noted that in the CIS countries “The most significant technical barriers to adherence to SPS
principles, apart from being a trade barriers itself, is the GOST system.” Countries have the right
and the obligation to protect their nationals from unsafe or unhealthy products and the right to
protect their environment and livestock against introduction and spread of pests and diseases.
What WTO principles require is that technical regulations or SPS requirements should be adopted
with minimum trade distorting implications, should be science based and should not discriminate
against imports. Under the GOST system, however, while safety is mandatory and ensuring safety
is consistent with WTO principles, quality is also mandatory and that is inconsistent with WTO
principles. The GOST quality regulations that are unrelated to safety are NTBs. Safety regulations
that are not supported by scientific evidence as posing risks are also NTBs under the WTO SPS
agreement. Further, in many instances these regulations are discriminatory against imports (such
as duplicative required inspections not required of domestic production), and therefore are in
contravention of WTO principles. The GOST system served an important function under the
centrally planned system of the Soviet Union and performed well in some areas. But it is ill suited
to a market economy and conversion to international standards is part of the transition process to a
market economy.34

44.      Nonetheless, as the UNIDO-STDF report (van der Meer, 2010) and the World Bank
(2007) have noted, there are important costly and difficult issues in the transition from GOST to
international SPS standards. The costly transition suggests a phased case by case approach to the




32
   There is some ambiguity of where to map the two mining sectors. We mapped them to the Industry sector.
In view of the fact that there is a zero productivity increase for the Industry sector from privatization, this is
a conservative choice in that it will lead to a lower estimated benefit from privatization.
33
   See, for example, Cadot and Gourdon (2012).
34
   “There are over 20,000 [SPS] standards, which is too many for smooth implementation. The prescriptive
and mandatory nature of the standards can stifle product innovation. The system is inflexible to respond to
consumer demand and new health risks. Implementation is difficult and costly because of overlapping
mandates. Inspectorates have much discretionary power and there is generally weak rule of law ” (van der
Meer, 2010, p. 6).

adoption on international standards, based on assessments of health risks, costs, benefits and trade
opportunities.35

45.      The accession of the Russian Federation and several other CIS countries to the WTO (and
the possible accession of Kazakhstan, and the commitment of the Russian Federation and these
countries to adhere to the WTO SPS and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) agreements, however,
imply that markets that accept GOST standards are declining. As part of their WTO accession
agreements, both Russia and the other CIS countries that have acceded to the WTO have agreed to
move toward international SPS standards. Further, the EU-Russia “Partnership for Modernization”
has listed harmonization of Russia’s technical regulations and standards with the EU as a priority
for cooperation36 and the associated program of assistance is aimed at aligning Russian standards
with EU norms and regulations.37 It is important to begin a process of adoption of international
standards for the CIS countries. Accession to the WTO should accelerate this process as Belarus
will be obligated to accept the WTO SPS and TBT agreements.

46.      Our estimates of the AVEs of NTMs are based on the estimates of Kee et al., (2008;
2009), which in turn are based on the theoretical developments of Anderson and Neary (1996;
2003). Kee et al. estimate the AVEs of NTMs for 105 countries, including Belarus at the 6 digit
level, and aggregate these to provide estimates for all of manufacturing and agriculture for the 105
countries, including Belarus. The estimates are available on the World Bank website.38

47.      The measure we use from Kee et al. is the uniform tariff equivalent that generates the
same level of import value for the country in a given year.39 Kee et al. provide estimates based on
both applied and MFN tariffs; the measure we use is based on applied tariffs, which take into
account bilateral trade preferences. Specifically, we use the values for the Overall Trade
Restrictiveness Index (OTRI) and for the Tariff-only (OTRI_T) at the aggregated level of
agriculture or manufacturing. The OTRI measures the uniform tariff equivalent of the country’s
tariff and NTMs that would generate the same level of import value for the country in a given year.
The OTRI_T focuses only on tariffs of each country.

 In the case of agriculture in Belarus, calculating the difference between OTRI (which is 21.77
percent) and OTRI_T (which is 4.04 percent) gives us an AVE for NTBs in agriculture for Belarus
of 17.7 percent. This value of 17.7 percent is reported in Table 4 as the benchmark ad valorem
equivalent of the non-tariff barriers in agriculture in Belarus. In the case of manufacturing, the
estimate from Kee et al., of the ad valorem equivalent is less than 3 percent. Moreover, while the
UNESCAP (2008) report shows that many of the SPS issues also apply to TBT on industrial
goods, the difficulty of converting to international standards is greater with SPS measures. Further,
reports are that the transition to international standards appears to be proceeding much more
rapidly in industrial goods.40 Consequently, we do not assess that WTO accession will result in a
reduction of non-tariff barriers in manufactured goods.

37 The European Commission (2013) notes that under the Partnership for Modernization program there are
projects to align 19 technical product and horizontal standards by the end of 2013. A draft agreement
between Rosstandart and European standards bodies CEN and CENELEC was to be signed in 2013 and an
EU-Russian industry task force was formed to pursue approximation of technical regulations and use of
international standards.

Tariff Changes in Belarus as a Result of Russia’s WTO Commitments

48.     We explain the scenario in the results section. Here we only discuss the tariff data.

49.     Shepotylo and Tarr (2013) have calculated Russian tariffs for all years from 2001 to 2020,
based on actual tariffs in Russia from 2001 to 2011 and have projected tariff rates forward from
2012 to 2020 based on Russia’s WTO commitments to lower tariffs. They have calculated tariffs at
the 10-digit level, where they have calculated the ad valorem equivalents (AVEs) for mixed and
specific tariffs at the 10-digit level. Thus, the Shepotylo and Tarr dataset is available as fully ad
valorem dataset. Our calculations are a trade-weighted aggregation of the Shepotylo and Tarr ad
valorem tariff rates, aggregated to the sectors of our model. We take the tariff rates for 2020 as our
counterfactual tariff rates since this is when all commitments are scheduled to be implemented.
The results for the benchmark (2011) and the counterfactual (2020) for the sectors of our model
are reported in Table 4. Details of our calculations are reported in Appendix 6.


D.      Results of WTO Accession
50.      In our general WTO scenario, we assume that: (i) discriminatory barriers against foreign
suppliers of services are reduced by fifty percent of their ad valorem equivalents, as indicated in
Table 4; (ii) non-discriminatory services barriers in services are reduced by 25 percent of their ad
valorem equivalents as indicated in Table 4 under the column “after WTO; (iii) five sectors subject
to antidumping actions in export markets receive slightly improved market access. This is
implemented as an exogenous increase in their export price as shown in Table 4; and (iv) the ad
valorem equivalent of barriers in agriculture are reduced by 25 percent. We first discuss (and
present in Table 11) our estimates of the impact of Russian WTO accession on aggregate variables
such as welfare and the real exchange rate, aggregate exports, the return to capital, skilled labor
and unskilled labor, and the percentage change in tariff revenue. In order to obtain as assessment
of the adjustment costs, we estimate the percentage of labor and mobile capital that must change
industries. The gains come from a combination of effects, so we also estimate the comparative
static impacts of the various components of WTO accession in order to assess their relative
importance.

51.      First we discuss the comparative static results, called medium-term in Table 11. The
comparative static model assumes a time period long enough for the economy to adjust to the new
equilibrium, but not long enough for the aggregate capital stock to adjust. The existing labor and
capital moves between economic activities, but the aggregate capital stock is fixed. In the
sensitivity analysis, we also consider the results of assuming the time frame is long enough for
capital to adjust to its new long run steady state equilibrium in a scenario we call comparative
steady state.

                     -Medium Term
Aggregate Impacts-----

52.     We estimate that the welfare gains to Belarus will equal 8.2 percent of Belarusian
consumption (or 4.0 percent of GDP) in the medium term. This is not a one-time gain; rather,
we estimate that these are estimated gains that are recurring each year. That is, the real value of
output should be higher each year by an amount that would increase welfare by 8.2 percent of
consumption.41 Returns to skilled labor, unskilled labor and capital are estimated to increase by

leading national standards….The level of such harmonization had reached 45 per cent by 2010.” See WTO
(2012, para. 203).
41
   To take an example, suppose that real income without WTO accession would be 100 in year 1; 105 in year
2; 109 in year 3; 113 in year 4; and 120 in year 5. (Later years are not shown in the example.) Then if there
is an 8.2 percent increase in welfare due to WTO accession, and we take real income changes to approximate
welfare changes, then real income in the five years with WTO accession would be: 108.2 in year 1; 113.6 in
year 2; 117.9 in year 3; 122.3 in year 4; and 129.8 in year 5.
                                                         13
about one percent. Aggregate exports are estimated to increase by 1.4 percent, which leads to a
small depreciation of the real exchange rate. We assume that the total amount of labor in both the
skilled and unskilled labor categories does not change;42 but labor will shift between sectors as a
result of changed incentives between the sectors. We estimate that the percentage of labor that will
have to move to another sector to obtain employment is three-tenths of one percent for both
unskilled and skilled labor.

53.      These impacts derive from four key effects: (1) improved access to the markets to non-CIS
countries in selected products; (2) Belarusian reduction on non-tariff barriers in agriculture; (3)
liberalization of barriers against foreign services suppliers and (4) liberalization of non-
discriminatory barriers against all services suppliers. We execute four scenarios that allow us to
understand the relative impact of these various elements and the mechanisms through which they
operate.

Impact of Improved Market Access

54.      In the column labeled “only improved market access” of Table 11, we present the results
of a scenario in which we allow for improved market access (according to the terms of trade
improvements of Table 4), but we do not reduce non-tariff barriers in agriculture or barriers to
services suppliers. We estimate that the impact of improved market access at 0.1 percent of
consumption.43 Gains derive from improved prices for exports in the five sectors. But also a
higher value for exports allows Belarus to buy more imports and more varieties of imports increase
productivity. Thus, the impact of improved market access is greater in a model with Dixit-Stiglitz
variety effects than in a constant return to scale model.

Impact of Reduced Barriers in Agriculture.

55.     The results for this scenario are presented in the column labeled “only reduction in WTO
inconsistent SPS barriers” of Table 11. We reduce the ad valorem equivalents of the barriers by 25
percent, but there is no liberalization of the barriers against suppliers of services or improved
market access. The estimated welfare gains to the economy are 0.4 percent of consumption or
0.2 percent of GDP.

56.      The gains to the economy come about for two reasons. The reduction in the barriers will
lead to improved domestic resource allocation since the non-tariff barrier reduction will induce
Belarus to shift production to sectors where production is valued more highly based on world
market prices. This is the fundamental effect from trade liberalization in constant returns to scale
models (CRTS). In addition, the resources spent on producing to standards that are not risk based
will be saved; this is known as rent capture.
Impact of Liberalization of Discriminatory Barriers against Foreign Suppliers of Services

57.      In this scenario, labeled “only discriminatory services barriers” in Table 11, we reduce the
discriminatory tax on foreign suppliers of services in Belarus (as shown in Table 4), but there is no
reduction in non-tariff barriers in agriculture and no improved market access. We assume that the
services of each imperfectly competitive services (and goods) firm are differentiated in some way
from all the others, i.e., each firm produces its own unique variety. The reduction in the
discriminatory barrier on foreign suppliers of services increases profitability for foreign provision
of services in Belarus, thereby inducing new entry by foreign service providers until zero profits
are restored. Although there is a loss of domestic service varieties due to increased foreign
competition, there is a net increase in varieties. Belarusian businesses will then have wider access
to services in areas like telecommunication, banking, insurance, transportation and other business
services. The additional service varieties in the business services sectors should lower the cost of

42
   This assumes that the level of unemployment is determined by structural factors in the economy that are
not impacted by the policy scenario.
43
   Due to rounding, the percent of consumption and GDP are shown as the same.
                                                        14
doing business and result in a productivity improvement for users of these goods through the
Dixit-Stiglitz-Ethier effect. We estimate that the gains to Belarus from liberalization of
discriminatory barriers to foreign suppliers of services in Belarus are about 1.7 percent of
the value of Belarusian consumption.
Impact of Liberalization of Non-Discriminatory Barriers against Suppliers of Services

58.     Non-discriminatory barriers against service providers that limit market access of WTO
members fall under the purview of the GATS scheduling negotiations (World Trade Organization,
2001, p.4). We assume, however, that the WTO Working Group of the accession of the Republic
of Belarus will negotiate more aggressively against discriminatory barriers. Consequently, we
assume only a 25 percent reduction in the non-discriminatory barriers against services providers.
In this scenario, we assume no change in the discriminatory barriers against foreign service
providers, and there is no reduction in non-tariff barriers in agriculture and no improved market
access for exporters from Belarus. The reduction of barriers against both Belarusian and foreign
service suppliers increases their profitability and induces entry of both until zero profits is restored.
We estimate that the gains to Belarus from liberalization of non-discriminatory barriers to
suppliers of services in Belarus are 5.5 percent of consumption or 2.7 percent of GDP.

59.      One might question why the gains from reform of non-discriminatory barriers are so much
larger than the gains from reduction of discriminatory barriers against foreign firms. The results
are explained by the fact that the Belarusian services sectors are dominated by Belarusian firms. In
Table 6, we show that the foreign share of the transportation sectors is less than two percent in rail,
road and air transportation services, and the foreign share is a maximum of 35 percent in any of the
eight sectors. When reforms are executed on a small base, even if the supply elasticity is high, the
output response and welfare gains usually will not be quantitatively large. For the reduction of
non-discriminatory barriers in services, the reforms apply to domestic firms as well; so the reforms
are applied on 100 percent of the sector.

Sector Results

Business Services Sectors.

60.     The most substantial expansion of output occurs in the business services sectors. We
estimate they will all expand output, with four sectors registering output increases of more than 9
percent. The reason is as follows. As a result of a reduction in the barriers to suppliers of services
in these sectors, we estimate that there will be an expansion in the number of services firms (both
foreign and domestic) who locate in Belarus to provide business services from within Belarus. In
Table 14, we report the estimated change in the weighted average number of firms. In the WTO
accession scenarios, we estimate an increase in the number of firms in all business services sectors
and the expansion in the medium terms exceeds ten percent in four of the eight services sectors.
Note that since foreign owned firms that are resident in Belarus employ Belarusian labor and are
part of Belarusian GDP, we include the output of foreign firms located in Belarus as part of the
output of the sector.

61.     As shown in Table 12, employment expands the most in insurance, other professional
services and other financial services. Given that the total amount of skilled and unskilled labor is
fixed (no change in total unemployment), labor must be bid away from other sectors.
Consequently, we see a reduction of employment in some sectors. The total amount of labor that
must change jobs is less than one percent, as shown in Table 11.




                                                       15
Manufacturing Sectors

62.      Although there are several sectors that slightly contract, we estimate that most
manufacturing sectors will expand slightly in the medium term and more strongly in the long run.44
The primary explanation for the expansion is that WTO accession will bring in additional service
varieties in the business services sectors and that should lower the cost of doing business and result
in a productivity improvement for the manufacturing sector as users of business services. In Table
14, we report the quality adjusted price45 change by sector. We see that it falls in all business
services sectors, and falls the most (by about 14-16 percent) in other professional services and
insurance. Sectors which use business services most intensely, especially the business services that
fall considerably in price, will see their costs fall the most and this will contribute to output
increases. In addition, sectors that export will see an improvement of their export prices in terms of
Belarusian rubles due to the small real depreciation of the exchange rate; and five sectors will
obtain improved market access in export sectors. Chemicals, textiles and textile products, metals
and fabricated metal products, and non-metallic mineral products are four of the sectors that obtain
improved market access and these are expanding sectors.

63.      We estimate a slight contraction of several sectors, with three sectors experiencing
contractions larger than one percent of output: wood and wood products (-2.7 percent); forestry
and related services activities (-3.4 percent); and mining and quarrying except energy (-4.5
percent). The reason that some sectors contract is that the increased profitability of the services
sectors (and the other expanding sectors) induces them to bid capital and labor away from the rest
of the economy. We estimate that real returns to skilled labor, unskilled labor and capital increase
between 3.5 and 3.9 percent. The increased costs of labor and capital induces a slight decline in
several sectors.

64.      It may be surprising that in our WTO reform scenario we don’t see more sectors declining.
The explanation is as follows. Tariff reductions are usually associated with trade reforms, and
tariff reductions lead to a reallocation of resources between sectors that often lead to some
declining sectors. However, we do not incorporate tariff reductions as part of the WTO accession
scenario. (If we had included tariff reductions, the estimated welfare gains would have been
larger.) The reason tariff reductions are not part of the WTO accession scenario is that as part of
the Belarus- Kazakhstan-Russia Customs Union, Belarus has committed to implement the tariff
reductions Russia has agreed as part of Russia’s WTO accession commitments; and Belarus hopes
to accede to the WTO with the same tariff commitments as Russia. So WTO accession should not
result in any further tariff reductions beyond what Belarus will implement as part of the Customs
Union. We evaluate the impacts of Belarus implementing the tariff reductions agreed by Russia in
a separate scenario that is independent of the WTO accession scenario.

               -Small Positive Impacts
Agriculture-----

65.     In Table 12, we report a small increase in the output of agriculture in the medium term of
0.8 percent. In the long run, however, where the economy has time to adjust to a new higher level
of capital stock, we estimate that WTO accession will lead to an expansion of the agriculture
sector of 6.3 percent. Thus, despite the fact that we incorporate a reduction by 25 percent in the ad
valorem equivalent of the non-tariff barriers that protect agriculture, which subjects agriculture to
increased competition, we do not estimate an adverse impact of WTO accession on agriculture.

66.     Some may be surprised that the estimated impacts on agriculture in Belarus are not
substantially negative, since many fear that the WTO limitations on trade distorting subsidies will
have a substantially negative impact on agricultural output. In our modeling of the impacts of
WTO accession on Belarus, however, we assume no reduction in agricultural subsidies. There are

44
   The only exceptions in the long run is industry are that manufacture of wood and wood products, and
mining other than energy both decline, by 0.1 and 0.2 percent, respectively.
45
   This is the Dixit-Stiglitz price index for the sector that takes into account the varieties.
                                                     16
three reasons for this assumption. First, as part of the obligations of the Republic of Belarus in the
Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia Customs Union, Belarus must reduce it agricultural subsidies
approximately consistent with Russian levels under Russia’s WTO commitments. So like with
tariffs, Belarus would have to reduce its subsidies as part of its Customs Union obligations and this
should not be considered a marginal commitment of Belarus under its WTO accession. Second,
WTO only limits trade distorting subsides, what the WTO calls “amber box” subsidies, and
permits without constraint a wide range of subsidies that are not considered trade distorting (called
“green box” subsidies)46. We have been informed by the Ministry of Agriculture of Belarus that
amber box subsidies have already been reduced to nine percent of agricultural value-added. As a
practical matter, this is below what is known as the de minimus level for industrialized countries.47
Subsidies below the de minimus level are permitted by the WTO; and third, the Ministry of
Agriculture informed us they are looking for further ways to switch from amber box to green box
subsidies. Green box subsidies include a large list of permissible subsidies under the WTO and
research has shown that green box subsidies are better than the trade distorting amber box
subsidies for agricultural productivity.


E.      Impact of Reductions in the Common External Tariff of the
        Customs Union
Defining the Scenario: Increased Competition from Imports in Belarus and
Preference Erosion in the Russia-Kazakhstan Markets

67.       As a member of the Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia Customs Union, Belarus will be called
upon to change its tariffs due to Russia’s WTO commitments. Russia has made tariff commitments
that will be phased in over a period of eight years from 2012 to 2020. In our tariff scenario, we
assess the impact on Belarus of the tariff reductions it will implement due to Russia’s WTO
commitments. In 2011 the common external tariff of the Customs Union was applied in both
Belarus and Russia; and it was the last year that the tariffs of Russia and Belarus were not
impacted by Russia’s WTO accession commitments. Consequently, we use the trade weighted
tariff rates for 2011 as our benchmark tariff rates. In order to capture the full impact of Russia’s
WTO commitments, we use the projected tariff rates of the Customs Union for 2020 as our
counterfactual tariff rates.

68.       To be clear, we are not assessing the impact on Belarus of the initial change in its tariffs in
2010 to implement the common external tariff of the Customs Union.48 By using 2011 as our
benchmark equilibrium, we take the initial implementation of the common external tariff of the
Customs Union by Belarus in 2010 and 2011 as part of the initial status quo or “benchmark”
equilibrium; and we assess the implications for Belarus of the reductions in the common external
tariff of the Customs Union after 2011, that is, from 2012 until 2020.

69.     CIS countries and Georgia have negotiated a network of bilateral and plurilateral
agreements under which goods are supposed to flow tariff free among these countries.
Consequently, we assume these tariff rates apply only to the European Union and the ROW in our
model. In the counterfactual scenario, there will be two types of changes as a result of the tariff
reductions of the Customs Union. First, the industry and agriculture sectors in Belarus will have
less import protection as Belarus implements the lowering of the common external tariff against

46
   Green box subsidies include subsidies for agricultural research and development, pest control, general and
specialist training, extension and advisory services, inspection services for health and sanitary reasons,
infrastructure services and crop insurance subsidies for natural disasters.
47
   The de minimus amount for developing countries is ten present product specific and ten percent overall or
roughly 20 percent. In the WTO accession negotiations, however, many Transition countries have been
required to take the more stringent obligations on de minimus subsidies of industrialized countries.
48
   In the case of Kazakhstan, the tariff changes along to implement the common external tariff of the
Customs Union were shown to have a negative impact. See World Bank (2012a).
                                                         17
imports. Second, Belarus will suffer preference erosion in the Russia and Kazakhstan markets; that
is, the tariff umbrella in Russian and Kazakhstani markets will be lower. Then exporters from
Belarus will suffer a decline in the export prices they will be able to receive in these markets. In a
world of homogeneous goods, the price decline in Russia and Kazakhstan would equal the decline
in the tariff. Based on this theory, to capture preference erosion, in our counterfactual tariff
scenario, we assume that the export price received by exporters from Belarus in the Russia-
Kazakhstan region of our model falls by the percentage decline in the tariff. The cuts by sector in
the tariff reduction scenario are shown in Table 4.

Results of Reductions in the Tariffs of the Customs Union

70.     The impact of reducing the common external tariff of the Customs Union on Belarus is an
increase in welfare of 1.1 percent of consumption or 0.5 percent of GDP. This is a combination of
the two impacts mentioned above, which have opposite effects on the welfare of Belarus.

                              -Gains of 2.0 Percent of Consumption
Reduced Tariffs in Belarus-----

71.      Reducing tariffs results in increased import competition in Belarus, which results in
estimated gains. We execute a scenario with tariff reduction, but without preference erosion in the
Russia-Kazakhstan markets. We estimate the welfare gains to Belarus would be equal to 2.0
percent of consumption. These gains come about from two impacts. First, tariff reduction in
Belarus will lead to improved domestic resource allocation since tariff reduction will induce
Belarus to shift production to sectors where production is valued more highly based on world
market prices. This is the fundamental effect from trade liberalization in CRTS models. In
addition, tariff reduction on imports in imperfectly competitive sectors, raises the tariff ridden
demand curve for imports. This increases profitability for foreigners of selling in the Belarusian
market thereby inducing new entry by foreign suppliers until zero profits are restored. Although
there is a loss of domestic varieties due to increased foreign competition, there is a net increase in
varieties. The additional varieties in the imperfectly competitive sectors of Belarus results in a
productivity improvement for users of these goods through the Dixit-Stiglitz-Ethier effect.

                                                          -Losses of 0.9 Percent of
Preference Erosion on Exports to Russia and Kazakhstan-----
Consumption.

72.      The welfare gains of improved resource allocation and productivity increases in Belarus
from increased import competition are reduced, however, by preference erosion in the Russia-
Kazakhstan markets. Given that we estimate that the estimated welfare gains to Belarus without
(with) preference erosion taken into consideration are equal to 2.0 (1.1) percent of consumption,
this indicates that preference erosion in Russia and Kazakhstan from implementation of the WTO
tariff reduction commitments of Russia will cost Belarus 0.9 percent of consumption per year.
Moreover, as shown in table 8, the tariff reductions are estimated to lead to a 28 percent reduction
in tariff revenues or a reduction of about 0.7 percent of the GDP of Belarus. This highlights the
need for the address alternate efficient methods of collecting tariff revenues.


F.      Impact of Reduction of Non-Discriminatory Services Barriers
73.      In the WTO accession scenario, we assumed a 25 percent reduction in the non-
discriminatory barriers against services providers in Belarus, but a fifty percent reduction in
discriminatory barriers on multinational services providers on the assumption that the WTO
members would negotiate more aggressively on non-discriminatory barriers. In this scenario,
labeled “only non-discriminatory services barriers,” we assume that the Republic of Belarus takes
a more aggressive fifty percent reduction in the ad valorem equivalent of the non-discriminatory
barriers on domestic and multinational service providers in Belarus. But there is no reduction in
the discriminatory tax on multinationals in the services sectors in this scenario. At 11.7 percent of
the value of Belarusian consumption (or 5.8 percent of GDP), the gains from the
                                                     18
liberalization of non-discriminatory regulatory barriers in services are larger than the other
reforms considered to this point. This estimate could be compared to the estimate above of a
gain of 5.5 percent on consumption from a 25 percent reduction in non-discriminatory services
barriers, which we executed as part of the WTO accession scenario. The reduction in the
regulatory barriers on the provision of services in Belarus reduces the cost of providing services in
Belarus for both Belarusian and multinational service providers. This increases profitability for the
provision of services in Belarus, thereby inducing new entry by both domestic and multinational
service providers until zero profits are restored. Consequently, there is an increase in new varieties
of services. Belarusian businesses will then have improved access to services in areas like
telecommunication, banking, insurance, transportation and other business services. The additional
service varieties in the business services sectors should lower the cost of doing business and result
in a productivity improvement for users of these goods through the Dixit-Stiglitz-Ethier effect. In
addition, we assume that there are real resource costs of the barriers which are freed through the
liberalization. The very powerful impact of the reduction of non-discriminatory barriers in
services in Belarus is explained by the fact that the Belarusian services sectors are dominated by
Belarusian firms. For the reduction of non-discriminatory barriers in services, the reforms apply to
Belarusian and foreign firms as well; so the reforms are applied on 100 percent of the sector.


G.      Impacts of Business Services Reforms in Individual Sectors
74.      As part of our WTO accession decomposition analysis, we have estimated the impact of
reform of discriminatory or non-discriminatory reforms in all business services sectors. Regulators
and policy-analysts, however, would likely want to know where reform is likely to yield the
greatest gains. To provide insight into this question, we assess the impact of reduction to barriers
to suppliers of services in each of our eight business services sectors. We also assess the impact of
reduction of the ad valorem equivalents of discriminatory and non-discriminatory barriers
separately, at the levels of reduction consistent with our WTO accession scenario: fifty percent of
discriminatory barriers and 25 percent for non-discriminatory barriers. Our results are presented in
Table 12.

75.     The estimated gains by sector are largely explained by three sets of parameters: (i) the ad
valorem equivalents of the barriers (see Table 4); (ii) the share of the sector in the economy (see
Table 5); and (iii) for the discriminatory barriers, the share of foreign firms in the sector (see Table
6). Our discussion of particular sectors should clarify the issues.

76.      The sector where we estimate the largest estimated gains from reduction of barriers to
services providers is the rail and other transport sector (not air or road). We estimate gains of 2.3
percent of consumption from a 25 percent reduction of the ad valorem equivalents of the non-
discriminatory barriers to services providers. Rail and other transport is the sector with the highest
ad valorem equivalent of services barriers in our dataset. The non-discriminatory (discriminatory)
barriers are 47.5 (42.5) percent as a percent of the domestic price.49 In addition, rail and other
transport constitute a substantial 4.1 percent of the aggregate value-added in the economy of
Belarus. Consequently, we estimate that reduction of the non-discriminatory barriers in this sector
would yield very substantial gains.

77.      On the other hand, we do not estimate gains from the reduction of discriminatory barriers
in the rail and other transport sector (not air or road) because the data indicate that there are no
foreign suppliers of these services in Belarus in our initial equilibrium. Our estimate of no gains
from the reduction of non-discriminatory barriers in the rail and other transport sector should be
considered a very conservative lower bound estimate, since our model assumes that if there is no
foreign presence in the benchmark equilibrium, there will never be any foreign supply. 50 It is

49
  This is 90.5 (73.9) percent as a percentage of estimated undistorted prices.
50
  In order to model foreign service supply in response to a reduction in barriers when there is no foreign
presence initially, we would need data on how much of a price increase would be necessary to start foreign
entry. Those data are not available.
                                                        19
possible that with a large reduction in the ad valorem equivalents of barriers in a sector, that
foreign entry would be induced and gains would accrue to Belarus. Consequently, we should not
read this result as indicating there are no gains possible form reform of discriminatory barriers.

78.       With estimated gains of 1.1 percent of consumption from reduction of discriminatory
services barriers, we estimate that the largest gains from reduction of discriminatory services
barriers is in the “other financial services” sector, which includes banking. There are two
explanations for this. The other financial services sector has 5.0 percent of value-added of the
economy, making it the fourth largest sector of the economy measured by value-added. Crucially,
it is the business services sector with the highest foreign share of the sector: the foreign share is 35
percent of the sector. So reductions in barriers have a more powerful impact on foreigners who
have demonstrated their interest in the sector.

79.     The largest sector in Belarus, measured by value-added, is the trade sector, with 16.5
percent of the value-added of the economy. At 6.3 percent, the ad valorem equivalents of the non-
discriminatory barriers are low; and we did not find any discriminatory barriers. Nonetheless, since
the sector is so large, we estimate substantial gains (of 2.0 percent of consumption) from a 25
percent reduction in the ad valorem equivalents of the low non-discriminatory barriers. The
opposite is true for air transport. Since the sector constitutes only 0.1 percent of total value added,
the estimated welfare gains form reform are relatively small. Recall, however, that these are
estimated gains that are repeated every year and represent substantial cumulative income. It is only
by comparison with the estimated gains from other sectors that they are small.


H.      Sensitivity Analysis
80.     The results depend on the choice of parameters in the model as well as certain assumptions
or “closures.” In this section, we evaluate the impact on the results of the changing the values of
the key parameters or modeling assumptions in the model. We begin with key model assumptions.
We then discuss the results of “piecemeal sensitivity” analysis on the parameters.

Model Assumptions

Long Run--Comparative Steady State Results of WTO Accession

81.      In a long run analysis, we should allow for the fact that WTO accession could improve the
investment climate in Belarus. In this scenario, we employ our comparative steady state model.
The principal feature is that we allow for the fact that accession to the WTO could increase the rate
of return on investment. This would induce an increase in the capital stock until the marginal
productivity of capital declines sufficiently that the rate of return on investment is no higher than
the initial steady state equilibrium rate of return on investment. With our comparative steady
state model, we estimate that the gains to Belarus from WTO accession are 16.0 percent of
consumption (7.8 percent of GDP). This is about twice the estimated comparative static welfare
gains. The reason the gains are larger is that we estimate that WTO accession will induce an
increase in the rental rate on capital in Belarus in the comparative static model by 3.5 percent. In
the comparative steady state model, this induces an expansion of the capital stock in the new
equilibrium. We estimate that the capital stock will increase by about 6.6 percent of its initial level
in the long run steady state equilibrium. With a higher capital stock, the economy is able to
produce more output and there is more consumption. We typically argue that this type of model
produces an upper bound estimate of the welfare gains because the foregone consumption
necessary to achieve the higher capital stock is not taken into account. However, Rutherford and
Tarr (2002) have shown that a fully dynamic model which incorporates productivity effects like
those in our present model, and which takes into account foregone consumption from investment
decisions, could produce estimated welfare gains that are larger than these comparative steady
state results.


                                                      20
Rent Capture.

82.      In our central scenario we have assumed that there are real resource losses from the
barriers in services and in agriculture. Firms must expend resources to comply with the regulations
or expend resources in rent seeking to obtain licenses. Then the ad valorem equivalents of the
barriers are a real resource cost, and WTO accession frees resources that were used to capture the
rents so they become available for productive activities. We also consider, however, the alternate,
where there is no loss of capital and labor in wasteful license seeking activities and the like, either
because licenses are allocated without real resource costs or because the rents are captured by
domestic agents. Under this assumption, the estimated gains from WTO accession fall to 4.9
percent of consumption (as shown in Table 15), which reflects a large share of rents (or losses
from dissipated rents) in the economy of Belarus. The estimated gains from privatization are
unchanged with respect to the rent capture assumption, however, since we do not assume a gain in
rents in the central scenario.

Perfect Competition and CRTS Model

83.       We also executed our central WTO scenario in a perfect competition, CRTS version of
our model. As we show in Table 15, without the Dixit-Stiglitz structure that provides the
possibility of productivity gains, the welfare gains from WTO accession are reduced to 3.0 percent
of consumption (we allow rent capture of the barriers in services in the CRTS scenario and most of
the gains are from rent capture). The estimated gains fall since with perfect competition and
constant returns to scale, the model excludes the productivity gains from additional varieties of
services and goods. The evidence we cited above, however, indicates that there are productivity
effects from additional suppliers of services, so the model with imperfect competition is the better
one.

Piecemeal Sensitivity Analysis

84.     Our piecemeal sensitivity analysis in Table 16 shows how the results change when we
vary the value of key parameters one-by-one, with central values of all parameters except the one
under consideration. Two sets of parameters stand out as having a strong impact on the results.

85.       The elasticity of substitution between firm varieties in imperfectly competitive services
sectors, σ(qi, qj) has a very strong impact in both the WTO and Privatization scenarios. At the low
end of the elasticity range (2.5 in all services sectors), the estimated gains are 10.9 per cent of
consumption from WTO accession and 47.1 percent from Privatization. Unlike most other
elasticities, a lower value of σ(qi,qj) increases the welfare gains because lower values of this
elasticity imply that varieties are less close to each other; so additional varieties are worth more.
Since the policy shocks in goods are much less, the elasticity variation in goods has a smaller
impact, but its impact is nonetheless significant.

86.      The elasticity of substitution between value-added and business services, σ(va, bs), also
has a strong impact. At its upper value of 1.75 in the WTO accession scenario (1.70 in the
Privatization scenario), the estimated gains increase to 10.6 percent of consumption in the WTO
accession scenario and 44.6.percent of consumption in the Privatization scenario. The better firms
are able to substitute business services for labor and capital, the more the economy will gain from
the reforms that reduce the quality adjusted price of business services.

87.      Other elasticities in the model follow the Le Chatelier principle, i.e., larger elasticities
typically lead to larger welfare gains in response to welfare improving reforms, as the economy
can adapt more readily. For example, a larger elasticity of firm supply means that more firms will
enter when profits are available, that results in more varieties and productivity increases. The
results appear rather robust to the other elasticities in the model. That is, the results are within plus
or minus ten percent of the central estimate for these parameter values for the WTO accession and
privatization scenarios. (The final two rows, for rent capture and constant returns to scale, are
results for model assumptions, not parameter values, and these were discussed above.)
                                                        21
I.      Conclusions
88.      We developed a modern, innovative computable general equilibrium model of the
economy of Belarus to undertake an assessment of WTO accession and key complementary
reforms. We find that WTO accession would be expected to increase the welfare (or real income)
of Belarusian nationals by 8.2 percent of consumption per year. Our decomposition analysis finds
that it is the reduction of barriers against suppliers of services that is the most important
contributor to the gains in welfare of Belarus, especially a 25 percent reduction of the ad valorem
equivalent of the non-discriminatory barriers that adversely impact both Belarusian and foreign
service providers. Further decomposition of our WTO scenario into impacts of individual services
sector reforms shows that the greatest gains from any single services sector reform comes from
reduction of non-discriminatory barriers in the in the rail and other transport sector (not air or
road), followed by the trade sector. The greatest gains from reduction of discriminatory barriers is
in the “other financial services” sector, which includes banking.

89.      We find that deeper more aggressive reduction of non-discriminatory barriers against
services providers (fifty percent) could have an ever more substantial impact on the productivity,
competitiveness and output of the Belarusian economy; we estimate a gain of 11.7 percent of
consumption per year. And based on data on the relative productiveness of various sectors in
Belarus, we find that partial privatization would lead to a large dramatic increase in the
productivity, competitiveness and output of the economy of Belarus, yielding gains of 36.2 percent
of consumption per year under our central modeling assumptions. We conduct extensive
sensitivity analysis of both our WTO accession and privatization scenarios, with respect to
modeling assumptions and parameter values. Although there is a large variance in the estimated
gains from privatization, depending on the modeling assumptions, the gains are always very large
and dramatic. .By increasing the productivity and competitiveness of Belarusian firms, we find
both of these complementary structural reforms would lead to a reduction of imports, contrary to
WTO accession. We hope that by identifying these complementary reforms to WTO accession, we
may be able to assist the Government in its efforts to use the WTO accession process as a vehicle
to make the economy more competitive.

for details of the calculations.
*Based on average R&D expenditures for the years 2004 and 2005. The average for all US industries was 36.
**We evaluate transportation as a medium R&D sector since three sectors dominate R&D expenditures of US multinationals operating
abroad. These are transportation, chemicals and computers and electronics. Moreover, about two-thirds of all R&D expenditures of foreign
multinationals operating in the US was performed in the same three sectors. See "U.S. and International Research and Development: Funds
and Technology Linkages," at ‘http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind04/c4/c4s5.htm.
***Metals and machines is a proxy for transport equipment, electrical and optical equipment, other manufacturing and metals and minerals.
Machinery is used for metals and machines, all equipment products and other manufacturing; we used plastics, rubber, mineral and wood
products for non-metallic products, wood products, pulp, paper and publishing, and plastics and rubber products.

*Note: See table 7 for the sets of elasiticity values for σ(qi, qj) and all ε elasticity values. For these elasticities, we scale the entire
set of elasticities by the number indicated in the table. We placed a lower bound on sigma(qi,qj)--Goods of 2.0 to avoid numerical
instability
**Note: In the "Privatization Upper" sensitivity run an upper bound of 1.70 was placed on sigma(va, bs) to avoid numerical
instability.

Appendix 1: Estimates of the Dixit-Stiglitz Elasticities of Substitution for Belarusian
Imperfectly Competitive Goods
It was necessary for us to obtain estimates of the Dixit-Stiglitz product variety elasticities of
substitution for the imperfectly competitive sectors in our model. In fact, since we do not have
rationalization gains in our model, results will differ from a competitive model only to the extent
that there is a Dixit-Stiglitz variety externality. Thus, we based our classification of goods sectors
into perfectly competitive or imperfectly competitive based on the Dixit-Stiglitz elasticity values.
High Dixit-Stiglitz values means the results will be very close to perfectly competitive, and we
classified the sector as perfectly competitive.

Based on data for the years 1994-2003, Christian Broda, Joshua Greenfield and David Weinstein
(2006) estimated Dixit-Stiglitz product variety elasticities of substitution at the 3 digit level in 73
countries. Belarus was not one of the countries for which Broda et al., estimated the elasticities.
Among the 73 countries, there were three Transition countries bordering Belarus (Latvia,
Lithuania and Poland), plus four other Transition countries in Central Europe: Croatia, Hungary,
Slovakia and Slovenia. As a country that was also one of the Republics of the former Soviet
Union, we chose Lithuania as the closest proxy for Belarus.

Broda et al., estimate 3 digit elasticities for 130 goods sectors, but there are 20 goods sectors in our
model (plus 15 services sectors). We assumed that six sectors are perfectly competitive in
structure or have high Dixit-Stiglitz elasticities of substitution, so classified these sectors as
perfectly competitive.51 For the remaining 14 sectors, it was necessary to map the sectors estimated
by Broda et al. into the sectors of our model. In Table A1 of this appendix, we show the mapping
for these sectors. (These elasticities are not relevant in our model for perfectly competitive
sectors.)

Since there are often multiple sectors from Broda et al. mapped into a single sector in our model, it
was necessary to determine a method of weighting the Broda et al. elasticities. There are reasons to
use both export shares as well as import shares. A larger share of a subcategory in imports reflects
more imports, and more likely there are more varieties of imports. So weighting by the import
share of a subcategory is better than an unweighted measure. Domestic varieties are also
important. Since we do not have production data for the subcategories, we use export shares as a
proxy for domestic production by subcategory. Analogously, weighting subcategories by export
shares is better than unweighted categories. Since both import shares and export shares are useful
in the weighting, we take one half the shares of both exports and imports as the weights. The
resulting elasticities are reported in Table A1. Except for leather and footwear, all the sectors have
weighted average Dixit-Stiglitz elasticities that are sufficiently low that we classify them as Dixit-
Stiglitz goods. Leather and footwear was classified as perfectly competitive.

Appendix 2: Antidumping Cases Initiated Against Belarus and Estimated Export
Price Increase from Improved Legal Rights of WTO membership

In antidumping and countervailing duty actions, WTO members are guaranteed an injury
determination in which the antidumping duty will not be applied if it is found that the domestic
industry was not injured by the imports. Non-WTO members are not assured of an injury hearing.
Consequently, Belarus may expect some small improved market access as a result of WTO
membership to the extent that antidumping has been an issue in certain sectors. In this appendix,
we list the antidumping and countervailing actions against Belarus and estimate price increases by
sector for Belarus as a result of WTO membership.

Chad Bown of the World Bank research department maintains a database of antidumping and
countervailing duty actions in the world.52 The latest version of the database is explained in Bown
(2014). Based on this database, we list below, all antidumping and countervailing duty cases
initiated against Belarus by the EU, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, China or the US.
We have found only antidumping cases against Belarus; there are no countervailing duty cases
against Belarus in the database of these countries. We list the country that initiated the case, the
product exported by Belarus and the date the case was initiated. We summarize the data for the
sectors of our model and indicate our estimated export price increases as follows:53

     (i) Manufacture of basic metals and fabricated metals (MET). There were three cases by the
         EU against pipes and tubes from Belarus in the past 7 years. We assume a 1.5 percent
         export price increase as a result of WTO accession.
     (ii) Non-metallic mineral products (NMM). In 2011, Ukraine initiated cases against float glass
          and also corrugated cement-asbestos; Lithuania and Latvia initiated antidumping cases
          against cement from Belarus in 2000 and 2001, respectively. We assume a 1 percent
          export price increase from WTO accession.
     (iii) Rubber and plastic products (RUB). There was a case by Ukraine against rubber tires for
           motor vehicles from Belarus in 2010. We assume a 1 percent export price increase from
           WTO accession.
     (iv) Textiles and textile products (TEX). There were two cases by the EU against fibers and
          yarn, the most recent of which was 2004; and there were two cases by Poland in 1999
          against synthetic fibers of polyester from Belarus. We assume a 0.5 percent export price
          increase from WTO accession.
     (v) Chemicals and chemical products (CHM). The EU initiated four cases in this sector
         (potassium chloride in 1990, ammonium nitrate in 1992 and ammonium nitrate and urea in
         1999 and urea in 2000). We assume a 0.5 percent export price increase from WTO
         accession.

   We assume no remaining impact from the antidumping case on uranium from Belarus in the US in 1991
and lime from Belarus in Lithuania in 2000.

Appendix 3: Labor Productivity in 2010 and Estimated Change in Labor
Productivity from Shifting from State to Private Ownership


In this appendix, we explain how we calculate the productivity changes in the economy for a shift
of ownership from the state sector to the private sector. We explain the eight steps in the
calculations as they correspond to the data in Table A2

1 and 2. Data on Value Added and Employment

We base our calculations on a dataset we obtained from Belstat on value-added and labor
employment for six aggregate sectors, where value-added and employment are broken down into
three classes of ownership: (state, mixed and private). The data are available for the years 2004 to
2010. We base our productivity index on the year 2010 and report the value-added and
employment data for the six sectors and by class of ownership in the first two sections of Table
A2.

3 Labor Productivity by Sector and Class of Ownership

We divide value added from Section 1 of the table by employment from Section 2. The results are
in Section 3 of Table A2.

4 and 5. Index of Productivity and Value-Added Shares by Sector

Based on the above data, we calculate the weighted average labor productivity in each of the six
sectors in the year 2010, using the share of value-added in the sector as the weights. The share of
value-added calculations are in Section 4 of Table A3 and the weighted average productivity
measures of each sector are in Section 5 of Table A2. Formally, the process is as follows.

In general, with data for multiple years, we have the following as the weighted average labor
productivity by sector in year t.

                                                  t=2004,…, 2010, i=1,…6 (our six sectors)
Where         is the share of value added captured by state owned firms in sector i in year t;
is the share of value added captured by mixed firms in sector i in year t; and         is the share of

value added captured by private firms in sector i in year t; and             is labor productivity of
state owned firms in sector i in year t;      is labor productivity of mixed owned firms in sector i
in year t; and        is labor productivity of private firms in sector i in year t. As our benchmark

parameter, for each sector, we take the most recent year          .

6 and 7. Value-Added Shares and Weighted Average Productivity in the Counterfactual
Scenario.

We wish to assess the impact of an increase of the private share of the economy with a decrease in
the share of the economy that is state owned. In our counterfactual scenarios, we assume that in
each of our six aggregate sectors, the state share is decreased by 50 percent and the private sector
share increases by an identical amount. The results are in Section 6 of Table A2. Using these
hypothetical shares, we then calculate weighted average labor productivity by sector and show
these results in Section 7 of Table A2. Formally, using the above notation, A*it is our new
hypothetical weighted average labor productivity measure, assuming the change in ownership
shares as mentioned above.


                                                     47
8. Percentage Change in Weighted Average Labor Productivity by Sector

We calculate the ratio of the weighted average labor productivity by sector in the counterfactual to
the analogous index in 2010 and convert this into the percentage increase in productivity by sector.
That is, we calculate the following.

                                      i=1,…6 (i=our six aggregate sectors in Table A3).

The results are reported in section 8 of Table A3.

9 Mapping of our Six Aggregate Sectors to the Sectors of Our Model.

The final step is to map the six aggregate sectors to the 35 sectors of our model. That mapping is
defined in Table 1 of the main text. In the counterfactual of our central privatization scenario, we
assume that skilled and unskilled labor productivity increases by the percentages shown in Table
A3 for the sectors of our model that correspond to these aggregate sectors.

Appendix 4: Construction of a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) and Benchmark
Calibration for Belarus for 2011

1.      The Original Matrix:

The file explains our constructed SAM together with raw data. The SAM and the data are in the
file “SAM_Belarus_2.xlsx”, the final SAM can be found in the spreadsheet “SAM2011”. Data
sources are described in Section 3.3 of the main text.

        1.A.    Activity columns:

                1.A.1. Intermediate Demand (Activity Column<a>/Commodity Row <b>):

Intermediate demand is reported in user prices, that are basic prices (given in spreadsheet
“IO_basic_Цены осн”) plus trade and transport margins in consumer prices (given separately in
spreadsheets “trade_margins_Торг наценки” and “transp_margins_Трансп наценки”, however,
according to the description of the Belstat methodology these margins are already built in to the
gross output of each sector).
Total trade and transport margins are added to intermediate demand of trade <a22> for trade
<b22> and transport <a24> for transport <b24> (accordingly, total margins are added to output
of trade and transport as explained in 1.B.1.).

                1.A.2. Factor Remuneration (Activity Column <a>/Factor Row <c>):

Data on factor remuneration per activity is taken from the IO table at basic prices (spreadsheet
“IO_basic_Цены осн”).

                1.A.3. Taxes and Subsidies (Activity Column <a>/Government <e>):

For each activity, taxes on production are taken from the IO table at basic prices (spreadsheet
“IO_basic_Цены осн”). The information is reported in row <e01>. Taxes and subsidies (negative
values) on commodities per activity are given in the IO table at basic prices (spreadsheet
“IO_basic_Цены осн”) and reported in row <e02> of the SAM. There are subsidies on
commodities (concerning intermediate consumption) in the following four sectors: agriculture
(a01), mining and quarrying of energy materials (a04), pulp, paper production and publishing
(a10), production and distribution of electricity, gas and water (a20).
Sum per Activity: The sum for each activity column equals the total industry output per activity
in the IO table at basic prices. The sum over all activities equals to the total output at economy-
wide level.

        1.B.    Commodity columns

                1.B.1. Total supply (Commodity Column<b>/Activity Row <a>):

Under the assumption that each sector produces only one principal good, total supply per activity
and commodity is given by the total industry output at basic prices in spreadsheet “R esources-
Ресурсы”.
In addition to industry output, total trade and transport margins are also added to the rows of trade
<a22> and transport <a24>. Margins are taken from the spreadsheets “trade_margins_Торг
наценки” and “transp_margins_Трансп наценки”.

                1.B.2. Taxes/Subsidies on Commodities (Commodity Column <b> /Government
                Row <e>):

Data on taxes and subsidies (negative values) per commodity is calculated in spreadsheet “tax -
subsidy”. It is the difference between total tax payments and tax payments for i ntermediate
consumption (the last ones are described in 1.A.3. - row <e02>). There are subsidies on
                                                     50
commodities in the following four sectors: transport (b24), real estate and business services (b29),
health care and social services (b29), community, social and personal services (b30).



                      1.B.3. Imports (Commodity Column<b>/Rest-of-the-World Row <h>):

Data on imports per commodity is taken from the IO table at basic prices (given in spreadsheet
“Resources-Ресурсы”).

                      1.C.1. Household factor income (Factor Column<c>/Household Row <d>):

Data on factor income of households (‘Gross operating surplus, mixed income’ and
‘Compensation of employees’) is taken from the National Accounts for Belarus for 201154
(available in the spreadsheet “income distribution”). The values are adjusted as, in contrast to the
IO table, the initial values in National Accounts are rounded up to one decimal in billions.

                      1.C.2. Government factor income (Factor Column<c>/Government Row <e>):

Data on ‘Gross operating surplus, mixed income’ of the government is taken from the National
Accounts for Belarus for 2011 (see sheet “income distribution”).55

            1.D.      Household column

                      1.D.1. Household consumption (Household Column<d>/Commodity Rows
                      <b>):

Household demand is given in consumer prices, taken from the IO table at consumer prices
(spreadsheet “IO_cons_Цены пок”). Some adjustments are made for SAM calibration:

                In contrast to the rest of the data, private consumption of b22-b24 (trade, hotel and
                 restaurants, transport and communication) is given with three decimals. These values
                 are rounded up to get a balanced SAM.
                For mining and quarrying of energy minerals (b04) we could not move the negative
                 changes in inventories as described in 2.B. because it caused a negative indirect tax on
                 intermediates over -200 percent after reducing the intermediate demand. That is why
                 we reduce the household consumption in b04 and savings of households (column
                 <d>7/row <f>).
                For manufacture of leather, leather products and footwear (b08) we initially observe
                 positive changes in inventories, but tax payments of 13982 (see cell AK12 in the
                 spreadsheet “tax-subsidy”) are higher than the positive changes of inventories of
                 10778. It caused a negative indirect tax over -400 percent. That is why we move these
                 changes in inventories just like for b04 to the household account (we increased
                 household consumption and indirect tax payments and adjusted the savings of the
                 household (column <d>7/row <f>)).

                      1.D.2. Transfers to government (Household Column<d>/Government Row
                      <e>):

Usually transfers from households to government consist of current taxes on income, wealth etc. as
well as of payments for property income and social contributions, social benefits other than social
transfers in kind and other current transfers (see spreadsheet “income distribution”).56 In the SAM

minus aggregate household consumption (1.D.1) minus household savings (1.D.3).

                    1.D.3. Household savings (Household Column<d>/Savings-investment Row
                    <f>):

Data on (gross) household savings is taken from the National Accounts for Belarus for 2011
(spreadsheet “income distribution”).57 However, private savings are adjusted by negative and
positive changes in inventories in b04 and b08 (see 1.D.1.).

Government demand is given in consumer prices, taken from the IO table at consumer prices
(spreadsheet “IO_cons_Цены пок”).

                    1.E.2. Transfers to households (Government Column<e>/Household Row <d>):

Transfers from government to households consist of payments due to property income as well as
social contributions, social benefits other than social transfers in kind and other current transfers.
However, it is not possible to calculate these from National Accounts for Belarus as there is no
detailed balance with payers and beneficiaries. That is why we assume that there is no such a
transfer (there is a single net government-household transfer described in 1.D.2).

                    1.E.3. Government savings (Government Column<e>/Savings-investment Row

                    (Savings-investment Column<f>/Changes in inventories Rows <g>):

The link between “Savings-investment” and “Changes in inventories” is a balancing item (in the
model the both accounts will be aggregated, here we report them separately to identify negative
changes in inventories as depreciation). It is equal to the sum of changes in inventories (column
<f>).

Changes in inventories demand is given in consumer prices, given by the IO table (spreadsheet
“IO_cons_Цены пок”). For b04 and b08 these values are adjusted to zero as described in 1.D.1. In
addition, the values for agriculture (b01) and mining and quarrying (b05) are rounded up as these
were reported with three decimals.

Compensation of employees from the Rest of the World is taken from the National Accounts for
Belarus.59

                    <e>):

This figure is the last balancing item between the government row <e> and column <e> – the
transfers between the government and abroad.

                    investment Row <f>):

The current external balance is taken from the National Accounts for Belarus. 60 This value is
adjust by statistical discrepancy (net lending) of 5 538,5 reported in the capital account.

2.         Modifications and Adjustments:

The following modifications are executed in ‘sam1.gms’

           2.A.     Exports:

The original SAM reports exports by commodity in the commodity accounts, whereas the standard
general equilibrium framework considers them as part of output by activities. Therefore, exports
are eliminated from commodity accounts and moved to the activity account that produces the
respective commodity as principal good. Accordingly, original total supply of each activity
account has to be reduced to domestic output (by subtracting exports).

As the “tax-subsidy” sheet also reports taxes on exports of commodities, these taxes on products
are also moved from the commodity accounts to the corresponding activity accounts (and added to
output of this activity). Similarly, the trade and transportation margins on exports are also moved
to the respective activity accounts.

Additional adjustment: re-exports are reported for mining and quarrying of energy minerals (b04)
and for manufacture of transport equipment (b18) (see imports_2011.xls, cells AK8 and AK22).
That caused a negative output after calculating domestic output for domestic market. That is why
we adjusted the trade flows by these reexports, so they are not included any more.

           2.B.     Negative changes in inventory:

For some commodities the SAM reports negative changes in inventories. To avoid this we shift
them as additional costs to the activity account, which means we interpret negative changes in
inventories as net depreciation of the activity that produces the respective commodity. This also
requires adjustment of intermediate demand of the activity for the respective commodity (reducing
total costs to their initial levels), as well as moving the corresponding taxes/subsidies on
commodities from commodity to activity accounts. The exceptions are the changes made for (b04)
and (b08) described in 1.D.1.

             2.C.     Negative operating profits

   Negative operating profits (returns to capital) as reported in the original SAM for “financial
   intermediation services indirectly measured” (a31) are not possible in a general equilibrium
   framework. Hence, we use the following adjustment procedure: The negative operating profit as
   well as intermediate demand of this activity (there is only one entry for 'Financial intermediation'
   <b25>) is allocated across all other sectors according to the weight of operating profits of a given
   sector in economy-wide operating profits. Then, activity <a31> and commodity <b31> are
   eliminated from the SAM.

             2.D.     Revenue from import tariffs for intermediate demand

   The “tax-subsidy” sheet reports all revenue from taxes on products, including revenue from import
   tariffs. Hence, for imports used in intermediate consumption, also the basic SAM reports revenue
   from import tariffs in the activity accounts. To report all revenue from import tariffs in the
   commodity accounts, we first calculate tariff revenue from imports to intermediate demand using
   additional import data (file imports_2011.xlsx and weighted import tariffs), and then move it to the
   commodity accounts.

             2.E. Current account

   The current account balance of 15808327 m BYR (1.H.5.) is moved to the government account.
   We increase the initial savings of the government by this current account balance and create a
   balancing item as a transfer from the government to abroad which is always constant.

   3.        Disaggregation of Labor and Services:

             3.A.     Disaggregation of services

   Three services sectors (transport and communications (a24), financial activities (a25) and real
   estate, renting and business services (a26)) are disaggregated according to the shares of value-
   added in the sector of IO table (see Table A3.1). The shares of subsectors are calculated using
   additional data provided by the Belstat. Disaggregation is done in file services_disaggr_ejb.gms
   and details on decomposition are provided in Table A4.1.

         3.B.       Disaggregation of labor

We disaggregate labor into skilled and unskilled according to the level of education. Using data on
the number of employees by education level and economic activity for 201261 we calculate the
shares of skilled and unskilled labor in the total employment by sector. Hereby we assume that
employees with post-secondary education and a second group referred to as possessing
“professional technical” education represent skilled workers whereas the rest is aggregated to
unskilled labor (secondary special education, general secondary and basic education). To calculate
the shares of labor remuneration by sector and skill level we assume the wage rate in agriculture
(1331.2 thousand BYR) for unskilled labor, the average wage across all sectors (1899.8 thousand
BYR) for workers with professional technical education and the wage in manufacturing (2093.4
thousand BYR) for workers with post-secondary education.62 Calculations can be found in the file
Labor_Shares_by_Skill1.xlsx and the resulting shares of labor remuneration (applied in the file
datainput1.gms for disaggregation) are illustrated in A4.2.

Appendix 5: The Elasticity of Varieties with Respect to Price

Grossman and Helpman (1991) have developed models of economic growth that have highlighted
the role of trade in a greater variety of intermediate goods as a vehicle for technological spillovers
that allow less developed countries to close the technological gap with industrialized countries.
Similarly, Romer (1994) has argued that product variety is a crucial and often overlooked source
of gains to the economy from trade liberalization. In our model, it is the greater availability of
varieties that is the engine of productivity growth, but we believe there are other mechanisms as
well through which trade may increase productivity.63 Consequently, we take variety as a metaphor
for the various ways increased trade can increase productivity. Winters et al. (2004) summarize the
empirical literature by concluding that “the recent empirical evidence seems to suggest that
openness and trade liberalization have a strong influence on productivity and its rate of change.”
Some of the key articles regarding product variety are the following. Broda and Weinstein (2004)
find that increased product variety contributes to a fall of 1.2 percent per year in the “true” import
price index. Hummels and Klenow (2005) and Schott (2004) have shown that product variety and
quality are important in explaining trade between nations. Feenstra et al. (1999) show that
increased variety of exports in a sector increases total factor productivity in most manufacturing
sectors in Taiwan (China) and Korea, and they have some evidence that increased input variety
also increases total factor productivity. In business services, because of the high cost of using
distant suppliers, the close availability of a diverse set of business services may be even more
important for growth than in goods. The evidence for this was cited in the introduction section.

Beginning with the path-breaking work of Coe and Helpman (1995), a rich literature now exists
that has empirically investigated the transmission of knowledge through the purchase of imported
intermediate goods and through foreign direct investment. Coe and Helpman found that OECD
countries benefit from foreign research and development (R&D); that they benefit more from
trading with countries that have a larger stock of R&D, and that the benefits are greater the more
open the country is to foreign trade. Moreover, while in large countries the elasticity of total factor
productivity (TFP) with respect to domestic R&D capital stocks is larger than that with respect to
foreign R&D capital stocks, the opposite holds in small countries; that is, foreign R&D is more
important for small countries. Coe, Helpman, and Hoffmaister (1997) extend these results based
on a sample of 77 developing countries. They find developing countries that do little R&D on their
own, have benefited substantially from industrialized country R&D through trade in intermediate
products and capital equipment with industrialized countries. They find that R&D spillovers
through trade with the U.S. are the largest, since the U.S. stock of R&D is the highest and it is the
most important trading partner for many developing countries. A one percent increase in the R&D
stock of the U.S. raises total factor productivity for all 77 developing countries in their sample by
0.03 percent. By comparison, a one percent increase in the R&D stock of Japan, Germany, France
or the U.K. raises total factor productivity only between 0.004 percent and 0.008 percent.
Crucially, they find that countries that trade more with the U.S., such as the Latin American
countries, get more productivity spillover increases from the U.S. R&D stocks. And the relatively
more open East Asian countries have benefited the most from foreign R&D through trade. Keller
(2000) also finds that trade is an important conveyor of R&D and is especially important for small
countries. Several other studies, including Lumenga-Neso et al. (2005), Schiff et al., (2002) and
Falvey et al., (2002), confirm these results. Lumenga-Neso et al. (2005) show that technological
spillovers can occur from indirect trade with technologically advanced countries. i.e., imports from
the U.K. embody some U.S. technology due to U.K. imports from the U.S. Since the data show
that OECD countries have the vast majority of R&D stocks,64 it implies that it is important for

63
   Trade or services liberalization may increase growth indirectly through its positive impact on the
development of institutions (see Rodrik, Subramananian and Trebbi, 2004). It may also induce firms to
move down their average cost curves, or import higher quality products or shift production to more efficient
firms within an industry. Tybout and Westbrook (1995) find evidence of this latter type of rationalization
for Mexican manufacturing firms.
64
   Coe, Helpman and Hoffmaister (1997) calculate that 96 percent of the world’s R&D expenditures took
place in industrial countries in 1990 and this number stood at 94.5 percent in 19995.
                                                         57
small developing countries to trade with large technologically rich countries, such as the U.S. and
the EU, at least indirectly.

Regarding the impact of FDI on the productivity of firms, the results depend on intra-industry
versus inter-industry impacts. Since FDI in the same industry may bring spillovers, but has an
adverse competitive or market share impact, the literature has found mixed results on the
productivity of firms in the same industry that receives the FDI. But several papers have found
significant productivity spillovers from FDI in both upstream (supplying) industries (e.g., Javorcik,
2004; Blalock and Gertler, 2008; and Javorcik and Spatareanu, 2008) and downstream (using)
industries (e.g., Wang, 2010; Jabbour and Mucchielli, 2007; and Harris and Robinson, 2004).

Schiff and Wang (2006) estimate the relative importance for technology diffusion to developing
countries of trade with industrialized versus developing countries. They note that technology from
the industrialized countries may indirectly diffuse to a developing country through trade with
another developing country, if the other developing country has traded with industrialized
countries. They conclude that trade with industrialized countries has a stronger impact on
productivity in developing countries and that spillovers from developing country trade occurs with
more of a lag. They find that the elasticity of productivity (TFP) with respect to current trade with
all industrialized countries is 0.16, but only 0.01 for current trade with all developing countries.
That is, trade with the industrialized countries in 16 times better for productivity spillovers. In
addition, since trade may be expected to have an impact on productivity with a lag, Schiff and
Wang estimate the impact of lagged trade with developing countries. They find that the
productivity spillovers from current trade with industrialized countries are only about 1.5 times
greater than the productivity spillovers from lagged trade with developing countries.65 Moreover,
Schiff et al. (2002) show that developing country trade with technologically advanced countries is
very important in technology intensive sectors, but trade with developing countries can be
important for productivity spillovers in less technologically complex products in which developing
countries have comparative advantage. So on low R&D products like footwear and textiles and
apparel, trade with China and Indonesia could be as important for technology diffusion as trade
with the EU and the US.

In summary, this literature shows that the purchase of intermediate inputs and FDI from
industrialized countries is an important mechanism for the transmission of R&D and productivity
growth in developing countries. For small developing countries, trading with large technologically
advanced countries is crucial for TFP growth. But for products in which developing countries
have a comparative advantage, developing country trade may be important for spillovers.

In our model, the parameter that reflects the ability of a region to increase total factor productivity
through the transmission of new technologies is the elasticity of varieties with respect to the price.
Schiff et al., (2002, Table 1) have shown that for R&D intensive sectors, trade with industrialized
countries contributes significantly to total factor productivity in developing countries, but trade
with developing countries does not. Averaging over the industries in Schiff et al.,( 2002, Table 3)
yields that trade with industrialized countries in R&D intensive products is about eight times more
valuable for developing country TFP increases. On the other hand, for sectors that are low in
R&D intensity, their results suggest that for technology diffusion trade with developing countries
can be as important as trade with industrialized countries.

Based on these considerations, we first classify the increasing returns to scale sectors of our model
into low, medium and high technology sectors. The classification is defined by the share of R&D
expenditures in total sales, based on U.S. data and we use this information to set the elasticities of
firm supply in each region by sector. The greater the elasticity of firm supply in a sector the more
varieties will be received in response to a price increase with respect to that country. In
manufacturing, for low R&D intensive sectors, we assume that the elasticity of firms with respect

65
  Schiff and Wang do not compare lagged industrialized trade to lagged developing country trade, which
may bias the results against the relative benefits of industrialized trade.

                                                       58
to price is the same in all regions, at 3.3. For medium and high R&D intensive sectors, we assume
that the elasiticty of supply in Belarus, the CIS+Georgia and Russia-Kazakhstan is 3.3, but it is 6.6
in the EU and the ROW. In chemicals and metals, where Russia is internationally competitive, we
increase the elasticity of supply to the same as the EU (and also in transport equipment for Russia,
since Russia has a substantial and developing auto sector). In business services, we generally
follow this pattern, but we allow the elasticity of the EU and the ROW to vary more depending on
the R&D intensity of the sector, where we allow for more technology diffusion in more R&D
intensive sectors. The results of these assumptions are in table 7. We conduct sensitivity analysis
on these parameters, to determine the impact of this parameter on the results.

Appendix 6: Aggregation of Common External Tariffs of Belarus-Kazakhstan-
Russia Customs Union to the Products of the Belarus CGE Model

As a member of the Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia Customs Union, Belarus will be called upon to
change its tariffs due to Russia’s WTO commitments. Russia has made tariff commitments that
will be phased in over a period of eight years from 2012 to 2020. In our tariff scenario, we assess
the impact on Belarus of the tariff reductions it will implement due to Russia’s WTO
commitments. We use the trade weighted tariff rates for 2011 as our benchmark tariff rates. In
2011, the common external tariff of the Customs Union was applied in both Belarus and Russia;
and it was the last year that the tariffs in Russia were not impacted by its WTO accession
commitments. Based on the projected tariff rates of the Customs Union due to Russia’s WTO
accession tariff commitments, we use the projected tariff rates of the Customs Union for 2020 as
our counterfactual tariff rates.

To be clear, we are not assessing the impact on Belarus of its initial change in its tariffs in 2010 to
implement the common external tariff of the Customs Union. By using 2011 as our benchmark
equilibrium, we take the implementation of the common external tariff of the Customs Union by
Belarus as part of the initial status quo or “benchmark” equilibrium; and we assess the implications
for Belarus of the reductions in the common external tariff of the Customs Union.

Shepotylo and Tarr (2013) have calculated Russian tariffs for all years from 2001 to 2011 based on
actual tariffs in Russia and project tariff rates forward from 2012 to 2020 based on Russia’s WTO
commitments to lower tariffs. They have calculated tariffs at the 10-digit level, where they have
calculated the ad valorem equivalents (AVEs) for mixed and specific tariffs at the 10-digit level.
Thus, the Shepotylo and Tarr dataset is available as a fully ad valorem dataset. Our calculations are
a trade-weighted aggregation of the Shepotylo and Tarr ad valorem tariff rates, aggregated to the
sectors of our model.

The aggregation was done in two steps. First, Shepotylo and Tarr provided us with a trade-
weighted aggregation of the 10-digit ad valorem rates, aggregated to the 6-digit level of the
Harmonized System, version 2007. We then aggregated from the 6-digit level of HS 2007 to the
sectors of our model, using a number of correspondence tables. As there is no direct
correspondence between HS 2007 and ISIC Rev. 3/NACE Rev. 1 (which constitute the base
classifications for the data used in the model), we constructed a new correspondence using the
following sources:

        The correspondence table between HS 2007 and HS 1996 available at
         http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdnld.asp?Lg=1.
        The correspondence table between HS 1996 (6-digit) and ISIC Rev.3 (4-digit) available
         also at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdnld.asp?Lg=1.66
        Correspondence between the sectors of our model and ISIC Rev. 3/NACE Rev.1. shown in
         Table A6.1.




66
  49 available 6-digit tariff lines are not mapped according to the correspondence tables. These were
mapped by hand to the 2-digit of NACE Rev. 1 classification and are listed in the Table 3.

For calculation of trade weighted import tariffs we use the data on Belarussian imports (in HS
2007 6-digit level) from UN Comtrade for 2011. Therefore, to have only duty paid imports as
weights we subtract the value of imports under free trade from total imports. The free trade regime
exists between Belarus and the following trade partners: Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia and Ukraine.

The aggregation procedure consists of the following steps:

(i)         Calculation of Total Import Tariff Payments at the 6-Digit Level

We calculate the total value of import tariff payments by multiplying the 6-digit tariff rate by total
imports (excluding imports from the CIS and Georgia). Let        denote the set of all 6-digit tariff
lines of HS 2007. There is a different number of tariff lines available for 2011 (4336) and 2020
(4684). That is why let    be the set of 6-digit tariff lines available for              . So, the
total value of import tariff payments (                    ) is:




                                                                   61
where          denotes the tariff rate and          is the value of imports on the 6-digit level of HS
2007.

(ii)  Aggregation of Import Tariff Payments to the 2-Digit Level of ISIC Rev. 3/NACE
Rev.1

Let     define the set of all 2-digit groups of ISIC Rev. 3/NACE Rev. 1. Then for any element of ,
we aggregate these total import tariff payments–simply summing up the values for HS 2007 6-digit
groups which belong to the one 2-digit group of ISIC/NACE ( according to the aforementioned
correspondence tables). So, the aggregate tariff payment (  ) is:




(iii)     Aggregation of imports to the 2-digit level of ISIC Rev. 3/NACE Rev. 1.

In the same way we aggregate the value of imports (            ) for each element of :




(iv)      Calculation of the trade weighted tariff rates for the sectors of the model.

Let     denote the set of 19 sectors of the model presented in Table A6.2.67 For each     we calculate
the trade weighted import tariff (           ) by dividing the value of total import tariff payments by
the value of imports which are both aggregated to the sectors of our model (according to Table
A6.1):




The resulting tariff rates are illustrated in Table A6.2.




67
   In addition to the production sectors of set our model includes services listed in Table F1. However,
there are no tariffs on services what reduces the number of elements of set s to 19.
