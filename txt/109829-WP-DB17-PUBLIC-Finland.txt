This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

STARTING A BUSINESS
What are the details?
Underlying the indicators shown in this chapter for
                                                              STANDARDIZED COMPANY
Finland is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                Legal form: Private Limited Company (Oy)
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through
collaboration with relevant local professionals and            Paid-in minimum capital requirement: EUR
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available          2,500
information on business entry in that economy.                 City: Helsinki
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,
along with the associated time and cost. These                 Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Deposit the paid-in share capital in a bank; pay the registration fee
       and get a receipt

       According to the Companies Act, the paid-in share capital must be paid
       in full into the company's bank account. To open a bank account, the
       company must provide at least a copy of memorandum of association.
       Normally also following materials need to be provided to the bank
       when opening an account:

       - The minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors including a
       resolution of opening an account and identifying persons authorized to
       use the bank account to be opened,
       - A brief description of the nature of company's future banking
       transactions,
       - A description of the company's field of business,
   1   - Sufficient information regarding the shareholders and the directors of     1 day           no charge
       the company,
       - Copies of the passports regarding the persons authorized to use the
       bank account

       The subscription price may be paid to a bank account outside of
       Finland. However, the bank account should correspond to a bank
       account of a Finnish depository bank or a branch of a foreign credit
       institute in Finland.

       The receipt of the bank regarding the payment of the share capital is
       sufficient in order to register the company. However, if an auditor is
       elected in accordance with applicable law, the auditor shall provide a
       statement confirming the payment of the share capital.

      Submit a single start-up notification form to the NBPR (National
      Board of Patents and Registration) and the Tax Administration.

      A basic declaration to the Trade Register must be filed (in either Finnish
      or Swedish) as the National Board of Patents and Registration specifies.
      For each type of business association, a separate basic declaration form
      must be used. The forms are available on the National Board of Patents
      and Registration, regional tax offices, local tax offices, Centers for
      Economic Development, Transport and the Environment ("ELY" Centers),
      local register offices, and Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise
      Agencies. All registrations to the Trade Register and to the Tax
      Administration are performed with the same basic declaration.

      Moreover, since December 2012, it has been possible to file a start-up
      notification online for EUR 330. In order to be able to use the online
      system, it is necessary to obtain an ID with the National Board of
      Patents and Registration of Finland. In 2013, roughly 30 % of the new
      limited liability companies filed to the Trade Register was performed
      using the online system.

      When the basic declaration is submitted, a certificate of the company's
      business identification number may be obtained at a fee of EUR 7. This
      certificate allows companies to use their bank accounts before
      registration has been completed.

      The online registration is possible only when the following conditions
      are met:

      - The standard Article of Association is sufficient.
      - The shares are paid in euros to the bank account of the company to
      be established.
      - The subscription price is entered in share capital entirely.
      - All subscribers of shares and the Members of the Board of Directors
      shall have a Finnish social security number and a personal code for
      online banking system or an identity card with chip (HST-card). This
      applies also to possible CEO and a possible auditor who is a natural
      person.
      - The possible procuration holders and those who are entitled to
      represent the company have a Finnish social security number.

        Under the statutory pension insurance scheme, an employer must
        subscribe its employees for pension insurance with a pension provider
        handling earnings-related pensions. Supplemental pension insurance is
        optional.

        The employer also pays the pension institution statutory employee

        proof of insurance is needed to start operations.

        The accident insurance is paid to the insurance company and must be
        obtained before the work for the company starts. The group life
        insurance is also paid to the insurance company. The group life
        insurance is compulsory only if the applicable collective labor
        agreement requires the employer to take the group life insurance.
        Unemployment insurance is paid to The Unemployment Insurance
        Fund.

      The following documentation is usually required for warehouse
      projects:
      • The completed application form issued by the building
      supervision authority. The owner or the holder of the building
      site must sign the form. If there are several owners or holders, all
      must sign the application form.
      • A power of attorney is required only if a representative files the
      building permit application (This is not applicable to the
      warehouse project considered here.)
      • The establishment of the ownership title is required because
      the building permit can be granted only based on the
      application made by the owner or the holder of the building site.
      Usually one of the following documents is presented to the
      building supervision authority:
      1. The deed of sale of the real estate
      2. The lease contract
      3. The deed of title
      4. The extract from the trade register
      5. The building permit map and the extract from the real estate
      registry
      6. The decision to deviate from the provisions, regulations,
      prohibitions, and other restrictions on building and other action
      must be attached to the application, in original, if the project
      requires such a decision
      7. The certificate of the decision’s legal validity must be
      presented before the actual launching of the building project
      (This is not applicable to the warehouse project.)
      8. The environmental permit is required if the use of the building
      poses a threat of environmental pollution. The decision on the
      building permit can be postponed until the environmental
      permit is attached to the application (This is not applicable to the
      warehouse project.)
      9. Three master drawings must be attached to the application.
      One document will be archived with the building supervision
      authority, and the other will be returned to the applicant with the
      final decision. The master drawings to be followed in
      construction master drawings are approved in connection with
      the grant of the building permit.
      10. Report of the height of the building site
      11. The ground investigation report of the building site. If
      needed, also enclosed with the building permit application will
      be an account of the site’s health effects and ground levels, and
      the type of foundation and any other measures required as a
      result. This report may be produced by BuildCo.
      12. The official opinion on the connection of the wastewater
      drain and the water pipeline
      13. Notification to the neighbors. When the building permit
      application is filed with the building supervision authority, the
      neighbors must also be notified. The applicant may do this
      personally by using the official form, obtained from the building
      supervision authority. Otherwise, subject to a fee, the applicant
      may request the building supervision authority to conduct the
      notification.
      14. Forms for official statistics. The building supervision authority
      must deliver information on building projects to the Population

      15. The official form on the building designer. Every building
      project must have a qualified head designer in charge of the
      construction design and the quality of the design as a whole.

      Other documents are required, as follows:
      1. Working designs
      2. Calculation of permitted building volume

      Request and obtain water connection

      HSY Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority is
      responsible for all matters of connections to the water
      distribution and sewerage systems.

      The procedure for ordering a connection is as follows:
      • Helsinki Water customer service staff provides the new
      customer with a statement on the connection. The street address
      of the plot or property is required, as is the owner’s name,
      address, and phone number.
      • Helsinki Water provides the customer with a preliminary
      estimate of the recently introduced connection charge.
      • The customer should acquire a building permit for the plot.
      • After the customer has obtained the building permit, Helsinki
      Water will send the customer the connection charge notice. The
      property owner can file a complaint within 14 days of receiving
14    the notice. Unless a complaint is made, the proposed charge will       3 days       EUR 6,469
      be considered as having been accepted by the customer.
      • Water service connection and meter installation will be
      conducted after the connection charge is paid. The customer is
      responsible for the construction and maintenance of the
      connection pipes and conduits and their financing. Before the
      start of on-site construction work, a supervisor responsible for
      the construction of the water facility and sewerage system --
      approved by the municipal building control officials -- should be
      assigned. Helsinki Water always takes care of installation of water
      meters with seals, water main connection with water-sealed
      joints, and connections to the sewerage system on the
      customer’s properties. Service charges will be invoiced at rates
      valid at the time of the order.
      • A connection agreement is concluded.

     meter road (such as by excavation or overhead
     lines) but are all carried out on public land. There
     is no crossing of other owners’ private property

     completed up to and including the customer’s
     service panel or switchboard and the meter base.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       The seller and buyer notarize the deed of sale with an attesting
       notary or prepare the agreement through E-Conveyancing

       The sale agreement can be prepared by the seller or the buyer, no
       involvement of a lawyer or real estate agent is required by law. In general
       the seller present an extract from the Land Registry and extracts from the
       Title and Mortgage Registries demonstrating ownership and any
       registered encumbrances, but these are not formally required.



       The agreement must be in writing and contain at a minimum the
       following information (according to the Code of Real Estate 540/1995, as
       amended): name of the seller and buyer, the object of purchase
       (including real estate number), the purchase price or equivalent
       compensation and possible subsequent conditions. The agreement must                            120 (55 € when

       The sale agreement shall be signed both by the seller and buyer, in the
       presence of the attesting notary. The attesting notary checks the ID of
       the seller and buyer and verifies the formal validity of the sales
       agreement. Failure to follow these requirements will result in the
       transaction being automatically null and void. Note that an attesting
       notary is required only when ownership (freehold title) of the real estate
       is assigned. When the right of tenancy (leasehold) or other right to
       possess the property is assigned, the presence of the attesting notary is
       not required. The attesting notary must inform National Land Survey of
       Finland of the transaction and the buyer must apply for the registration
       of its title at their offices (see Procedure 3).

        size), under the Pre-Emption Act (608/1977, as amended), the
        municipality may have a pre-emption right in respect of the property. If
        the municipality decides to use its pre-emption right, it shall notify the
        buyer, seller and the National Land Survey of Finland of its decision to do
        so within three months of the original sale transaction. The owner of the
        property may, however, request that the municipality confirm in advance
        that the right of pre-emption will not be used. The buyer's title to the
        property may only be registered after the three-month deadline unless
        the municipality gives advance notice that it will not use the pre-emption
        right. Based on the case study assumptions, the pre-emption right will
        not be triggered by the transaction.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                              to retain 50% of the value of such floating charge, while the remainder of that
                                  value would be applied towards satisfying the other creditors. Therefore,

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
