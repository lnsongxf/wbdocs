Introduction

This report aims to guide the government of Armenia and other stakeholders in applying sustainability
principles to the mining sector. The report is based on the premise that mining can significantly
contribute to social and economic development, but that achieving positive impacts requires
considering and integrating social, environmental, and economic concerns into mining policies and
projects.

The principles of sustainability are present in all aspects of development, and are of great importance
to the intensive and natural resource-based industries such as mining. The need to apply sustainability
principles to ensure positive economic development has been widely acknowledged by governments
and the mining industry. Globally, the governments, as well as the mining industry, have embraced
the concept of sustainable development as defined in the Brundtland Report (World Commission on
Environment and Development 1987), which summarizes the main pillars of sustainability as follows:

         enhance individual and community well-being and welfare by following a path of economic
          development that safeguards the welfare of future generations;
         provide for equity within and between generations; and
         protect biological diversity and maintain essential ecological processes and life support
          systems.

In recent years, these basic principles have been expanded to include equity, transparency, justice,
accountability, and consultations. It is important to note that integrating sustainable principles is not a
one-time event that can be completed; rather, it is a process that can lead to continuous improvements,
and is being adopted by both developing and developed countries.

Sustainability requires strong coordination between various policy makers, implementing agencies,
and other stakeholders that often have competing goals and opinions. As such, the key to
implementing a sustainable approach involves open and participatory processes. With regards to the
mining industry in particular, it is key to:

         ensure partnerships between government, mining companies, and communities, while focused
          on local development, rather than mining development; and
         maintain sustainability and revenue sharing as the key point of the dialogue


The first thematic paper, Armenia: Sustainable and Strategic Decision Making in Mining, prepared by
the World Bank in 2014, highlights the importance of ensuring dialogue and strategic planning
between the responsible ministries, companies, communities, and NGO sector, and has led to the
preparation of the second thematic paper. It will contribute to enhanced awareness that application of
global best practices in Armenia’s mining sector will set the sector on the road to sustainability. The
overall goals and recommendations are presented in two separate sections of the paper: Improved
Environmental and Social Performance in the Mining Sector and Environmentally and Socially Sound
Management of Mine Tailings.

Organization of the paper and methodology
This thematic paper is the second produced under the World Bank’s Environmental Sector Note
aimed at strengthening the understanding of environmental and social sustainability principles in the
development of Armenia’s mining sector. The first paper, completed January 2014 and titled
Sustainable and Strategic Decision Making in Mining, focused on higher-level regulatory strategic
planning. It explored the use of SESAs as a policy instrument for making decisions and strategically
developing the mining sector, and focused on the application of CIA as a tool for assessing area-wide
risks, impacts, and mitigation responses that go beyond the regular, mine-specific EIA report. The
findings of this paper also include recommendations on strengthening the dialogue among
stakeholders and improving transparency, which also directly feed into the second paper.

This paper focuses on good practice management of the mining industry with respect to
environmental and social sustainability, as a guidance tool for both regulators and operators. It is
divided into two separate parts that are logically connected. The first part describes best available
global practices, corporate systems, and examples of global legal mechanisms (laws, bylaws,
guidance, and best practice notes) and requirements to enhance the overall sustainability of mining
operations. The second part focuses on mine tailings and associated environmental and social issues
while presenting good international practices in sound mine tailings management.

The second paper includes a literature review, analysis of existing data, and new data collection.
However, certain limitations concerning availability and fragmentation of data, in particular on
operating mines in Armenia and tailings depots that the authors experienced, may have affected the
analysis and conclusions. The paper’s intended audience includes policy makers and government
officials involved in regulating the mining sector, as well as representatives from the private sector,
NGOs, and civil society that could further benefit from its findings and recommendations.

A major constraint in the preparation of the first and second thematic paper was the lack of a readily
available, organized, and regularly updated database. There is limited information available on the
mine operations, mine tailings depots, and activities related to environmental management. Private
companies lead this sector, especially international corporations that have an obligation to publish
data and make information available on their websites. However, there is no formal registry that
would provide an integrated and detailed overview of Armenia’s mining sector that would be
regularly revised, used, or produced by a government body.

The information used to draft this report was obtained from the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources upon formal, written request. The request was also addressed to the Ministry of Nature
Protection but the detailed information was only provided by the first ministry.

1. Background

Armenia’s natural abundance in mineral and metal underground resources such as copper, gold, silver,
zinc, cement, diatomite, gypsum, limestone, and perlite is a strong reason for the mining industry to
be an economic driver in the country. The industry has helped maintain economic growth in times of
crisis; makes up a large share of the country’s exports; and is expected to contribute to social
development by creating jobs and improving infrastructure. Certain mining sectors have grown
particularly quickly and are now vital to the Armenian economy. In particular, during 2011,
Armenia’s production of gold increased by 30% from that
in 2010, while production of copper metal increased by
16.12%;      molybdenum      concentrate    by    11.12%;,
molybdenum metal by 11.09%; zinc concentrate by 8.54%; In 2011, the country’s exports, which were
copper concentrate by 8.16%; and ferromolybdenum by valued at $1.33 billion, were much lower than the
7.78%. It is expected that investment in these sectors will country’s imports of $4.15 billion. Mineral

socially and environmentally sustainable economic growth.
Putting these measures in place could require far-reaching
reforms in decision-making processes and supporting tools,
even before the right policies are formulated. The first thematic paper in this series, Strategic and
Sustainable Decision Making in Mining, provides a number of recommendations to the government of
Armenia, which would need to follow the already ongoing reforms in the mining sector to ensure
sustainability. These include (a) strategic planning of the sector with sustainability concerns, in
particular through the use of a SESA; (b) reforming the legal and oversight practice to include better
planning based on a CIA and SESA, and to ensure proper ecosystem valorization procedures; (c)
facilitating dialogue and information sharing as well as increased transparency in the sector, in

particular through the possibility of joining the EITI; all in order to (d) ensure shared prosperity and
environmentally sound local development.

As a follow up, this thematic paper is meant to equally inform both policy makers and the private
sector (representatives of the mining industry) of the global trends that ensure sustainability in mining,
which include both trends in the legislative aspects, and practical implementation. A separate part of
this paper includes analysis and recommendations that need to be put in place to achieve
environmentally and socially sound management of mine tailings. Although the primary audience is
policy makers, government officials, and mining industry representatives, the civil society groups
could also use the recommendations to guide best practices in the sector.

2. Review of Legislative Provisions for Environmental and Social
   Sustainability
Environmental and social sustainability in the mining sector starts with sound regulations that allow
for clear assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of social and environmental impacts, as well as
provisions for transparency and benefit sharing. This section describes the measures currently in place
in Armenia, their provisions for environmental and social sustainability, and areas for improvement.
The section then compares these measures to those in place in other countries. This section makes it
possible for Armenia’s government to understand what kinds of mining sector regulations are
available that can promote social and environmental sustainability. A more thorough analysis of the
legislative provisions, and in particular the specific laws and codes is given in the first paper of this
series, Armenia: Sustainable and Strategic Decision Making in Mining.


Legal requirements on sustainable mining in Armenia
Sustainability in the mining sector in Armenia is governed by several legal mechanisms. Mining
planning, development, and operations are first and foremost governed through the Mining Code,
which was developed and adopted in 2011. The Mining Code is linked to several pieces of legislation
and regulations, including the Republic of Armenia Water Code, laws on geological exploration and
the extraction of petroleum and gas, the Law on Urban Development, and the Environmental Impact
Assessment Law.

As stated in its first article, the Mining Code “defines principles and order of mining throughout the
territory of the Republic of Armenia, governs relations associated with protection of nature and
environment from deleterious effects, ensures security of works during mining, as well as protection
of rights and legitimate interests of state and individuals during mini ng.” It includes provisions that
promote sustainable development and strictly prohibits all activities that do not have a positive
conclusion on the state expertise on environmental, geological, and technological safety. The Mining
Code also requires application documents for mining licenses to include an environmental
management plan, a mine closure plan, and a social program with a timetable of implementation. The
code sets forth requirements for permanent monitoring. However, it needs to be further elaborated that
environmental management comprises measures to dispose and store removed overburden and
exhausted ore, as well as to restore and rehabilitate the damaged landscape.

The second most important legal mechanism for ensuring social and environmental sustainability in
Armenia’s mining sector is the EIA Law, which dates from 1995 and is being updated. The law
requires EIA to be prepared and reviewed on a mine-by-mine basis. While the impacts of a single
mining project could be manageable, the cumulative impacts of multiple mining developments in a
given area or in a shared watershed could, in aggregate, significantly affect the quality of
environmental services provided by the ecosystem. The Law on Targeted Use of Environmental
Charges Paid by Mining Companies does not include provisions of fees for disposing mining residues
and tailings dams.

The provisions of the Law on Targeted Use of Environmental Charges Paid by the Mining Companies
is replaced by a mechanism of fees and royalties that are set forth in the Mining Code. Nonetheless,
the system for collecting funds, along with their redistribution back to the affected communities,
needs to be improved. Better investment planning is also needed to target the actual environmental

damages for which the costs have been assigned. The process of calculating such costs also needs to
be improved.1

Following up with a number of other legislative acts that deal with natural resources, and with a
number of international treaties, reveals that there has been little development in improving the
environmental legislation, and improving the overall process of legislation—that is, implementing,
monitoring, and supervising. There are very limited, if any, inputs in the legislation and therefore few
practices on valuation of ecosystem services, analyses of cumulative impacts, or development of
strategic environmental and social impact assessments, which could be a very applicable strategic
planning tool for Armenia’s mining sector.

Legal requirements on sustainable mining in other countries
A number of countries are revising their mining laws and legal requirements as stated for a particular
number of countries in the 2008 Mayer Brown Report, Country Mining Law Updates. The reasons for
these reforms and aims are multifaceted. Most countries are attempting to promote foreign
investments while safeguarding their natural riches; some, such as India, are also updating obsolete
mining laws that date back all the way to the 1950s. Environmental and social sustainability play a
major role in these revised laws. For example, the revised Indian laws would ensure that a sustainable
development framework is being followed based on the International Council on Mining and Metals
model.2 As such, the mining companies would also be required to spend a percentage of profits on
social infrastructure, in keeping with corporate social responsibility. Ecuador is proposing a mining
law that has more stringent environmental controls and that also provides a stable environment for
foreign mining companies in country. The existing laws and procedures in place in Russia also
stipulate development of EIA (OVOS) reports with subsequent licensing, which include separate
permits for mineral resources, water, waste management, waste generation and disposal, air
emissions, and water discharge. Apart from this, the mine closure plan must be submitted for approval
to regional authorities one year before mining activities cease.

In the Kyrgyz Republic, the main environmental laws that pertain to the mining industry are the ones
that deal with Protection of the Environment and Environmental Expertise (both passed in 1999) that
cover water and air quality, natural resources, land use, and ecological preservation. Unfortunately,
given the limited capacities of the monitoring staff and few available resources, the companies are the
ones that register their maximum emission or discharge values, which are frequently calculated rather
than measured. The Kyrgyz Republic’s legal requirements do state that the mine needs to be closed in
an orderly fashion, but there are no detailed provisions regarding what the closure should entail or
how it should be financed. 3 The legislation’s proposed amendments needed to also focus on the
financing mechanisms and guarantees for rehabilitation. The legislation also deals with the restoration
and rehabilitation of the mining site, but does not include the tailings management. The example of
the Kyrgyz Republic highlights a very relevant fact that may also be applicable in Armenia regarding
historic environmental pollution and now-abandoned mines and tailings disposal areas that are
leftover from previous operations.

Around the globe, the common denominator in improving sustainability in the mining sector is the
EIA process, which is the first and foremost step in evaluating and managing environmental impacts
at the individual mine or activity level. Even this process—which frequently has a standardized and
internationally proposed table of contents—can vary greatly, in terms of the institutions that prepare

such reports, the bodies that review and authorize them, the follow up actions and their supervision,
and the level of pertinence and technical details provided by the reports.

In Russia, the OVOS (EIA) differs from the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)
reports that are prepared and submitted by international mining corporations in terms of its project
footprint, level of technical detail for baseline studies, degree of public consultations and disclosure,
labor, coverage of social issues, and preparation of Social and/or Environmental Management Plans
(EMP) or Systems (EMS). In addition, the OVOS is only intended to inform a select group of
experts.4

The most internationally recognized benchmarks and requirements for environmental and social
activities assessment, including mining, are the ones associated with the World Bank and the IFC, or
from countries with more developed, sustainable mining sectors, such as Canada, Australia, or
Finland. As of 2012, the IFC, working with the private sector and the mining industry in particular,
had developed a revised and refined set of Performance Standards (PS), which guide the
environmental and social responsibilities of the activities in which the IFC is investing. The major and
first PS is Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts, which
includes, much like an ESIA process or report, identification of environmental and social risks and
impacts, their avoidance, minimization, or mitigation, and community engagement and
communication. The rest of the PSs include Labor and Working Conditions, Resource Efficiency and
Pollution Prevention, Community Health, Safety and Security, Land Acquisition and Involuntary
Resettlement, Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources,
Indigenous Peoples and Cultural Heritage.5

The IFC also has a set of Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines6 that serve as a technical
reference document with general and industry-specific examples of GIIP. The industry-specific
guidelines include mining and cover all aspects and areas impacted by mining activities. They provide
succinct recommendations and guidance for each identified impact.7

Going beyond the EIA report, additional planning and management tools include higher-up SESA
approaches that would be developed for the overall planned and strategic development of a
sustainable mining sector, or review of CIAs. Capacity building and institutional strengthening,
coupled with improved monitoring, availability of data and transparency, follow up and inspections,
need to be implemented in a wider area than a simple EIA, and are further addressed in the World
Bank thematic paper Armenia: Sustainable and Strategic Decision Making in Mining (2014).

Furthermore, there are numerous good examples of successful policies for decentralization and
revenue sharing. These include but are not limited to: tax credits for local community expenditures
(Placer Dome—Papua New Guinea) stabilization funds (Debswana, Botswana and Codelco, Chile),
and intergenerational transfers of wealth (trust funds in Alaska, United States). Whichever of these (or
other) instruments are used is a function of a project’s economic viability as well as the prevailing
circumstances in the country. An instrument of particular interest may be the financial sureties (or
assurance) which is the most important instrument of modern mining. A company applying for a
mining license needs to place the money into a financial surety, which is meant to be used for
environmental remediation during the lifetime of the mine and post-closure. This surety can be used
to cover associated environmental damages.

Comparison of environmental legislation and requirements in different countries
The range of the mining industry’s industry-initiated mechanisms has largely been a result of
international “soft law.” Various United Nations international conferences, beginning with the
Stockholm conference in 1972 and continuing with more recent, specific global mining initiatives,
have directly influenced the range of self-regulatory tools that have been internally developed by the
major mining companies, or more usually, in partnership with NGOs.

Environmental law is unlike most other areas of law. As a discipline it does not exist solely in
jurisdictional isolation, whereas criminal law, taxation, and to a large extent commercial law clearly
can. Since all global issues in environmental law have their genesis at the local level, and since local
issues often resound in the international sphere, the field could correctly be viewed as a subset of
public international law. Accordingly, environmental laws and regulations in any jurisdiction cannot
be viewed in isolation from international factors. Understanding how these policies impact
environmental law in general and the environmental regulation of mining in particular is essential to
understanding the theoretical base on which domestic legislation is based and to predict future
legislative trends.

A selection of four different countries has been made for the purposes of analyzing their mining and
sustainability requirements. Table 1 provides an overview of the mining practice in Finland,
Kyrgyzstan, and Australia.

    Further complexity arises from the differential treatment of specific resources. Some resources, for example coal and uranium, have separate legislative regimes in most jurisdictions.

Although the four countries analyzed in the above table have very distinct and different approaches to mining,
a common factor in all of the sections analyzed is the need for public involvement and the fact that post-
closure activities are envisaged, as one of the basic sustainability practices. In all four countries the
environmental impact assessment with a proper public consultations mechanism supplements the initial review
of the mining application and a number of mechanisms exist why the mining licenses can be revoked. For the
particular in-depth analysis of the Armenian legislative requirements on mining and environmental
sustainability, please refer to the first paper of the series, Armenia: Sustainable and Strategic Decision Making
in Mining.


3. Transparency and Information Sharing

With the development of the new Mining Code, and revisions being made to the EIA Law, the integration of
sustainability principles in Armenia’s mining industry has been under a lot of scrutiny and pressure from
NGOs and civil society. One of the key elements of sustainability that has attracted the most attention is
transparency, or the present lack there of. Among the key shortcomings are a general lack of available
information, decision making without the involvement of a broader stakeholder audience, inadequate
information sharing, and a lack of information about how environmental and social impacts are identified and
addressed.

Since Armenia is a signatory to the Aarhus Convention on the Access to Information, Public Participation in
Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters,9 it is obligated to provide information to all
interested stakeholders. The mechanism established under this convention ensures that the civil society has
access to environmental information, is able to participate in the decision-making processes, and has access to
justice.

Depending on proposed project complexity and associated impacts, the EIA procedure requires a series of
public consultations, where comments received need to be used to further develop and expand the report and
the follow up monitoring practices. In addition, the SESA is built upon and deeply rooted in stakeholder
participation and involvement.

Armenia could adopt several other mechanisms and international best practices on transparency. For example,
the EITI ensures transparency in governance of the mining sector, including revenues from oil, gas, and
mineral resources. The initiative is developed and overseen by a multistakeholder coalition of governments,
companies, investors, and civil society organizations. Benefits for implementing the EITI include improved
investment climate, strengthened accountability, and greater economic and political stability. This in turn is
beneficial for business, since investments are capital intensive and dependent on long-term stability to generate
returns. Armenia could also recommend that its companies follow the guidance of the International Council on
Mining and Metals, which makes public reporting one of the three steps that are required for membership. The
other two are commitment to 10 principles of sustainable development and independent assurance, or audits
conducted by independent parties.




9
    Armenia signed the Aarhus Convention in 1998 and ratified it in 2001.
One of the core principles and mandatory requirements in establishing and certifying an EMS at the corporate
or mine level is also making data publically available, as well as instituting a feedback mechanism through
which affected populations can provide their comments, grievances, and feedback.10

Transparency and availability of information is not just the obligation of the mining companies. The regulatory
agencies must also ensure that the information is available to the public and that the public is included and
consulted with during the entire decision-making process. The consultation mechanism needs to be well
integrated into the EIA process, while information on environmental monitoring, noted impacts, mitigation
measures, and mitigation projects financed by the fees collected, and the number and mitigation of technogenic
accidents also needs to be available. Figure 1 shows how the information that is either formally submitted or
voluntarily disclosed can impact the public knowledge and also solicit inputs and feedback in a continuously
open dialogue.

     Engaging civil society in Armenia

     Many companies hesitate to engage civil society. In Armenia, civil society is relatively young, but it has a
     significant impact on management of environmental impacts related to mining. In Armenia, civil society has
     raised awareness of potential negative impacts of mining,

     Engaging civil society can lead to several benefits for companies:

             Civil society can help inform the public of positive environmental and social actions taken on by a
              mining company, and therefore help to spread good practices and improve the reputation of
              environmentally and socially responsible actors.
             Civil society can encourage the participation of citizens affected by mining, and can therefore lead to
              companies better understanding social impacts. This can lead to better design of mitigation measures.
             In cases where mining activities are funded by actors with strong grievance redress mechanisms
              (such as the World Bank’s inspection panel) engaging civil society can help reduce the chances that
              these groups or affected populations recur to these third party GRMs.
             Civil society can inform the public about revenues paid by companies to the government, and
              therefore hold the government accountable for providing services and using mining revenues to
              benefit communities.

     As part of their communications and outreach strategies, companies that operate in sustainable ways may
     want to engage civil society. Companies may want to engage several types of civil society, including civil
     society that can help local communities engage, ones that can help the company understand when activities
     have been carried out in ways that are not environmentally sustainable, and ones that have technical capacity
     to help the companies develop activities for social and environmental sustainability. Companies may also
     want to engage civil society as partners in tracking the use of mining funds for the benefit of Armenia and for
     the environmental sustainability of communities.

4. Best Practices from International Mining Corporations

With the growing investments in the developing countries and their mining industry, there is also growing
scrutiny and potential for allegations that international corporations seek countries with less stringent
environmental regulations that would allow profit maximizing at the cost of environmental impacts and
damages. Much like the international financing institutions with their own, globally applicable environmental
and social mechanisms, international corporations are also a powerful vector in sharing sound environmental
and social practices across the globe, while spreading their business and investments. International
corporations, in particular the ones that deal with mining, have adopted corporate-level policies that they apply
wherever they are engaged in mining operations. Community outreach programs, environmental management
systems, and corporate responsibility are just some of the practices that the international corporations may
bring to countries years before such requirements are introduced or required by the local legislation. Improved,
more detailed and more elaborate environmental and social impact assessments may also be prepared by such
corporations, or by other, independent international consultants, or are required by international financing
institutions, and often surpass the local legislation requirements. Some of the more positive examples yielded
from the experiences and practices of a number of international mining corporations are provided below.


Environmental Management Systems (EMSs)
One of the key and core elements in properly identifying and managing environmental and social risks, and the
impacts of one’s activities at the company level, is establishing a properly functioning EMS. These systems are
often based on the requirements and certification as per ISO 14001 series or other international standards,
membership in international organizations that promote sustainable mining. However, the EMS can and should
be fully operational prior to being certified, and should be based on a given standard. The benefits of having an
EMS in place include the company’s superior environmental performance, potential cost savings and improved
efficiency, lower insurance costs, and improved public relations. The main benefits of an EMS include the
responsibility of a company beyond mere compliance with the regulations and improved process efficiencies.
The EMS should be in place for all environmental aspects of all activities and operations that a company has
control over or can reasonably influence. The general and required elements of an EMS include:

         setting a clearly defined objective and target and overall company policy regarding environmental
          impacts
         supporting procedures to implement the actions needed to meet the objectives
         accountability for environmental action across the company
         monitoring and review of the impacts and overall system to insure continuous development

An EMS within the mining industry can be used to manage all of the associated environmental impacts
throughout the life cycle of the mine, in a manner that is fully integrated with all of the other management
considerations. The EMS provides a structured approach through continuous planning, implementation, review
and checking, corrective action, and management review. The EMS provides a more focused and structured
approach than simply responding to an environmental impact or issue as they appear. This continuous review
and development process can also help better adjust the mitigation and planning actions to the changing work
of the mine. In addition, the EMS would also include data on monitoring, social, health, and safety aspects of
the operation and would include measures for making all relevant information publically available. By better
organizing the data and making it readily available, the EMS also ensures a positive and transparent image of a



ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                    28
company’s sound environmental planning and management. With proper data collected and published, it offers
a set of benchmarks against which to measure progress, and improves staff morale and public image.



Environmental auditing
Although environmental auditing—environmental review and reporting conducted by an independent third
party—is one of the requirements of a functioning EMS, it can also be done regardless of an EMS or its
certification. Environmental audits should be conducted to determine (a) whether the site is operating in
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and appropriate nonregulatory and corporate
requirements; and (b) whether the EMS and other environmental plans have been properly implemented and
maintained. Each audit should take into consideration the results of previous environmental audits and be
carried out by qualified expert teams. The scope of an environmental audit will vary depending upon the type
and size of mine and the objectives of the audit, which usually are to identify and assess potential liabilities,
risks, and hazards. The results may be used to identify areas for improvement in environmental management
and to identify costs associated with reducing environmental risks and liability to acceptable levels.



Self-monitoring
Monitoring is essential to assessing environmental performance, and monitoring results may be used to help
ensure continual improvement in environmental performance and also to keep track of related social issues.
Environmental monitoring is the process of checking, observing, or tracking a mine’s environmental releases
and any environmental impacts potentially associated with the mine. Some environmental monitoring is
required by regulatory agencies. However, voluntary monitoring, beyond that required by regulatory agencies,
may help prevent pollution and will continually improve performance by identifying risks and avoiding
problems before they occur.

Besides the legally mandated environmental monitoring process, companies should also self-monitor both on-
and off-site impacts, including air emissions, releases to water and land, water management and wastewater
treatment facilities, containment and storage facilities, waste handling and disposal, acid leakage, and effects
on water quality from the mining disposal areas and tailings dams. Self-monitoring should be based on
documented procedures and plans, together with schedules and follow-up procedures. Reporting should be
carried out both in-house to management and to external, regulatory agencies as mandated. Monitoring is used
to determine whether facilities are operating as designed, and inspection is used to verify the condition of
facilities and to provide early warning of any deterioration of the facilities. Environmental monitoring
establishes control over emissions from the site, and helps monitor impacts on surrounding natural areas and
biodiversity. Environmental monitoring should include specific plans to measure and verify all effects and
endpoints that were predicted in the environmental assessment.

One of the additional positive examples in monitoring comes from monitoring cumulative environmental
impacts; that is, impacts that go beyond the activity’s physical footprint, or those that may arise from
additional interactions with other activities in the area. Monitoring plans developed by the companies and
regulatory agencies need to include measures to assess such impacts. Overall, monitoring should begin as early
as possible in the mine development and should always have a proper and clear baseline against which the
measurements need to be made. In particular, the monitoring plan needs to account for the applicable



ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                      29
legislative requirements, potential other activities in the vicinity, and any existing monitoring activities. Some
examples of how cumulative impacts may arise in a given mining location depend on:

         the number of mining facilities operating in close proximity;
         whether a mining facility is operating near another industrial facility, such as a pulp and paper mill; or
         whether a mining facility is operating in an area of historical industrial activity.

When environmental monitoring activities identify an effect or a change not predicted or not deemed
acceptable in the environmental assessment, additional monitoring measures should be implemented to
investigate the cause of the effect.
The issue of self-monitoring and self-reporting will also have to respect the provisions and requirements of
the Republic of Armenia’s Law on Self-Reporting on the Requirements of the Environmental Legislation.
This law has been drafted and is currently undergoing the adoption procedure with the Armenian
government, and is pending Parliament’s approval (third reading).



Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs)
Regardless of how meticulous a company is in its operations, there are likely to be cases where its activities
impact surrounding communities. Sometimes these impacts may be direct, such as by displacing individuals,
households, or their livelihoods, and sometimes impacts may be indirect, such as when mining activity
results in overcrowded health facilities or landfills. These impacts may result in grievances that need to be
addressed to ensure that impacted individuals and communities are not worse off as a result of mining and to
avoid conflict between mining companies and communities. GRMs are also increasingly recognized as a
critical tool for promoting transparency and accountability.

Effective GRMs typically have common building blocks and characteristics: multiple grievance uptake
locations and multiple channels for receiving grievances; fixed service standards for grievance resolution;
clear processing guidelines; and an effective and timely grievance response system to inform complainants of
the action taken. The best GRMs are managed by independent third parties, such that all parties feel that the
outcome of the system is fair.
Setting up an effective GRM requires the following steps.

     1. Identifying areas where more common grievances are likely to arise and the populations that are
        more likely to be affected.
     2. Design mechanisms for uptake of grievances, such as hotlines, complaints boxes, etc. It is important
        to design a system that can be anonymous if necessary (such as when individuals want to point out
        cases of corruption), but where individuals can also identify themselves (such as when individuals
        need compensation for environmental damages to their lands.) Ensure that this mechanism is
        accessible to people that may be more vulnerable, including people in more remote areas, people
        with low income or limited education, etc.
     3. Communicate to potential affected populations about the setup of GRMs and how they are used.
        Encourage the use of these mechanisms for grievances as well as for any feedback or suggestions on
        the operation of the company.
     4. Design a mechanism for sorting and processing feedback. Feedback should be received by the
        individual or unit that can act on the feedback and acknowledge receipt to the feedback provider, if
        the feedback provider is not anonymous.

ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                        30
     5. Create a system to verify, investigate, and act on grievances and feedback. The system should be set
        up so that grievances are addressed as quickly as possible, especially when grievances have
        significant impacts.
     6. Communicate to communities about the type of grievances received and measures taken to address
        grievances. This can help communities and companies have more positive interactions and can
        encourage communities to continue to provide feedback that can improve the impact of mining.



Corporate social responsibility
Companies often carry out activities to benefit the communities in and around mining areas. These corporate
social responsibility (CSR) activities serve multiple purposes, including showing communities that the
company intends to improve the surrounding areas; meeting local benefit-sharing regulations; and indirectly
improving the lives of mining workers and their families. Companies can benefit greatly from such endeavors,
since they can increase the good will of communities towards companies, which reduces the potential for
conflict between companies and citizens.

Companies often use CSR funds for highly visible
                                                                         The Juruti Mine project in Brazil is being helped by

of resources and furthers the community’s understanding of how investments are financed and procured. If
grievances arise because of CSR activities, clear grievance redress mechanisms need to be in place.



Proper planning and practices beyond mine closure
According to the Armenia Mining Code (2011), and the EIA practice of Environmental Impact Assessment,
the practice of mine closure and remediation needs to be stated and identified up-front, before the company is
granted rights to exploit a given mineral reserve. A mine closure program needs to be an integrated part of the
a company’s contract with the given company. Even though this approach of reviewing the whole “cradle-to-
grave” process of mining development is in line with all international standards, but it leaves a lot of questions
and issues that could arise in the practical implementation, mostly related to planning of financing mine
closure financing, and the responsibilities and liabilities and associated with post--closure monitoring. Closure
plans should be considered and incorporated into all aspects of mine planning, construction, and operation so
that key aspects of the closure are anticipated throughout the mine’s life cycle. Plans should identify measures
to be undertaken during the operations phase that are aimed at progressive reclamation of disturbed or
developed areas of the mine site.11 Figure 2 shows the relationship between cumulative efforts and investments
throughout the stages of the mine development life cycle, including the decommissioning and closure phases.



Managing social impacts
While CSR and GRMs are good practices for improving social impacts, companies need to have in place
systematic processes to manage social impacts. Many of the social impacts that may arise from mining are due
to environmental impacts. For example, contamination of water sources or impacts on biodiversity ultimately
have an impact on the people who use these natural resources. Mining also has a great deal of direct social
impacts, however, including displacement from lands and impacts on livelihoods. Mining can also have
positive impacts through the sharing of benefits.

Managing social impacts is one of the most difficult tasks of a mining company. Good practice states that
mining companies need to mitigate against all negative social impacts, including indirect and downstream
impacts. This means that companies need to have good mechanisms for establishing who the affected
populations are, costing out losses, and compensating populations for their losses. In many cases, affected
populations need assistance establishing new sources of livelihoods, especially when the mining activity means
that a community can no longer engage in traditional livelihood activities.

When managing social impacts, the participation of affected populations is essential. Populations, their
representatives, and civil society can participate in helping the company establish potential impacts (positive
and negative) and affected populations. Most importantly, affected populations are more likely to be satisfied
with mitigation measures that they themselves design in collaboration with the company. These measures are
likely to lead to more sustainable outcomes.

Mining can have a great role in reducing poverty in a country, and especially at the local level. This positive
social impact should also be managed. Putting in place benefit sharing mechanisms is essential, and goes

and their governments to help revenues impact the lives of those affected by mining.

Mine closure should be carried out in a way that prevents or minimizes impacts and risks to the environment
and human health. Closure plans should identify site-specific objectives for closure and how the land plans to
be used post-closure. Closure plans should detail the processes that will be used to decommission and reclaim
all aspects of the mining facility, including:

         mining and ore-processing facilities;
         site infrastructure; and
         water and waste management facilities, including waste rock piles and tailings management facilities.

Mine closure planning is a key tool in preventing or limiting post-closure environmental problems. The sooner
in the mine’s life cycle designing for mine closure begins, the greater the likelihood that closure measures will
be effective. In many cases, early planning also means the mine closure process will be less costly. In addition,
the early development of closure plans can facilitate progressive reclamation activities during the mine
operations phase, and this can help in preventing pollution during operations.

Apart from early identification of potential issues and recommended mitigation measures, it is proposed that
the environmental management plans, mine closure plans, and waste management plans be regularly updated
during the mine’s operation; these should be adjusted based on the monitoring results that are obtained from
regular monitoring processes, ongoing reclamation activities results, changes in mine operations, public
reactions, or other factors that influence mining operations. The final use of rehabilitated areas after mining
should be compatible with—or complemented by—adjacent land uses, which may have changed over time.
Figure 3 shows a schematic of the systems, tools, and processes that can be applied at any stage of the project
cycle, as well as the different stages of mine development and exploitation.

  Social issues must also be considered when planning for mine closure. A large number of individuals in local
  communities will probably need to find alternative work, and may need help developing skills to transition to a
  different industry. In addition, community demographics may change, as the health and education systems see
  individuals leave the community. Local development activity funding may be impacted if firms were
  contributing to these plans. Social issues in mine closure therefore also need to be updated throughout a mine’s
  life span.

  A separate issue is the management and reclamation including clean-up of legacy pollution and old and/or
  abandoned mining sites. The ownership over such mines may be an issue, as well as privatization or foreign
  investments into old mines, where environmental and social issues have not been determined up-front.
  Nonetheless, the potential and actual contamination of old mines and abandoned sites in particular tailing
  dams, still pose a significant environmental risk and pollution source and need to be managed.

5. Technological Advances—Costs and Benefits

The constant need for development and technological advances primarily hinges on improved efficiency of a
given process. The first and foremost aim of improving efficiency is indeed to lower associated costs and raise
economic benefits. With growing concern being rightfully paid to environmental issues, scientific and
technological advances are increasingly geared towards minimizing undesired environmental impacts,
including emissions, pollution, water use and wastewater release, and waste generation. Technological
developments and new practices span the entire mining and metal processing branch, and are aimed at different
segments of processing, including mines, related beneficiation, smelting facilities, and even mine tailings
reprocessing. Research behind the technological advances and development is focused first on understanding
the underlying processes that give rise to environmental impacts and then builds on this foundation to provide
new, cost-effective solutions. The challenge is to develop environmentally sound mining and processing
techniques that can also contribute to more widespread mitigation of historic environmental problems.

Developing more efficient and cost-effective approaches for handling mining-related environmental impacts is
desirable, particularly if the approaches promote the widespread cleanup of old mining sites. Innovative
methods for preventing and mitigating mining impacts will also help ensure cost-effective development of
future mines and the continued supply of minerals and metals. Environmentally sound mining and metal
production practices should meet the key challenges of:

         Reclamation—includes reestablishing viable soils and vegetation at the mine site. Although regulatory
          agencies and general recommendations may require more complex reclamation designs, modifying
          sloped (and other) surfaces and planting vegetation are simple ways to help stabilize the soil and
          prevent erosion and surface water infiltration. Although simple, this can still cost a few thousand
          dollars per acre to implement. As such, the challenge remains to decrease costs and develop
          reclamation and mitigation approaches that will yield better results. A potential and promising
          reclamation option may include using sludge, or “biosolids,” from municipal waste water treatment
          processes as an organic soil amendment and growing plant species that are more tolerant to acidic
          conditions, which would fit with the acidic conditions of tailings depots.
         Soil treatment—a common approach is to physically move soil to specially designed repositories.
          Future approaches may include using chemical methods to stabilize metals in soils, making them less
          mobile and biologically available; using bactericides that stop bacterial growth that promotes oxidation
          of pyrite and the accompanying formation of sulfuric acid; or using bio-liners (such as low
          permeability and compacted manure) as barriers at the base of waste piles.
         Water treatment—the most common treatment for acidic and metal-bearing waters is to add a
          neutralizing material, such as lime, to reduce the acidity. This “active” treatment process, which causes
          dissolved metals to precipitate from the water, usually also requires construction of a treatment
          facility. The operational maintenance that such a plant requires makes this treatment technique very
          expensive. Some possible alternatives could include using a “passive” wetland systems to treat metal-
          bearing waters (used where the volumes and acidity of the water are not too high); using in-situ
          treatment zones, where reactive materials or electric currents are placed in the subsurface so that water
          passing through them is treated; or combining treatment with the recovery of useful materials from
          contaminated water.
         Prevention of acid rock drainage—the potential for ARD needs to be identified early on and
          prevention must be addressed during exploration activities, prior to the start of newly planned mining
          operations. In some cases, it may even be possible to prevent or reduce ARD even in old or abandoned

ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                      35
          mining areas. Possible measures to prevent or significantly reduce ARD include flooding old
          underground mine workings to cut off the oxygen supply necessary for the sustained generation of
          acidic waters; sealing exposed surfaces in underground workings with a nonreactive or impermeable
          coating that inhibits the oxidation process; backfilling mine workings with reactive materials that can
          neutralize and treat waters that pass through them; adding chemicals to the water in flooded surface
          and underground mine workings that can inhibit acid-generating chemical reactions and precipitate
          coatings that will seal off groundwater migration routes; and isolating contaminated waters at depth by
          stratification, which allows viable habitat to develop near the surface in the water that fills large open
          pits.
         Control of gas and airborne emissions—including the particulates that are being emitted into the air
          from the mining operations and the gas emissions from the mines themselves.
         Recycling—recycling used metal components can be an alternative source of metals that reduces the
          need for new metal mines. Developing technologies may make recycling become a significant source
          or metals; however, recycling facilities themselves are new and stand-alone industrial developments
          and therefore have their own set of environmental impacts.
         Innovative mine backfilling—for example, alternative Binder technology that reduces greenhouse gas
          emissions, diminishes smelter footprint, and decreases environmental effects and long-term liability.
         Management of waste rock and tailings—tailings and waste rock being considered for use as mine
          backfill should be assessed to ensure that the material will be suitable for this purpose, particularly if
          the material is to be used to provide structural support in underground mines.
         Mine closure—mine closure activities should address the underground and open pit mine workings;
          ore-processing facilities and site infrastructure; waste rock piles and TMFs; sludge disposal areas, as
          well as ongoing sludge disposal requirements post-closure; water management facilities; landfill and
          waste disposal facilities; and exploration areas.

New technological advances, and research and development (R&D) in general, need to be in constant
development. This is to not only follow trends and changing variables, but also to be able to build on one set of
advances and ensure continuous development and improvement. For example, in the United States, mine
health issues are certain to be paramount in the coming decades. Noise, dust, and diesel emissions, as well as
heat and humidity, will continue to be targets for improved technology. But others may arise as mining and
overall global variables change. Some of these concerns come about from the increasing depth of mineral
operations and the growth of operations. Others arise from the use of new equipment, potential health
problems, and the small size of operations.

Figure 4 indicates diminishing returns on the overall curve as it relates to a specific area of technology, with
gradual improvements as individual breakthroughs are made, and then improvements that occur at specific
points. An example of this could be the introduction of mechanized tunneling rigs. Level 0 would represent
manual drilling, with the first and major breakthrough to level 1 being the semi-mechanized pneumatic rig.
This technology would be improved and made more mine-worthy until the next breakthrough to level 2, with
the introduction of the rail-bound hydraulic drifter. The next breakthrough could be the trackless, diesel
hydraulic rig, and the level 4 technology, the fully automated electrohydraulic rig. The overall technological
developments need to stem from an R&D strategy, which would be based on not only the available technology
but also on how appropriate and applicable that technology is to a given operation.12

New technologies at the company level
In order to improve safety, environmental protection, or operational effectiveness, many mining companies
view the introduction of new technology as a strategic necessity. Most mining companies worldwide have
experienced the difficulty in successfully implementing new technologies in the mining industry. 13 Often,
failure is not caused by the technology itself, but by the overall operational system into which the technology is
introduced. Such failures may come with a significant opportunity cost, and have a detrimental effect on future
development, simply because the system has not been adequately engineered and the risks have not been
adequately assessed and managed. Technology initiatives often fail because the technology was not
appropriate for the work system into which it was introduced; perhaps it was too technically advanced for the
level of skill available, or it may have required too radical a change in workflow, or there was a lack of skilled
personnel to operate.

New technology or new operational methods involve doing work differently. Such a statement immediately
implies change, which, unless managed adequately, will foment resistance. Thus, a change in management
process, which is applicable to the introduction of new technology and methods, is necessary. Lessons to be
learnt from large-scale interventions are that firstly, the change process goes through a series of phases that, in
total, usually require a considerable length of time. Skipping steps creates only the illusion of speed and never
produces a satisfying result. A second lesson is that crucial mistakes in any of the phases can have a
devastating impact, slowing momentum and negating hard-won gains. The holy grail of optimum performance
is not found in technology—technology is merely an information tool.

Numerous research studies and cases suggest that new technologies are best implemented through a series of
steps that are required to properly change and upgrade a working technological process into something new
and different. As a starting point, any plan for a new technology’s implementation must offer the business a
quantifiable purpose and benefit, whether in terms of economics, health, safety, or environment. Within the
visioning process, it is important to identify risks and derailers. This is essential, because many of these will be
identified and raised by the team members and stakeholders during the change process. The risks include:

           premature application of unproven technology
           resistance to change from the workforce and supervisors
           fear of job loss as a result of the technology
           suspicion of management motives in introducing the technology
           poorly engineered work systems
           inadequate training and skill to operate the equipment

         new health and safety risks created by the technology or work system
         poor implementation, planning, and control

New technologies must be introduced through a process that should ensure the implementation program
includes:

         a strategic component, such that the program supports the strategic intent of the company
         a carefully developed feasibility study
         an inclusive change management process
         an understanding of the technology’s appropriateness
         a risk assessment and risk management program
         an ongoing performance management system for people and technology

Introducing new technology to an existing operation is a complex and multilayered process that may require
substantial resources to be harmonized with the operation’s other segments. Hence, greenfield development
that allows for early introduction of most recent technologies has an advantage in this scenario, but also
requires that sufficient research and design is done during the exploration and planning phases to support such
technological decisions. Some companies may actually prefer to use already tested and tried processes, while
others may prefer to obtain the benefits of newer technologies.

New technologies at the regulator or government level
Developing and using new technologies in any industry, including mining, is welcome if a company
experiences immediate economic benefits. If the aim of the new technology is predominantly to improve
environmental impacts and concerns, however, then companies may see little incentive to adopt processes that
can be cumbersome and even unnecessary, if judged solely from an economic and market value perspective.
Hence the government needs to support the development and implementation of such technologies. This means
that government agencies and institutions need to employ experts who will undertake and promote research
and technology development, and transfer and cooperate with the companies that operate in a given industrial
branch such as mining. Doing so will ensure that a country’s resources are optimally used for overall
development of the country and that the industry remains competitive. Furthermore, the private sector tends to
underfund R&D, particularly for high-risk projects and projects with long-term benefits.

The government needs to have an appropriate, clear, and critical role in funding mining technology R&D.
Successful R&D produces new technologies that reduce production costs; enhance the quality of existing
mineral commodities; reduce adverse environmental, health, and safety impacts; and create or make available
entirely new mineral commodities. In order for government institutions to track and support new technologies
and their application, expert teams must follow global trends and cooperate with other teams that provide
licenses for mining operations and the EIA procedures. The R&D geared at new mining technologies should be
two-fold: (a) interact with the regulatory system that governs current mining operations; and (b) focus on the
cleanup, remediation, or even reuse of the historic mining or mining-related pollution sites.

The government’s role in this process is essential. For example, when determining the value of R&D, private
firms tend to only consider the benefits they expect to capture. Therefore, society as a whole is best served
when R&D expands to the point at which the expected benefits of additional expenditures just equal the costs,




ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                   38
appropriately discounted for time and risk. 14 The expected benefits include internal benefits to the firm
carrying out the R&D, as well as external benefits realized by consumers and other producers. Because the
external benefits of exploration, mining, and mineral processing often constitute a large portion of the total
benefits, the market will not support the optimal amount of R&D, possibly by a wide margin, without
government support.

As states move to reclaim their roles in community and economic development, there will be opportunities for
improved partnerships between governments, mining companies, and local communities. These new
partnerships will be critical to ensure that mining contributes to local and national development in an
environmentally sustainable way. Studies show that countries with a positive history of new technology
implementation are mostly those that have strong institutions and well-formed policies.15 Revenue flows from
the mining sector have helped finance public sector investments that have supported overall economic growth.

A number of recommendations can be made based on the example of Australia’s industry policy, which is a
relatively noninterventionist instrument that rests first and foremost on providing general economic settings
that foster efficiency. Recent policy has emphasized innovation as the basis for continuing competitive
advantage, including a focus on commercialization of Australian research.16 The developed programs that can
provide services to the industry include:

         Small Business Assistance Program—a competitive grants program made up of three components:
          Small Business Incubators, Small Business Enterprise Culture, and Small Business Answers.
         Commercial Ready—a competitive merit-based program that offers industry a single entry point to
          grants for early stage commercialization activities, R&D with high commercial potential, and proof-of-
          concept activities.
         Commercializing Emerging Technologies (COMET)—a grants program that targets management
          skills of businesses and individuals to increase the commercialization of innovative products,
          processes, and services.
         The Pooled Development Fund (PDF) Program—designed to increase the supply of equity capital for
          growing Australian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). PDFs raise capital from investors and
          use it to invest in Australian companies.
         The Innovation Investment Fund (IIF) Program—designed to promote the commercialization of
          Australian R&D, through the provision of venture capital to small, high-tech companies at the seed,
          start up or early expansion stages of their development.
         Industry Techlink—gives companies looking for technology solutions access to technology consultants
          who can help them diagnose their problem and provide a suggested way forward.
         Invest Australia—in the course of attracting direct foreign investment, builds capacity by creating
          leading edge customers for the industry.

Companies can take several actions to improve their mining sectors. Companies in developing countries
should:

         closely cooperate with government and innovators, as well as participate in any research and support it
         formulate their strategy for the gradual changes within the company itself and mining approach

Policymakers can also take action to improve their mining sectors. Policymakers in developing countries
concerned with strengthening the economic management and institutional competency in their mining sectors
might want to:

         formulate a strategy for the sustainable development of the minerals and metals sector
         pursue reform and capacity building for government agencies and ministries, in particular with regard
          to economic management and fiscal administration (this includes strengthening the independence and
          competence of fiscal and monetary authorities so that they can resist pressures to spend any windfalls

6. Main Risks, Bottlenecks, and Obstacles

One of the first issues identified in developing these two thematic papers is the need for stronger coordination
and cooperation between the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (as the body responsible for the
development of mining) and the Ministry of Nature Protection (as the body responsible for ensuring sound
environmental practices across the board of all development activities). Although generally perceived as
having different and opposing agendas, the two ministries need to work together to develop compromise
solutions that would lead to environmentally and socially sustainable mining development. The first thematic
paper (Sustainable and Strategic Decision Making in Mining) concluded that there is a need for strategic
planning in mining, and stressed the use of a number of instruments that would help ensure the overall
sustainability of the mining development process. In particular, based on the analysis made regarding the R&D
and technological advances (Chapter 5), it is essential to have professional staff dedicated and able to track the
global development of technologies, and be able to apply and/or review their practical application in Armenia.
The designated staff can also help influence the regulative requirements coming out of the ministries,
particularly the Ministry of Nature Protection.

In addition, the lack of formally required and organized data was a major constraint in the development of this
paper, and will also be an obstacle to the management of the environmental and social impacts associated with
mining activities. A registry of data needs to be developed based on a set of parameters that will be unified for
all mining activities. This dataset will be regularly updated based on formal monitoring and will allow for
easier and readily available tracking of all given parameters against either a baseline (which may be impossible
to generate for already operating mines) or the earliest available data for a given mine. The data can also be
separated into sections ready for public disclosure, along with threshold values and data interpretation that can
be beneficial to raising awareness and for the public’s general knowledge, in particular the local communities
that are the most impacted by the mining operations. Furthermore, having a formal registry will also help build
the practice of formal monitoring conducted for the mines and strengthen the regular communication channels
between the operators and regulators.

7. Recommendations and Conclusions

Building on the recommendations made in the first paper, this paper offers a series of more in-depth and
specific recommendations to enhance strategic and sustainable planning; integrate SESA processes in strategic
mining development; include CIA to supplement the EIA procedure; and enhance transparency in mining.
These recommendations are aimed at ensuring better and stronger support and coordination between the
regulating agencies, and to ensure better data collection and monitoring practices. All of this should lead to
improved data availability and disclosure of available data and monitoring results.

For each of the recommendations there is an assigned responsibility between the two ministries that are
primarily involved in mining development and impact assessment. . In addition, priority recommendations are
ranked as “high” or “medium”. . A high priority may identify issues that need to be urgently dealt with, or for
which the preconditions have been met. A medium priority may mean that the activity includes an ongoing and
longer-term process, or that the recommendation may need to have one or a few preconditions in place prior to
its commencement. The priorities are, as such, based on their need and the ability to be implemented rapidly.




Recommendation 1: enhance cooperation and better staffing practices in the responsible
ministries
Responsibility: Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and Ministry of Nature Protection
Level of Priority: high – (long-term process)


Having professional and dedicated staff to follow global development and improvements in the environmental
management practices related to mining is critical for making sure Armenia is implementing the most up-to-
date and enhanced environmental protection measures. Furthermore, the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources and the Ministry of Nature Protection need to engage in continuous dialogue so as to achieve the
synergy necessary for developing environmentally and socially sustainable mining solutions. This cooperation
can only benefit from having a designated staff member, or even a whole unit, to handle mining issues in
particular. Once a staff member or unit is fully dedicated to one industrial branch (mining) they can build their
own professional expertise, easily follow the most recent global technological developments, and fully view
the economic, social, and environmental impacts of such developments. Furthermore, the cooperation will be
strengthened by tracking global developments and new practices and technologies to help mitigate the
associated impacts.

Recommendation 2: improve monitoring practices, enforcement and data collection,
analysis and disclosure
Responsibility: Ministry of Nature Protection and Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources
Level of Priority: high – (long-term process)


A main constraint to developing this thematic paper was the lack of available and up-to-date information and
data. In particular, similar requests often resulted in different values of data provided, often citing the same
source. The limited data, measurements, and figures that are available come from relevant government
agencies, private mining companies, international companies that are involved in Armenia’s mining industry,

ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                    42
and from articles and analyses conducted by independent experts or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
Armenia lacks a central registry of data on the operating mines, which would include general items related to
the location and operation of the mine, linked with environmental measurements, and data for example on the
management of tailingsThe existence of such a register would help ensure regular monitoring practices and
help enforcement agencies conduct inspections. The register should feature well-organized and structured
databases; certain sections of it would ideally be made available to the public, which would boost public
awareness and knowledge of mining-associated impacts, ways these are measured, and how they are mitigated.
Increased public awareness can also help generate more constructive dialogue between all stakeholders, in
particular for drafting strategic documents hinged on sustainability, such as the SESA. Joining the EITI (one of
the recommendations from the first paper) will help increase the public disclosure and availability of the data
to the public as well.

Armenia has already taken certain steps, for example through the RA Government Decree from January 2013
that establishes monitoring procedures of the mining areas and tailings dams with respect to the safety and
health of the population in the neighboring communities. The provisions of this decree need to be enforced,
and the regularly updated data needs to be made available in a consistent manner.



Recommendation 3: develop specific guidelines
Responsibility: Ministry of Nature Protection with Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources
Level of Priority: medium – (long-term process already initiated)

Substantial guidelines and sound practices exist to guide all of the individual mining processes, as well as
overall mining development. In particular, countries such as Australia and Canada have very strong and well-
established guidance notes and literature, which have been used to develop this paper. A general conclusion of
the literature is that strong expert presence needs to be ensured on the ground, so as to custom tailor the
guidance to a given mine in a given country, and to make sure the technological solutions are a good fit for a
given operation. This recommendation can developed by a strong expert staffing or a dedicated unit within the
two ministries, and can only be implemented once the first recommendation is fully implemented and the
second is partially implemented.

First steps in this general direction are being made by the Government of Armenia, in particular with the
guidelines that will be further developed and are aimed at supplementing the Mining Code, but also through
the Operational Manual that the Ministry of Nature Protection had drafted in 2011, tackling a number of
mining-related issues and impacts.

The key point of this recommendation, as well as the overall paper is to ensure harmony between various
requirements and to ensure proper compliance with the legal provisions.

ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining   44
     I.   Mine Tailings and Associated Impacts

Mine tailings is a term for the materials (or residue) left over from the process of separating the valuable
fraction from the uneconomic fraction of a given ore. Since separation processing requires large quantities of
rock to be mined, crushed, pulverized, and processed, the resulting mine tailings are usually enormous,
especially if the extraction process is not very efficient. Furthermore, the tailings usually take up more physical
space than the area from which they were mined. The definition of mine tailings does not include the
overburden materials, which are the waste rock or inert materials that have been removed from the mining area
prior to extraction of the ore.

In most cases, mine tailings are kept close to the mining site so as to decrease transport costs, or in some cases,
are transported to a site displaced from the actual mine. The tailings usually represent the external cost of
mining; they are the industry’s single most important environmental impact. The associated environmental and
health impacts of mine tailings depots are far-reaching and require a number of financially substantial steps to
render the areas environmentally safe both during their lifetime and after a mine closes. The tailings depots are
often the most significant environmental liabilities for mining development projects. Because tailings have no
financial value to the mine operator at that particular point in time,17 they are typically stored in the most cost-
effective manner that meets the bare minimum of regulations. As such, the tailings are disposed (or stored) at
dams, embankments, and other types of low-cost containments that are also prone to catastrophic failures.
Hence, it is important to examine not only the environmental impacts associated with inadequately storing and
managing tailings, but also the risks associated with catastrophic and accidental events.

In general, the tailings from base metal mining activities can be characterized as follows:

         they are usually a slurry
         they contain metals;
         they contain sulphides;
         large amounts are produced;
         slurried tailings are managed in ponds; in some underground mines, the coarse tailings are used as
          backfill material;
         sulfide in tailings and waste rock can oxidize when water and air have access and an acidic leachate is
          generated. This phenomenon is called Acid Rock Drainage (ARD). Due to ARD, not only is the
          physical stability of the tailings ponds and dams an issue, but so is the chemical stability of the acid
          generating tailings, both during operation and after the mine closure;
         waste rock is stacked on heaps and can also have a high environmental impact if it has a net acid
          generating potential.


Conflicting views over how mine tailings are perceived mostly hinge on the associated costs of their sound
environmental management and on who has ownership over them. As is the case in Armenia, tailings are
considered a valuable resource due to the potential to reprocess them and extract the remaining valuable ore.18

17
   One of the main reasons behind mine tailings being “stored“ and not permanently managed as waste is the fact that they could be
reprocessed sometime in the future. At a given point in time, when the further extraction of smaller fractions of ore from tailings is
not economically viable, the tailings have no value to the mining operator.
18
   By far the larger proportion of ore mined in most industry sectors ultimately becomes tailings that must be disposed of. In the gold
industry, for example, only a few hundredths of an ounce of gold may be produced for every ton of dry tailings generated. Similarly,
the copper industry (and others) typically mine relatively low-grade ores that contain less than a small percentage of metal values;

ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                                         45
As such, ownership over the tailings (or manmade mines) is transferred to the government of Armenia once the
mine is closed. The tailings are not defined as a waste material in the Law on Wastes (2004), are not required
to be listed in state registers, and are not issued a “waste passport” as mandated by the Decree on Procedures of
Issuing Passports to the Wastes. There are also no fees associated with storage or final disposal. Yet another
issue to take into account is whether the mine tailings are a historic remnant of previous mining, or if the
tailings are being presently generated by an active mine.

Disposal methods
In almost every project, metallic ores are buried under a layer of ordinary soil or rock (called overburden or
waste rock) that must be moved or excavated to access the metallic ore deposit. Most mining projects generate
enormous overburden. The ratio of the quantity of overburden to the quantity of mineral ore (the strip ratio) is
usually greater than one, and can be much higher. For example, if a proposed mining project involves the
extraction of 100 million metric tons of mineral ore, the project could generate more than one billion metric
tons of overburden and waste rock. These high-volume wastes, which sometimes contain significant levels of
potentially toxic substances, are usually deposited on-site, either in piles on the surface or as backfill in open
pits, or within underground mines. Therefore, the EIA for a proposed mining project must carefully assess the
management options and associated impacts of overburden disposal.

The crushed ores are also usually concentrated to free the valuable mineral and metal particles from the less
valuable rock. Beneficiation processes include physical/chemical separation techniques such as gravity
concentration, magnetic separation, electrostatic separation, flotation, solvent extraction, electrowinning,
leaching, precipitation, and amalgamation. Conventional beneficiation processes generate tailings, which
generally leave the mill as a slurry that consists of 40–70% liquid and 30–60% solids.

There are several methods for disposing tailings. These include dry or thickened tailings disposal in
impoundments or free-standing piles; backfilling underground mine workings and open pits; subaqueous
disposal; and the most common method, disposing tailings slurry in impoundments. Modern tailings
impoundments are engineered structures for permanently disposing the fine-grained waste from mining and
milling operations. At some projects, tailings embankments stand several tens of meters high and the
impoundments cover several square kilometers. Historically, tailings were disposed where convenient and
most cost-effective, often in flowing water or directly into drainages. As local concerns arose about
sedimentation in downstream watercourses, water use, and other issues, mining operations began impounding
tailings behind earthen dams, which were often constructed of tailings and other waste materials. The
impoundments served the dual purpose of containing the tailings and, particularly in the arid areas, allowing
scarce water to be reused.19

Tailings contain toxic constituents, and the key long-term goal of tailings disposal and management is to
prevent the mobilization and release of these toxic materials into the environment. The disposal options
include: (a) the use of a wet tailings impoundment facility, or tailings pond; (b) dewatering and disposal of dry
tailings as backfill; and (c) submarine tailings disposal. The first option (a tailings pond) is by far the most
commonly used option, but the second option (dry tailings disposal) is, in most circumstances, the
environmentally-preferable option. The third option (submarine tailings disposal) is sometimes proposed for
mine sites located near deep-sea environments, or in rare instances in freshwater lakes. Submarine tailings
disposal has a poor environmental record in the few places where it has been practiced. Before the adoption of

the residue becomes tailings. Thus, tailings disposal is a significant part of the overall mining and milling operation at most hard rock
mining projects. (Source: US Environmental Protection Agency, 1994.)

environmental laws and standards, many mining companies simply dumped tailings in the nearest convenient
location, including nearby rivers and streams. Some of the worst environmental consequences of mining have
been associated with the open dumping of tailings, a practice that is now nearly universally rejected.20



Environmental, social, and health impacts of poorly managed mine tailings
The first and most visible impact of mine tailings is the aesthetic appearance of an area in which tailings are
disposed, and also the land footprint of the tailings, as they occupy large portions of land. However, the risks
associated with mine tailings go beyond the simple physical impacts.

The second most common concern and issue with the tailings depots is the erosion of soils and tailings, which
especially needs to be assessed in the event of a catastrophe or dam failure. Erosion is a specific issue, as large
areas of land are disturbed by mining operations; this continues to be an issue that must to be managed
throughout the mine’s life cycle, from the planning and start of operations through reclamation. Erosion may
cause sediments (and any entrained chemical pollutants) to be unloaded to nearby water bodies, especially
during severe storm events and high snow melt periods. A further concern is that exposed materials from
mining operations (mine workings, wastes, contaminated soils, etc.) may contribute sediments with chemical
pollutants, principally heavy metals. The variability in natural site conditions (for example, geology,
vegetation, topography, climate, and proximity to and characteristics of surface waters), combined with
significant differences in the quantities and characteristics of exposed materials at mines, preclude any
generalization of the quantities and characteristics of sediment loading.21

The composition of mine tailings varies greatly and depends on the type of ore mined, the geological
composition that would include other elements in the tailings, and finally, the process that has been used to
extract the valuable ore. In particular, the extraction process that may use chemicals and other extraction
compounds would in turn characterize the tailings as hazardous waste. Even when chemicals are not used,
tailings contain a number of trace elements in the form of complex compounds, and present waste that is bulky
and difficult to manage. Even though mine tailings contain naturally occurring elements that have been
extracted from the ground, the mining and grinding process may uncover and liberate compounds that are not a
standard part of the ecological systems (either by form, concentration, or simply presence at the soil’s surface
layers).

For example, most mining and processing wastes contain minerals, such as sulfides, which are formed at the
higher temperatures and pressures found at geological depths. Once such elements are processed and therefore
exposed to aerobic, surficial conditions, the minerals may break down and release elements (including acids)
that are not a common or natural part of the surrounding environment.22 As such, when such compounds are
leached, it changes the soil composition in the surrounding areas and renders them useless for agriculture or
other human uses. It also negatively impacts the surrounding flora, fauna, and ecosystems. Leaching increases
with precipitation, which further spreads the polluting constituents to nearby rivers, lakes, and groundwater.
These water bodies are mostly used as a water supply source for settlements, where water quality monitoring,
if conducted at all, may not test for all of the constituents that may leach from tailings piles.23

Commonly called acid mine drainage (AMD) or acid rock drainage (ARD), acid drainage primarily depends
on the mineralogy of the rock material and the availability of water and oxygen. Acid drainage is generated at
both abandoned and active mine sites. The potential for a mine or its associated waste to generate acid and
release contaminants depends on many site-specific factors. AMD occurs at mine sites when metal sulfide
minerals are oxidized. Once acid drainage has occurred, controlling the releases is a difficult and costly
problem, so prediction is becoming an important tool for regulators and operators.

Both water and oxygen are necessary to generate acid drainage. Other factors that affect acid drainage are the
physical characteristics of the material, the placement of the acid-generating materials, the presence of any
acid-neutralizing materials (whether naturally occurring in the material or supplemental), and the climatologic
and hydrologic regime in the vicinity. Once formed, the acid will leach or dissolve metals and other
contaminants from mined materials and form a solution that is acidic, high in sulfate, and metal-rich (including
elevated concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, arsenic, etc.) Toxic constituents, such as arsenic,
selenium, and metals, can be leached even if acidic conditions are not present. Elevated levels of cyanide and
nitrogen compounds (ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite) can also be found in waters at mine sites, from heap
leaching and blasting. Acid drainage and contaminant leaching is the most important source of water quality
impacts related to metallic ore mining.

Acid mine drainage is mostly associated with metal mines, and in particular with metals such as gold, copper,
silver, and molybdenum, all of which are relevant to the Armenian mining industry. These metals are often
found in rock with sulfide minerals. When exposed to air and water, the sulfides will form sulfuric acid. The
acid will in turn dissolve other harmful metals in the surrounding rock. If uncontrolled, the acid can reach
ground or surface water bodies and severely impact fish and other aquatic life. Once a stream has a pH value of
4 or lower, its plants, animals, and fish cannot survive. Beyond the acidic conditions, the toxic characteristics
of the leachate also severely impact the aquatic life. AMD also dissolves toxic metals such as copper,
aluminum, cadmium, arsenic, lead, and mercury from the surrounding rock. These metals, particularly the iron,
may coat the stream bottom with an orange-red colored slime called yellowboy. Even in very small amounts,
metals can be toxic to humans and wildlife. Carried in water, the metals can travel far, contaminating streams
and groundwater over great distances. The impacts to aquatic life may range from immediate fish kills to
sublethal impacts that affect growth, behavior, or reproductive ability. Metals are particularly problematic
because they do not break down in the environment. They settle to the bottom and persist in a stream for long
periods of time, constituting a long-term source of contamination to the aquatic insects that live there and the
fish that feed on them.24

Due to processing and grinding, tailings particles decrease in size and can easily become airborne, especially
with wind. As such, the dust that is spread may contain fine particulates along with other compounds found in
the tailings. All of these can spread far beyond the local tailings depot area. This issue can persist over
decades, as low pH and lack of soil content at a tailings depot prevents plant cover from developing.
Exacerbating the problem is population growth, which has led to increasing proximity of some mine sites to
developing communities. Thus, there are both human and ecological health consequences from exposure to
dust that originates from these sites.

The health-related impacts go beyond the site’s workers. The airborne particles may interfere with the
respiratory system (of both humans and animals) and may settle on the surface of the plants and/or soil. The
acid and other leached compounds impact the quality of the soil and surface and groundwater beyond the

project site. Since soil is used for agriculture and to sustain the population, and ground and surface waters are
used for water supply, the health impacts, especially those that accumulate over years of consumption, may be
very serious.

The underlying social impacts that can arise from poorly organized and uncontrolled mining operations and
mining sites include possible illegal access to the sites and artisanal mining. Such practices can expose
artisanal miners to great risks of accidents on site. Figure 5 provides an overview of the main environmental
impacts associated with the mine disposal areas or tailings sites.

The main challenge, and therefore purpose of this paper, is to provide guidance on sound environmental
management practices for the tailings, regardless of whether the tailings would be processed or disposed of in
the long run. From a practical aspect, these guidelines would include minimizing the physical footprint,
managing dust, controlling leaching of hazardous elements, and controlling access to the site; meanwhile from
an enforcement aspect, the guidelines would need to include the necessary steps required for self-monitoring,
third-party monitoring, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and permits, and, most importantly,
deliberating a cut-off date by which the tailings would need to be reprocessed in order to avoid being
considered waste material.


 II.        Situation with Mine Tailings in Armenia

According to information collected in 2011 by the Armenian Development Agency—Research and
Information Department,25 some 30 base metal and precious metals mines exist in Armenia, out of which 22
were being exploited in 2011. Seven are copper-molybdenum, three are copper, thirteen are gold and gold
poly-metallic mines, and two are iron ore mines. Apart from the operating mines, an additional 115 deposit
sites have been discovered. According to the ADA, the biggest concentration of the mines is in the Lori,
Kotayk, and Syunik marzes, with mines also present in the marzes of Gerharkunik, Vayots Dzor, and
Aragatsosn.

However, according to the data of Ministry of Emergency Situations there were 19 tailing dumps in Armenia
by March of 20121 (presented in map in Figure below). The area of land allocated to the mining companies
makes 8275 hectares including 1400 hectares used for tailing dumps with the volume of accumulated tailings
equal to 220 million m3.2

Large amounts of concomitant ore components remain unutilized in the disposed overburden. Most of the
tailings are poorly managed, with little oversight to limit the exposure of such sites to weather conditions. A
Toxic Site Identification Program—a joint effort led by the Blacksmith Institute, the American University of
Armenia, the World Bank, the European Commission, and other development partners—evaluated sites where
toxic pollution may impact human health. The investigated sites included 7 mines, 12 active or abandoned
tailings depots and one abandoned smelter. Thirteen impacted communities in five marzes were interviewed.
Water and soil samples were taken and analyzed in a licensed laboratory in the United Kingdom. Among many
other observations, the Toxic Site Identification Program points out that the most significant impacts on the
environment and human health originating from the tailings leachate include contaminated soil, groundwater,
and surface water, and children’s exposure to contaminated soils and bodies of water. Toxic chemicals such as
cadmium, chromium, arsenic, and lead get into the food chain when abandoned tailings are used as pastures or
cultivated land and polluted rivers for irrigation. Local communities use tailings residues as construction
materials. Valuable species are disappearing in polluted rivers.

According to the available information, the most predominant mine tailings dam sites are those associated with
primarily gold and then copper mining. These include the Mghart gold mine in Lori, the Sotk gold mine in
Gegharkunik, and the Amulsar gold mine in Jermuk, Vayots Dzor. The tailings dams of the copper mines are
registered at Teghut and Akhtala in Lori, Kajaran and Hankasar mines in Syunik, while the Agarak mine in
Syunik has multiple tailings dams that have been or are currently being used. In most cases, the registries may

not include the mines that have previously been operational but are now shut down, but the tailings dams still
exist.

One of Armenia’s most substantial mining operations is the copper-molybdenum mine in Kajaran, which is
considered to be one of the country’s industrial giants. Operational since 1951 the plant is estimated to produce
some 10 million tons of copper and molybdenite concentrates per year. The copper concentrate is transported
to the Alaverdi metallurgical plant and Armenian Molybdenum Production Company in Yerevan for further
processing, while final treatment of molybdenite takes place at the Yerevan Clean Iron Plant. The mine in
Kajaran employs 3,800 people.

The Alaverdi Copper Smelter was founded in 1770, and had benefited from the regional investments in the
metallurgical sector through Russian and French support through the 19 th century. By 1903, the amount of
copper produced in Alaverdi equaled 13% of the total copper produced in the entire Russian Empire. Along
with the development of the hydropower plant of the Debed River to supply energy to the metallurgical plants,
the Alaverdi area expanded into a large town of 16,500 population (as of 2009). The smelter employs
approximately 500 people.

Across the country, mine tailings are located fairly close to settlements, in particular in small towns that have
grown around the mines and mine processing, such as Alaverdi. The predominant part of the country is rich in
cultural-historical heritage and natural areas, including forests. For example, in Alaverdi, the Odzun church
dates back to 5th century and the Horomayr monastery dates back to the 7th; natural areas within the high
mountains include the Debed River canyon and forests. One of the most drastic examples of the proximity of a
mine tailings pond to an urban area is in Akhtala, Lori marz, which is a particular valued cultural heritage site;
a tailings dam is located in a gorge right next to a monastery from the 13th century.

Although there is a general notion that metals mining has been the driving economic force in many of these
mining communities (for example in the area of Agarak, where use of the copper and lead mines date back to
ancient times), some areas, such as Jermuk, may also have other development options which can be
endangered by unsustainable mining practices. Jermuk’s mineral water and spa tourism industry offers a
substantial development option, and it is essential to preserve the quality of the groundwater being bottled and
used in spas.

The fact that water accumulates on top of the tailings depots is further evidenced in the Geghi rivulet and
Voghji River, where direct disposal in the riverbanks or river canyons occurs. Meanwhile, the Kajaran tailings
dam has water stored on top of the tailings dump and is used to meet the plant’s water needs.

Improperly managed mining areas and in particular tailing dams and depots present a number of environmental
threats and concerns. In particular, it is very important to note that improperly managed historical mining
areas, whether they are still operational or abandoned, are a deterrent to any new mining developments. Any
plans and agreements made for a new mine cannot be acceptable to the general public if the remnants of old
mining processes and their environmental impacts are still visible. A combined approach needs to be made for
ensuring sustainable development of new mining areas but also clean-up and remediation of the old sites.

Tailing depots of “Akhtala Mountain Enrich Combinat” Ltd
There are 3 tailing depots adjacent to Akhtala town. “Nazik” tailing depot has an area of 2 hectares, 40
meters height, and designed volume of 0.5 mln m3. 1 By March 2012 0.4 mln m3 was full. “Canyon of
explosive materials” tailing depot has an area of 3.6 hectares, 40 meters height, and designed volume of
0.45 mln m3 with 0.3 mln m3 being full. 1 The “Martir” tailing depot has an area of 8 hectares, 60 meters
height, and designed volume of 3 mln m3 (1.1 is full).1 The materials of the construction for all three dams
are clay-sand.1 All three dams lack basic environmental protection measures including diversion of
surface water, circulation of waste water and rehabilitation of the land.3 All tailing depots were
established during Soviet time.3 In 2010, two out of three tailing depots were actively used by the
company although they have been closed due to reaching designed maximum capacity. 3 According to
2012 data the first two tailing depots have been conserved while “Martir” continues to be active.1
The closest human habitats to tailing depots are Akhtala with population of 2400, Mets Ayrum with
population of 986, and Jojkan with population of 2138.4 5 Akhtala Monastery is located in Akhtala town
just next to “Nazik” tailing depot.6 There are houses next to the tailing depots in “Svinets” and
“Transport” district of the town (see figure below). In addition to the tailing depots from the other side of
the Monastery yard tailings can be seen across the river bank6.

Tailing Depots of “Multi Group” Concern

“Multi Group” Concern owns the open pit gold mine adjacent to Mghart and Koghbes villages.6
In the area of “Mghart” mine there are three tailing depots with designed volumes of 0.03, 0.02 and 0.05
mln m3, respectively.1 As of March 2012 the first tailing depot was full by 0.026 mln m3 out of 0.03 mln
m3, the second depot was full by 0.01 mln m3 out of 0.02 mln m3 and the third was full by 0.043 mln m3

out of 0.05 mln m3.1 The current heights of the dams of three tailing depots are 5m. The designed height
of the first dam was 2m, and for the next two the designed heights are equal to the current heights (5m).
The materials used are clay-sand, rocks and gravel.1 Тhe area of these tailing depots are 0.15, 0.064 and
0.023 hectares, respectively.1 Two of these tailing depots are conserved and the last one is in operation.1
The owner of these tailings depots is “Multi Group” Concern.1
Villagers of the abovementioned communities reported continuous disturbance due to explosions. 6 Since
the mining operations started the quality and quantity of the drinking water suffered. As a result villagers
have to collect water from the spring located in the center of the village since their taps are no longer
providing drinking water.6


A Tailing Depot of “ACP” Ltd
The ACP (Armenian Copper Programme) operates since 1997 and owns Copper Smelter in Alaverdi and
Teghut Mine.9
A tailing depot that belongs to “ACP” Ltd is located next to Alaverdi town.1 The designed volume is 0.5
mln m3 out of which 0.4 was full by March, 2012.1 The area of the tailing depot is 1.32 hectares.1 The
dam was constructed with mineral wastes accumulations.1 The designed and current heights of the dam
were 59.7 m and 40 m, respectively.1 At current the tailing depot is conserved.1

There are 9 tailing depots in Syunik marz.1

Tailing Depots of “Zangezur Copper-Molybdenum Combine” Ldt
The “Zangezur copper-molibdenum combine” was established in 1951. It was privatized in 2004 by an
international consortium led by a German mining company.1 3 Currently it is one of the biggest mining
companies in Armenia. Zangezur mine is an open pit copper-molibdenum mine with annual 12.8
megatons of copper ore; part of which is processed in Alaverdi and part in sent abroad.1 3 According to
the Kajaran’s Mayor’s office 60 % of available workforce in Kajaran work in the Combine. Kajaran has
around 10 000 inhabitants.3 The “Zangezur Copper-Molybdenum Combine” Ldt owns four tailing
depots.1

The first tailing depot is located in Kajaran town on the right stream of Voghji river (see figure below). It
has designed volume of 3.0 mln m3.1 It has a dam constructed with stone-pudding materials materials with
designed height equal to 60 m and current height equal to 58 m.1 According to the data of March 2012 it
is completely full and conserved.1
Most of the people expressed concern about pollution of air since the dust is blown to the city during
explosions as well as concern about drinking water.6
Analysis of soil samples taken from Kajaran showed that molybdenum exceeded the Maximum
Allowable Concentration by 10.2 times, Nickel 8.2 times, Cobalt 2.6 times and Copper 1.7 times.10 In
addition, mercury was high in vegetables in the boundaries of the city.11

habitats include Syunik, Artsvanik, Ajanan, Chapni, Sevakar, Norashenik villages and Kapan town. 6
These villages have grazing lands, vegetable and tree gardens next the tailing depot.6 The wheat fields of
Artsvanik village are located in close proximity of the depot.6

Villagers from Artsvanik, Syunik and Ajanan have been reporting cancer, diabetes, hypertension,
headaches, cardio-vascular diseases, infertility, diarrhea and general weakness as common health
problems for the communities.6 A young age mortality is detected.6 People also reported air pollution by
dust of the tailing depot due to general wind direction, and pollution of rivers and springs during
accidents.6 Report of the villagers include information about number of fruits and vegetables (such as
cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, etc.) that no longer grow well in these areas.6


Tailing Depots of “Agarak Copper-Molybdenum Combine” Ltd

“Agarak copper-molybdenum combine” has three tailing depots (see figure below).1 The Agarak Copper-
Molybdenum Mine is an open-pit copper-molybdenum deposit that was originally established in 1958.12
It was privatized by a Russian company in 2003.3 The Mine is using conventional methods to dig out the
pit which later is processed at the adjacent processing plant into an end-product of concentrate.12

The construction materials of the dam are sand, clay and mountain rocks.1 The tailing depot has an area of
8.2 hectares.1 Currently it is being used by “Agarak Copper-Molybdenum Combine” Ltd with the used
volume of 3.5 mln m3.1

One of the closest human habitats adjacent to the tailing depots is Agarak town (previous name
Banavan).3 It was founded on the basis of mining activities in 1949.3 The river Araks flows below Agarak
town forming border between Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran. 3 The water from Araks river is
used for irrigation in local agricultural farmlands in Agarak town and other villages downstream.3 The
tailing discharge from the three tailing depots as well as from the waste storage facilities flows into the
river.3 Currently 1000 people from around 1200 households are working in the mine.3

In the frame of Toxic Site Identification Program, in-depth interviews with general population and
healthcare providers revealed that in the past there was a crucial problem with pollution of the irrigation
water.6 As a result, during the recent years the water is being double filtered before it flows to Araks. 6
However, the population is still concerned with the quality of irrigation water since no test have been
implemented.6 The incidence of cancer has risen during the last years, however, there is no evidence to
link this with pollution of heavy metals; Chronic lung diseases and hypertension is among the most
prevalent diseases among people living near mine.6 Local people reported that some fruit trees (e.g.
apricot) no longer grow in this area.6

underground mine, tailing storage facilities, many mining legacy sites belong to the Canadian “Dino Gold
Mining Combinat” Ltd.3

A tailing depot that belongs to “Dino Gold Mining” Ltd is located near Kapan town and is named
“Geghanush”.1 It has a designed capacity of 4.6 mln m3 and by March 2012 the used volume was
estimated to be 2.5 mln m3.1 The designed and current heights of the dam are 56 m and 45 m,
respectively.1 The area of the tailing depot is 12.8 hectares.1 The construction materials of the dam are
stone-pudding materials.1 “Geghanush” is currently active tailing depot.1

The site observation found that the “Geghanush” tailing depot is located in the hills directly next to
Kapan.6 The depot is active with visible borders, at an elevation of 834 meters above sea level. 6
Observations show livestock grazing in adjacent fields.6 During the interviews residents reported that
tomatoes and some fruit trees no longer grow well in their gardens.6


An Abandoned Tailing Depot of the Former “Dastakert Copper-Mining Combinat”
There is a tailing depot located near Dastakert village on Ayriget river (see figure below).1 The designed
capacity was 3.1 mln m3 with used volume of 1.5 mln m3 (by March, 2012).1 The dam has a designed

Health risks and implications associated with heavy metals and mining residues
Although human health, and an area population’s general health, reflects a combination of different factors and
elements, it has been proven that long-term exposure to certain elements may endanger human health and be
linked to serious and life-threatening illnesses. Some elements and compounds may also simply be toxic when
ingested by people or animals. Some such metals and/or elements and their health implications include:

         Cadmium (Cd)—often found in zinc-concentrate after mineral processing; removed at smelter. Lead
          and copper ores may contain small amounts of cadmium. Cd is always a byproduct in smelters.

         Copper (Cu)—mostly found in nature in association with sulfur. Recovered in a multistage process.

         Lead (Pb)—ores occur primarily as sulphides or, nowadays, more commonly in complex associated
          compounds with zinc and small amounts of silver and copper. Usually the lead concentrate is achieved
          by selective flotation. The metal is recovered from the concentrate by smelting.

         Gold (Au)—occurs in native form (free-gold) or is locked in other minerals (pyrite, quartz, etc.). It can
          contain a variable amount of silver in solid solution. Gold-silver tellurides can also be a minor addition
          in commercial gold deposits. The use of cyanide (CN) to leach gold has been a much discussed issue
          in recent years. Due to cyanide’s high toxicity, special attention must be given to the tailings

ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                        60
            management where this process is applied. When exposure occurs (for example, via inhalation or
            ingestion), cyanide interferes with many organisms’ oxygen metabolism and can be lethal in a short
            time. Overall, cyanide can cause three major types of environmental impacts. First, ponds and ditches
            contaminated with cyanide can pose an acute hazard to wildlife and birds. Tailings ponds present
            similar hazards, but less frequently (because of lower cyanide concentrations). Second, spills can cause
            cyanide to reach surface water or groundwater and cause short-term (for example, fish kills) or long-
            term (for example, contamination of drinking water) impacts. Finally, cyanide in active heaps, ponds,
            and in mining wastes—primarily spent ore heaps, dumps, and tailings impoundments—may be
            released and present hazards to surface water or groundwater. Geochemical changes can also affect the
            mobility of heavy metals.


Overall, leached heavy metals and other potential contaminants can reach surface waters. From there they form
sediments that may become a persistent source of toxins and pose a chronic threat to aquatic organisms. In
addition, consuming fish or coming into direct contact with the sediments or drinking water puts human health
at risk. Bioaccumulation of toxic pollutants in aquatic species may limit their use for human consumption.
Accumulation in aquatic organisms, particularly benthic species, can also cause acute and chronic toxicity to
aquatic life.

Table 3 presents the effects of some of these metals on humans, animals, and plants (Vick 1990).

Table 3: Impact of various metals on environment and health

Metal                   Effect
Arsenic (As)            Highly poisonous and possibly carcinogenic in humans. Arsenic poisoning can range from chronic to
                        severe and may be cumulative and lethal.
Cadmium (Cd)            Cadmium is concentrated in tissue and humans can be poisoned by contaminated food, especially fish.
                        Cd may be linked to renal arterial hypertension and can cause violent nausea. Cd accumulates in liver and
                        kidney tissue. It depresses growth of some crops and is accumulated in plant tissue.
Chromium (Cr)           Cr+6 is toxic to humans and can induce skins sensitizations. Human tolerance of Cr+3 has not been
                        determined.
Lead (Pb)               A cumulative body poison in humans and livestock. Humans may suffer acute or chronic toxicity. Young
                        children are especially susceptible.
Mercury (Hg)            Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic, especially to the developing nervous system. The toxicity to
                        humans and other organisms depends on the chemical form, the amount, the pathways of exposure, and
                        the vulnerability of the persons exposed.
Copper (Cu)             Small amounts are considered nontoxic and necessary for human metabolism. However, large doses may
                        induce vomiting or liver damage. Toxic to fish and aquatic life at low levels.
Iron (Fe)               Essentially nontoxic but causes taste problems in water.
Manganese (Mn)          Affects water taste and may stain laundry. Toxic to animals at high concentrations.
Zinc (Zn)               May affect water taste at high levels. Toxic to some plants and fish.

III.       International Best Practices—Legal Requirements and Guidelines

Mining legislation varies across the world, and even in developed countries could be more stringent. Globally,
environmental legislation that deals with mining practices was put into place after a number of operations were
already ongoing and impacting the environment. After that, the environmental requirements needed to be
ensured both in future operations as well as those that are already ongoing. For the purposes of comparison, the
legislation, acts, guidelines, and best available techniques from the United States, Canada, and the European
Union will be reviewed in this chapter, with attention paid to the most environmentally sound provisions of
each. Furthermore, the practices that are promoted under the Environment, Health, and Safety guidelines of the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) are used to additionally supplement the reviewed legislation.

United States Environmental Protection Agency
The United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) of 1976 and Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 define all discarded materials as solid
waste, regardless of whether the material is solid, liquid, or gas. US EPA’s definition of solid waste also
includes materials that are “abandoned,” “recycled,” or “inherently waste-like,” all of which are defined in
separate regulations. The same US EPA legislation was amended in 1980 to require that all extraction and
beneficiation wastes, as well as 20 large-volume mineral-processing wastes, be regulated as nonhazardous
waste. This exception is known as the Bevill Exclusion to RCRA, and has a number of provisions that need to
be met before the waste can be considered under it. The exclusion specifically lists the origins, processing, or
activities from which the waste can be considered. The Bevill exclusion primarily considers the fact that these
wastes are usually generated in very high volumes, and does not consider tailings to be hazardous, though
nonetheless a waste. The US EPA Hardrock Mining Framework offers provisions to predict acid mine
drainage and stability of tailings ponds and dams. Moving down to state levels of environmental management,
certain states tackle mining waste through reclamation programs. Others do so through the water pollution
program, while some states do a combination of both.26

Environment Canada
The Canadian environmental agency, Environment Canada has issued an Environmental Code of Practice for
Metal Mines. The code includes recommended environmental management practices that fully encompass
mitigation of environmental impacts and sound environmental practices in the entire life cycle of a mine. The
code and the recommended practices include items as simple as an Environmental Policy Statement of the
mining company, through starting and implementing an Environmental Management System, through public
participation, emergency planning, monitoring, and adaptive management. The practices are grouped into the
exploration and feasibility, planning and construction, mine operation, and mine closure phases. The mine
closure phase also includes recommendations that go beyond the formal closure date and include monitoring
and site inspections, and as such cover a mine’s full life cycle. A mine’s typical life cycle is shown in Figure
7.

  The following parameters need to be considered when designing TMFs:

           physical and chemical characteristics of the tailings material, including its metal and acidic leaching
            potential;
           hydrology and hydrogeology, including local climate conditions and extreme weather events;
           geology, geotechnical considerations, and seismic data, including seismic risk; and
           topography of the TMF and adjacent areas.


  The code provides guidance on the earliest possible planning and design of the waste rock piles and the tailings
  management facilities (TMF). TMFs are key elements of the environmental management infrastructure at most
  mine sites, especially since at least 90% of the material that is sent for ore processing typically ends up as
  tailings. TMFs include all components and facilities functionally pertaining to tailings management, including
  dams, spillways, decant structures, tailings lines, as well as settling and polishing ponds. Frequently, effluents
  such as mine water and site runoff are directed to the TMF for treatment prior to release into the environment.
  Issues to consider when locating a TMF are shown in Figure 8.

 The code recommends that the most stringent engineering standards are employed for the containment
 structures and monitoring practices, and that TMF design and planning is carried out as early as possible in the
 planning stages. The cost of implementing mine tailings management practices during operation or at a later
 stage of the mine life cycle could have substantially increased costs.

 During the mine’s operation, a different approach is taken for waste rock and tailings. The waste rock is
 regarded as inert waste and stored separately, to be reused at a later time. The main concern with piling the
 waste rock is instability and possible landslides, while its reuse can be facilitated during the gradual filling in
 of the mining areas and reclamation during operation of the mine.

 The waste rock and tailings can also be used for mine backfill, but only if it is determined that the material will
 be suitable for such use. In particular, it must have appropriate structural properties and be determined that the
 chemical alteration of the material will not pose risk to the environment. In the event that potentially acid-
 generating (PAG) materials are used as mine backfill, monitoring measures should be implemented to assess
 impacts of the material on the quality of mine water and to predict potential impacts after mine closure.
 Potential impacts on the groundwater also need to be tracked by carefully planned monitoring programs

 TMFs need to be regularly inspected during mine operations to ensure that the construction and stability
 measures are sound, that the planned and designed measures are implemented, that procedures for dust
 suppression are in place, and that monitoring is regularly conducted, including taking samples and keeping and
 registering data. In addition, the Mining Association of Canada has developed a document titled Developing an
 Operation, Maintenance and Surveillance Manual for Tailings and Water Management Facilities (2011).

A monitoring plan needs to be developed based on the environmental permitting requirements, assumptions
made in the design, and the EIA report. The monitoring plan and monitoring practice need to be conducted in
order to:

          assess the potential of tailings for acid drainage and metal leachate
          make sure predictions made during the planning phase are true
          collect data required for modeling
          assess the level of acid generation
          evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures

          identify possible threats to stability27



European Union Legislation—BREF
The European Waste Catalogue and Hazardous Waste List dedicates its first chapter to the Waste Resulting
from Exploration, Mining, Quarrying, and Physical and Chemical Treatment of Minerals. Under the code of
01 01 01, wastes from mineral metalliferous excavation are considered nonhazardous, as this predominantly
deals with waste rock generated during excavation. However, under section 01 03 04*, acid-generating tailings
from processing of sulphide ore is considered hazardous, and so is 01 03 07* or other wastes containing
dangerous substances from the physical and chemical processing of metalliferous minerals.

A separate directive has been drafted to distinguish wastes from extractive industries from those that are
considered under the Landfill Directive. Directive 2006/21/EC applies to wastes from extraction, treatment and
storage of mineral resources, and working of quarries. This particular extractive waste, as per the directive,
needs to be managed in specialized facilities and in compliance with specific rules. The operators of such
facilities need to obtain a permit prior to operation, which shall set forth the basic parameters of the facility
such as: its location, how its stability is ensured, how pollution prevented, whether it is monitored and
inspected by competent persons, what arrangements are made for its closure, and how land is to be
rehabilitated in the post-closure phase. After closure, the operator needs to stay on site and is responsible for
all monitoring activities for as long as the competent authority considers necessary. This means that all
associated costs are borne by the operator.

Apart from the permit, the operator must also produce a waste management plan that is reviewed every five
years. This plan needs to ensure that waste is reduced or prevented and must encourage recycling and
reclaiming and safe short- and long-term waste disposal. At a minimum the plan must contain a description of
waste and its characterization, the control and monitoring procedures, planned measures for closure and post-
closure, and measures to prevent soil and water pollution. The competent authority must also be satisfied with
the steps taken to evaluate leachate generation, preventing leachate generation, and treating contaminated
water and leachate. The directive also introduces specific measures aimed at limiting cyanide concentrations in
tailings ponds and waste waters. One of the requirements of the directive is that all extractive wastes be
handled in accordance with the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREFs) for Management of
Tailings and Waste Rock in Mining Activities (January 2009).

The BREF document also defines the TMF as a pond, dam, system, backfill, heap, or any other kind of tailings
management. The BREF further proposes that proper design and planning be undertaken early in the mine’s

life cycle. The BREF document is very specific to the countries of the EU, as it first analyzes the metals that
are most pertinent and the mining activities that are the most represented in the EU. The BREF then defines in
detail the types of mining activities and follow up activities for processing, as well as the currently applied
techniques for disposing mine tailings at locations throughout the EU. The techniques that define the core of
the BREF document are first and foremost aimed at preventing or reducing emissions and preventing or
mitigating accidents. As such, good management of tailings and waste rock includes evaluating alternative
options for:

         minimizing the volume of tailings generated in the first place by proper choice of mining method; and
         maximizing opportunities for the alternative use of tailings and waste rock such as in aggregate,
          restoration of mine sites, backfilling, conditioning of mine tailings, and waste rock to minimize any
          environmental or safety hazard.

The most common methods for managing mine tailings and waste rock, as reviewed and defined in the BREF
document, are:

         discarding slurried tailings into ponds
         backfilling tailings or waste rock into underground mines or open pits
         dumping dry tailings onto waste-rock heaps or hill sides
         using the tailings and waste rock as a product for land use, aggregates etc.
         dry stacking thickened tailings
         discarding tailings into surface water or groundwater


Recommendations for TMFs are centered on preventing ARD, accidental bursts and collapses of the ponds or
dams, the contamination of water and soil, and health threats. The BREF document’s recommendations are
very detailed; they include suggestions to start planning and implementing tailings management as early as
possible in a mine’s life cycle, and to include defined technical practices or good operating practices in tailings
management. The best available techniques (BAT) defined in this document is based on reducing reagent
consumption, preventing water erosion, preventing dust generation, developing a water management plan
based on a water balance, applying free water management, and monitoring groundwater around all tailings
and waste rock areas. ARD needs to be first determined and then prevented, controlled, or have treatments
applied. These treatments include adding limestone, hydrated lime, or quicklime to neutralize acids, adding
caustic soda for ARD with high manganese content, or include passive treatment options such as constructed
wetlands, open limestone channels, or diversion wells. A number of sound engineering recommendations are
made for the design of tailings dams to ensure safety and stability. In particular, the BREF includes
recommendations on limiting cyanide use in gold mining. At the end, a number of emerging techniques are
noted in order to raise awareness for any future revisions to the BREF document, as they are only in the R&D
phase.

IFC Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines for Mining
The IFC EHS Guidelines for Mining are a technical reference with general and industry-specific examples of
GIIP. The guidelines are mandatory for all investment projects that the World Bank Group supports, but can
also be a useful document for all other activities in a given sector. For the mining sector, the EHS Guidelines
include industry-specific impacts and their management, performance indicators and monitoring, references,
and additional sources. The guidelines separate management of waste rock dumps and management of tailings.
Recommendations for managing waste rock dumps include:
ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                      66
         to minimize erosion and reduce safety risks, dumps should be planned with appropriate terrace and lift
          height specifications based on the nature of the material and local geotechnical considerations;
         management of PAG wastes should be undertaken as described in the guidance below;
         potential change of geotechnical properties in dumps due to chemical or biologically catalyzed
          weathering should be considered. This can significantly reduce the dumped spoils in grain size and
          mineralogy, resulting in high ratios of clay fraction and a significantly decreased stability towards
          geotechnical failure. These changes in geotechnical properties (notably cohesion, internal angle of
          friction) apply especially to facilities that are not decommissioned with a proper cover system, which
          would prevent precipitation from percolating into the dump’s body. New facilities must be designed so
          as to provide for such potential deterioration of geotechnical properties with higher safety factors.
          Stability/safety assessments of existing facilities should take these potential changes into account.

The guidelines acknowledge that the tailings management strategies vary according to site and nature/type of
tailings, but that the general impacts include groundwater and surface water contamination, ARD and metals
leaching, sedimentation of drainage networks, dust generation, and the potential for geotechnical hazards
associated with the selected management option. The guidelines suggest that the management of tailings needs
to include not only operation aspects, but permanent or long-term storage requirements, too. Strategies should
consider the site topography, downstream receptors, and the physical nature of tailings (for example, projected
volume, grain size distribution, density, water content, among other issues). Apart from leach-pad waste and
geochemical mapping of the tailings, the recommended tailings management strategies include:

         design, operation, and maintenance of structures according to specifications of ICOLD3 and
          ANCOLD4, or other internationally recognized standards based on a risk assessment strategy.
          Appropriate independent review should be undertaken at design and construction stages, with ongoing
          monitoring of both the physical structure and water quality during operation and decommissioning;
         where structures are located in areas at risk for high seismic loadings, the independent review should
          include a check on the maximum design earthquake assumptions and the structure’s stability to ensure
          there will be no uncontrolled release of tailings during seismic events;
         tailings storage facility design should take into account the specific risks/hazards associated with
          geotechnical stability or hydraulic failure and the associated risks to downstream economic assets,
          ecosystems, and human health and safety. Environmental considerations should thus also consider
          emergency preparedness and response planning and containment/mitigation measures in case of
          catastrophic release of tailings or supernatant waters;
         any diversion drains, ditches, and stream channels to divert water from surrounding catchment areas
          away from the tailings structure should be built to the flood event recurrence interval standards
          outlined elsewhere in this section;
         seepage management and related stability analysis should be a key consideration in design and
          operation of tailings storage facilities. This is likely to require a specific piezometer-based monitoring
          system for seepage water levels within the structure wall and downstream of it, which should be
          maintained throughout its life cycle;
         consideration of zero discharge tailings facilities and completion of a full water balance and risk
          assessment for the mine process circuit, including storage reservoirs and tailings dams. The use of
          natural or synthetic liners should be considered to minimize risks;
         design specification should take into consideration the probable maximum flood event and the required
          freeboard to safely contain it (depending on site-specific risks) across the planned life of the tailings
          dam, including its decommissioned phase;


ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                       67
         where potential liquefaction risks exist, including risks associated with seismic behavior, the design
          specification should take into consideration the maximum design earthquake;
         on-land disposal in a system that can isolate acid leachate-generating material from oxidation or
          percolating water, such as a tailings impoundment with dam and subsequent dewatering and capping.
          On-land disposal alternatives should be designed, constructed, and operated according to
          internationally recognized geotechnical safety standards;
         thickening or formation of paste for backfilling of pits and underground workings during mine
          progression. Riverine (for example, rivers, lakes, and lagoons) or shallow marine tailings disposal is
          not considered good international industry practice; nor is riverine dredging, which requires riverine
          tailings disposal. Deep-sea tailings placement (DSTP) may be considered as an alternative only in the
          absence of an environmentally and socially sound land-based alternative, and based on an independent
          scientific impact assessment. If and when DSTP is considered, such consideration should be based on
          detailed feasibility and environmental and social impact assessment of all tailings management
          alternatives, and only if the impact assessment demonstrates that the discharge is not likely to have
          significant adverse effects on marine and coastal resources, or on local communities.

IV.       International Best Practices—Technology, Development, and Practice

In order to keep track of the best available technologies, R&D, as well as practical approaches to
environmental and social sustainability, it is common to follow available data and information, but also to take
part in a number of international organizations and cooperation platforms that could help share experiences and
link the less developed mining countries and corporations with more developed and sustainable ones. For
example, the EU has the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials (EIP-RM) and the European
Technology Platform on Sustainable Minerals (ETP-SMR). In addition, the Network on the Industrial
Handling of Raw Materials for European Industries (ERA-MIN) and the European Institute of Innovation and
Technology, Knowledge and Innovation Communities (EIT KIC) can also be helpful platforms. One of the key
international initiatives is the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, membership in which is one of the
recommendations of the first thematic paper in this series and which directly feeds into the conclusions and
recommendations made by this paper.

In Finland, within the Sustainability Action Plan, one of the greatest potentials for recycling is found in the
waste rock heaps from mines and natural stone quarries, and the ever-growing and developing recycling
industry needs to keep this waste stream in mind. The only issue remains with the cost-effective recovery of
small quantities of metals in the rock heaps and further development of such technologies. In Romania, the
mine closure and rehabilitation works are subject to monitoring of technical solutions meant to ensure
environmental protection. The coordinating engineers, residents, and the rest of the staff monitor all aspects
and in line with FIDIC provisions on behalf of the beneficiary. The designer of the mine closure and
environmental rehabilitation works is obliged to monitor from a technical point of view how the approved
solutions are put into practice. Following closure, the line ministry allocates funds for each mining site to be
monitored for environmental issues and works completion. These also include monitoring for erosion and
landslides, sampling groundwater and gas samples beyond the tailings dams, monitoring soil quality,
monitoring tailings depots, and so on. The monitoring phase is concluded with a report on the field
observations and findings.

Good practice and sustainable environment techniques common to the analyzed legislative and practical
requirements or guidelines from the U.S., Canada, the EU, and the international IFC Guidelines include:

         life cycle assessment and planning of a mine
         early planning of all stages, including mine closure
         TMFs
         siting, design, and stability of a tailings dam
         prevention or control of ARD
         water control management
         improved cyanide control
         post-closure monitoring and follow up




ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                    69
Life cycle of the mine and rehabilitation
Mining represents a transient land use, and the aspiration should always be to restore land used for mining to
some “productive” use. In broad terms, rehabilitation refers to the measures undertaken to return land on which
mining has taken place to the agreed post-closure uses. Implicitly, this requires that rehabilitation measures are
not undermined in the longer term by residual pollution (such as the presence of toxins in soils used for
revegetation or of ARD). Proper mine closure should:

         include operational waste management planning, which includes overburden rock, tailings, and toxic
          materials (such as cyanide);
         include mine tailings sites rehabilitation or proper management and monitoring;
         involve local community and various stakeholders;
         start as early as possible in the process of mine development; and
         account for management of all types of waste, including potential sludge that may be generated from
          treating acidic drainage with lime in order to neutralize acidic conditions. In some cases, the volume of
          the sludge may exceed the volume of tailings. These sludges may also release additional metals.

Planning of mine closure and tailings management
Effective closure planning involves bringing together the views, concerns, aspirations, efforts, and knowledge
of various internal and external stakeholders to achieve outcomes that are beneficial to the operating company
and its host community. One of the most beneficial recommendations to the mining company and also to the
regulatory agencies is to have the mine closure and also waste management planning decided and developed
early in the mining operation. The process should be open and conducted in cooperation with the local
community. Overall planning and initial siting should be guided by the concerns of the population, and the
protection and integration of biodiversity. Mine closure activities should address the following environmental
aspects:

                   underground and open pit mine workings;
                   ore-processing facilities and site infrastructure;
                   waste rock piles and TMFs;
                   sludge disposal areas, as well as ongoing sludge disposal requirements post-closure;
                   water management facilities;
                   landfill and waste disposal facilities; and
                   exploration areas.



The planning for mine closure is depicted in Figure 9 throughout the mining development phases.

The concept of continuous closure planning is not the same as concurrent rehabilitation. The former is a
process that extends throughout the life of the mine. The latter is only one part of the closure planning process
that is usually accounted to operations only. Table 4 presents a summary of components to be addressed in the
mine closure plan.

Tailings management facilities
In order to better manage tailings that are a byproduct of mining, a TMF or a tailings storage facility (TSF)
should be established in lieu of the tailings depots or dumps. Based on the European Commission BAT
document, the following tailings characteristics will need to be established in order to facilitate a tailings
storage facility’s design requirements:

            chemical composition (including changes to chemistry through mineral processing) and its ability to
             oxidize and mobilize metals
            physical composition and stability (static and seismic loading)
            behavior under pressure and consolidation rates
            erosion stability (wind and water)
            settling, drying time, and densification behavior after deposition
            hard pan behavior (for example, crust formation on top of the tailings)

The engineering characteristics of tailings are in most instances influenced by the degree of thickening and the
method of deposition. It is therefore essential that while investigating the properties of tailings that the physical
characteristics and material parameters (for example, beach slope angles, particle size segregation, water
recovery) that can occur as a result of varied deposition techniques be identified (SANS 1998). This is
particularly true when considering high density tailings disposal and its associated transportation and
deposition challengers.

Once the potential site specific parameters (for example, environmental, social, geotechnical, cost) and the
characteristics of the tailings and their behavior upon deposition are determined, the process of deciding a
suitable storage method can begin.

ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                                     72
A number of technological or design solutions can be included in the TSF design to minimize the facility’s
environmental impact. For example, tailings that have a potential to generate acid 28 can be controlled by
preventing or minimizing oxygen and water from contacting the material, as well as ensuring that an adequate
amount of natural or introduced material is available to neutralize the acid produced. Oxygen and water contact
can be controlled through techniques such as subaqueous disposal, covers, waste blending, hydrologic controls,
bacterial control, and treatment.

Impounding slurry tailings is one of the most common methods for the disposal or storage of mine tailings.
Impoundment is largely favored due to the low economic costs and the fact that they are relatively easy to
operate. If properly designed, the impoundments can be developed to perform a number of functions:

         remove suspended solids by sedimentation
         precipitate heavy metals as hydroxides
         permanently contain settled tailings
         equalize wastewater quality
         stabilize some oxidizable constituents (thiosalts, cyanides, flotation reagents)
         manage water, including runoff and recycled water from the process29

However, tailings impoundments have a number of disadvantages that require attention in design, such as:

         difficulty in achieving good flow distribution
         difficulty in segregating drainage from uncontaminated areas
         difficulty in reclamation, particularly with acid-generating tailings, because of the large surface area
          and materials characteristics
         inconsistent treatment performance due to seasonal variations in bio-oxidation efficiency
         costly and difficult collection and treatment of seepage through impoundment structures
         potentially serious wind dispersion of fine materials unless the surface is stabilized by revegetation,
          chemical binders, or rock cover

Siting of a tailings management facility
Once the site screening criteria of mill or mine location, topography, and hydrology have been conducted, the
number of siting options is usually considerably reduced. Geologic considerations then assume a critical role.
In particular, site geology affects the foundation of the embankment, seepage rates, and the availability of
borrow materials for embankment construction. Soft foundations, for example, may limit the allowable rate of
embankment build-up in order to allow for adequate pore pressure dissipation. Sloping foundations and the
presence of weak layers will need to be investigated, since these may contribute to slope failure of the
embankment.

Although geologic details are critical to siting and design, they often play a secondary role in actual siting
decisions. This is because there are usually a limited number of sites available at this stage (the rest having

28
   Acid generation prediction tests are increasingly relied on to assess the long-term potential of a material, or waste, to generate
acid. Mineralogy and other factors affecting the potential for AMD formation are highly variable from site to site, which can result in
difficult, costly, and questionable predictions. In general, methods used to predict the acid-generation potential are classified as
either static or kinetic. These tests are not intended to predict the rate of acid generation, only the potential to produce acid. Static
tests can be conducted quickly and are inexpensive compared with kinetic tests. Kinetic tests are intended to mimic the processes
found in the waste unit environment, usually at an accelerated rate. These tests require more time and are much more expensive
than static tests.

ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                                           73
been eliminated by considering mill location, topography, and hydrology). In addition, the lack of detailed
information often precludes any meaningful comparisons of alternative sites. The tendency is to try to engineer
around any geologic problems. If, following the site investigation, a "fatal" geologic problem is discovered, the
site must be abandoned at that time. The search will then continue for one or more suitable sites.

Groundwater conditions are usually related to geology, and also affect siting conditions. A high water table
limits the amount of dry borrow material available for construction, and shortens the distance for seepage to
enter the groundwater system. In addition, shallow groundwater can infiltrate tailings and increase the amount
of water in the impoundment.

Initially, various observations and assessments can assess broad geologic factors, including the availability of
construction materials, special construction problems with respect to nearby structures, drainage conditions at
the site, and apparent ground stability of the site (such as slumping, evidence of weak planes within the rock,
faulting, etc.). An area’s vegetation can indicate subsoil characteristics. Test pits and trenches may be dug and
test holes may be drilled to obtain soil and/or rock samples. In situ permeability tests also may be run in holes
drilled at the site of the proposed tailings impoundment area.

A proposed site will undergo a geotechnical site investigation. The investigation will assess site geology,
including the depth, thickness, continuity, and composition of the strata; site hydrogeology; geotechnical
properties of soil and rock affecting design; and availability of suitable construction materials for building
dams, dikes, drains, and impervious liners.

Design and stability of a tailings management facility or tailings dam
A very significant concern regarding tailings dams involves stability, and therefore the environmental
performance of such sites. The risk of seismic activity, earthquakes, erosion, or simply any natural or
manmade event that may lead to the tailings impoundment’s collapse may cause substantial and irreversible
environmental damages. The stability concerns arise from the materials used for tailings dams or embankments
and the fact that a certain amount of seepage is usually necessary to keep the embankments stable.

The impoundments or tailings dams need to be clearly marked, fenced, and guarded, with adequate provisions
to minimize seepage and drainage, and with appropriate water and dust management and monitoring in place.
The most stringent requirement in design is stability.

Prevention or control of acid rock drainage
The first step in planning disposal and storage of waste rock or overburden and tailings is to establish the risks
of metal and acid leaching drainage, and then develop design and siting of the waste rock piles and TMFs. In
the event of potential acid leaching, one of the most commonly used disposal methods is the subaqueous
disposal, which helps avoid oxidation reactions and therefore acidic generation. Such disposal would require
tailings dam facilities to be properly designed. Stability and accidental events management must be carefully
considered, and under no circumstances should tailings be disposed in water bodies, but rather a layer of water
must be present on the tailings. If it is impossible to prevent acidic drainage, several methods may be used
alone or in combination to control or limit it. These include:

         dry covers consisting of alternating layers of material of different porosity to limit water infiltration
         dry covers using innovative materials, such as sewage sludge stabilized by lime or sludge from pulp
          and paper mills
         impermeable geo-membrane liners to prevent infiltration of acidic drainage into underlying materials

ARMENIA – Enhancing Environmental and Social Sustainability of Mining                                      74
          waste rock or tailings maintained in a frozen state (in permafrost areas)
          direct addition of lime or other alkaline substances
          raising the water table to inhibit acid generation of materials disposed of below the water table
          use of tailings as mine backfill, or disposing of tailings in mined-out open pits30

Water control and management
One of the most significant aspects of tailings impoundment design and operations, as well as environmental
concern, is water management and control. Water disposed of in the impoundment, as well as the collected
atmospheric precipitation, play an important role in leaching. They spread contamination from the site, but also
play the most significant role in the stability and failure of the impoundments or embankments. Leaching
various constituents from the mining tailings, including acid, degrades the quality of the surrounding soil,
groundwater, and surface water. Containing seepage that would fully control water in impoundments is
considered to be “an elusive goal” (Vick 1990).

Looking at a mining impoundment in a strict mass-balance approach, the inflows would include precipitation
and process water, while the outflows from the impoundment would include overflows, evaporation, water
recycling, and seepage. Overflow is directly related to the dam’s storage capacity and precipitation volume.
Evaporation rates are a function of the climate and surface area of the pond and saturated tailings, while the
amount of water recycled back into the impoundment or the transport system depends on the operation’s
capacity and needs. Seepage can leave the containment as groundwater or seep from under the embankment.

In general, the inflow plus the storage available has to equal the outflow from the dam. The maximum storage
occurs when the inflow equals the outflow.

The principal methods for controlling run-on are catch basins and check dams, and diversion ditches (channels
and pipes). Catch basins stop surface water from entering the tailings impoundment area but generally require
some method of bypassing the tailings impoundment, such as decant systems or diversion ditches. Catch basins
may be expensive because of labor and fill material, but can be cost-effective for small runoff volumes. It may
not be necessary to treat the water, because the water never enters the tailings impoundment itself.

Improved cyanide regulations
In the IFC EHS on mining’s section on cyanide, it is stated that the use of cyanide should comply and be
consistent with the principles and standards of practice of the International Cyanide Management Code. This
code includes principles and standards applicable to cyanide purchase (sourcing), transport, handling, storage,
use, facilities decommissioning, worker safety, emergency response, training, and public
consultation/disclosure. The code is a voluntary industry program developed through multi-stakeholder
dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and administered by the
International Cyanide Management Institute.

The country-specific regulations targeting cyanide use should also address the design of facilities that use
cyanide (requiring or recommending liners and site preparation for heap leach piles or tailings impoundments);
operational concerns (monitoring of solutions in processes and in ponds, treatment of cyanide-containing
wastes); and closure/reclamation requirements (rinsing to a set cyanide concentration in rinsate, before
reclamation can begin). Operators are generally required to take steps either to reduce/eliminate access to
cyanide solutions or to reduce cyanide concentrations in exposed materials to below lethal levels. Regulatory

requirements and guidelines for the allowable concentration of cyanide in exposed process solutions are widely
variable (when numeric limitations are established, they generally range around 50 mg/l), as are the means by
which operators comply. Operators reduce access in several ways, including covering solution ponds with
netting or covers, using cannons and other hazing devices (for example, decoy owls) to scare off waterfowl and
other wildlife, and/or installing fencing to preclude access by large wildlife.31

Post-closure monitoring and follow up
A proper mine closure and tailings rehabilitation or management plan needs to include adequate monitoring
procedures. The monitoring system should be able to monitor the environmental impacts that are associated
with a given operation and also detect whether pollution containment methods are effective. The monitoring
plan needs to include the parameters to be monitored, the procedure by which they will be monitored, legally
prescribed thresholds, and most importantly, baseline conditions against which all monitoring results will be
compared. The environmental monitoring will rely more on sampling and testing, while socioeconomic
monitoring will be more qualitative.

Mine closure costs
Proper mine closure needs to account for the associated costs, which need to be reevaluated throughout the
planning stages and adjusted accordingly. The funds also need to be made available either through guarantees
or funds established for such purposes. Since the establishment of such funds can be mandated very early in
the mine development stage, it is necessary to review the applicability and costs associated with the available
funds. The mine owner/operator should ensure that adequate funds are available to cover all closure costs, and
the amounts of any security deposits should be adjusted accordingly.

Cost estimating, from prefeasibility through to construction, should be owned at the project or site level, with
projected expenditures being factored into annual operating activities. As a closure plan evolves, it should have
ownership at the site level, both technically and financially (versus simply higher level accounting entry). Such
ownership can spur more accountability for accurate estimates. At the conceptual stage, the closure costs are
expected to be broad estimates only. The earlier that risks and unknowns are reduced, the greater the potential
for meeting specific objectives. This is one reason that planning for closure should begin at the earliest
opportunity.

 V.       General Guidelines for Environmentally and Socially Sound Management
          of Mine Tailings

The purpose of this section of the paper is to provide sufficient information on the key environmental and
social concerns as related to the management of mine tailings and the current practices in Armenia. Based on
the current practices and on the Mining Code (2011) the mine tailings are considered as a “manmade mine”
and can become a secondary source of valuable minerals upon further processing. This process of “recycling”
and promoting high-efficiency use of natural resources is rather encouraging. However, first and foremost a
final time frame needs to be established, by when such attempts at reprocessing will be carried out, so that the
tailings are not stored permanently and indefinitely.
Furthermore, one of the key constraints is the lack of sufficiently advanced processing techniques, which
would help balance the economic aspects and associated costs with the potential mineral gains and extraction
from the tailings. As such, the tailings can be stored on- or off-site for a long period of time, exposed to the
natural elements, which can lead to the spread of a number of hazardous or potentially hazardous constituents.
As a result, improperly managed tailings piles or ponds present a direct threat to human health and the
environment, but can also have other far-reaching impacts.


Overall recommendation: establish sound environmental management of tailings facilities or
depots

The overall recommendation of this paper is to ensure sound environmental management of mine tailings
depots, ponds, or simply TMFs, coupled with regular and thorough monitoring practices that would be
established and carried out for the mine’s lifetime by the operator. After closure, monitoring and supervision
would be conducted by the regulating agencies (ministries) to ensure minimal if any environmental impact as
the tailings await processing. The associated costs and responsibilities need to be defined in the mining rights
contracts, as included in the pertinent legislation.

A great step in this direction has already been taken through the general provisions of the Mining Code, as well
as the supplemental secondary legislation, such as the RA Government Decree from January 2013 on
establishing monitoring procedures for the area of mining operations and tailings dams in particular to ensure
safety and health of the population of the neighboring communities. In addition, with the assistance of GEF, a
framework for surveying the mining areas and establishing a monitoring framework is also going to be
pursued.

Within the guidelines that supplement the Mining Code, as well as the Operational Manual drafted by the
Ministry of Nature Protection in 2011 on secure management of tailings in Armenia, the legislative framework
may be close to complete. The next steps should include: (i) establishing implementation of such guidelines in
the field and enforcement, (ii) obtaining monitoring results (set of established values over an established period
of time) that would be publically disclosed and (iii) differentiating the approach for new mining developments
as opposed to the legacy pollution sites, abandoned mines, or old operational mines that have been privatized.

Develop mine tailings facility or depot registry

The data made available from the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources needs to be continuously updated
and revised to reflect the situation on the ground. The existing sites need to be adequately assessed and
reviewed based on the existing environmental impacts. Future mines need to incorporate sound tailings
management practices in their EIAs and ensure that such sites/facilities are properly monitored. Baseline data
for any new development is an essential requirement, against which all subsequent monitoring measurements
will be conducted. The information for existing, new, and yet-to-be-developed tailings facilities will be
combined into one registry that will be equally managed and reviewed by the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources and the Ministry of Nature Protection. The first ministry needs to ensure adequate treatment of the
potential secondary resource, while the second ministry needs to be involved to ensure minimal if any
associated environmental impacts, as proven by the monitoring results.

Among the key elements for developing this registry is (a) to adequately staff and delegate responsibility in the
ministries; (b) establish presence in the field, coupled with on-site assessments, documentation preparation,
quantities estimates, and clear delineation of locations using GPS coordinates; and (c) provide expert
assessment of the major environmental issues and potential risks associated with the tailings depots. Based on
this information, a mine-specific Tailings Management Framework will be developed. Figure 10 shows the
application of such a framework through the life cycle of a mine. The framework needs to be somewhat
adjusted for the already existing and non-managed mine tailings facilities.

Ensure implementation of monitoring plans and develop remediation plans for existing
facilities

Based on the registry of mine tailings facilities or depots, a number of remediation actions can be proposed.
These should have the goal of properly managing the mine tailings facility and decreasing its environmental
impact, as well as mitigating any environmental damages that have already been sustained. The monitoring
needs to be made subject to public disclosure and be regularly updated. A lack of current information can serve
as a red flag to make sure monitoring is being conducted and that the results are satisfactory.


Obviously, management of mine tailings is the most important segment of any mining operation. Throughout
this paper a number of recommendations have been made but mostly related to implementing measures and
legal requirements from day one of planning a mining operation. The situation in Armenia is more complex, as
a number of mines have been operational for a long time, and have started operating prior to any
environmental requirements were in place. Some of these old mines have attracted foreign investors and have
expanded their operations. Even if the tailings from current operations are managed in the most
environmentally sound approach, the historic tailings still remain. Any approach to be taken towards
environmentally sustainable management of mine tailings needs to include both, the new mining developments
and the legacy sites. The legacy sites, due to different ownership issues and the associated clean-up costs may
present a more long-term priority, while setting up new mining developments on a sound and sustainable base
is a key priority that the Government of Armenia has started to address.
