                        In today’s globalized environments, companies are
                        facing challenges and competition in global market
                        place. Thus, the role of good corporate governance has
                        become more important.
                        By strengthening the role and the responsibilities of
                        their boards, increasing the amount and quality of
                        disclosure and enhancing accountability of corporate
                        executives, good corporate governance helps companies
                        formalize business and decision making processes and
                        establish the appropriate checks and balances. This, in
                        turn, improves performance and builds trust between
                        businesses and investors, employees, clients and the
                        community as a whole.
                        IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, advocates
                        and promotes good corporate governance practices
                        in any market where it operates by helping its clients
                        and partners address key challenges and achieve
                        impactful results. In Indonesia, IFC set up a Corporate
                        Governance Program in Indonesia in 2012 with the
                        aim of improving market standards and creating an
Sarvesh Suri            environment conducive to transparent, accountable and
IFC, Country Manager,   responsible practices.
Indonesia
                        As part of this Program, IFC has established a formal
                        cooperation with Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK). A
                        key product of this cooperation between IFC and
                        OJK is the development of this Indonesia Corporate
                        Governance Manual, which serves as a learning
                        instrument to benchmark existing standards and
                        practices in Indonesia with internationally recognized
                        best practices.
                        In this respect, this Corporate Governance Manual
                        should be considered as a major tool for Corporate
                        Governance in Indonesia as it targets a wide spectrum



                                     iii
of stakeholders, such as directors and commissioners, academics, policymakers,
corporate governance experts and more generally, individuals and institutions
interested to know about the corporate governance framework in Indonesia.
IFC is happy to be part of this initiative with OJK and remains committed to helping
raise governance standards across the market and contribute to a sustainable private
sector in Indonesia.

                       Indonesia has experienced financial crisis in 1997/1998
                       in which one of the causes of the crisis is the weak
                       implementation of corporate governance. We have
                       also learnt that recent global financial crisis is due to
                       poor corporate governance practices. Thus, the need
                       for developing and improving corporate governance, in
                       compliance with national regulations and in alignment
                       with international best practices, is unavoidable.

                       Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK) is
                       committed to promote corporate governance practices
                       in Indonesia as part of financial stability efforts.
                       Therefore, OJK highly appreciates the initiative of IFC
                       in developing the Indonesia Corporate Governance
                       Manual for companies in Indonesia.

                       OJK believes that the Indonesia Corporate Governance
                       Manual will benefit to all companies in Indonesia in
                       developing their robust corporate governance practices.
                       Through the manual, company could benchmark its
                       current governance implementation with best practices
Muliaman D. Hadad      and identify the weaknesses that may contribute
Chairman of            to a company’s financial vulnerability and make
the Board of           improvement accordingly. The improvement may cover
Commissioners of OJK   the role of the Board of Commissioners, the role of
                       the Board of Directors, shareholder rights, material
                       corporate transaction, disclosure and transparency, and
                       internal control.

                       As Indonesia will enter the Asian Economic
                       Community, it is inevitable that Indonesian company
                       should improve its corporate governance practices that
                       benchmarked on international best practices to improve




                                    v
its competitiveness. These will increase investor confidence, reduce the cost of capital,
and create sustainable company performance.

OJK hopes that the Indonesia Corporate Governance Manual will serve as a
cornerstone for the implementation of good corporate governance in Indonesia
so as to create conducive, stable and attractive financial sector which contribute to
sustainable economic growth.

An Introduction To Corporate Governance        28                              The Chairman’s Checklist
Corporate governance has become a familiar and increasingly popular term in
Indonesia. With the introduction of ICL 19952, the role of the private sector in
economic development and job creation in Indonesia began to accelerate. The
following two decades brought increasingly sophisticated domestic production,
private enterprise growth and increased global competition. The downside to these
developments has been the occurrence of major corporate scandals. While various
domestic and international efforts have made corporate governance a household
name, few Indonesian companies appear to truly appreciate the depth and
complexity of this topic.
Indeed, corporate governance reforms are often introduced superficially and used as
a public relations exercise, rather than as a tool to introduce the internal structures
and processes that enable a company to hold the trust of its shareholders, increase
the company’s ability to access capital and reduce vulnerability to financial crises.
But to successfully introduce these structures and processes, a company must fully
and continually commit to the principles of fairness, transparency, accountability
and responsibility.
This chapter defines corporate governance, makes a business case for its
implementation, and provides an overview of the legal, regulatory and institutional
frameworks for corporate governance in Indonesia today.

A.	           Corporate Governance Explained

1.	 Defining Corporate Governance
There is no single definition of corporate governance that can be applied to all
situations and jurisdictions. The various definitions that exist today largely depend on
the institution or author, country and legal tradition.
IFC defines corporate governance as “the structures and processes for the direction and
control of companies.” The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), which in 1999 published its Principles of Corporate Governance, offers a
more detailed definition of corporate governance as:
       “The internal means by which corporations are operated and controlled […], which involve
       a set of relationships between a company’s management, its board, its shareholders and other
       stakeholders. Corporate governance also provides the structure through which the objectives of
       the company are set, and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance
       are determined. Good corporate governance should provide proper incentives for the board and
       management to pursue objectives that are in the interests of the company and shareholders,
       and should facilitate effective monitoring, thereby encouraging firms to use resources more
       efficiently.”3

Most definitions that center on the company itself (an internal perspective) do, however,
have certain elements in common, which can be summarized as follows:
     •	 Corporate governance is a system of relationships, defined
        by structures and processes: For example, the relationship between
        shareholders,management and stakeholder(s) that consists of the relationship
        between the capital provider, stakeholder (s) and the management to achieve
        certain rate of return and profit on their (shareholders’) investment. Board of
        Directors in turn are to provide shareholders with financial and operational
        reports on a regular basis and in a transparent manner. Shareholders also elect a
        supervisory body, often referred to as the Board of Commissioners, to represent
        their interests. This company organ essentially provides strategic direction to, and
        control over the company’s Board of Directors. Board of Directors are accountable
        to this Board of Commissioners, which in turn is accountable to shareholders

       through the General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS). The structures and
       processes that define these relationships typically center on various management
       performance and reporting mechanisms.
     •	 These relationships may involve parties with different and sometimes
        contrasting interests: Differing interests may exist between the organ of the
        company, i.e. the GMS, the Board of Directors, and/or Board of Commissioner
        (or other executive bodies). Contrasting interests exist most typically between
        owners and Board of Directors, and are commonly referred to as the principal-
        agent problem.4 Conflicts may also exist within each governing organ, such as
        between shareholders (majority vs. minority, controlling vs. non-controlling,
        individual vs. institutional) and Company’s Organ (executive vs. non-executive,
        outsiders. inside, independent vs. dependent). Each of these contrasting interests
        needs to be carefully observed and balanced.
     •	 All parties are involved in the direction and control of the company:
        The GMS, representing shareholders, takes fundamental decisions, for example
        the distribution of profits. The Board of Commissioner is generally responsible
        for guidance and oversight, accepting company strategy and controlling the
        Board of Director. Board of Director, finally, run the day-to-day operations, such
        as implementing strategy, drafting business plans, managing human resources,
        developing marketing and sales strategies, and managing asset.
     •	 All this is done to properly distribute rights and responsibilities—and
        thus increase long-term shareholder value: For example, how outside,
        minority shareholders can prevent a controlling shareholder from gaining benefits
        through related party transactions, tunneling or similar means.5




4	   The principal-agent problem is defined as follows by the Oxford Dictionary of Economics: “The problem
     of how Person (A) can motivate Person (B) to act for (A’s) benefit rather than following his self-interest.”
     In a company setting, Person (A) is the investor (or principal) and (B) the manager (or agent). Managers
     at times may follow different goals than investors (e.g. building business empires rather than creating
     shareholder value), act dishonestly and, at times, even in an incompetent manner. This essentially creates
     three types of agency costs: (i) divergence costs (i.e. managers that do not maximize the investors’ wealth);
     (ii) monitoring costs (investors have to develop and implement control structures), including replacement
     costs; and (iii) incentive costs (costs incurred by investors to remunerate and incentivize their managers).
     The core role of a corporate governance system is to reduce total agency costs, thus maximizing the value
     of the company to investors.

The external aspect of corporate governance, on the other hand, concentrates on
relationships between the company and its stakeholders. Stakeholders are those
individuals or institutions that have an interest in the company. Such an interest may
arise through legislation or contract, or by way of social or geographic relationships.
Stakeholders include investors, but also employees, creditors, suppliers, consumers,
regulatory bodies and state agencies, and the local community in which a company
operates. Some commentators also include consideration of the environment as an
important entry on the list of stakeholders.


2.	 The Role of Stakeholders
Many international codes, including the OECD Principles, discuss the role of
stakeholders in the governance process. The role of stakeholders in governance has been
debated in the past, with some arguing that stakeholders have no claim on the company
other than those specifically set forth in law or contract. Others have argued that
companies fulfill an important social function, have a societal impact and, accordingly,
must act in the broad interests of society. This view recognizes that companies should, at
times, act at the expense of shareholders. Interestingly, there is a consensus that modern

companies cannot effectively conduct their businesses while ignoring the concerns of
stakeholder groups. However, there is also agreement that companies which consistently
place other stakeholder interests before those of shareholders cannot remain competitive
over the long run.




                                                                  Best Practices

       A key aspect of corporate governance is ensuring the flow of external
       capital to firms. Corporate governance is also concerned with finding
       ways to encourage stakeholders to undertake socially efficient levels of
       investment in firm-specific human and physical capital. The competitiveness
       and ultimate success of a corporation is the result of teamwork that
       embodies contributions from a range of resource providers including
       investors, employees, creditors and suppliers. Corporations should
       recognize that stakeholders’ contributions constitute a valuable resource
       for building competitive and profitable companies. It is, therefore, in the
       long-term interest of corporations to foster wealth-creating co-operation
       among stakeholders. The governance framework should acknowledge that
       the interests of the corporation are served by recognizing the interests
       of stakeholders and their contribution to the long-term success of the
       corporation. Therefore, it is in the interest of the company to stimulate
       productive co-operation with the stakeholders, establish a governance
       framework to acknowledge the existence of these interests and recognize
       their importance for the long-term success of the company.




3.	 A Brief History of Corporate Governance
Corporate governance systems have evolved over centuries, often in response to
corporate failures or systemic crises. The first well-documented failure of governance
was the South Sea Bubble in the 1700s, which revolutionized business laws and practices
in England. Similarly, much of the securities law in the U.S. was put in place following
the stock market crash of 1929. There has been no shortage of other crises, such as the
secondary banking crisis of the 1970s in the U.K., the U.S. savings and loan debacle
of the 1980s, the 1998 financial crisis in Russia, the 1997-1998 financial crisis in Asia



An Introduction To Corporate Governance    33                      Corporate Governance Explained
(especially in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand) and the current global financial
crisis which started in 2008 and has not shown signs of ending at the time of this book.
The history of corporate governance has also been punctuated by a series of well-
known company failures. The early 1990s saw the Maxwell Group raid the pension fund
of the Mirror Group of newspapers and witnessed the collapse of Barings Bank. The
new century likewise opened with a bang, with the spectacular collapse of Enron in the
U.S., the near-bankruptcy of Vivendi Universal in France, the scandal at Parmalat in
Italy, the trading fraud which hit Société Générale and the most recent Madoff multi-
billion dollar ponzi scheme, make other scandals pale in comparison. Each of these
corporate failures, often occurring as a result of incompetence or outright fraud, was
swiftly met by new governance frameworks, most notably the many national corporate
governance codes, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the current trend towards imposing
stricter regulatory oversight on banking and financial activities in various countries.
In Indonesia, the financial crisis in 1997-1998 has had dramatic social, economic and
political effects. That event brought the Rupiah down by almost 80% and dramatically
increased poverty. As noted by Furman and Stiglitz:” The depth of the collapse in
Indonesia, if not unparalleled, is among the largest peacetime contractions since at
least 1960, excluding the experience of the transition economies”6. According to several
experts, the recession in Indonesia was fuelled by many institutional weaknesses, among
which the lack or inadequate enforcement of the central bank’s regulations along with
irregular banking practices and the extremely poor financial regulation7.
Since then, it is fair to say that, although there is still plenty of room for improvement,
the awareness, enthusiasm as well as legal and regulatory framework on corporate
governance in Indonesia has changed and improved dramatically in recent years.
Indonesia had done a lot of initiatives and efforts to implement good corporate
governance, both from government side as well as private. Those initiatives and efforts
include establishment of corporate governance institutions, adoption of new laws and
amendments of existing ones to support corporate governance implementation process
in the country. More specifically, Indonesia has taken several steps towards improving
corporate governance standards and enhancing legislation. A national committee for
Good Corporate Governance has been established in 1999 under the supervision of
the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs and issued the first Indonesia’s Code

of Good Corporate Governance in 2001, which was then amended in 20068. The
Capital Market and Financial Institutions Supervisory Body (currently has merged into
OJK)9 has continued to introduce and amend its regulation and enforced them, which
resulted in improved investors’ protection. Corporate governance rules for banks were
introduced in 2006 and Bank Indonesia has actively monitored and enforced their
implementation. A number of other legislation reforms may also be cited such as: the
Law on Foreign Investment10, adopted in 1967, and amended in 2007, ICL adopted in
199511, and amended in 2007, the Law on Insurance Business adopted in 199212, and
the Competition Law adopted in 199913. All these are but some examples of the many
positive changes to the legal and regulatory framework.
More specifically, the following major initiatives and/or laws and regulations may be
considered:
      •	 Establishment of National Committee on Corporate Governance in 1999 by
         decree of the Coordinating Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry.
      •	 The National Committee on Corporate Governance was then changed to National
         Committee on Governance in 2004 to accommodate governance not only for
         corporate but to include public sector as well.
      •	 Adoption of the Indonesian Company Law No. 1 of 1995 which superseded in
         2007 with Law No. 40 of 2007 concerning the same.
      •	 Law No. 8 of 1995 on Capital Market.
      •	 Law No. 25 of 2007 on Investment, which supersedes the previous Law No. 1 of
         1967 on Foreign Investment.
      •	 Law No. 31 in 1999 on Corruption Eradication Commission, which by this law,
         Corruption Eradication Commission was established. Later, the Law was amended
         with Law No. 30 of 2002.
      •	 Law No. 5 in 1999 on the Prohibition of Monopolistic Practices and Unfair
         Business Competition. As an implementation of that law, the Commission for The
         Supervision of Business Competition (KPPU - Komisi Pengawas Persaingan Usaha)
         was established on 1999.
      •	 Law No. 30 of 1999 on Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution.

      authority of the Capital Market and Financial Institution Supervisory Board (Bapepam-LK) as capital
      market supervisory and regulatory board was diverted to Financial Service Authority (OJK).

   •	 Establishment of Center for Reporting and Financial Transaction Analysis
      (PPATK - Pusat Pelaporan dan Analisis Transaksi Keuangan), which was mandated by
      the Law No. 15 in 2002 on Money Laundering. The Law was then amended with
      Law No. 25 of 2003.
   •	 Regulation on obligation to implement GCG in SOE through the decree of the
      Minister of SOEs Kep-117/M-MBU/2002 in Implementation of GCG in SOEs.
   •	 Law No. 19 of 2003 on State-Owned Enterprise.
   •	 Law No. 3 of 2004 on Bank Indonesia superseding the Law No. 23 of 1999
      concerning the same.
   •	 Law No. 7 of 2009 on Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS - Lembaga Penjamin
      Simpanan), superseding the Law No. 24 of 2004 concerning the same.
   •	 Regulation on obligation to implement GCG in banking sector through Central
      Bank regulation PBI No. 8/4/PBI/2006 on GCG Implementation for Banks.
   •	 Other Regulations which elaborate GCG principles to public companies
      through Capital Market and Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency (Otoritas
      Jasa Keuangan-OJK) regulations, such as regulations on disclosure, independent
      Commissioners, corporate secretary, audit committee, protection of minority
      shareholders and etc.

The adoption of the CG Regulations, although not heavy in detail, certainly must be
hailed as another positive step for Indonesia corporate governance, providing the first
ever set of corporate governance guidelines for companies in Indonesia, in general and
listed companies in particular.

the western world and Indonesia.

4.	 The International Scope of Corporate Governance
Numerous codes of best practices and corporate governance principles have been
developed over the last 10 years. Worldwide, more than 200 codes have been
written in some 72 countries and regions.14 Most of these codes focus on the role
of the Board of Commissioners or Board of Directors in a company. A handful is
international in scope.15
Among these, only the OECD Principles address both policymakers and businesses, and
focus on the entire governance framework (shareholder rights, stakeholders, disclosure
and board practices). The OECD Principles have gained worldwide acceptance as a
framework and reference point for corporate governance. Published in 1999 and revised
in 2004, they were developed to provide principle-based guidance on good governance.
The OECD corporate governance framework is built on four core values:
   •	 Fairness: The corporate governance framework should protect shareholder
      rights and ensure the equitable treatment of all shareholders, including minority
      and foreign shareholders. All shareholders should have the opportunity to obtain
      effective redress for violations of their rights.
   •	 Responsibility: The corporate governance framework should recognize the
      rights of stakeholders as established by law, and encourage active co-operation
      between corporations and stakeholders in creating wealth, jobs, and the
      sustainability of financially sound enterprises.
   •	 Transparency: The corporate governance framework should ensure that timely
      and accurate disclosure is made on all material matters regarding the company,
      including its financial situation, governance structure, performance and ownership.
   •	 Accountability: The corporate governance framework should ensure the
      strategic guidance of the company, the effective monitoring of management by the
      Board, and the Board’s accountability to the company and shareholders.

Many national corporate governance codes have been developed based on the OECD
Principles. Indonesia’s CG Code was also developed based on the OECD Principles and
contains certain principles which conform to international best practices. For instance,
the CG Code states that (i) they were developed to “. . . help ensuring the sustainable
development of the securities market and contributing to a cleaner and healthier


14	 For a complete list of country codes of corporate governance, see the website of the European Corporate
    Governance Institute at www.ecgi.org.
15	 Corporate governance codes of international scope include the OECD Principles of Corporate
    Governance (www.oecd.org), the International Corporate Governance Network’s Statement on Global
    Corporate Governance Principles (ICGN - www.icgn.org), and the Commonwealth Association of
    Corporate Governance (CACG - www.commonwealthfoundation.com).

economy”, that (ii) “[The] regulations set out the basic rules of corporate governance
with a view to protecting legitimate rights and obligations of shareholders, establishing
standards for professional acts and morality of the Board of Directors, Board of
Commissioner and the managers of the listed company”, and that (iii) “the regulations
also serve as the basis for assessing the implementation of corporate governance of a
listed company”.
Although they represent a good start in the right direction, the CG Regulations
are much simpler in form in comparison to other national codes of corporate
governance. The CG Regulations are also likely to add more in volume over time, when
corporate governance is taken more seriously by Indonesian companies. The OECD
Principles can serve as an excellent reference point for international practices and are
recommended reading for those interested in understanding some of the principles that
underlie national standards.



5.	 Distinguishing Corporate Governance
Corporate governance must not be confused with corporate management. Corporate
governance focuses on a company’s structure and processes to ensure fair, responsible,
transparent and accountable corporate behavior. Corporate management, on the other
hand, focuses on the tools required to operate the business. Corporate governance is
situated at a higher level of direction that ensures that the company is managed in the
interests of its shareholders. One overlapping area is strategy, which is dealt with at the
corporate management level and is also a key corporate governance element. Figure 3
illustrates the difference between corporate governance and corporate management.

Corporate governance must also not be confused with public governance, which
deals with the governance structures and systems within the public sector. Corporate
governance must further be distinguished from good corporate citizenship, corporate
social responsibility and business ethics. Good corporate governance will certainly
reinforce these important concepts. But while companies that invest in socially
responsible projects, run charitable foundations or do not pollute often benefit with a
superior reputation, public goodwill and even better profitably, corporate governance is
and remains distinct from these concepts.

B.	           The Business Case for
	             Corporate Governance

Good corporate governance is important on a number of different levels. At the
company level, well-governed companies tend to have better and cheaper access
to capital, and tend to outperform their poorly governed peers over the long-term.
Companies that insist upon the highest standards of governance reduce many of the
risks inherent to an investment in a company. Companies that actively promote robust
corporate governance practices need key employees who are willing and able to devise
and implement good corporate governance policies. These companies will generally
value and compensate such employees more than their competitors that are unaware of,
or ignore, the benefits of these policies and practices. Such companies, in turn, tend to
attract more investors who are willing to provide capital at lower cost.
Generally, well-governed companies are better contributors to the national economy
and society. They tend to be healthier companies that add more value to shareholders,
workers, communities, and countries in contrast with poorly governed companies that
may cause job and pension losses, and even undermine confidence in securities markets.
Some of the building blocks, or levels, and specific benefits of good governance are
depicted in Figure 4 and discussed in further detail below.

1.	 Stimulating Performance and Improving Operational
    Efficiency

There are several ways in which good corporate governance can improve performance
and operational efficiency, as illustrated in Figure 5.

                 Better Oversight and Accountability

                                                                                  Source: IFC, March 2004



An improvement in the company’s governance practices leads to an improvement in
the accountability system, minimizing the risk of fraud or self-dealing by the company’s
officers. Accountable behavior, combined with effective risk management and internal
controls, can bring potential problems to the forefront before a full-blown crisis
occurs. Corporate governance improves the management and oversight of executive
performance, for example by linking executive remuneration to the company’s financial
results. This creates favorable conditions not only for planning the smooth succession
and continuity of the company’s executives, but also for sustaining the company’s long-
term development.
Adherence to good corporate governance standards also helps to improve the decision-
making process. For example, Board of Comissioners, Board of Directors and
shareholders are all likely to make more informed, quicker and better decisions when
the company’s governance structure allows them to clearly understand their respective
roles and responsibilities, as well as when communication processes are regulated in
an effective manner. This, in turn, should significantly enhance the efficiency of the
financial and business operations of the company at all levels. High quality corporate
governance streamlines all the company’s business processes, and this leads to better
operating performance and lower capital expenditures,16 which, in turn, may contribute
to the growth of sales and profits with a simultaneous decrease in capital expenditures
and requirements.

An effective system of governance practices should ensure compliance with applicable
laws, standards, rules, rights, and duties of all interested parties. Furthermore, it should
allow companies to avoid costly litigation, including costs related to shareholder claims
and other disputes resulting from fraud, conflicts of interest, corruption and bribery,
and insider trading. A good system of corporate governance will facilitate the resolution
of corporate conflicts between minority and controlling shareholders, executives and
shareholders, and between shareholders and stakeholders. Also, company officers will be
able to minimize the risk of personal liability.


2.	 Improving Access to Capital Markets
Corporate governance practices can determine the ease with which companies are
able to access capital markets. Well-governed firms are perceived as investor friendly,
providing greater confidence in their ability to generate returns without violating
shareholder rights.
Good corporate governance is based on the principles of accessibility, accuracy,
completeness, efficiency, timeliness and transparency of information at all levels. With
the enhancement of transparency in a company, investors benefit from being provided
with an opportunity to gain insight into the company’s business operations and financial
data. Even if the information disclosed by the company is negative, shareholders will
benefit from the decreased risk of uncertainty.
Of particular note are the observable recent trends among investors to include
corporate governance practices as a key decision-making criterion in investment
decisions. The better the corporate governance structure and practices, the more likely
that assets are being used in the interest of shareholders and not being tunneled or
otherwise misused by managers. Figure 6 illustrates that corporate governance practices
can take on particular importance in emerging markets where shareholders do not
always benefit from the same protections available in more developed markets.
Finally, new listing requirements on many stock exchanges around the world require
companies to adhere to increasingly strict standards of governance. Companies wishing
to access both domestic and international capital markets will need to adhere to specific
corporate governance standards.

3.	 Lowering the Company’s Cost of Capital and
	 Raising the Value of Assets
Companies committed to high standards of corporate governance are typically
successful in obtaining reduced costs when incurring debt and financing for operations.
As a result, they are able to decrease their capital costs. The cost of capital depends
upon the level of risk assigned to the company by investors—the higher the risk, the
higher the cost of capital. These risks include investor rights violations. If investor rights
are adequately protected, the cost of equity and debt capital may decrease. It should be
noted that investors providing debt capital, i.e. creditors, have recently tended to include
a company’s corporate governance practices (for example, a transparent ownership
structure and appropriate financial reporting) as a key criterion in their investment
decision-making process. Thus, the implementation of a good corporate governance
system should ultimately result in the company paying lower interest rates and receiving
longer maturity on loans and credits.




An Introduction To Corporate Governance                    45                  The Business Case for Corporate Governance
The level of risk and cost of capital also depend on a country’s economic or political
situation, institutional framework and enforcement mechanisms. Corporate governance
at a particular company thus plays a crucial role in emerging markets, which often do
not have as good a system of enforcing investors’ rights as countries with developed
market economies.
This holds particularly true in countries such as Indonesia where the legal framework
is still not well implemented, and where courts do not always provide investors
with effective recourse when their rights are violated. This means that even modest
improvements in corporate governance relative to other companies can make a large
difference for investors and decrease the cost of capital.17 Figure 7 tellingly demonstrates
that a significant percentage of investors are willing to pay a premium for a well-
governed company (for example, this premium amounts to 25% for Chinese companies).

At the same time, there is a strong relationship between governance practices and how
investors perceive the value of company assets (such as fixed assets, goodwill, human
capital, product portfolios, receivables, and research and development).

4.	 Building a Better Reputation
In today’s business environment, reputation has become a key element of a company’s
goodwill. A company’s reputation and image effectively constitute an integral, if
intangible, part of its assets. Good corporate governance practices contribute to and
improve a company’s reputation. Thus, those companies that respect the rights of
shareholders and creditors, and ensure financial transparency and accountability, will be
regarded as being an ardent advocate of investors’ interests. As a result, such companies
will enjoy more public confidence and goodwill.
This public confidence and goodwill can lead to greater trust in the company and its
products, which in turn may lead to higher sales and, ultimately, profits. A company’s
positive image or goodwill is known to play a significant role in the valuation of a
company. Goodwill in accounting terms is the amount that the purchase price exceeds
the fair value of the acquired company’s assets. It is the premium one company pays to
buy another.



                                                                      Best Practices

       The following principles of corporate conduct are fundamental guidelines
       underlying the formation, operation and enhancement of a company’s
       system of corporate governance:
         1.	 Corporate governance practice should provide shareholders with a
             real opportunity to exercise their rights in relation to the company.
         2.	 Corporate governance practice should provide for the equitable
             treatment of all shareholders. Shareholders should have access to
             effective recourse in the event of a violation of their rights.
         3.	 Corporate governance practice should provide for the Board of
             Commissioners’ direction and control of the Board of Directors of
             the company and for the accountability of the Board of Directors to
             shareholders.
         4.	 Corporate governance practice should ensure that the Board of
             Directors manage the day-to-day activities of the company without
             undue interference, in good faith and solely in the interests of the
             company, and ensure that the Board of Directors report in full and on a
             timely basis to the Board of Commissioners and shareholders.




An Introduction To Corporate Governance     47             The Business Case for Corporate Governance
           5.	 Corporate governance practice should, in particular, provide for
               the full, timely and accurate disclosure of all material information
               (including information about a company’s financial position, financial
               indicators, and ownership and management structure) in order to
               enable shareholders and investors to make informed decisions.
           6.	 Corporate governance practice should ensure compliance with
               applicable laws as related to the statutory or contractual rights of all
               stakeholders. Corporate governance practice should, more generally,
               encourage the consideration of stakeholders’ interests, including
               employees, even when they are not expressly set forth in law, and
               support active co-operation between the company and stakeholders
               with a view to increasing the assets and value of the company and

C.	           The Cost of Corporate Governance

Good governance entails real costs. Some of the costs include hiring dedicated staff,
such as corporate secretaries, experienced and independent Board of Directors and
Board of Commisioner, internal auditors or other governance specialists. It will likely
require the payment of fees to external counsel, auditors, and consultants. The costs of
additional disclosure can be significant as well. Furthermore, it requires considerable
Board of Directors time, especially in the start-up phase. These costs tend to make
implementation considerably easier for larger companies that may have the resources to
spare than smaller companies whose resources may be stretched thin.




                                                                    Best Practices

       Corporate governance is most, if not solely, applicable to larger, open
       joint stock companies that are publicly traded on an exchange. A large,
       dispersed shareholder base, where controlling shareholders and Directors
       can wield extraordinary powers and potentially abuse shareholder rights,
       often defines such companies. Large companies are, moreover, important
       elements of a country’s economy and thus require close public scrutiny
       and attention.
       Notwithstanding, corporate governance is beneficial to all companies,
       irrespective of size, legal form, number of shareholders, ownership
       structure or other characteristics. Of course, a one-size-fits-all approach
       should be avoided and companies should carefully apply corporate
       governance standards. For example, smaller companies may not require
       a full set of Board committees or a full-time Corporate Secretary. On the
       other hand, even a small company may benefit from an advisory body.
       A company will not always see instant improvements to its performance
       due to better corporate governance practices. However, returns, while
       sometimes difficult to quantify, generally exceed the costs, in particular
       over the long term. This is especially true when one takes into account
       potential invested capital, job and pension loss risks and the disruption




An Introduction To Corporate Governance      49                    The Cost of Corporate Governance
       that may be caused to communities when companies collapse. In some
       cases, systemic governance problems may undermine faith in financial
       markets and threaten market stability.
       Finally, it must be noted that corporate governance is not a one-time
       exercise, but rather an ongoing process. No matter how many corporate
       governance structures and processes the company has in place, it is
       advisable to regularly update and review them. Markets tend to value long-
       term commitment to good governance practices rather than a single action
       or “box-ticking” exercises.

D.	           The Corporate Governance Framework
	             in Indonesia

1.	 Specifics of Corporate Governance in Indonesia
All countries have a unique history, culture, legal and regulatory framework, each of
which influences a company’s corporate governance framework. The following is a list
of features that characterize Indonesia’s corporate sector.
The role of SOEs: Since the early 1990s and especially in the last 20 years, several SOEs
have been equitized and converted into partly privatized companies through public stock
offerings and/or strategic alliances, in which the State may still hold a majority interest.
Despite that fact, many important sectors in Indonesia’s economy remain either State
monopolies, or largely dominated by wholly State-owned enterprises, such as those in
the banking, electricity, mining, oil and gas, post and telecommunications, railways and
shipbuilding sectors. In numerous equitized SOEs, the State retains a majority interest
of 51% and exercises its control via the GMS and the Commissioners appointed by the
State to the company’s Board Of Commissioners.
Concentrated ownership: Many private companies in Indonesia start out as small private
companies owned either by a single controlling shareholder, members of a family, or a
small group of shareholders. Although many have expanded significantly, the controlling
shareholders have not changed. This concentrated ownership structure often entails a
lack of proper documents (such as the company charter or financial regulations) and
a lack of supervisory activities and proper book-keeping. This impedes the ability of
outsiders to become shareholders and leaves room for minority shareholder abuses. Such
insider dominance and weak protection of external shareholders/investors has resulted
in failed deals and the underdevelopment of the capital markets in Indonesia. A trend,
albeit nascent, towards initial public offerings (IPOs) and thus more dispersed ownership
can, however, be witnessed. Whether these majority shareholders are truly willing to
reduce or even exit their investments remains to be seen.
Little separation of ownership and control: Most controlling shareholders also act as the
company’s President Director and sit on the Board of Directors. Those companies that
separate ownership and control often do so only on paper. It is not uncommon to find
joint stock companies in which the President Director acts concurrently as the President
Commissioner. Failure to separate ownership and control typically results in weak
accountability and control structures (effectively, the majority/controlling shareholders




An Introduction To Corporate Governance     51          The Corporate Governance Framework in Indonesia
oversee themselves in their function as Commissioners and Directors), abusive
related party transactions, and poor information disclosure (insiders have access to all
information and are unmotivated to disclose to outsiders or minority shareholders).
Unwieldy holding structures: Some major business groups, especially large SOEs, are set
up in the form of parent companies controlling subsidiary companies. While holding
structures can serve legitimate purposes, cross-shareholdings and lack of transparency
have the tendency to create opaque ownership structures. This could make a company
difficult to understand for shareholders and investors. Such structures could be used to
expropriate and circumvent the rights of individual shareholders. Poor consolidated
accounting, or even the absence thereof, is a further corporate governance issue that has
yet to be tackled.
Inexperienced and inadequate corporate bodies: Parts of Indonesia’s current concept of
Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors were first introduced in ICL 1995
and the Law on SOEs in 2003. However, these concepts were not taken seriously until
recently, when companies began to draft and adhere to elaborate AoA with company
rules and regulations. However, in reality, it is still common for Boards of Directors to
attempt to bypass the supervision mechanisms put in place by the AoA (such as internal
auditors or the Board of Commissioners), and to limit direct contact to the controlling
shareholder (to the extent they are not one and the same). The role of the Board of
Commissioner, as well as its Committees, the President Director and the Board of
Directors as a whole, as well as the Corporate Secretary often remain unclear in the
day-to-day company operations. The members of all these bodies are supposed to be
experienced and capable, but in reality they lack awareness of their responsibilities,
due to a historical lack of general good practice in their areas. A lack of experience in
the field of corporate governance is a big obstacle for further economic development.
Unfortunately, strong, vigilant and independent corporate bodies remain a rarity.


2.	 The Legal and Regulatory Framework
The legal and regulatory framework in Indonesia has some unique characteristics
resulting from Indonesia’s history and the development of Indonesia’s economy.
Indonesia first regulates the Limited Liability Company on 1848 in Chapter 3 of
Indonesia Commercial Code (Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Dagang). On the other
hand, the foreign investment in Indonesia first introduced through the 1967 Foreign
Investment Law. The introduction of the Foreign Investment Law in 1967 brought the first
concepts of corporatization to Indonesian economy. Throughout the 1970s and up until now, FICs
(Foreign Investment Companies) have been growing fast in both number and size. Most FICs have
some corporate governance structure in place.




An Introduction To Corporate Governance        52          The Corporate Governance Framework in Indonesia
As mentioned, the first comprehensive piece of legislation for domestic companies was
approved in 1968 with the Domestic Investment Law. In 1995, Indonesia established
the ICL 1995. In 2007, there are significant changes in legal and regulatory framework
for companies and investment in Indonesia where the government issued Investment
Law and ICL. Over the past 5 years, Indonesia’s legal and regulatory framework for
corporate governance has improved dramatically, but actual implementation and
adherence by Indonesian companies to corporate governance practices is still in its
improving stages).
Impact of World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments: As a member of WTO, Indonesia
has adopted its commitments made when it joined WTO as a positive reference in
accelerated its efforts to get its legal framework comply with the WTO requirements.
Application of industry-specific laws and regulation: In Indonesia, companies are required to
comply with ICL and other laws and regulations which govern the specific industry and
activities carried out by such companies. Thus, a company in the insurance business is
subject to ICL and the Law on Insurance Business. Similarly, a bank is subject to ICL
and the Law on Banks. In addition to these two laws, a listed bank is also subject to the
Law on Capital Market18 and so on.
ICL: As an example, ICL allows (i) the GMS of a limited liability company to elect
members of the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors, and (ii) the GMS
to elect the President Director and President Commissioner respectively.19 However,
banking regulations require that the appointment and dismissal of the President
Director, the Chairman and members of the Board of Commissioners, and members
of the Board of Directors of a limited liability commercial bank be approved by the
Governor of Bank of Indonesia (BI).20 Similarly, insurance regulations require that the
appointment and dismissal of the President Director, the President Commissioner and
the members of the Board of Directors of an insurance company be approved by the
OJK.21 This is one of many examples of how there are different legal requirements
which are relevant to the corporate governance of a company.
ICL expressly provides that “In special cases where the establishment, organization,
management and operation of an enterprise are regulated by a specialized law, the
provisions of such law shall prevail”. However, in practice, there are numerous cases
where the distinctions are not clear-cut, and the overlapping laws and regulations have
created confusion, ambiguities and uncertainties to the companies trying to follow the

An Introduction To Corporate Governance           53     The Corporate Governance Framework in Indonesia
laws and implement good corporate governance practice. These also create the danger
of inconsistencies in the implementation of these laws by Ministries, the courts and
other law enforcement bodies.
Thus, it is prudent that whilst companies should use this Manual for reference for
corporate governance practice, they should also review other laws and regulations which
may be applicable to their line of business, and comply with such laws and regulations.
Where it encounters what seems to be some inconsistency or ambiguity of different
legislation, a company should try to clarify such an inconsistency or ambiguity, either by
engaging the company’s in-house legal department, internal compliance department,
advice from the company’s external legal counsel and clarification from law enforcement
agencies or law-making agencies, to achieve full compliance with the law and best
corporate governance practice.
Applicable laws and legal framework: All commercial enterprises, regardless of their legal
form, are subject to a comprehensive set of laws, regulations, and governmental decrees
as illustrated in Figure 8. In addition to the general legal and regulatory framework,
there are Decrees, Circulars and Decisions from the Government, Ministries and other
law enforcement bodies that deal with specific corporate issues in Indonesia in more
detail for SOEs, limited liability companies (LLCs) and other corporate entities.

An Introduction To Corporate Governance                 56         The Corporate Governance Framework in Indonesia
As discussed previously in this Chapter, ICL applies to all corporate entities in
Indonesia, and in addition to this general rule, companies in the banking, investment,
and insurance industries need to comply with specific legislation. The Law on Capital
Market and its implementing regulations applies to activities relating to the issuance,
offering, sale and purchase of securities, securities-related services and information
disclosure by corporate entities, shareholders and investors.
Indonesian companies are also subject to other accounting, anti-corruption, auditing,
bankruptcy, commerce, competition, construction, labor, tender process and taxation
laws. Where appropriate, this Manual refers to these laws and other legal documents.
The list of legal acts in Figure 8 is far from complete. Moreover, Indonesian legislation
continues to change as it develops and improves. For example, as mentioned previously,
ICL has amended several times to eliminate inconsistencies in provisions that regulate
the activities of governing bodies, securities issuance, the exercise of shareholder rights
and other matters. Most of the laws and regulations that have an impact on corporate
governance and will be used in this Manual have been enacted in the last few years,
although they may have evolved from past laws.
Finally, all Indonesian companies are being encouraged to adhere to the corporate
governance rules included in the CG Regulations, although these provisions are only
mandatory for listed companies.



                                                                             Best Practices

       Corporate governance frameworks typically comprise elements
       of legislation, regulation, self-regulatory arrangements, voluntary
       commitments and business practices that are the result of country specific
       circumstances, history and tradition. The desirable mix between legislation,
       regulation, self-regulation, voluntary standards, etc. in this area will
       vary from country to country. As new experiences accrue and business
       circumstances change, the content and structure of this framework needs
       to be adjusted. 22 Companies will need to carefully monitor such adjustments
       on a regular basis and update their governance systems accordingly.

An Introduction To Corporate Governance         57           The Corporate Governance Framework in Indonesia
3.	 The Corporate Governance Regulations Applicable
	 to Listed Companies in Indonesia

The CG Regulations were adopted by the OJK and draw upon generally accepted
principles of corporate governance, including the OECD Principles.




                                                                        Best Practices

       Good corporate governance practices are focused on respect for the
       lawful interests of all participants in corporate activities. They can improve
       the quality of a company’s operations by means of, among other things,
       increasing the value of corporate assets, creating jobs and enhancing the
       financial stability and profitability of a company. Trust among all those
       involved in corporate activities is at the root of the effective operation
       of a company and the ability to attract investment. The OECD Principles
       are aimed at the creation of trust in relations arising in connection with
       corporate governance.




The CG Regulations comprise the following three categories of rules:
   1.	Legal requirements: The rules that refer to mandatory legal requirements;
      these provisions are mandatory not because they are part of the CG Regulations,
      but because they overwrite or rephrase legal requirements. Legal requirements
      in the CG Regulations can be recognized by using words ”must”, “is obliged to”,
      “cannot”, etc.
   2.	Comply or explain rules: These rules are to be followed. Listed companies are
      compelled to disclose and explain all deviations from these rules in the declaration
      of compliance with the corporate governance principles, comply or explain rules
      allow companies to deviate from certain rules only when the deviation is justifiable.
      The comply or explain rules of the CG Regulations are marked in the text by the
      use of the word “shall”.
   3.	Suggestions: These rules are recommendations in their nature. Non-compliance
      with these rules requires neither disclosure nor explanation. For these rules the CG
      Regulations use terms such as “should” or “can”.

The General Governance Structure of a Company     63            The Chairman’s Checklist
The Indonesian Company Law No. 40 of 2007 defines a Limited Liability Company
(Perseroan Terbatas - PT) as a company’s status and provides for the structure of its
governing bodies. The CG Code further includes recommendations to establish
additional governing bodies for listed companies, for example the Board Committees
and Corporate Secretary. This chapter discusses the concept and governance
structure of Limited Liability Company (Perseroan Terbatas - PT) as they are defined
by the Limited Liability Act and as recommended by the CG Code. The authorities,
functions and structures of the governing bodies are described in more detail in other
chapters of this Manual.




The General Governance Structure of a Company   64                      The Chairman’s Checklist
A.	           What is a Limited Liability Company?

1.	 The Definition of a Limited Liability Company
Under the ICL, a Limited Liability Company (Perseroan Terbatas - PT), hereinafter
called a “Company”, is defined as a legal entity which constitutes an alliance of capital
established pursuant to a contract in order to carry on business activities with an
authorized capital all of which is divided into shares and which fulfils the requirements
stipulated in the ICL and its implementing regulations.
Under the ICL, a Company is a legal entity which has the following characteristics:
     •	 limited liability of shareholders
     •	 independent legal status and can enter into contracts in its own name
     •	 adopt two-tiered system
     •	 may sue and be sued
     •	 its capital structure is divided into authorized capital and issued and paid-up
        capital. Minimum of authorized capital is IDR 50 million (Rp 10 billion for
        FICs), and the paid-up and issued capital must be 25% from its authorized capital
     •	 the Company Organs consist of the Board of Directors, Board of
        Commissioners, and General Meeting of Shareholders
     •	 may issue shares and bonds.

A PT is the only legal entity that can issue shares. Shares in a PT may include (i)
ordinary shares, (ii) shares with or without voting shares, (iii) shares with special right
to nominate members of the Board of Directors and/or members of the Board of
Commissioners (iv) shares which after a certain period of time will be withdrawn or
exchanged with other shares’ classification, (v) shares which provide priority rights to
their owner to receive dividends over the other shareholders from different shares’
classification for the distribution of dividend cumulatively or non-cumulatively,
(vi) shares which provide priority rights to their owner to receive allocation of the
remainder of the Company’s assets in liquidation over the other shareholders with
different shares’ classification, and (vii) other preference shares as determined in the
AoA of the company.1

1	   ICL, Article 53 paragraph (4)




The General Governance Structure of a Company   65                  What Is a Limited Liability Company?
Shareholders of a PT are not personally liable for any agreement made on behalf of the
PT, and are not liable for the PT’s losses in excess of their respective shareholding.2
The ICL, however, contains certain specific exceptions to the limited liability principle,
including:
     a.	Under the ICL, founding shareholders are together obliged to subscribe at least
        25% of the authorized capital.
     b.	An ordinary shareholder would be personally responsible if it commits any of the
        following acts in the name of the company:3
       (i)	 directly or indirectly exploits the company in bad faith in his/her personal
            interest.
       (ii)	 involve in illegal acts committed by the company.
       (iii)	directly or indirectly illegally uses the company’s assets with the result that the
             company’s assets become insufficient to pay off the company’s debt.


2.	 Listed and Non Listed Companies
Indonesian law distinguishes clearly between listed and non listed companies. In
general, listed company is defined as a public company or a company undertaking
an initial public offering. Listed companies require higher paid-up capital, and are
subject to stricter and more complex rules regarding their governance and disclosure.
Law on Capital Market4 defines a public company as a company which has reached
300 shareholders and its paid-up capital has reached IDR 300 billion. It is possible
for a private company to voluntarily transform itself into a public company and
vice-versa by following legal requirements, in accordance with the Law on Capital
Market. Procedurally, this has to be done by amending the company’s AoA and
business registration certificate and is not considered to be a conversion of the business
organization’s legal form. If a company is intended to conduct a public offering, the
said public company must first be registered in OJK. Listed companies are generally
better suited for larger and growing companies that might wish to raise money in the
equities markets.

    Liability Public Company over Other Legal Forms

a.	 Legal Forms of Commercial Entities
        Indonesian law allows for the establishment of the following types of commercial
        entities:
           •	 Civil Partnership (Maatschap)12
           •	 Firma (Vennootshap onder firma)13
           •	 CV (Commanditair Vennootschap)14

           •	 Cooperatives
           •	 Foundation




                                                   Company Practices in Indonesia

        PT is the most popular form of commercial entity in Indonesia, which
        according to the latest economic survey (business/company listing result)
        2006, there were 22,7 million entities in operation.15 There were 458 public
        companies and among them 451 were listed companies.16

b.	 Advantages of Listed Companies Compared to Non Listed
    Companies and CV/Partnership
       Listed company offers many advantages, including:
          •	 Access to investors: Listed companies have greater opportunities to
             attract investment at lower cost. In comparison with other commercial
             entities, listed companies are more transparent to potential investors due to
             information disclosure obligations. A better market position improves their
             availability to attract investment under privileged conditions. Furthermore,
             the scale of capital-intensive companies, such as banking, is so large that few
             individual lenders or equity investors can provide the needed capital.
          •	 Free transferability of shares: Shares of the company can be
             transferred without the consent of other shareholders, the company, or its
             management in accordance with legal requirements.
          •	 Limitation on the risks to shareholders: The risks carried by
             shareholders are limited to the value of their investment and duties set by
             Indonesian legislation. Shareholders are not normally liable for the legal and
             financial obligations of the company.
          •	 Diversification of risks: The risks of a public company are spread over
             a large number of shareholders.


c.	    Disadvantages of Listed Companies
       The principal economic advantage of the listed company form is the ease with
       which it can access financial markets. However, this special access is not without
       disadvantages. A number of organizational, legal and regulatory hurdles must be
       cleared for a company to have the right to offer its securities to investors. A listed
       company requires:
          •	 Compliance with securities regulations: private companies are
             generally outside the purview of such regulation.
          •	 A complex organizational structure: It is designed to protect
             shareholders from abuse and allow professional directors to run the
             company. The company bears the costs associated with supporting its
             governing bodies.
          •	 Compliance with disclosure and other regulations: A public
             company must ensure appropriate level of transparency and publicity
             through timely, accurate and complete disclosure of all important events



The General Governance Structure of a Company   69                   What Is a Limited Liability Company?
              that are significant for determination of legal and financial position of
              the company. Disclosure obligations encompass the business report of the
              company, financial reports and audit report, as well as other reports and
              information that are important for the company, in accordance with the
              securities market regulations. Therefore, a public company must comply
              with more rigorous legislation and regulations, and should follow codes and
              standards designed to protect shareholder rights. It must ensure the proper
              registration of issued shares.
          •	 Shareholders willing to invest in the company: The company should
             be able to attract shareholders willing to accept the risk of investing in the
             company and at the same time maintain good investor relations once shares
             have been floated. These activities imply significant costs for the company.
             Some of them are associated with marketing an offer to investors and
             maintaining continuous communication with shareholders after the IPO.
          •	 Professional Management: The separation of ownership and control
             provides investors with the possibility to hire professional Directors who
             devote their efforts and skills to run the company. The separation of
             ownership and control also provides professional directors with access to the
             capital needed to manage the company. Finding, developing and retaining
             trustworthy professional directors are, however, a difficult task.
          •	 Higher minimum charter capital: This is more than other normal legal
             requirements.

B.	           The Governance Structure of a
	             Limited Liability Company

Legislation provides companies with substantial flexibility in establishing their
governance structure. The bodies required by ICL do not depend on how many
shareholders the company has or the amount of charter capital. The only distinction
which has legal consequences for the governance structure of the company is the one
between public and private companies.
Non-Listed Companies
A non-listed company must have the following bodies:17

1.	 The General Meeting of Shareholders
The GMS of a limited liability company is, a company organ given the authority
which is not granted to the Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners within
the limits determined by the ICL and/or the AoA. All ordinary shareholders have the
right to participate in the GMS and have the number of votes corresponding to the
respective ordinary shares held by them. The GMS approves nominations for the Board
of Commissioners and the Board of Directors membership. In addition, it approves
the annual report and the financial statements, the distribution of profits and losses
(including the payment of dividends), amended authorized capital, amendments of the
AoA, re-organization and dissolution, and extraordinary transactions.26

         See Chapter 8.


2.	 The Board of Commissioners
The Board of Commissioners plays a central role in the corporate governance
framework. The Board of Commissioners is responsible to supervise the management
policy and its implementation and also to advise the Board of Directors. The CG
Code provides that a Board of Commissioners shall have the capability and integrity
in order to perform its responsibilities and to ensure that the company activities are in
compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.27

                                                                           Best Practices

       Indonesian companies are not able to choose between different corporate
       governance frameworks, depending on the structure of the company’s
       Board. Essentially, two opposite board models have been developed in
       Europe, the one-tier board (unitary board system) and the two-tier board
       (dual system). The tendency in Europe is towards an increase in flexibility,
       allowing companies to choose between the different systems and adapt
       them to the different business environments:
          •	 The one-tier, or unitary board system is characterized by a single
             board that governs the company, and includes both executive and
             non-executive members. In such a setting, the supervisory body is
             often called the Board of Directors. This governance structure can
             facilitate strong leadership structures and efficient decision-making.
             Non-executive and independent directors, however, play a crucial role
             in monitoring managers and reducing agency costs. This system is
             typical for companies based in countries with a common law tradition,
             for example the U.S. and the U.K.
          •	 The two-tiered,or dual system, on the other hand, is characterized
             by the existence of distinct supervisory and management bodies. The
             former is commonly referred to as the Supervisory Board, the latter as
             the Executive Board. Under this system, the day-to-day management
             of the company is handed down to the Executive Board, which is
             then controlled by the Supervisory Board (which in turn is elected
             by the GMS). These two bodies have distinct authorities and their
             composition cannot be mixed, i.e. members of the Executive Board
             cannot sit on the Supervisory Board and vice-versa. The advantage of
             the two-tiered system is a clear oversight mechanism, but it has been
             criticized for inefficient decision-making. This system is most famously
             represented in Germany.
          •	 Besides the one-tiered and the two-tiered systems, many countries
             recognize a third governance structure, the hybrid system, which is
             essentially an amalgam of the two abovementioned models.




The General Governance Structure of a Company   73   The Governance Structure of a Limited Liability Company
       Regardless of which system a country allows, the following must be kept in
       mind:
          1.	 There is always a trade-off between efficiency and control. When the
              agency problem and conflict of interests is high, shareholders may
              choose the two-tiered system, but must realize that a tight monitoring
              governance system could tie managers’ hands and render business
              operations and decision-making inefficient. On the other hand, when
              shareholders and managers trust each other and the company needs
              better efficiency to explore more business opportunities, the company
              may choose a more pro-management oriented, one-tier board system.

          2.	 While all systems have many elements in common, important
              differences do exist and these will affect the board’s authority,
              structure and operations, and consequently the duties and obligations
              of directors.




3.	 The Board of Directors
Every company must have a Board of Directors who is responsible for day-to-day
management of the company.28 The Board of Directors is the legal representative of the
company unless the company’s AoA appoints certain member of the Board of Directors
to this position29. The Board of Directors is accountable to the General Meeting of
Shareholders (GMS)30. ICL and the company’s AoA regulate the authority of the Board
of Directors and also their election and dismissal process.

         See Chapter 5, Section A.

4.	 Board Committees
A Board Committee has the duty to oversee and supervise as well as advise the Board
of Directors and the Board of Commissioners. The CG Code recommends the
establishment of certain Board Committees such as an Audit Committee, Risk Policy
Committee, Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The primary task of these
committees is to assist the Board of Directors functions. The discussion in this Manual
as to the authority, composition, and functions of individual Board Committees is mostly
based on recommendations of the CG Code and Best Practices.

         See Chapter 4, Section C.


5.	 External Auditor
ICL provides that an annual, independent audit shall be conducted by a certified
independent External Auditor (licensed and accredited audit company/organization)31.
It is an obligation for a company that is:
   a)	 Considered to be a compliance-audited company (a SOE, FIE, commercial bank,
       credit institution, financial institution, insurance company, and listed companies);
   b)	A controlling company that makes consolidated financial statements;
   c)	 Issuing securities or other financial instruments traded on the organized market.
For listed companies, the External Auditor is a separate body of the company, elected
by the GMS within the list of auditors authorized by the MOF to conduct the audit of
financial statements of listed companies, prepare the report of the auditor and submit to
the Board of Directors.

         See Chapter 14, Section B.

6.	 The Internal Auditor
According to the OJK regulation32, Indonesian listed companies are obligated to
establish an Internal Auditing function. The role of Internal Auditors is increasingly
becoming more important in strengthening corporate governance of many listed
companies.

         See Chapter 14, Section D.


7.	 The Corporate Secretary
Pursuant to Head of OJK Decree, the task of a Corporate Secretary is to follow the
development of regulations on Capital Market; ensure the availability of information
of the company to be accessed by public; advising the Board of Directors of Issuers or
Public Company to comply with Capital Market Law and its implementing regulations;
and acting as a contact person between Issuers or Public Company with OJK and the
public.

              Does the company have valid Articles of Association, in
              compliance with Article 15 of the ICL?

              Are the Articles of Association freely available to interested
              parties and accessible on the internet?

              Has the company adopted internal regulations? Is adopting
              internal regulations a legal obligation of the company? Is it
              possible for a company to be incorporated without having
              internal regulations? Does the company regularly consult
              and follow its internal regulations?

              Has the company adopted its own corporate governance
              code? If so, does the company code touch upon the
              principles of fairness, responsibility, transparency,
              and accountability? Does the company code provide
              recommendations on the relationship between the
              corporate bodies, notably the interaction between the Board
              of Commissioners and the Board of Directors?

              Has the company identified a core set of values? Does the
              company have a code of ethics based on these values?




The Internal Corporate Documents          80                       The Chairman’s Checklist
The deed of establishment of a company, as the company founding document,
consists of the Articles of Association (AoA) and other information related to the
establishment of the company.1 No company can be established without an AoA. A
deed of establishment establishes the company, determines its structure and purpose
as well as its capital structure. It is fundamental to the company’s system of corporate
governance, ensuring the protection and equitable treatment of shareholders,
distribution of authority between the governing bodies, and disclosure and transparency
of the company’s activities. It also plays an important public role in relation to third
parties since it provides information about the company. The amendment of the AoA
is subject to the Minister of Law and Human Rights (MOLHR) approval2 or only to be
acknowledged by the MOLHR.3
In addition to the AoA, the company may adopt internal regulations for different
purposes, such as internal regulations containing working terms of the worker and
the code of conduct of the company.4 Certain internal regulations are compulsory
for a number of specific types of companies. For instance, a credit institution and
an insurance company are required to adopt financial regulations which provide the
framework for the financial administration of the company and aim to maintain the
integrity of the company’s financial system. Listed companies (which include listed
banks and listed insurance companies) are required to adopt a corporate governance
code which ensures that a company is effectively operated and controlled in the
interests of shareholders and related persons.5 A corporate governance code is useful in
regulating detailed procedures for the company’s governing bodies and can help avoid
an unwieldy AoA that is difficult to understand. This internal regulation, however, must
be consistent with the AoA.
The company-level corporate governance code and code of conduct allow the company
to make its governance structure more transparent while demonstrating the company’s
commitment to good corporate governance and good business practices.
This chapter explains when and how the AoA are amended, and how the amendments
are registered. This chapter further touches upon the important role that company-level
corporate governance and code of conduct play.

5.	 How to Amend the Articles of Association?
The amendment of the AoA may only be conducted through a GMS, stating clearly
the agenda items regarding the amendments of the AoA in invitations to a GMS.10 A
special treatment is applicable for a company which has been declared as bankrupt, the
amendment of said company being subject to the approval of its receiver.11




                                                                     Best Practices

       It is accepted practice that the company, through its legal counsel/
       department, prepares the AoA amendments in cooperation with external
       legal consultants and with the participation of the Corporate Secretary.
       The President Director should closely follow the process, in order to ensure
       that provisions of the AoA are formulated in accordance with the Board’s
       guidelines. The final text of the draft proposal must be evaluated and
       accepted at the Board of Directors meeting. That text will be submitted to
       the GMS as a proposal.




6.	 Objection to the Amendments of the Articles of
    Association
The amendment of the AoA is stipulated by the GMS. If there are any objections to the
matters for the amendment, it has to be resolved by in the GMS. In addition, pursuant
to Article 27 of the ICL, the amendment of the AoA must be rejected if it is contrary to
the provisions regarding the procedures for amendment of the AoA, the content of the
amendment are contrary to the provisions of legislative regulations, public order and/or
morality, or there is any objection from the creditor upon the GMS decision regarding
the decrease of the capital.

       company or vice versa.

For any amendment other than those stated above, only an acknowledgment from the
Minister is required.


8.	 When does the Amendment of the Articles of
    Association Become Effective?

B.	           The Internal Regulations of a Company

1.	 Type of Internal Regulations
Internal regulations are internal company documents that specify the AoA provisions
and may contain any provision for managing the business and regulating the affairs of
a company.
Internal regulations may be an optional or compulsory subject to each type of internal
regulations and each type of company. In any case, the company’s internal regulations
must be consistent with the AoA and cannot conflict with legislation. As between the
AoA and internal regulations, the AoA are the dominant instrument so far as their
provisions are mutually conflicting, the AoA prevail.
The company has no obligation to register its internal regulations with the business
registration authority for the purpose of establishment. In other words, the company
may be formed and may exist without the internal regulations. The application for the
formation of the company does not have to be accompanied by the internal regulations.
There are various types of company internal regulations:
   •	 Corporate governance internal rules which are required for listed companies.
   	 (see section C of Chapter 3 below)
   •	 Internal labor rules which are compulsory for all companies with 10 or more
      employees. According to the Article 1 point 20 of the Manpower Law, a company
      regulation is defined as written regulations made by the company and containing
      the working terms of the worker and the company’s code of conduct. It is an
      obligation for companies employing at least 10 workers.15 The obligation to
      establish a company regulation is not applicable for companies who already owned
      a collective working agreement (perjanjian kerja bersama). The Manpower Law stated
      in Article 111 that a company regulation must at least contain several things as
      follows:
      a.	 rights and obligations of the entrepreneur/company;
      b.	 rights and obligations of the workers;
      c.	 working requirements;
      d.	 code of conduct of the company; and
      e.	 validity period of the company regulation.

       Although certain provisions must be stipulated in the AoA17, internal
       regulations have several advantages:
          •	 Internal regulations do not need to be registered with the business
             registration authority, saving the company resources by avoiding
             registration fees and bureaucratic procedures
          •	 In comparison with the AoA, the procedure for amending internal
             regulations is simplified, making it easier to adjust to changing
             circumstances
          •	 Internal regulations contribute to the protection of shareholders’
             rights. In particular, internal regulations set out a sound and proper
             framework for the administration and operations of the company.
             Internal regulations also assist shareholders to understand the
             implementation of the AoA provisions in practice.




16	 Credit institutions are also required to establish financial regulations (Article 29 of Decree 146 of the
    Government dated 23 November 2005 on financial regimes applicable to credit institutions).
17	 In Indonesia, a charter is the equivalent of the Articles of Association.

2.	 How to Adopt and Amend Internal Regulations?
By law, the President Director has the right to suggest and the Board of Directors has
the right to decide internal regulations of the company.18 It is a statutory presumption
that the Board of Directors has the authority to adopt or change the internal
regulations.
However for company regulation which is governed under the Manpower Law, in
adopting the company regulation, the company must consider inputs and considerations
from the representative of the workers in the company. It is also applied for the
amendment of the company regulation, where the Manpower Law stated in Article
113 that the amendment of the company regulation may only be conducted based on
mutual consent between company and workers and must be registered and authorized
by the MMT. A company regulation must be renewed every 2 (two) years.




18	 LOE, Articles 108.2(k) and 116.3(d). Although the term “internal management rules” is not defined by
    law, it could be interpreted to include all internal regulations set out in B(1) above given that such internal
    regulations are relevant to the management of the company.

C.	           Company Codes of Corporate
              Governance

1.	 What is a Company Code of Corporate Governance?
A company-level corporate governance code is a principle-based statement on the
company’s corporate governance practices. It is intended to make the company’s
governance structure more transparent and demonstrate the company’s commitment to
good corporate governance by developing and furthering:
   •	 Responsible, accountable and value-based management
   •	 An effective Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors that act in the best
      interests of the company and its shareholders, including minority shareholders and
      seek to enhance shareholder value in a sustainable manner
   •	 Appropriate information disclosure and transparency, as well as an effective system
      of risk management and internal control.

By adopting, following and updating a company-level corporate governance code on a
regular basis, the company confirms its desire to demonstrably lead and promote good
corporate governance. To foster the confidence of its shareholders, employees, investors
and the public, a company-level corporate governance code should, however, go beyond
the established legal and regulatory framework and embrace both nationally and
internationally recognized best corporate governance practices.



                                                                    Best Practices

       Many companies in countries with well-developed corporate governance
       practices have voluntary corporate governance codes or guidelines in
       addition to their AoA. Most codes are brief and simple statements of
       principle that generally reflect the desire of the Board of Commissioners and
       the Board of Directors to conduct company operations in an honest, fair,
       legal and socially responsible manner.

       Topics to be covered will depend upon the issues of greatest relevance to
       the company.
       As a rule, company codes are approved by the Board of Directors,
       communicated to shareholders and investors, and published on the
       company’s website. Company codes or guidelines must be consistent with
       legislation, as well as the AoA, and should generally follow the provisions
       of the relevant corporate governance code. They cannot, however, replace
       the AoA.




2.	 Indonesian Company Code of Corporate Governance
Codes of corporate governance are important sources for corporate governance in
many economies ranging from advanced to transitional economies. The framework for
corporate governance in Indonesia is already in a quite advanced stage of development,
both for companies in general as well as for listed companies.
The first Indonesia Code of Good Corporate Governance was developed in 1999 by
The National Committee on Corporate Governance (NCCG) which was established
by Decree of the Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Number:
KEP/31/M.EKUIN/08/1999. The committee was then replaced to be The National
Committee for Governance (NCG) by Decree of the Coordinating Minister for
Economic Affairs Number: KEP/49/M.EKON/11/2004 consisting of Public Sub-
Committee and Corporate Sub-Committee as the Government has become more aware




The Internal Corporate Documents              92               Company Codes of Corporate Governance
that for CG Code to be successfully implemented, it needs to have the public support
and the existence of good public governance.
The Code has been revised several times and the latest being the 2006 Code.
The CG Code is published on the basis of ethics-based approach. As a Code it does not
have legal binding but providing reference for business community in implementing the
CG Code.
The CG Code describes steps to be taken in creating checks and balances process,
enforcing transparency and accountability, as well as promoting corporate social
responsibility toward the company long-term survivability.
The CG Code, hereinafter called the CG Code, is a living instrument offering standards
as well as guidance for companies to implement CG with the purpose of:
   •	 achieving sustainable growth of the company through a management system based
      on the principles of transparency, accountability, responsibility, inde-pendency and
      fairness.
   •	 empowering the function and independency of each companyorgan, namely, the
      Board of Commissioners, the Board of Directors and the General Meeting of
      Shareholders
   •	 encouraging shareholders, members of the Board of Commissioners and members
      of the Board of Directors to take decisions and actions based on high moral values
      and compliance with the law and regulations.
   •	 stimulating the company awareness of social responsibilities in particular the
      environmental and societal interests of the communities in which a company
      operates.
   •	 optimizing the value of a company for its shareholders by also taking into
      consideration the interests of other stakeholders.
   •	 enhancing the competitiveness of a company, both nationally and internationally,
      in order to enhance market confidence which may promote investment flow and a
      sustainable national economic growth.

The CG Code constitutes the references points for all companies in Indonesia including
companies operating on the basis of sharia. The CG Code which encompasses the basic
principles and provisions on the implementation of CG Code is a minimum standard
that will be further elaborated in sectoral code of the respective sectors of industry to be
issued by NCG. The code can be adapted to the specific circumstances of the individual
companies into a more detailed manual for its operations.
Publicly listed companies, state-owned enterprises, province and region-owned company,
companies that raise and manage public funds, companies of which products or services
are widely used by public, and companies with extensive influence on environment,



The Internal Corporate Documents            93                 Company Codes of Corporate Governance
are expected to become the pioneer in implementing the CG Code. Regulator/policy
makers are also expected to use the CG Code as a reference for developing related
regulations and applicable sanctions.19
Using the national code as its reference, an individual company is encouraged to develop
their own corporate governance code and must cover at least the following:
   •	 Order and procedures for convening and voting at shareholders’ meetings
   •	 Order and procedures for nominating, standing for election, electing and
      dismissing Directors
   •	 Order and procedures for holding Board of Directors meetings
   •	 Order and procedures for co-ordination between the Board of Commissioners and
      the Board of Directors
   •	 Rules on assessing activities, rewarding and disciplining members of the Board of
      Commissioners and the Board of Directors.

A listed company must announce information on its corporate governance status at the
annual shareholders’ meeting and in annual reports of the company. Such information
must at least consist of:20
   •	 Members and structure of the Board of Commissioners and the Board of
      Directors
   •	 Activities of the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors
   •	 Activities of Independent Commissioners
   •	 Activities of Board Committees
   •	 A plan to increase the efficiency of the company’s activities
   •	 Remuneration and expenses for the Commissioners and Directors
   •	 Information about transactions of the company’s shares by the Commissioners,
      Directors and major shareholders; and about other transactions by the
      Commissioners and Directors and their affiliated persons
   •	 The number of the Commissioners and Directors attending training courses on
      corporate governance
   •	 Actions not yet undertaken, but required by the corporate governance code, the
      reasons and proposed solutions.

D.	           Company Code of Ethics

1.	 What is a Code of Ethics?
A code of Ethics (also referred to as a Code of Conduct, or Ethics or Responsibility
Statement) is a basic guide of conduct that imposes duties and responsibilities on a
company’s officers and employees towards its stakeholders, including colleagues,
customers and clients, business partners (e.g. suppliers), government and society.


2.	 Why Adopt a Code of Ethics?
A Code of Ethics:
   •	 Enhances the company’s reputation/image: A company’s reputation and
      image constitutes an integral, if intangible, part of its assets. Establishing a Code
      of Ethics is an effective way to communicate the value a company places on good
      business practices.
   •	 Improves risk and crisis management: A Code of Ethics can bring
      potential problems to management’s and Directors’ attention before a full-blown
      crisis occurs, as it sensitizes and encourages employees to react to ethical dilemmas.
   •	 Develops a corporate culture and brings corporate values to the
      forefront: A Code of Ethics developed by and widely distributed to the
      company’s officersand employees can help build a cohesive corporate culture,
      based on a shared setof values, that helps guide employees in their daily work.
   •	 Advances stakeholder communications: A Code of Ethics also has a strong
      demonstration effect towards the company’s stakeholders during times of crisis,
      communicating the company’s commitment to ethical behavior and underlining
      that possible transgressions are exceptions rather than the rule.
   •	 Avoids litigation: A Code of Ethics, in combination with an effective ethics
      program, can help minimize litigation risks resulting from fraud, conflict of
      interest, corruption and bribery, and insider trading.

3.	 How to Implement a Code of Ethics?
Every company is different in terms of size and industry, and each has a different
business culture, set of values, and ethically sensitive operational areas. A Code of
Ethics should reflect these differences.
A company’s Code of Ethics should go beyond simple rules and, instead, focus on core
values. Before drafting a Code of Ethics, it is fundamental that a company has
identified and formulated its values.21
Drafting a Code of Ethics goes beyond paper. Developing a Code of Ethics is a
process as much as an outcome. In assessing the need for a Code of Ethics, the
company should begin by studying its internal ethics climate, the amount and type of
ethical guidance its employees and officers receive, and the risk the company faces
without such a Code.22 As a second step, the company should seek buy-in from every
part of the organization, from senior management to workers, if the Code of Ethics is
to truly guide the company’s ethical practice. Most importantly, the company should
ensure that a broad consultative process takes place within the company.23 By the time
the Code of Ethics is submitted for the Board of Directors’ approval, every employee
should be familiar with it and have played a role in drafting it, a process that ensures
buy-in and helps with implementation.
The company must also recognize that the “tone at the top” matters, and that public
and demonstrable commitment by senior management and Directors is a key
component to the implementation of a Code of Ethics.
A Code of Ethics should be user-friendly (i.e. provide practical guidance to the
company’s management and employees on how to handle ethics problems that may
arise in the day-to-day course of business). In support of a Code of Ethics, the
company may wish to establish an ethics training program, as well as appoint an ethics
officer and create an ethics office and/or establish a Board of Directors’ Ethics
Committee to advise and educate officers and employees, and provide guarantees for
confidential counseling.

    company’s Code of Ethics for the Board of Directors’ approval, consisting of representatives from
    every level. See also: Kenneth Johnson and Igor Abramov, Business Ethics: A Manual for Managing a

4.	 Indonesian Code of Business Ethics
Indonesia through the National Committee on Governance (NCG) has adopted a
general Code of Ethics applicable to Indonesian companies. However, certain specific
types of companies (such as banks, insurance companies and securities companies) are
required to adopt professional ethics rules that establish the most important principles
and rules of business ethics.
Business Ethics and Code of Conduct was also developed by The NCG as Part III of
the CG Code. It stated that “to attain success in the long term, CG implementation
needs to be based on high integrity. Hence, a code of conduct that can be used as a
reference for a company’s organs and its employees in applying the values and business
ethics is required so that it may become a part of the company’s culture.
For that reason, a company must employ the following principles:
   1.	each company must have company values describing morals of the company in
      conducting its business.
   2.	materialize the moral attitude in conducting business, a company must formulate
      its business ethics that has been agreed by company’s organs and all employees. A
      continuous implementation of business ethics will constitute a company culture
      which is a manifestation of the company’s values.
   3.	the values and business ethics shall be further elaborated in a code of conduct to
      enable proper understanding and application.

Provisions covered by the Code are as follows:
   1.	Company Values
       1.1.	 Company values constitute the moral basis in achieving the company’s vision
             and mission. Therefore, before formulating the company values, it is
             necessary for the company to formulate its vision and mission.
       1.2.	 Although the company values are basically universal, however the
             formulation needs to take into account each respective business sector and
             character as well as the geographic location of a company.
       1.3.	 Company values that are universal include reliability, fairness and honesty.

       2.2.	 Sustainable implementation of a company values and business ethics will
             promote the creation of the company culture.
       2.3.	 Each company must formulate its business ethics and elaborated it further in

   3.	Code of Conduct
       3.1.	 Function of Code of Conduct
              a.	 Code of conduct is a translation of the company values and business
                  ethics that is useful as guidance for the company organs and all employees
                  of the company in conducting business activities.
              b.	 The code of conduct covers guidance regarding conflicts of interest,
                  presenting and receiving gifts and donations, compliance with laws and
                  regulations, confidentiality of information, and reporting of unethical

The Board of Commissioners              107                      The Chairman’s Checklist
As stipulated in the Indonesia’s CG Code, the management of a limited liability
company in Indonesia is adopting a two board system, namely the Board of
Commissioners and the Board of Directors, each of which has a clear authority
and responsibility based on their respective functions as mandated by the articles of
association and laws and regulations. Yet, they both have the responsibility to maintain
the company sustainability in the long term. Accordingly, the Board of Commissioners
and the Board of Directors must have the same perception regarding the company’s
vision, mission and values.
The Board of Commissioners as an organ of the company shall function and be
responsible collectively for overseeing and providing advices to the Board of Directors
and ensuring that the Company implements the GCG. However, the Board of
Commissioners is prohibited from participating in making any operational decision.1
An effective, professional and independent Board of Commissioners is essential for good
corporate governance. The Board of Commissioners acts in the best interests of the
company and its shareholders. It sets the strategy of the company, protects shareholder
rights, and oversees the Board of Directors and financial operations of the company.
While the Board of Commissioners cannot change the economic environment in
which a company operates, it can influence the performance of the company through
its strategic oversight and control over management. The Board of Commissioners’
activities may go entirely unnoticed when an economy is strong, share prices are rising
and everything appears to be going well. On the other hand, when things go badly, the
Board of Commissioners becomes the center of attention and the importance of the
Board of Commissioners becomes clear.

       Certainly, the catastrophic collapse of Enron in the U.S. served to focus
       public and government attention on boards and corporate governance. The
       following illustration shows some of the shortcomings of the Enron Board
       that contributed to the company’s downfall, the loss of many thousands of
       jobs and pensions, and ultimately a loss in faith in U.S. financial markets. On
       7 May 2002, the U.S. Senate concluded the following with respect to the role
       of the Board in Enron’s collapse and bankruptcy: 2
          •	 Fiduciary Failure: The Enron Board failed to safeguard Enron
             shareholders and contributed to the collapse of the seventh largest
             public company in the U.S.
          •	 Lack of Independence: Financial ties between the company and
             certain Board members compromised the independence of the Enron
             Board.
          •	 Conflicts of Interests: Despite clear conflicts of interests, the Enron
             Board approved an unprecedented arrangement allowing Enron’s Chief
             Financial Officer to establish and operate private equity funds that
             transacted business with Enron and profited at Enron’s expense.
          •	 Excessive Compensation: The Enron Board approved excessive
             compensation for company executives, failed to monitor the cumulative
             cash drain caused by Enron’s financial year 2000 annual bonus and
             performance unit plans, and failed to monitor or halt a company-
             financed, multi-million dollar, personal credit line.
          •	 High-Risk Accounting: The Enron Board knowingly allowed Enron to
             engage in high risk accounting practices.
          •	 Extensive Undisclosed Off-the-Book Activity: The Enron Board
             knowingly allowed Enron to conduct billions of dollars in off-the-book
             activity to make its financial condition appear better than it was, and
             failed to ensure adequate public disclosure of material off-the-books
             liabilities that contributed to Enron’s collapse.

The CG Code further states that the duty of the President Commissioner as primus
inter pares is to coordinate the activities of the Board of Commissioners. For the Board
of Commissioners to be able to effectively exercise its duties, the following principles
shall be observed:3
     1.	the composition of the Board of Commissioners shall enable it to make effective,
        right and timely decision and to act independently;
     2.	the members of the Board of Commissioners must be professional that possess
        the integrity and capability to enable them to carry out their function properly
        including to ensure that the Board of Directors shall observe the interest of all
        stakeholders;
     3.	the oversight and advisory function of the Board of Commissioners includes the
        acts of prevention, improvement, and suspension.

The legal regime of the Board of Commissioners is characterized by mandatory
requirements, but is also accompanied by a degree of flexibility enabling companies
to tailor their internal organization to their own needs and circumstances. This
chapter describes the authority, election and dismissal, composition, structure, working
procedures, duties and liabilities, evaluation, and remuneration of the Board of
Commissioners. It also discusses corporate governance principles and standards found in
the CG Regulations and other best practices.

The Board of Commissioners                               111                       The Board of Commissioners’ Authority
2.	 An Overview of the Board of Commissioners’ Authority
The ICLICL defines the Board of Commissioners’ authority.5 The Board of
Commissioners is responsible for supervising management policies, the running of the
management in general with regard to both the company and the company’s business
and provide advice to the Board of Directors. In essence, the role of the Board of
Commissioners is to supervise and not to manage. The article of association can assign
additional powers to the Board of Commissioners as well.
An AoA of a imited liability company stipulate the general duties of the Board of
Commissioners as follows:
     •	 conduct supervision over the management (that is, the Board of Directors) of the
        company;
     •	 perform any duty specifically provided for by the AoA, prevailing laws and
        regulations and/or the resolutions of the GMS;
     •	 perform their duties, authorities and responsibilities in accordance with the AoA
        of the company and the resolutions of the GMS;
     •	 act in the interest of the company and be accountable to the GMS;
     •	 examine and review the annual report prepared by the Board of Directors and
        sign it.
In relation to the duties of the Board of Commissioners as mentioned above, the Board
of Commissioners has to:
     •	 supervise the implementation of the working plan and the budget of the
        Company;
     •	 follow the development of the Company’s activities and in the event of a turmoil,
        report to the GMS as soon as possible and also give advice on the recovery steps
        that have to be taken;
     •	 propose to the GMS the appointment of the external auditor;
     •	 perform other supervisory activities determined by the GMS;
     •	 assess the Board of Directors’ periodic report and, at any time, give a response on
        the performance of the company and report the implementation of its duties to
        the Shareholder in a timely manner;
     •	 review or approve the working plan and the annual budget of the Company
        prepared and submitted by the Board of Directors at the latest on the thirtieth
        (30th) day of the first month after the new financial year commences;
     •	 if until the end of the given period , the Board of Commissioners has not given
        its review or approval, then the working plan and the annual budget submitted for
        the current financial year will prevail.

The Board of Commissioners                   112                 The Board of Commissioners’ Authority
In addition, ICL Article 116, 117 and 118 of the ICL states that the Board of
Commissioners shall:
   a)	 Take minutes of meetings of the Board of Commissioners and keep copies thereof;
   b)	Report to the Company regarding share ownership by them and/or their families
      in the Company and other Companies; and provide the GMS with reports
      concerning the performance of their supervisory task during the past financial year
      exercise.
   c)	 Based on the AoA grant of authority to the Board of Commissioners, the latter
       may approve or assist the Board of Directors in the performance of certain legal
       actions.
   d)	Pursuant to the articles of association or a GMS resolution, a Board of
      Commissioners may perform management activities in specified situations for a
      specified period of time.

As a rule, the Board of Commissioners has the authority to decide all issues that do not
fall under the authority of the GMS and other corporate bodies.




                                                                    Best Practices

       When additional powers and authorities are granted to the Board of
       Commissioners in the articles of association, these should correspond with
       the typical functions of the Board of Commissioners to avoid ambiguity with
       respect to the division of powers between the GMS, Board of Commissioners,
       President Director and/or Board of Directors.

       The Board of Commissioners sets6 the company’s strategic direction in the
       context of the market environment, its financial position and other factors. It is
       very important for the Board of Commissioners to determine the amount and
       type of risks the company is ready to take in accomplishing its goals.

       The strategic and business plans of the company should be reviewed and
       evaluated at least on an annual basis. The evaluation should also cover
       production, marketing and planned investments. Finally, the Board of
       Commissioners should approve a single document that contains financial
       projections for one year.

       When the GMS appoint new members of the Board of Commissioners, the
       Corporate Secretary should inform new members about the strategy and
       business plan of the company.

       Good corporate governance principles also suggest that:
         •	 The President Director and the member of the Board of Directors seek
            the approval of the Board of Commissioners for transactions that fall
            outside the scope of the financial and business plan (non-standard
            operations).
         •	 The company develop internal regulations with detailed procedures
            for the President Director and the Board of Directors for obtaining the
            approval of operations that fall outside the scope of the financial and
            business plan.
         •	 The Board of Commissioners be given the right to veto the decision of
            the President Director and the Board of Directors to implement any non-
            standard operations, provided such veto can be justified.
         •	 The company internal regulations determine rights and duties of
            the executive bodies, as well as the responsibility for acting not in
            accordance with these limitations.

       It is common practice internationally for the Board of Commissioners’
       Remuneration Committee,7 chaired and comprised of independent
       Commissioners, to set the remuneration of the President Director and other
       senior managers. Criteria for determining the level of compensation should
       include the tasks of the Executive Board member, the economic (financial)
       situation of the company, the performance outlook compared to competing
       companies, evaluation of the member’s past performance as well as the
       performance of the Executive Board as a whole, making connections
       between the future results of that member and his/her remuneration and
       professional opinions.




         For more information on executive remuneration, see Chapter 5, Section G.




                                                                              Best Practices

       The Board of Directors normally report to the Board of Commissioners. Most
       shareholders, in particular minority shareholders, are not able to effectively
       supervise management. This is the reason why this task is the responsibility
       of the Board of Commissioners, which oversees the Board of Directors on
       behalf of all shareholders.

       When establishing and selecting a Board of Directors, an appropriate balance
       must be struck between exercising oversight over the President Director
       and allowing him/her sufficient autonomy to conduct corporate affairs. The
       dangers of weak oversight are well known. Board of Directors can operate
       in their own personal interests and defraud shareholders. There are, on the
       other hand, dangers associated with excessive oversight. These include




7	   Remuneration Committee which is responsible to review and give recommendation regarding
     remuneration of Director and Board of Commissioner.

       micro-management and the politicization of managerial decision-making. Both
       weak and excessive oversight can lead to economic inefficiencies and legal
       problems. As a consequence, charters, internal regulations and other policy
       documents should be developed with a view towards dividing responsibilities
       among the governing bodies of the company on the basis of what body is
       best suited for a particular task. Managerial tasks should, clearly, be left to
       professional managers. Oversight tasks should be carried out by oversight
       bodies, such as the Supervisory Board, Internal Auditor or Audit Committee
       and GMS.




                                                                     Best Practices

       The Board of Commissioners must understand what to monitor. A number
       of key issues every Board of Commissioners will want to closely monitor
       should include the:
          •	 Company’s overall performance, especially in comparison to
             competing companies.
          •	 Board of Directors’ compliance with law and internal procedures,
             including on corporate governance, risk management and internal
             control, as well as ethics.
          •	 Board of Directors’ performance, both at the team and individual levels.
          •	 Implementation of the company’s strategy.
          •	 Company’s marketing and sales targets.
          •	 Company’s financial results.
          •	 Relations with key stakeholders, including the company’s
             shareholders, as well as employees, suppliers and customers.

       The Board of Commissioners can create competent committees in
       order to manage the company more efficiently and resolve complex
       problems. Creating the committee is of extreme importance if the Board
       of Commissioners consists of a large number of members or when the
       significant number of executive members is at the same time on the Board
       of Commissioners.

       International corporate governance practices shows that the Board of
       Commissioners can approve a number of internal documents dealing with a
       company’s:
          •	 Dividend policy.
          •	 Information policy.
          •	 Ethical standards.
          •	 Control and revision service.
          •	 Risk management.
          •	 Audits of the financial and business activity of the company.

        A key Board of Commissioners function is to establish a system of
        compliance with corporate procedures. The Board of Commissioners’
        responsibility is to take all necessary steps to prevent and resolve conflicts
        that may arise between shareholders and the company. It may appoint
        officers to implement systems of enforcement. The Board of Commissioners
        may also form a Conflict Resolution Committee to this end.




                                                                       Best Practices

        A listed company is required to make a public disclosure on the corporate
        governance of the company at the annual GMS.8 The Board of Commissioner
        is obliged to prepare the annual management and operation report of the
        company which should include the Corporate Governance Report of the
        company and submit it to the annual GMS.9 The Corporate Governance Report
        should enclose all important elements of the corporate governance structure
        and practice in the company.10 In that report the Board of Commissioners
        has to disclose how the company follows corporate governance principles
        and to explain any discrepancy from the CG Regulations. Finally, the Board of
        Commissioners is supposed to suggest improvements in the current corporate
        governance practice in the company.11

       Risk management is an important function of the Board of Commissioners.
       The Board of Commissioners should ensure that systems are established
       that enable the company to assess and control risks. Among other things,
       the Board of Commissioners should:
          •	 Approve risk management procedures and ensure compliance with
             such procedures (these procedures should provide that the company
             and its employees notify the Board of Commissioners promptly of any
             substantial deficiency in risk management mechanisms).
          •	 Analyze, evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the internal risk
             management procedures on a regular basis.
          •	 Develop adequate incentives for the executive bodies, departments
             and employees to apply internal control systems.
          •	 Establish a Risk Management Committee of the Board of
             Commissioners when necessary.
          •	 Ensure that the company complies with legislation and charter
             provisions.

The authority of the Board of Commissioners is stated in the Articles of
Association and the CG Code
The CG Code formulated the Board of Commissioners role and function as follows:
   •	 The Board of Commissioners is prohibited from participating in any operational
      decision making. In circumstances where the Board of Commissioners makes
      decisions regarding matters as stipulated in the articles of association or laws and
      regulations, such decisions shall be made within its supervisory function, so that
      decisions on operational activity shall remain the responsibility of the Board of
      Directors. The authority of the Board of Commissioners shall be carried out
      within their supervisory and advisory function;
   •	 In circumstances where it is deemed necessary in the interest of the company,
      the Board of Commissioners may impose sanction on members of the Board of
      Directors in the form of a suspension, subject to further determination by GMS;
   •	 In circumstances where a vacancy occurs in the Board of Directors or in a
      situation as stipulated by laws and regulations and the articles of association, the
      Board of Commissioners may carry out the function of the Board of Directors on
      a temporary basis;
   •	 To enable the exercise of its function, the members of the Board of
      Commissioners, collectively and individually, are entitled to have access to, and to
      obtain information regarding the company on a timely and complete basis;
   •	 The Board of Commissioners shall have rules and guidelines set out in a charter
      to ensure that its duties can be executed in an objective and effective manner. The
      charter can also be used as one of the tools for performance evaluation purposes;
   •	 In performing its oversight function, the Board of Commissioners shall submit an
      accountability report for overseeing the conduct of the management by the Board
      of Directors in the framework of obtaining the release and discharge (acquit et
      decharge) from GMS;

AoA of a limited liability company set out the authority of the Board of Commissioners
which commonly covers:
   •	 Members of the Board of Commissioners, whether collectively or individually,
      at any time during office hours of the company, shall have the right to enter any
      building, office or premise used by the Company and shall be entitled to examine
      accounts, letters, and other evidence, to examine and to review cash flow and
      others, and also authorize to have all information on every action that has been
      carried out by the Board of Directors.




The Board of Commissioners                  121                  The Board of Commissioners’ Authority
   •	 The Board of Commissioners has a right to request explanation from the Board of
      Directors on any matters relating to the Company, and each member of the Board
      of Directors is oblige to provide such required information.
   •	 If consider necessary, the Board of Commissioners have a right to request for
      professionals assistance, for a limited period and/or to form an audit committee in
      performing their duties, on the cost of the Company.

B.	           The Election and Dismissal of
              Commissioners
1.	 The Election and Term of Commissioners
Article 111 of the ICL stipulated that:
   1.	Members of Boards of Commissioners shall be appointed by GMS.
   2.	Initially, members of Boards of Commissioners shall be appointed by founders in
      the deeds of establishment.
   3.	Members of Boards of Commissioners shall be appointed for a definite period and
      may be reappointed.
   4.	Articles of Association shall stipulate procedures for the appointment, replacement,
      and dismissal of members of the Board of Commissioners and may also provide
      for the nomination of members of the Board of Commissioners.

CG Code Part IV stipulated that members of the Board of Commissioners are
appointed and terminated by GMS through a transparent process. For publicly
listed companies, State-Owned Enterprises, province and region- owned companies,
companies that raise and manage public funds, companies of which products or services
are widely used by public, and companies with extensive influence on environment, the
process of evaluating the candidates for the member of the Board of Commissioners
shall be conducted prior to the GMS by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.
The appointment of an independent commissioner shall have considered the opinion
of the minority shareholders which shall be obtained through the Nomination and
Remuneration committee.

                                                                             Best Practices

       Companies can maintain their vitality and ability to adapt to new challenges
       by changing the composition of their Board of Commissioners. Commissioners
       may indeed lose some of their (independent) edge if they remain on a Board
       too long. A company may wish to impose term-limits, either for the entire
       Board of Commissioners or a certain percentage, to keep its members
       focused. Either way, reappointment should not be automatic, but a conscious
       decision by the shareholder(s) and the Commissioners concerned.

       In accordance with French law, for example, a Commissioner’s mandate
       may not exceed six years unless the GMS decides to renew this mandate,
       and Commissioners older than 70 years may not exceed one-third of Board
       membership. In this respect, the Hellebuyk Commission recommends that
       Commissioners’ mandates should not exceed four years and the number
       of Commissioners over 65 years should not exceed one-third of the Board
       membership.12 The French Corporate Governance Code (Vienot II) provides in
       turn that the duration of a Commissioner’s term of office, set by the internal
       regulations, should not exceed a maximum of four years, in order to enable
       shareholders to rule upon their appointment with sufficient frequency.13

       Shareholders should receive sufficient information to determine the abilities
       of Board of Commissioners nominees to fulfill their duties and, if applicable, to
       ascertain their independence. Some useful items of information include:
          •	 The identity of the candidate.
          •	 The identity of the shareholder (or the group of shareholders) that
             nominated the candidate.
          •	 The age and educational background of the candidate.
          •	 The professional qualifications and experience.
          •	 The positions held by the candidate during the last five years.
          •	 The positions held by the candidate at the moment of his/her nomination.
          •	 The Evaluation Report about the candidate’s up-to-date work for (with)
             the company as a member of the Board of Commissioners, in case of his/
             her reappointment.
          •	 The nature of the relationship the candidate has with the company.
          •	 Other Board of Commissioners memberships or official positions held by
             the candidate.
          •	 Other nominations of the candidate for Board of Commissioners or
             official positions.
          •	 The candidate’s relationship with affiliated persons of the company.
          •	 The candidate’s relationship with major business partners of the
             company.
          •	 Information related to the financial status of the candidate and other
             circumstances that may affect the duties and independence of the
             candidate as a Board member.
          •	 The refusal of the candidate to respond to an information request of the
             company.

       Information about Board of Commissioners nominees is one item of the AGM
       materials that must be made available to shareholders before the AGM (i.e.
       20 days prior to the AGM). It must be made available at the premises of the
       company’s head office and any other places specified in the AGM notification.
       This information (included in the AGM material) should be posted on the
       internet, preferably on the company’s website. Electronic dissemination is a
       simple and cost-effective method of allowing broad public access.

2.	 The Removal of Commissioners
Article 119 of the ICLt regulates that the provisions with regard to the dismissal of
members of Boards of Directors contemplated in Article 105 shall apply mutatis
mutandis to the dismissal of members of Boards of Commissioners.
Article 105 stipulates the following:
   1)	Members of Boards of Directors may be dismissed at any time by virtue of
      GMS resolutions stating the reason therefor.
   2)	The resolutions to dismiss members of Boards of Directors shall be adopted
      after the directors concerned have been given the opportunity to defend
      themselves in the GMS.
   3)	In the event that a resolution to dismiss a member of a Board of Directors
      as mentioned above is adopted by a resolution outside a GMS in accordance
      with the provisions contemplated in Article 9114, the member of the Board of
      Directors concerned shall first be notified of the planned dismissal and be given
      the opportunity to defend himself/herself before the resolution for dismissal is
      adopted.
   4)	The opportunity to defend himself/herself before the resolution for dismissal is
      adopted shall not deemed necessary in the event the relevant director show no
      objection against such dismissal.
   5)	The dismissals of the members of the Board of Directors shall come into effect
      as from:
      a.	 the closing of GMS contemplated in number (1);
      b.	 the date of the resolution contemplated in number (3);
      c.	 other date determined in the GMS resolution contemplated in number (1);
      d.	 other date determined in the GMS resolution contemplated in number (3).

In line with the provisions contemplated in the ICL, the Indonesian CG Code stated
that termination of members of the Board of Commissioners shall be effected
by GMS for a reasonable cause and after the relevant member of the Board of
Commissioners has been given an opportunity to defend himself or herself.15




14	 Article 91 of the ICL regulates that Shareholders may also adopt binding resolution without convening
    GMS provided that all shareholders with affirmative vote give their approval in writing by signing the
    relevant proposal.

       Both international practices and the ICLICL allow the AoA to provide for
       additional grounds for dismissing Board of Commissioners members. Grounds
       may include providing false information to the company as a candidate for
       the Board of Commissioners, willful neglect of Board of Commissioners
       responsibilities, or conviction of a criminal act.

C.	           The Composition of the Board of
              Commissioners
1.	 The Number of Commissioners
The numbers of commissioners shall be limited to the numbers set out in AoA. A Board
of Commissioners must have a minimum of one Commissioner or more.16 Boards of
Commissioners consisting of more than 1 (one) member shall constitute a council and
no member of the Board of Commissioners may act alone but rather on the basis of a
resolution of the Board of Commissioners.17
The ICL Article 108 paragraph (5) stated that Companies whose business activities are
related to the collection and/or management of the public’s funds, Companies who
issue acknowledgements of indebtedness to the public, and Public Companies must have
at least 2 (two) members of their Boards of Commissioners.




                                                                         Best Practices

       Companies should choose a Board of Commissioners size that will enable it
       to:18
          •	 Hold productive and constructive discussions
          •	 Make prompt and rational decisions
          •	 Efficiently organize the work of its committees, if these are established.

       The number of Commissioners should be guided by legal requirements, the
       specific needs of the company and its shareholders.




Having either too few or too many commissioners can be a problem for effective
decision-making. A small Board of Commissioners may not allow the company to
benefit from an appropriate mix-of-skills and breadth of experience. A larger Board of

The Board of Commissioners                   128            The Composition of the Board of Commissioners
Commissioners is typically more difficult to manage and can make consensus building
a time-consuming and difficult task. The challenge in selecting the correct Board of
Commissioners size is striking an appropriate balance.
The CG Code stated that The composition of the Board of Commissioners shall be of
sufficient size that suits the complexity of the business of the company by taking into
account the effectiveness in decision making.



2.	 Who Can Be a Commissioner?
Under the ICL. A commissioner is an individual capable of performing legal actions
except for those who in the 5 (five) years before their appoinment:19
      a.	were declared bankrupt;
      b.	were members of a Board of Directors or Board of Commissioners who were
         declared to be at fault causing a Company to be declared bankrupt; or
      c.	 sentenced for crimes which caused financial losses to the state and/or which were
          related to the financial sector.

Under the company’s AoA. The company’s AoA may also set out additional criteria
and conditions which a commissioner or a prospective commissioner must satisfy,
provided that such requirements do not violate basic rights of shareholders.20
Other requirements. The commissioners of a company which is subject to industry-
specific regulations, such as a bank, an insurance company or a securities company,
may be subject to stricter requirements.21 It would be prudent for companies which
are subject to industry-specific regulations to investigate their industry’s requirements
carefully while selecting commissioners.
For issuers and public companies, candidates for the Board of Commissioners must
meet the requirements stipulated under Decision of the Chairman of Financial Services
Authority, as follows:22
      1.	Have a good character and moral;
      2.	Are legally competent;

   3.	Have never been declared bankrupt or been the Director or Commissioner who
      were responsible for causing a company to go bankrupt within 5 (five) previous
      years before appointed;
   4.	Have never been found guilty of criminal act within 6 (six) years before appointed.

         For more information on the fiduciary duties of a director, see Section F.2 of this Chapter.




                                                                                Best Practices

       At the beginning of his/her term, every Board of Commissioners member must
       fulfill all the conditions required by the law, corporate governance regulations
       and internal company documents. If something changes in that respect during
       the term, the Board members should inform the President of the Board. All
       the conditions for the Board members shall be applicable to Commissioners
       elected after a Board of Commissioners vacancy.

       Upon the Board of Commissioners’ proposal, the GMS shall adopt a resolution
       about the necessary conditions for the election of the Board members, taking
       into consideration the nature of the company’s activities and its purposes.
       These conditions can be general, if applicable to all Commissioners, and
       specific, if applicable to a particular Commissioner.

       To avoid conflicts of interest, individuals should not be elected to the
       company’s Board of Commissioners when they are:
         •	 A Commissioner of a competing company
         •	 A manager of a competing company
         •	 An employee of a competing company.

       Nominees for the Board of Commissioners should also not be related to
       suppliers, affiliated persons, as well as employees of the independent
       External Auditor.

Commissioners should possess the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the
work of the Board of Commissioners. Figure 4 illustrates the personal characteristics
and competencies required for this task.
The CG Code states the following23:
   •	 Members of the Board of Commissioners shall have the capability and integrity
      required to ensure that the oversight and advisory function can be carried out
      properly.
   •	 Members of the Board of Commissioners are prohibited from utilizing the
      company for his/her personal, family, business group and or other parties’
      interests;
   •	 Members of the Board of Commissioners shall understand and comply with the
      articles of association and the laws and regulations as related to their duties;
   •	 Members of the Board of Commissioners shall understand and implement the
      GCG Code.

                                         Company Practices in Indonesia

       Indonesian companies feel that work experience within the company
       and the industry as well as personal maturity are important criteria when
       electing commissioners. Other popular criteria include contacts and loyalty
       to the company as well as independence, expertise and leadership are also
       considered important. It can thus be inferred that the benefits of independent
       commissioners are already fully understood by Indonesian companies.




There are no legal requirements with regard to the qualification criteria of
commissioners. As a result, such criteria need to be specified elsewhere. For example,
companies may find it useful to include qualifications in their internal company
documents, such as their AoA, internal regulations or other company policies.
Notwithstanding the above, there are of course requirements applicable to companies
which are regulated by industry-specific laws regulations, such as banks, insurance
companies, securities companies, and so on, in which case the commissioners of
the Board of Commissioners may need to satisfy certain qualification requirements.
For instance, in addition to the requirements set out in Section 2 (Who can be
a commissioner?), in setting out the qualification of members of the Board of
Commissioners, the company shall take into account provisions regarding dominant
position stipulated under Article 26 of Law No.5 of 1999 regarding Prohibition
of Monopoly Practice and Unfair Competition. Again, it would be prudent for
companies which are subject to industry-specific regulations to examine their industry’s
requirements carefully while selecting their commissioners.

                                                                         Best Practices

       The article of association should set forth the qualification criteria for
       commissioners. Commissioners should have the following qualifications:
         •	 The trust of shareholders (reflected in their supporting votes for such
            commissioners), other commissioners, directors, managers, and
            employees of the company
         •	 The ability to relate to the interests of all stakeholders and make well-
            reasoned decisions
         •	 The professional expertise and education needed to be effective
         •	 International business experience, knowledge of national issues and
            trends, knowledge of the market, products, and competitors
         •	 The ability to translate knowledge and experience into solutions.
       It may, however, be difficult for the company to determine whether a potential
       commissioner possesses these qualifications. Moreover, a brief description
       of such qualifications in the company’s article of association may lead to
       ambiguity and thus be of little use. Instead, companies may wish to include
       the above criteria in their internal regulations or other internal documents.
       Indeed, many companies in the U.S. use corporate governance guidelines for
       this purpose.
       Shareholders should be informed of the commissioners’ qualifications and the
       list of candidates for the Board of Commissioners should indicate whether, at
       the time of election, the candidate is or will be:
           •	 The President Director
           •	 An Board of Directors member
           •	 An officer or employee of the company
           •	 Able to meet the qualifications of an independent commissioner.
       The background of Board of Commissioners candidates should be checked
       for a criminal record and for past administrative offences that are not de
       minimis in nature, and to see whether such candidates meet the requirements
       set out in the ICL, the CG Regulations and the AoA of the company.
       In every moment during its term, the Board of Commissioners should comprise
       of members who in totality have the knowledge, capability and professional
       experience necessary for the successful direction of the company. At least
       one member needs to have the knowledge and experience of running finance
       and accounting in listed companies.

4.	 Categories of Commissioners
International practices distinguish between different categories of commissioners
according to the degree to which such commissioners are involved (or related to) in
the affairs of the company, and divides them into three categories of executive, non-
executive, and independent commissioners. In Indonesia, categories of commissioners
regulated in the Article 120 of the ICL, which consists of Independent Commissioner
and Delegated Commissioner.




                                             Company Practices in Indonesia

       Many Indonesian public companies are controlled by a single majority
       shareholder or a group of shareholders who are well informed about
       the affairs of the company and able to closely monitor the company’s
       management. The remaining ownership is often widely dispersed and many
       of these, often minority, shareholders lack the resources and information to
       effectively monitor management and defend themselves against the potential
       abuses of large shareholders. In these types of companies, independent
       commissioners have an especially important role:

       (i)	 Independent Commissioners
            According to the CG Regulations, approximately one-third of
            commissioners on the Board of Commissioners of a listed company should
            be independent commissioners.24 The Indonesia’s CG Code stipulates that
            the number of Independent Commissioners shall be such as to ensure
            that the control mechanism runs effectively and in accordance with laws
            and regulations. One of the Independent Commissioner shall have an
            accounting or finance background.

       Most international and national codes of corporate governance recommend
       that Boards of Commissioners be composed of a majority of Commissioners
       who contribute:
          •	 An outside perspective and greater impartiality in their judgments
          •	 Additional external experience and knowledge
          •	 Useful contacts.

       In most EU countries, Commissioner normally exercise oversight of the
       financial and strategic decision-making functions of the company. Apart
       from these, there are three areas in need of disinterested monitoring by
       Commissioner:
          •	 Nomination of directors
          •	 Remuneration of President Director and member of Board of Directors
          •	 Internal and external audit.

       In the U.K., the Higgs report groups the role of the Commissioner around four
       issues:25
          1.	Strategy
          	 Commissioners should constructively challenge and contribute to the
             development of the company’s strategy.
          2.	Performance
          	 Commissioner should scrutinize the performance of management in
             meeting agreed upon goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of
             performance.
          3.	Risk
          	 Commissioner should satisfy themselves that financial information is
             accurate, and that financial controls and systems of risk management
             are robust and defensible.
          4.	People
          	 Commissioners are responsible for determining appropriate levels of
             remuneration for Directors, have a prime role in appointing, and where
             necessary removing, President Director, and in succession planning.

Independent Commissioners
International practices distinguishes between independent commissioners and non-
independent commissioners. Good corporate governance practice suggests that, an
independent commissioner is an individual who has not received substantial financial or
other benefits from such company in the last three years, such as:
   •	 have not been an employee of the company or a shareholder of 10% or more of
      the company
   •	 have not paid to or received from the company a substantial amount, or been a
      major shareholder of a company that has paid to or received from the company
      a substantial amount (the threshold of such amount should be determined by the
      GMS and set out in the AoA of the company)
   •	 have not been an External Auditor of the company.
         For more information on related persons, see Chapter 4, Section C.2.




                                                                              Best Practices

       Commissioners who are independent can make a substantial contribution
       to important decisions of the company, especially in evaluating executive
       performance, setting executive and commissioner remuneration, reviewing
       financial statements, and in resolving corporate conflicts. Independent
       commissioners give investors additional confidence that the Board of
       Commissioners’ deliberations will be free of obvious bias. Companies are
       advised to disclose information about independent commissioners in the
       annual report.

       IFC defines “Independent Commissioner” as a Commissioner who:
          1.	 Has not been employed by the Company or its Related Parties in the past
              five years.
          2.	 Is not, and is not affiliated with a company that is an advisor or
              consultant to the Company or its Related Parties.
          3.	 Is not affiliated with a significant customer or supplier of the Company or
              its Related Parties.

              over the Company) or such person’s brother, sister, parent, grandparent,
              child, cousin, aunt, uncle, nephew or niece or a spouse, widow, in-law,
              heir, legatee and successor of any of the foregoing (or any trust or
              similar arrangement of which any such persons or a combination thereof
              are the sole beneficiaries) or the executor, administrator or personal
              representative of any Person described in this sub-paragraph who is
              deceased or legally incompetent.

       (For the purposes of this definition, a person shall be deemed to be “affiliated”
       with a party if such person (i) has a direct or indirect ownership interest in;

       the Company, any person or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under

          Has the Commissioner paid to or received from the company a substantial amount
          apart from a fee received as Commissioner?26
          Has the Commissioner been, directly or indirectly, a shareholder of more than
          10% of the company or an associated company (including affiliated person) of the
          company? Has the Commissioner been a member of the Board of Commissioners or
          Board of Directors of such a shareholder?
          Has the Commissioner had within the last three years a significant business
          relationship with the company or a related person or the company? Has the
          Commissioner been in the same period a shareholder, partner, External Auditor,
          commissioner, member of the Board of Commissioners or the board of Directors of
          the entity that had a significant business relationship with the company?
          Has the Commissioner been a member of the Board of Director of another company
          in which an director of the company is a member of the Board of Directors?
          Is the Commissioner a representative of the significant shareholder?
          Has the Commissioner served as a member of the Board of Commissioners at least
          six terms in a row, even if he/she was an independent member?
          Is the Commissioner in any of the above-mentioned relationships with an
          associated company, controlling shareholders of the associated company,
          Commissioner or members of the Board of Commissioners or Board of Directors of
          the associated company?



       If a Commissioner ceases to be independent, the Commissioner should
       immediately notify the Board of Commissioners with an explanation of why
       the criteria of independence no longer apply. The Board of Commissioners is
       then advised to:
           •	 Notify shareholders that the Commissioner is no longer independent
           •	 Disclose information about independent Commissioner in the annual
              report of the company, giving shareholders the opportunity to verify any
              changes in the status of Independent Commissioner.
       In any event, Independent Commissioner should refrain from actions that may
       compromise their independent status.
       Other international and national codes of corporate governance have
       similar definitions for Independent Commissioner. In the U.K. for example, a
       Commissioner is considered independent when the Board of Commissioners



26	 The threshold of such amount should be determined by the GMS and set out in the charter of the
    company.

       determines that the Commissioner is independent in character and judgment,
       and there are no relationships or circumstances which could affect, or
       appear to affect, the Commissioner’s judgment. Such relationships and
       circumstances would include those, in which the Commissioner:27
          •	 Is a former employee of the company or group, and his/her employment
             (or any other material connection) has ended less than five years ago.
          •	 Has, or has had, within the last three years, a material business
             relationship with the company either directly, or as a partner,
             shareholder, Commissioner, or senior employee of a body that has had
             such a relationship with the company.
          •	 Has received or receives additional remuneration from the company
             apart from a Commissioner’s fee, participates in the company’s share
             option or a performance related pay scheme, or is a member of the
             company’s pension scheme
          •	 Has close family ties with any of the company’s advisers, Commissioner
             or senior employees
          •	 Holds cross-directorships or has significant links with other
             Commissioners through involvement in other companies or bodies
          •	 Represents a significant shareholder
          •	 Has served on the Board of Commissioners for more than 10 years.
       The large number of definitions with their detailed qualifications may give rise
       to confusion. In reality, understanding and defining independence need not be
       complex. The Council of Institutional Investors (CII), a grouping of some of the
       world’s largest institutional investors, defines an Independent Commissioner
       plainly in the following way: “Stated most simply, an Independent
       Commissioner is a person whose commissionership constitutes his/her only
       connection to the corporation.” This cuts to the heart of the matter. For those
       interested in learning how to apply this simple definition in practice, the CII
       also lists specific circumstances that compromise independence.28
       Finally, it should be noted that Commissioner independence is not a panacea.
       The New York Stock Exchange is a telling example. In 2003, the exchange
       was enveloped in a scandal over the excessive compensation of its Chief
       Executive Officer, despite the fact that compensation levels had been
       approved by a committee staffed and chaired by Independent Commissioner.

D.	           The Structure and Committees of the
              Board of Commissioners
1.	 President Commissioner
The article 108 ICL regulated that Board of Commissioners shall consist of 1 (one) or
more members. In addition, the articles of association of a company usually stipulate
that in the event of a Board of Commissioners composed of more than 1 (one) member,
one of them should be appointed as the President Commissioner.
Further, Indonesia’s CG Code stated in Part IV C that each of the members of the
Board of Commissioners, including the President Commissioner, has equal position.
The duty of the President Commissioner of the Board of Commissioners as primus inter
pares is to coordinate the activities of the Board of Commissioners.




                                                                    Best Practices

       The ability of the President Commissioner to properly discharge his/her duties
       depends on his/her being vested with sufficient and appropriate powers,
       and on his/her personal and professional qualifications. The President
       Commissioners should have an outstanding professional reputation and
       should be of the highest integrity, be committed to the interests of the
       company, and enjoy the trust of shareholders and the other commissioners.

       There should be a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the company
       between the running of the Board of Commissioners and the executive
       responsibility for the running of the company’s day-to-day operations—both
       on paper, as required by law, and in actual practice. Companies should define
       the authority of the President Commissioner, as well as that of the President
       Director, in as much detail as possible in the internal regulations.

       The President Commissioner’s other duties, or responsibilities, should be
       defined in the internal regulations for the Board of Commissioners. In addition,
       the company may wish to draft a position description, or terms of reference,
       which could contain the following elements:29

       The President Commissioner:
          •	 Provides leadership and ensures for the Board of Commissioners’
             effectiveness.
          •	 Establishes, implements and reviews procedures that govern the Board
             of Commissioners’ work.
          •	 Schedules a Board of Commissioners meeting calendar and coordinates
             it with the Board’s committee chairs.
          •	 Organizes and presents meeting agendas and ensures that all
             commissioners receive appropriate information on a timely basis.
          •	 Periodically interacts with the President Director and acts as a liaison
             between the Board of Commissioners and executives.
          •	 Ensures for accurate, timely, and clear information to and from the other
             commissioners.
          •	 Ensures for effective communication with shareholders
          •	 Arranges regular evaluations of the Board of Commissioners’
             performance, as well as of its committees and individual commissioners.
          •	 Facilitates the effective contribution of independent commissioners and
             enables constructive relations between commissioners.
          •	 Carries out other duties as requested by the GMS and the Board of

2.	 Committees Established by a Board of Commissioners
As the business environment continues to become more complex, the demands on and
responsibilities of the Board of Commissioners and its members continue to grow. The
Board of Commissioners’ committees are widely considered a key tool for Board of
Commissioners to overcome and effectively deal with such challenges.
In carrying out its duty, the Board of Commissioners may form committees. Any
proposal from the committees shall be submitted to the Board of Commissioners for
approval.30
More specifically, committees:
   •	 Permit the Board of Commissioners to handle a greater number of complex issues
      in a more efficient manner, by allowing specialists to focus on specific issues and
      provide detailed analysis and recommendations back to the Board.
   •	 Allow the Board of Commissioners to develop subject-specific expertise on the
      company’s operations, most notably on financial reporting, risk, and internal
      control.
   •	 Enhance the objectivity and independence of the Board of Commissioners’
      judgment, insulating it from potential undue influence of managers and controlling
      shareholders.

It is of crucial importance that committees are understood to be part of the Board of
Commissioners. It is the Board of Commissioners that establish committees, set their
terms of reference through committee internal regulations, appoint their members and
turn their recommendations into action.31
The Board of Commissioners must issue detailed regulations on the establishment and
the duties and responsibilities for each Board of Commissioners committee and its
members.

a.	 Types of Committees
       A company may establish several types of committees, as discussed in more detail
       in Table 4 below, if it decides that it is necessary. Committees are not a must.
       ICL, the Article of Association and the CG Code require that a company should
       establish committees, although they do recommend that companies establish
       committees if they see that committees would facilitate the operations of the

The Board of Commissioners                 142                         Structure and Committees
       Board of Commissioners. Both the CG Code and the ICL suggest that the Board
       of Commissioners may form committees in order to assist it in its activities.
       The types of committees suggested by the CG Code include Audit Committee,
       Nomination and Remuneration Committee, Risk Policy Committee and Corporate
       Governance Committee. The CG Code also allows companies to set up other
       committees according to resolutions of the GMS.
       For publicly listed companies, state-owned enterprises, province and region-owned
       companies, companies that raise and manage public funds, companies of which
       products or services are widely used by public, and companies with extensive
       influence on environment, an Audit Committee shall be established, whereas other
       committees are formed as required.32
       It should be noted that a large number of committees can be hard to manage and
       may lead to a fragmentation of the Board of Commissioners. It is advisable to
       establish committees as the need arises, starting with the most critical ones, and
       then establishing others as experience is gained. The Board of Commissioners
       may establish either permanent or ad-hoc Board committees. The most important
       committee from the shareholder perspective is the Audit Committee. Some of the
       committees that a company should consider establishing are described in Table 4.

       Commissioners, provided that resolutions of a committee are only valid and
       enforceable if a majority of members of such committee who are present and vote
       at the meeting of the committee are also members of the Board of Commissioners.

c.	    The Composition of Board of Commissioners Committees
       The number of members on a Board of Commissioners committee is determined
       by the Board of Commissioners. In every committee, at least one member
       should be a member of the Board of Commissioners and at least one member
       should fulfill all the conditions for an independent commissioner. The Board of
       Commissioners should appoint one member as Chairman of each committee.
       Other parties, most notably managers, who are not members of the Board of
       Commissioners committee, may be invited to present or elaborate on particular
       issues, but have observer status only, i.e., are precluded from conferring or deciding
       on particular issues.




                                                                      Best Practices

       Experienced and knowledgeable commissioners should staff Board of
       Commissioners committees. There needs to be a sufficient number of
       members to accomplish the work at hand. Since the work of Board of
       Commissioners committees may involve time-consuming reviews, the
       participation of commissioner in multiple Board of Commissioners committees
       should be restricted. Before allowing participation in multiple committees,
       Board of Commissioners should review all the activities assigned to the
       committee, estimate time necessary for effective realization of these
       activities, as well as free time potential members can dedicate to the work of
       the committee. Board of Commissioners committees may occasionally require
       the assistance of outside advisors. However, these advisors must not receive
       Board of Commissioners committee member status.

       Many stock exchanges further recommend that Board of Commissioners
       committees be composed of and/or chaired by independent commissioners.
       The listing requirements of some stock exchanges, for example the New
       York Stock Exchange, go further and require a majority of independent
       commissioners, as well as the Audit and Human Resources Committees to be
       composed solely of independent commissioners.

3.	 The President of Supporting Committee of a Board of
    Commissioners
The Chairman of a committee is responsible for its effectiveness, regardless of his/her
other duties.




                                                                   Best Practices

       The Chairman of a committee plays an important role in organizing its work.
       Ideally, committees should be chaired by independent commissioners. This
       holds particularly true for the Audit and Remuneration Committees which,
       according to best corporate governance practices, are to be chaired by
       independent commissioners.

       The Chairman of the committee should keep the President of the Board of
       Commissioners informed about its work. In addition, the committee Chairmen
       should be present at the GMS to respond to shareholders’ questions.

       A committee Chairman should:
         •	 At least once in three months inform the Board of Commissioners about
            all the questions important for the committee’s work
         •	 Without undue delay submit all data requested by the Board of
            Commissioners
         •	 Take necessary administrative measures to ensure that the committee
            performs its tasks.

E.	           The Working Procedures of The Board
              of Commissioners
The Board of Commissioners is a governing body, which operates according to
procedures defined by the ICL, the AoA, or the internal regulations of the company.


1.	 The President and Board of Commissioners Meetings
The authority of the President Commissioner is regulated in the Articles of Association
or internal regulations of the company.




                                                                     Best Practices

       More specifically, the President Commissioner facilitates the work of the
       Board of Commissioners by:
         •	 Facilitating decision-making on agenda items.
         •	 Encouraging open discussions on issues in a friendly and constructive
            atmosphere.
         •	 Providing Board of Commissioners members with an opportunity to
            express their points of view on matters being discussed.
         •	 Steering the Board of Commissioners towards a consensus.

       In doing so, the President Commissioner should act with conviction and, at all
       times, in the best interests of the company. Moreover, the internal regulations
       or other internal documents should impress upon the President Commissioner
       the responsibility to:
          •	 Encourage commissioners to freely express their opinions on agenda
             items and other issues.
          •	 Discuss opinions of commissioners openly.
          •	 Initiate the drafting of the Board of Commissioners’ decisions.

2.	 The Board of Commissioners Meetings
Board Meetings.
The Board of Commissioners must follow legal requirements in making valid decisions,
or risk having them overruled by the courts upon complaints.



                                                                   Best Practices

       Commissioners should ensure that Board of Commissioners and committee
       meetings are well-organized and held on a regular basis. Commissioners
       should actively participate in the Board of Commissioners meetings and each
       director should:
          •	 Take part in discussions and voting
          •	 Participate in the work of Board of Commissioners committees, if he/she
             is a member of the committee
          •	 Demand a Board of Commissioners meeting to discuss matters of
             concern
          •	 Notify the Board of Commissioners when he/she is unable to attend
             meetings.

       In addition, Board of Commissioners members should have sufficient
       time for the performance of their functions. The Board of Commissioners
       should develop rules to regulate the participation of its members on other
       companies’ Boards of Commissioners. The general rule for directorship
       on multiple Board of Commissioners should, however, be based on time-
       constraints. If a commissioner does not have the time, he/she should not take
       on the responsibility.




Written Resolutions.
Written Resolutions. Except to the extent that the AoA or internal regulations require
action by the Board of Commissioners taken at a meeting, an action required or
permitted to be taken by the Board of Commissioners may be taken without a
meeting. In regards with this issue, Article 116 of the ICL stipulated that the Board
of Commissioners shall be obliged to prepare a minute meeting of the Board of



The Board of Commissioners                  149                             Working Procedures
Commissioners which contain all proceedings and resolutions taken and keep the copy
thereof. Further, a standard AoA of a limited liability company may stipulate as follows:
   •	 Any matters that are discussed and decided in the Board of Commissioners’
      Meeting should be drawn-up in the Minutes of Meeting. The Minutes of Meeting
      shall be prepared by a person who attended the meeting and assigned by the
      Chairman of the Meeting, and the Minutes of Meeting shall be signed by the
      Chairman of the Meeting and another member of the Board of Commissioners
      appointed by the Meeting.
   •	 The Board of Commissioners may also make a valid decision without convening
      a Board of Commissioners’ Meeting, provided that all members of the Board of
      Commissioners have been notified in writing and all members of the Board of
      Commissioners have granted their approval to such written proposal and signed
      such resolution.
   •	 A resolution made in such manner shall have the same force as a valid resolution
      made in a Board of Commissioners’ Meeting.



3.	 The First Board of Commissioners Meeting
The first meeting of the Board of Commissioners is not regulated in the ICL nor
the CG Code, and so the Board of Commissioners or the newly appointed one is
encouraged to have it regulated in its article of association or manual along with other
internal arrangements.




                                                                    Best Practices

       The first meeting of a newly elected Board of Commissioners should be held
       no later than one month after it is elected. As a matter of convenience, the
       first Board of Commissioners meeting can be organized to follow the GMS. In
       addition, it is recommended that the first Board of Commissioners meeting:
          •	 Define and confirm the priorities of the Board of Commissioners.
          •	 Establish committees if appropriate.
          •	 Elect committee chairman.

       A company may also wish to develop an induction training for new Board of
       Commissioners members that cover, among other topics, an overview of the
       company’s:
          •	   Industry and sector of operation
          •	   Business operations
          •	   Current financial situation
          •	   Strategy
          •	   Business risks
          •	   Key employees’ background and skills.




4.	 The Schedule of Board of Commissioners Meetings
The article of association or the internal regulations/manual can specify the procedures
for convening and conducting Board of Commissioners meetings.




                                                                   Best Practices

       The Board of Commissioners should have a working plan in addition to a
       schedule for meetings that includes the topics to be addressed. The Board of
       Commissioners should hold regular meetings. The Board of Commissioners
       should meet at least four times a year. The Board of Commissioners may,
       however, wish to hold meetings as often as deemed necessary.

       Here is some guidance on conducting productive and efficient Board of
       Commissioners meetings:
         •	 Develop an annual calendar of meetings. This will allow commissioners
            to slot the meetings in their agendas. Note that this calendar should
            serve as a guide, i.e. the Board of Commissioners should hold additional
            meetings when warranted and, vice versa, cancel meetings when there
            are no issues to be resolved.




The Board of Commissioners                   151                            Working Procedures
          •	 Set an agenda well in advance. Commissioners will thus be able to
             properly focus on and prepare for the task at hand. The President
             Commissioner may wish to send a draft agenda in advance, allowing for
             comments and suggestions.
          •	 Place important issues at the beginning of the agenda. Commissioners
             often have other commitments and might need to leave early.
             Scheduling meetings for the early, rather than latter part of the day, is
             thus often more conducive to foster interactive discussions.

       In addition to regular meetings, the Board of Directors needs to organize a
       meeting to review and approve the annual report. This Board meeting needs
       to take place at most two months prior to the AGM.

       A standard article of association of a limited liability company may include
       provisions on the Board of Commissioners meetings, such as a Board of
       Commissioners’ meeting may be held at any time if deemed necessary.




5.	 Who Has the Right to Convene a Board of
    Commissioners Meeting?

The President Commissioner normally convenes regular Board of Commissioners
meetings. However, an article of association of a company may state that a Board
of Commissioners’ meeting may be held by one or more member of the Board of
Commissioners, or upon a written request of the Board of Directors, or upon the
written request of one or more shareholders jointly holding at least 1/10 (one-tenth) of
the total number of shares with valid voting rights issued by the Company.


6.	 Proper Notice for Board of Commissioners Meetings
The necessary information and materials should be sent to commissioners together with
the notice of the Board of Commissioners meeting sufficiently in advance to enable
each commissioner to thoroughly review the information.




The Board of Commissioners                   152                              Working Procedures
Regulations on notice for the Board of Commissioners Meetings are usually stipulated
in the article of association and further stated in more details in the charter/manual. For
example a public company’s article of association regulates as follows:
   •	 Notice for a Board of Commissioners Meeting shall be made by a member of
      the Board of Commissioners which is authorized to represent the Board of
      Commissioners
   •	 Notice for a Board of Commissioners’ Meeting must be made in writing and
      delivered directly to each of the members of the Board of Commissioners with
      sufficient receipt, or by registered mail or courier services, or telex, or facsimile, or
      electronic mail (e-mail), no later than 3 (three) days prior to the said meeting, not
      including the date of the notice and the date of the meeting, or within a shorter
      time period for an urgent matter.
   •	 The notice for the Board of Commissioners’ Meeting must contain the agenda,
      the date, the time and the venue of the meeting. The Board of Commissioners’
      Meeting shall be held within the domicile of the Company or the place where the
      Company’s activities are conducted.




                                                                        Best Practices

       Commissioners should properly prepare themselves to participate effectively
       in meetings. They should not vote on items on which they have not been
       fully informed or which they do not understand. The internal regulations or
       other internal documents should determine the form of the notice and the
       way materials are delivered that is most convenient and acceptable to all
       commissioners (for example by mail, telegraph, fax, or e-mail). Such delivery
       method must ensure that the notice reaches the commissioner’s contact
       details which have been registered at the company.

7.	 The Quorum for Board of Commissioners Meetings
A quorum is the minimum number of commissioners that must participate in a meeting
for decisions to be valid. Since the ICL does not specify the quorum for Board of
Commissioners Meetings, the articles of association of a company may require that a
quorum of the Board of Commissioners should consists of one half (1/2) of the total
members of the Board of Commissioners that are present or represented in the meeting.


8.	 How Commissioners Can Participate in Board of
    Commissioners Meetings
Commissioners can participate in voting when they are:
   •	 Physically present at the meeting.
   •	 Participating by conference call, video call or other means of communication
      (provided that all commissioners can see and hear each other clearly, and each
      commissioner may speak at the same time as other attending members if he/she
      wishes to do so).
   •	 Absent, by assert his/her opinion in writing and by signing it, then delivered to
      the President Commissioner or to other member of the Board of Commissioners
      that will chair the Board of Commissioners’ Meeting, on whether he/she agree or
      disagree on the matters to be discussed, and his/her opinion would be considered
      as a valid vote in the Board of Commissioners’ Meeting.

A member of the Board of Commissioners may only be represented by another
member of the Board of Commissioners by virtue of a power of attorney. A member
of the Board of Commissioners may only represent one member of the Board of
Commissioners.

       Although the law does not impose express requirement, certain items are of
       such importance that commissioners need to be physically present, and the
       company should consider making it compulsory that the commissioners adopt
       resolutions on such matters in a physical meeting (rather than by written
       resolution or in a telephone meeting). These items include:
          •	 The approval of the strategic plan and the approval of the company’s
             financial and business plan.
          •	 Calling the AGM, and making decisions on items related to the
             organization of the AGM.
          •	 The preliminary approval of the annual report of the company.
          •	 Convening or refusing a request by third parties to convene an EGM.
          •	 The election of the President Commissioner.
          •	 The creation and early termination of the authority of executive bodies.
          •	 The suspension of the President Director and the appointment of an
             interim President Director.
          •	 The reorganization or liquidation of the company.
          •	 Increasing the charter capital and issuing shares.




                                                                    Best Practices

       When participating in Board of Commissioners meetings, each commissioner
       should:
         •	 Listen and understand oral presentations.
         •	 Ask questions. This is particularly important for presentations or reports
            given by executives during Board of Commissioners meetings, especially
            when these materials are presented in a complex or ambiguous manner.
         •	 Request supporting materials. When presented with a particular issue
            that does not correspond to the commissioner’s area of expertise,
            additional information in the form of studies, independent appraisals or
            opinions, and other documentation on the subject should be requested
            prior to the meeting.

9.	 The Consideration of Written Opinions
    (Absentee Ballots)
Good corporate governance suggests that the article of association or internal
regulations should specify that written opinions of commissioners can be considered in
determining the existence of a quorum for Board of Commissioners meetings and the
validity of the voting results.




                                                                      Best Practices

       The article of association, internal regulations, or other internal documents
       should enable Board of Commissioners members to make decisions by
       absentee vote. However, for resolutions required by the article of association
       to be adopted by voting in person, the votes of absentees expressing their
       opinion in written form should not be counted for the quorum. Companies
       should develop procedures for absentee voting, including the deadline for
       the delivery of voting ballots and deadline for the return of completed ballots.
       It should give commissioners enough time to receive the ballots and make
       decisions on agenda items.




10.	Board of Commissioners Decisions
The company articles of association may stipulate that a resolution of the Board of
Commissioners’ Meeting must be adopted by deliberations to reach consensus. If no
consensus is reached by deliberations, the resolutions shall be adopted by voting based
on affirmative vote of more than ½ (one-half) of the total votes duly cast at the meeting.
In a tie vote, the President Commissioner of the Meeting shall cast the deciding vote.

11.	The Minutes of Board of Commissioners Meetings
Boards of Commissioners shall make minutes of meetings of the Board of
Commissioners and keep copies thereof.41 Articles of association of both public and
non-public company regulates that any matters that are discussed and decided in the
Board of Commissioners’ Meeting should be drawn-up in the Minutes of Meeting.
The Minutes of Meeting shall be prepared by a person who attended the meeting
and assigned by the Chairman of the Meeting, and the Minutes of Meeting shall
be signed by the Chairman of the Meeting and another member of the Board of
Commissioners appointed by the Meeting. If the minute of meeting is made by a
Notary, no signature is required.
The Minutes of Meeting shall serve as valid evidence for the members of the Board of
Commissioners and to any third parties insofar as with respect to the resolutions made
at the Meeting.




                                                                    Best Practices

       As legal and regulatory requirements of commissioners become more
       onerous, minutes are important records to show that the Board of
       Commissioners has discharged its duty of care. Under good corporate
       governance practices, the minutes will include the voting of each individual
       commissioner.

       The Board of Commissioners is often required to designate a secretary of
       the Board of Commissioners to take notes and help prepare the minutes. In
       international practices, the Corporate Secretary often serves as the secretary
       of the Board of Commissioners and may sign the minutes as well.




The minutes provide only a brief summary of the Board of Commissioners meeting. In
addition to minutes, every meeting should be followed by making verbatim reports that
contain a word-for-word account of discussions held. They should form an integral part
of the minutes. Verbatim reports from the meeting are supposed to be kept in company’s
records as a part of the minutes.

       Regardless of whether the company chooses to keep minutes and/or verbatim
       reports, the following documents should be preserved together with the
       minutes and/or the verbatim reports:
         •	 The voting ballots
         •	 The written opinions of directors who were not able to attend.

       Each commissioner should also be given a summary of the deliberations of
       the Board of Commissioners. The company should establish a procedure
       which ensures that all commissioners will be provided with:
          •	 Copies of the minutes and/or verbatim reports
          •	 Reports detailing the outcome of the voting.

The ICL as well as CG Code is silent on the role of the Corporate Secretary and Board
of Commissioners meetings. However, the CG Code sheds some light on the Corporate
Secretary position more related to support the Board of Directors function and not
specifically mentioned to support the Board of Commissioners.

         For more information on the Corporate Secretary, see Chapter 6.




The Board of Commissioners                       158                            Working Procedures
                                                                 Best Practices

       The Corporate Secretary should be responsible for administrative and
       organizational matters with respect to preparing and conducting Board
       of Commissioners meetings. While the decision to conduct a Board of
       Commissioners meeting is made by the President Commissioner, the
       Corporate Secretary should be responsible for handling such matters as:
          •	 Notifying all commissioners of Board of Commissioners meetings
          •	 Sending voting ballots
          •	 Collecting completed ballots and absentee ballots
          •	 Ensuring compliance with the procedures for Board of Commissioners
             meetings; and
          •	 Keeping the minutes and verbatim reports.

F.	           The Duties and Liabilities of
              Commissioners
Each member of the Board of Commissioners shall perform in good faith, prudence,
and full of responsibility to perform his supervisory duty and provide advices to the
Board of Directors as contemplated in Article 108 paragraph (1) in the interests of the
Company and in accordance with the Company’s purpose and objectives.42




                                                                      Best Practices

       In some countries, the Board of Commissioners is legally required to solely
       act in the interest of the company (without specifying the interest of the
       company towards its shareholders and/or stakeholders). However, acting
       solely in the best interest of the company can encourage management to
       entrench themselves and shareholders (and indeed the legislator) will need
       to carefully consider whether to require commissioners to act in the best
       interests of shareholders as well.




It is important to note that when a court action is brought against a commissioner,
reasonableness and good faith are presumed. However, the ICL does not define “good
faith” or “reasonableness.”
Turning to other jurisdictions for guidance, for example the U.S. and U.K., the
concepts of reasonableness and good faith are viewed as fundamental principles of a
commissioner’s duty, notably that of care and loyalty.



1.	 The Duty of Care
Commissioners on the Board of Commissioners are responsible for exercising their
rights and discharging their duties in good faith, with care and in a professional manner.


42	 ICL, Article 114 paragraph (2)




The Board of Commissioners                 160              The Duties and Liabilities of Commissioners
                                                                       Best Practices

       A commissioner should:
         •	 Act honestly and in good faith
         •	 Refrain from being passive
         •	 Use care and prudence to the maximum extent that could be expected
            from a good commissioner in a similar situation under similar
            circumstances
         •	 Not cause the company to act unlawfully
         •	 Regularly attend and actively participate in Board of Commissioners
            meetings
         •	 Place matters on the agenda of Board of Commissioners meetings, and
            demand such meetings when necessary
         •	 Ensure that an efficient and effective system of internal control is in
            place
         •	 Demand that the President Director and The Board of Directors’
            members provide adequate information to the Board of Commissioners
            so that its members are properly informed on corporate matters
         •	 Exercise a reasonable amount of supervision over management.




2.	 The Duty of Loyalty
In international corporate governance practice, the duty of loyalty is of central
importance to the governance framework, underpinning the effective implementation of
key corporate governance issues, for example, monitoring of related party transactions
and establishing remuneration policies for members of the Board of Commissioners and
members of the Board of Directors.
The duty of loyalty requires commissioners to exercise their powers in the interests
of the company as a whole. Simply put, commissioners should not allow personal
interests to prevail over the company’s interests. The duty of loyalty usually prohibits
commissioners from:
   •	 Participating in a competing company
   •	 Entering into any transaction with the company without first disclosing the
      transaction and obtaining Board of Commissioners or GMS approval



The Board of Commissioners                  161              The Duties and Liabilities of Commissioners
   •	 Using corporate property and facilities for personal needs
   •	 Disclosing non-public, confidential information
   •	 Using company information or business opportunities for private advantage, i.e.
      personal profit or gain.




                                                                                Best Practices

       The duty of loyalty requires the commissioner to act in the best interest of the
       company regardless of:
         •	 Who nominated and elected such member
         •	 Pressures from other commissioners, shareholders, or other individuals
            to take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interest of the
            company.

       It is of fundamental importance that, in carrying out its duties, the Board of
       Commissioners should not be viewed, or act, as an assembly of individual
       representatives for various constituencies.43 While specific commissioners
       may indeed be nominated or elected by certain shareholders (and sometimes
       contested by others), it is an important feature of the Board of Commissioners’
       work that commissioners when they assume their responsibilities carry out
       their duties in an even-handed manner with respect to all shareholders. This
       principle is particularly important to establish in the presence of controlling
       shareholders that are able to select all commissioners.

       Further, commissioners and affiliated persons (for example, family, friends,
       and business partners) should not accept gifts from persons interested in
       Board of Commissioners’ decisions, or accept any other direct or indirect
       benefits. An exception can be made for symbolic gifts that are given as a
       common courtesy or souvenirs that are given during official events. These
       exceptions should be described in internal regulations or other internal
       documents of the company.

a.	 Conflicts of Interest
       A commissioner should not discharge his/her duties if there is a conflict of interest
       between him/her and the company and its shareholders.



                                                                              Best Practices

       A conflict of interest may arise when a commissioner or his/her related
       person:
         •	 Enters into contractual relationship with a company
         •	 Have financial interests in that action in a way that can be reasonably
            expected to influence the commissioner’s behavior contrary to the
            interests of the company.




         For more information on related party transactions and the role of commissioners in such
         transactions, see Chapter 12, Section B.3.

       Commissioners should refrain from actions that may potentially result in a conflict
       between their own interests and the interests of the company. They are also
       advised to refrain from voting in situations where they have a personal interest in
       the matter in question. Commissioners should immediately inform the Board of
       Commissioners about any potential conflicts of interest.
       A commissioner must disclose to the Board of Commissioners information about
       the existence of conflict of interest between him/her and the company. Such
       information must be disclosed at the first Board meeting after the commissioner is
       aware of the conflict of interest.

                                                                        Best Practices

       Commissioners should not disclose confidential information or use their
       access to company information for their personal interests or the interests of
       third parties. The personal use of confidential information ultimately damages
       shareholders. It is recommended that:
          •	 Commissioners take steps to protect confidential information.
          •	 Commissioners should not disclose information or use it in their own
             interests.
          •	 Standards for the use of confidential information should be specified in
             the internal documents of the company.
          •	 Contracts between the company and commissioners stipulate the
             obligation of commissioners to not disclose confidential information for a
             period of 10 years after they leave the company.

       To create an effective mechanism to prevent the unauthorized use of
       confidential information, the company should require commissioners to:
         •	 Notify the Board of Commissioners in writing of their intention to
            enter into transactions that involve securities of the company or its
            subsidiaries
         •	 Disclose information about previous transactions with securities of the
            company in accordance with the procedures for disclosing material
            facts as specified by securities legislation.

       Board of Commissioners members, before taking over their position as a
       member, should sign a special statement that they are aware of and that
       they will follow all legal requirements and duties connected with confidential
       information.

                                                                        Best Practices

       The company should develop and incorporate into its internal documents a
       list of clearly defined duties of Board of Commissioners members.




3.	 Commissioner Access to Information

                                                                        Best Practices

       Every commissioner of the Board of Commissioners has a right to request
       the President Director and member of Board of Directors in the company to
       provide the information and documents regarding the financial conditions,
       business performance of various units in the company and of the company
       itself. It is essential for commissioners to have access to the information they
       need to properly discharge their duties, including full and accurate responses
       to their inquiries from members of the executive bodies, and other company
       officers.
       The company should create a mechanism to ensure that commissioners are
       provided with information about the most important financial and business
       developments of the company, as well as other developments that may have
       an impact on shareholder interests. The internal regulations or other internal
       documents should provide that the President Director, the Board of Directors’
       members, and heads of major divisions have the duty to promptly submit full
       and reliable information to the Board of Commissioners. In reaching this goal
       it is of particular importance to establish co-operation in this field between
       members of the Board of Commissioners on one hand, and the Corporate
       Secretary and the Board of Directors of the company, on the other hand.
       The company’s internal documents should include the right of commissioners
       to demand information from the executive bodies.




The Board of Commissioners                   165              The Duties and Liabilities of Commissioners
4.	 Liabilities of Commissioners
Each member of the Board of Commissioners shall share in personal liability for
the Company’s losses if the Commissioner concerned is at fault or negligent in
performing the tasks contemplated in paragraph (2).44
In the event that a Board of Commissioners consists of 2 (two) or more members
of the Board of Commissioners, the liability contemplated in paragraph (3) shall be
apply jointly and severally to each member of the Board of Commissioners.45
It is important that customary business practices and other relevant circumstances
be taken into consideration to determine the grounds and the amount of
commissioners’ liability.




                                                                       Best Practices

       The company should:
         •	 Encourage commissioners to perform their duties in a proper way
         •	 Take measures to terminate the authority of commissioners who are
            responsible for inflicting losses
         •	 Hold commissioners responsible when they do not fulfill their obligations
            towards the company.




5.	 When are Commissioners Relieved from Liability
    and Responsibility in Respect of the Company
    Losses?
Managing the affairs of a company is a complex process with the risk that decisions
made by the Board of Commissioners, acting reasonably and in good faith,
will ultimately prove wrong and entails adverse consequences for the company.
Commissioners cannot generally be held liable for decisions made in good faith.

The Board of Commissioners                  166              The Duties and Liabilities of Commissioners
Pursuant to Article 114 paragraph (5) of ICL, members of Boards of Commissioners
may not be held liable for the losses if they can prove that:
   •	 they have carried out their supervision in good faith and prudence in the interests
      of the Company and in accordance with the Company’s purpose and objectives;
   •	 they do not have any direct or indirect personal interest in the actions of
      management of the Board of Directors which caused the losses; and
   •	 they have given the Board of Directors advice to prevent the losses arising or
      continuing.
Commissioners are not relieved from liability after they have resigned from the Board
of Commissioners or when they are dismissed from the Board of Commissioners for
actions and decisions made during their tenure as a commissioner.


6.	 Who Can File a Claim against Commissioners?
On behalf of the Company, shareholders representing at least 1/10 (one tenth) of
the total number of shares with voting rights may sue in the district court members
of the Board of Commissioners who because of their fault or negligence gave rise to
losses to the Company.46


7.	 The Minutes of Board of Commissioners Meetings
    and Commissioner Liability
Article 116 of the ICL stated that the Boards of Commissioners shall make minutes
of meetings of the Board of Commissioners and keep copies thereof.


                                                                        Best Practices

       To effectively enforce provisions that regulate the liability of commissioners,
       it is recommended that the company keep detailed minutes (and possibly
       verbatim reports) of meetings. It is important for the Board of Commissioners
       to keep detailed minutes of Board of Commissioners meetings to determine
       who voted for a certain decision and who can be held liable (to the extent the
       court considers such factors).

8.	 Protection from Liability for Commissioners
Article 114 of the Limited Liability Company stipulated that each member of
the Board of Commissioners shall be personally liable for the loss suffered by the
Company if it resulted from its fault or negligent in performing its duties.47 In
the event the Board of Commissioners consist of 2 (two) members or more, the
responsibility as referred to in paragraph (3) shall jointly and severally apply to each
member of the Board of Commissioners.48 However, a member of the Board of
Commissioners shall not be liable for the loss if it is proven that:49
   a.	it has performed the supervisory duty with good faith and prudent principle for
      the interest of the Company and in accordance with its purpose and objective;
   b.	it has no, either directly or indirectly, personal interest to the Board of
      Directors’ management over the Company’s which causing the Company’s
      loss; and
   c.	 it has provide advice to the Board of Directors in order to prevent the
       occurrence or continuity of such loss.




                                                                             Best Practices

       Most companies should allow their commissioners to protect themselves
       from, or at least limit the liability for, losses incurred while they fulfilled their
       duties. Such mechanisms are:
          •	 Officer and commissioner liability insurance
          •	 Provisions in the article of association and internal regulations that
             indemnify commissioners against claims, litigation expenses and
             liabilities in certain circumstances.

The Board of Commissioners                      168                The Duties and Liabilities of Commissioners
       Companies may reimburse a commissioner for expenses incurred in
       defending a claim related to his/her role as a Board of Commissioners
       member, if he acted:
          •	   Honestly
          •	   In good faith
          •	   In the best interests of the company
          •	   In compliance with law, the article of association and internal
               regulations.

       A company may wish to obtain liability insurance for commissioners to cover
       the risk that their actions might result in losses to the company or third
       parties. Liability insurance for commissioners should allow the company to
       use civil law remedies more productively. It is also often needed to attract
       competent commissioners.

G.	           Evaluation and Education of the Board
              of Commissioners
To be effective, Board of Commissioners should have the necessary resources to develop
and maintain the knowledge and skills of its commissioners. Training programs,
based on periodic evaluations of the Board of Commissioners and its members, are
fundamental to this end.




                                                                   Best Practices

       The importance of Board of Commissioners evaluations is widely recognized
       in the international business community. It is also recommended that:
          •	 The Board of Commissioners evaluate its performance annually.
          •	 The annual report reflects the results of the performance evaluation.
          •	 The performance evaluation of the Board of Commissioners and its
             members may be carried out by.
          •	 Commissioners through self-evaluation.

       An alternative approach calls for confidential Board of Commissioners
       peer evaluations coordinated by an external party, such as legal counsel or
       specialized consultants.




1.	 Self-Evaluation by the Board of Commissioners
A self-evaluation is a useful tool for the Board of Commissioners to privately assess the
quality of its work. Through critical reflection and self-evaluation, commissioners can be
more responsive to shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders.




The Board of Commissioners                  170                          Evaluation and Education
Self-evaluation methods include:
   •	 Organizing a retreat and inviting an outside facilitator.
   •	 Organizing a special Board of Commissioners meeting to evaluate the work of
      the Board of Commissioners or, alternatively, setting aside time during a regular
      meeting to address performance issues.
   •	 Designing checklists that Board of Commissioners members can use to assess their
      work.
   •	 Participating in specialized training programs, thereby providing commissioners
      the opportunity to critically reflect on their performance and develop and share
      new ideas.




                                                                     Best Practices

       The CG Regulations requires that the internal corporate governance rules of
       a company should include a mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of the
       Board’s performance, activities of every committee that it had establish, the
       Board of Directors and every member of the Board of Commissioners.

       Another useful way to evaluate the Board of Commissioners is to invite
       a consultant, advisor, institute of commissioners, or rating agency to
       independently assess the Board of Commissioners.




2.	 Education and Training
In international practices, it is customary for commissioners to take vigorous executive
and professional training before they are appointed to the Board.
In many multi-national corporations, it is compulsory to give commissioners (i)
periodical corporate training, (ii) corporate governance training and (iii) evaluation of
their performance. The training and evaluation of commissioners may be conducted
internally or by a third party to ensure impartiality.




The Board of Commissioners                  171                           Evaluation and Education
The evaluation of the Board of Commissioners and its members can result in important
insights into the Board’s strengths and weaknesses. This information can also be
used by the Board of Commissioners to identify training needs, both collectively and
individually. Corporate training events take on added importance in the context of
transitional economies, as commissioners need to be kept abreast of changes to the legal
and regulatory framework, as well as best practices. All this makes a company education
policy for the Board of Commissioners and its commissioners a key success factor in
developing and supporting a competent, knowledgeable and vigilant Board.




                                                                   Best Practices

       A variety of organizations contribute to the professional development
       and training of commissioners. These include stock exchanges, financial
       institutions, government and industry regulators, business associations,
       chambers of commerce, institutions of higher education, institutes of
       commissioners and associations set up to promote good corporate
       governance practices.

       Commissioner training is delivered primarily by two broad types of
       organizations. One is corporate governance associations, which are devoted
       to improving corporate governance and provide training as one aspect of
       that effort. The other is organizations that are focused on commissioners
       and support, represent and set standards for commissioners. Both types
       of organizations can be membership associations, such as the National
       Association of Corporate Directors in the United States, the Institute of
       Directors in the United Kingdom, and the Brazilian Institute of Corporate
       Governance. They may serve commissioners without having a membership
       base, such as the Corporate Governance Centre in Kenya and the Corporate
       Governance Forum of Turkey.

       Training can provide commissioners with:
         •	 New skills
         •	 Increased professionalism
         •	 Greater awareness of relevant issues
         •	 Access to current thinking on governance and other issues
         •	 Opportunities to discuss issues with peers and mentors

H.	           The Remuneration of Commissioners

Members of the Board of Commissioners are given honorarium/service fees (uang
jasa) including facility and/or other benefits, including tantieme and retirement benefit
(santunan purna jabatan) in the amount determined by the GMS.
Details of the remuneration policy for commissioners generally and the remuneration
of the individual commissioners should be disclosed in detail in the annual financial
statements of the company. Details such as the annual salary and bonus of each
commissioner must also be published in the annual financial statements. It should be
an explicit item on the agenda of the Annual GMS in order to give shareholders the
opportunity to debate over these matters.
The issue of commissioner remuneration is one of the more contentious in the field of
corporate governance, and companies are advised to choose a cautious and circumspect
approach to the question of Board of Commissioners remuneration. Excessive
compensation plans are often perceived as an unjustified privilege of power. Therefore,
it is of the utmost importance that commissioner compensation be competitive, yet stay
within reasonable limits.




                                                                    Best Practices

       The remuneration payable to commissioners should be equal for all
       commissioners. Moreover, the fees that a company pays should be
       competitive, i.e. sufficient to attract competent individuals. They should
       be set so that they are neither very much below nor above commissioners
       fees paid at a peer group of companies. Setting a reasonable level of
       commissioner remuneration is particularly important in order not to jeopardize
       the special status of independent commissioners. Independent or not, a
       commissioner’s judgment may be clouded if he/she receives a significant
       percentage of his/her total income in the form of a commissioner’s fee. A
       commissioner who relies on Board compensation for his/her livelihood will
       soon become beholden to the company and may not be relied upon to fill his/
       her responsibilities in an unbiased manner.




The Board of Commissioners                  173                  The Remuneration of Commissioners
The Board of Commissioners should regularly review the remuneration of
commissioners. Pursuant to Article 66 of the ICL, the Board of Commissioners should
review the company annual report submitted by the Board of Directors, part of which
report deals with the Board of Commissioner remuneration.




                                                                   Best Practices

       Ideally, this should be done either by a remuneration committee, composed
       entirely of independent commissioners, or by the independent commissioners.
       The company should disclose its remuneration plan and the remuneration of
       each commissioner, either on an individual basis or in the aggregate, in its
       annual report. The former is easiest to implement when all Board members
       receive the same fees with a simple statement in the annual report: “All
       commissioners receive fees of _____ per year.”




Great care needs to be exercised in establishing performance-based remuneration, in
particular, stock-based remuneration. Performance-based remuneration is generally
considered a factor that impinges on commissioner independence.

       While stock-based remuneration is common in the U.S., it is a good deal less
       common elsewhere and considerable controversy still surrounds it. Stock-
       based remuneration plans and, in particular, stock option plans are complex
       arrangements. While they are generally thought to provide incentives for
       commissioners and directors, they can also have a significant impact upon
       the company and shareholders.

          •	 Stock options, it is argued, cause commissioners to focus on short-term
             performance and stock price movements
          •	 If stock option grants are large, they may also create complicity
             between commissioners and directors who stand to make enormous
             sums from short-term price movements
          •	 Shareholders risk share dilution when large option plans are granted
          •	 Finally, large option grants have not prevented managers from
             manipulating companies and financial information to their benefit.

       Consequently, option plans are coming under increasing scrutiny. Such
       plans require careful consideration, good planning, and special disclosure.
       Companies may be best served by avoiding stock options for commissioners.

       If a company chooses to implement stock option plans, it should be
       transparent about the costs in terms of share dilution. The company should
       also be transparent about the accounting methods used to measure the costs
       of stock and option grants. Best practices would call for shareholder approval
       of stock, or option based compensation plans that could dilute shareholder
       value or affect profits.




Personal loans or credits to the company’s commissioners are also a minefield and a
potential source of controversy that companies would be well advised to avoid.

                                        Company Practices in Indonesia

       The low level of remuneration compared to the importance of the Board of
       Commissioners is striking. Whatever the explanation, it seems clear that
       commissioner remuneration needs to receive greater attention. Transparent
       systems of remuneration, capable of attracting qualified commissioners, need
       to be put in place.

              Effectiveness

   Has the Board of Commissioners recently devoted a significant amount
   of time and serious thought to the company’s longer-term objectives and
   to the strategic options open to it for achieving them? If so, have these
   deliberations resulted in a Board consensus or decision on its future
   objectives and strategies, and have these been put in writing?

   Has the Board of Commissioners consciously thought about and reached
   formal conclusions on what is sometimes referred to as its basic corporate
   philosophy that is, its value system, its ethical and social responsibilities,
   its desired ‘image’ and so forth? If so, have these conclusions been set
   forth in explicit statements of policy, for example, in respect of terms of
   employment? Does the company have formal procedures for recording and
   promulgating major Board of Commissioners decisions as policy guidelines
   for line managers?

   Does the Board of Commissioners periodically review the organizational
   structure of the company and consider how this may have to change in
   future? Does it review and approve all senior appointments as a matter of
   course? Are adequate human resource development programs in place?

   Does the Board of Commissioners routinely receive all the information
   it needs to ensure that it is in effective control of the company and its
   management? Have there been any unpleasant surprises, for example,
   unfavorable results or unforeseen crises that could be attributed to a lack of
   timely or accurate information?

   Does the Board of Commissioners routinely require the President Director
   to present his/her annual plans and budgets for their review and approval?
   Does the Board regularly monitor the performance of the President Director
   and his/her immediate subordinate managers in terms of actual results
   achieved against agreed plans and budgets?

   When the Board of Commissioners is required to take major decisions on
   questions of future objectives, strategies, policies, major investments,
   senior appointments, does it have adequate time and knowledge to make
   these decisions soundly, rather than finding itself overtaken by events and,
   in effect, obliged to rubber-stamp decisions already taken or commitments
   already made?

If the answers to all of these questions are yes, it is safe to say that the company’s
Board of Commissioners can be considered effective. On the other hand, if the
answers are negative, or perhaps not clear, then the company needs to reevaluate the
composition and role of its Board of Commissioners and undertake other activities on
improving its work.

               Does the company have a clear delineation and separation
               of authorities between shareholders, commissioners and
               directors? Has the company properly established a Board
               of Directors? Does the AoA or some other general act of

The Board of Directors                   183                      The Chairman’s Checklist
This chapter describes the composition of “executive bodies” as they are often
structured in practice, and the authorities, formation and working procedures of such
executive bodies, as well as their interaction with the Board of Commissioners, their
duties evaluation, liabilities and remuneration.
The executive body of a limited liability company in Indonesia is called the Board of
Directors (BoD) and it is one of the three organs of a company.1 The ICL provides
definition of the Board of Directors as the Company Organ with full authority and
responsibility for the management of the Company in the interests of the Company in
accordance with the Company’s purposes and objectives and to represent the Company
in and out of court in accordance with the provisions of the AoA.2
As it is the central organ of a company, provisions on the Board of Directors, its
structure, roles and responsibilities, authority, meetings, members’ nomination,
appointment, and remuneration are stipulated in the ICL, CG Code as well as
companies’ AoA.

A.	            The Board of Directors
               and Their Authorities

Board of Directors is the Company Organ with full authority and responsibility for the
management of the Company in the interests of the Company in accordance with the
Company’s purposes and objectives and to represent the Company in and out of court
in accordance with the provisions of the AoA.3
Furthermore, Article 92 paragraph (3) to (6) of the ICL stipulates that companies’
Boards of Directors shall consist of 1 (one) or more members of the Board of Directors.
Companies whose business is related to the collection of and/or management of the
public’s funds, Companies which issue acknowledgements of indebtedness to the public,
or Public Companies must have at least 2 (two) members of the Board of Directors. In
the event that the Board of Directors consists of 2 (two) or more members of the Board
of Directors, the division of management tasks and authority between the members of
the Board of Directors shall be determined by a GMS resolution and in the event that
the GMS does not make any determination, the division of the tasks and authority of
the members of the Board of Directors shall be determined by a resolution of the Board
of Directors.
While the CG Code regulated, each member of the Board of Directors can carry out its
duty and take decisions in accordance with their respective assignments and authorities.
However, the execution of tasks by each member of the Board of Directors remains to
be a collective responsibility. The position of each respective member of the Board of
Directors including President Director is equal. The duty of the President Director as
primus inter pares is to coordinate the activities of the Board of Directors.4

The Board of Directors                    185             The Board of Directors and Their Authorities
                                                                         Best Practices

       In Indonesia, the establishment of a Board of Directors is mandatory for
       limited liability companies. Regardless of the fact that the establishment
       of the Board of Directors is not mandatory for all companies, it is always
       recommended. However, companies could consider setting out a mechanism
       in their charters for the Board of Directors to make decisions on a collective
       rather than an individual approach, at least for important company decisions.
       When such issues are brought before the Board of Directors, it can facilitate
       discussion and coordination among key managers and help them to arrive at
       a decision which is most beneficial to the company.
       The Board of Directors assembles the key resources at the President
       Director’s disposal to help achieve the company’s goals. Larger companies
       may need a Board of Directors to deal with more complex business models
       and organizational structures. Smaller companies typically have simpler
       business models and fewer resources to establish formal structures.




                                                                         Best Practices

       The work of the Board of Directors should be guided by an annual work plan
       that is delivered annually to the Board of Commissioners or the GMS as stated
       in the AoA. The annual work plan should contain basic guidelines for the daily
       operations of the company. Good corporate governance principles further
       recommend that:
           •	 The President Director and the Board of Directors seek the approval of
              the Board of Commissioners for transactions that fall outside the scope
              of the financial and business plan (non-standard operations)
           •	 The company develop internal regulations or other internal documents
              detailing procedures for the President Director and the Board of
              Directors to obtain such approval from the Board of Commissioners
           •	 The Board of Commissioners has the right to veto decisions made by
              the President Director and the Board of Directors to implement non-
              standard operations.

1.	 The Authority of the Board of Directors
ICL sets out that the Board of Directors, as an executive unit, shall undertake its duty
to manage the company for the interest of the company in the pursuit of its purposes
and objectives.5 The Board of Directors shall have the authority to manage the
company in accordance with the policy which is considered accurate, and shall be in
accordance with the provision as regulated under the ICL and/or the AoA.6 Further,
the CG Code stated that the Board of Directors as a company organ shall function
and be responsible collegially for the management of the company. Each member
of the Board of Directors can carry out its duty and take decisions in accordance
with their respective assignments and authorities. However, the execution of tasks by
each member of the Board of Directors remains to be a collective responsibility. The
position of each respective member of the Board of Directors including President
Director is equal.7 Furthermore, any such mechanism must be provided for in detail in
the AoA of the company.
ICL specifies several of the Board of Director’s duties and obligations, which include:
      •	 undertake the management of Companies in the interest of the Companies and
         in accordance with the Companies’ purpose and objectives8

Regarding the day to day management of the company, the Board of Directors’ duties
and responsibilities are stipulated in the company’s AoA. The Indonesia’s CG Code

internal control, public relation, and social responsibility.

               of Directors

1.	 Who Can Be a President Director or a Board of
    Directors’ Member?
Those who may be appointed as members of the Board of Directors are individuals
capable of performing legal actions, except those who in the 5 (five) years previous to
their appointment had:16
   a.	been declared bankrupt;
   b.	been members of a Board of Directors or a Board of Commissioners declared to
      be at fault in causing a Company to be declared bankrupt;
   c.	 been sentenced for crimes which caused losses to the state and/or were related to
       the finance sector.

The ICL regulates that members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the
GMS.17 AoA shall regulate the procedures to appoint, replace, and dismiss members
of the Board of Directors, and may also regulate the procedures to nominate the
members of the Board of Directors.18 The CG Code recognizes the position and role
of the President Director as a coordinator of the activities of the Board of Directors
(as primus inter pares).

          For more information on concepts of (i) persons who are prohibited from management of
          enterprises and (ii) related persons, see Chapter 4, Section C.2.

       Best practices dictate that individuals should not be appointed to the Board of
       Directors when they are:
          •	 Directors of a competing company;
          •	 Managers of a competing company; or
          •	 Employees of a competing company.

       The President Director of the Board of Directors should not be engaged in
       any business activities other than those related to the management of the
       company and the governance of its subsidiaries.




2.	 Qualifications of the President Director and Board of
    Directors’ Members
The Board of Directors can only be effective when they have adequate financial and
human resources, as well as members with the necessary experience, knowledge, skills
and time to exercise their duties.




                                                                          Best Practices

       AoA or the internal regulations should specify the qualifications of members
       of the Board of Directors as well as heads of major divisions. Members of the
       Board of Directors should generally satisfy the following requirements:
           •	 To enjoy the trust of shareholders, Board of Commissioners, other
              directors and employees of the company
           •	 To own the ability to relate to the interests of all stakeholders and to
              make well-reasoned decisions
           •	 To possess the professional expertise, education and appropriate
              organizational skills

           •	 To possess (international) business experience, knowledge of national
              economic, political, legal and social issues, as well as trends and
              knowledge of the market, products and competitors (national as well as
              international)
           •	 To have the ability to translate knowledge and experience into practical
              solutions that can be applied to the company.

       Moreover, a background check on candidates should be conducted for a
       possible record of criminal or administrative offenses. Evidence of such
       offenses would likely result in the rejection of a candidate.




ICL does not have any provisions regarding the specific qualifications for the Board
of Directors’ member. They are highly varied depending on the business, size and
company’s need. However, again, The CG Code provides general guidelines for
company’s reference where members of the Board of Directors must be professionals
that possess the integrity, experience and capability required for carrying out their
respective duties.
In more detail, The CG Code provides guidelines in the aspects of capability and
integrity, as follows:19
   1.	Members of the Board of Directors shall have the capability and integrity required
      to ensure the proper execution of management function;
   2.	Members of the Board of Directors are prohibited from utilizing the company for
      his/her personal, family, business group and or other parties’ interests;
   3.	Members of the Board of Directors shall understand and comply with the AoA
      and the laws and regulations as related to their duties;
   4.	Members of the Board of Directors shall understand and implement the GCG
      Code.

The Board of Directors                       193               The Composition of the Board of Directors
3.	 The Composition of the Board of Directors
The number of the Board of Directors’ members should be set forth in the company’s
AoA, the internal regulations or a specific resolution from the Board of Commissioners.
The ICL Article 92 regulates that the Board of Directors of a company shall consist of
1 (one) or more members. In the event that the Board of Directors consists of 2 (two) or
more members, the division of management tasks and authority between the members
of the Board of Directors shall be determined by a GMS resolution. In the event that
the GMS does not determined the division of management tasks and authority, then
such management task and authority shall be determined by the Board of Directors
Meeting. Further, for companies engaging in collection of and/or management of the
public’s funds, companies which issue acknowledgements of indebtedness to the public,
or public companies must have at least 2 (two) members of the Board of Directors.
The provision of the CG Code stated that the composition of the Board of Directors
shall enable it to make effective, right and timely decisions and to act independently, and
shall be of sufficient size that suits the complexity of the business of the company by
taking into account the effectiveness in decision making.




                                          Company Practices in Indonesia

       The size of the Board of Directors will need to be adapted to the specific
       circumstances of the company and, consequently, will vary in composition.
       It will dominantly depend on the activities of the company, size (number of
       employees), level of development and other characteristics of the company.
       All this is important for determining the optimal number of directors, their
       qualifications and professional skills. The Board of Directors might include the
       following persons:
          •	 The President Director
          •	 The Chief Operating Officer/Operation Director
          •	 The Chief Financial Officer/Finance Director
          •	 Marketing and Sales Director
          •	 General Affairs Director
          •	 The Human Resources Director.

1.	 The Election and Term of the Board of Directors’
    Members
President Director
Article 94 of the ICL provides regulations regarding the appointment, replacement and
dismissal of members of the Board of Directors, which covers:
   (1)	Members of Boards of Directors shall be appointed by the GMS
   (2)	Members of Boards of Directors shall be appointed for a certain period and may
       be re-appointed
   (3)	AoA shall provide procedures for the appointment, replacement and dismissal
       of members of the Board of Directors and may also provide procedures for
       nominating members of the Board of Directors
   (4)	Resolutions of GMS with regard to the appointment, replacement, and dismissal
       of members of the Board of Directors shall also determine when the appointment,
       replacement or dismissal comes into effect.

The CG Code reinforced the provision above and stated that members of the Board
of Directors are appointed and terminated by the GMS through a transparent process.
For publicly listed companies, SOEs, province and region-owned companies, companies
that raise and manage public funds, companies of which products or services are widely
used by public, and companies with extensive influence on environment, the process of
evaluating the candidates for the member of the Board of Directors is carried out by the
Nomination and Remuneration Committee prior to the GMS.

       High-level personnel decisions, in general, and the selection of Board
       of Directors members, more specifically, are best accomplished by the
       President Director, in tandem with the Board of Commissioners. Personnel
       decisions should not be political decisions. The assessment of the skills
       and qualifications of potential Board of Directors members is best done by
       someone who works day in, day out with potential candidates. Shareholders
       or Board of Commissioners that insist on close control over this process may
       be better served by developing policies that specify outcomes rather than
       getting involved in the details of selection. Drafting precise and effective
       terms of reference for key executive positions is but one example. At the very
       least, proposals for membership on the Board of Directors should be closely
       coordinated with the President Director, by having him/her nominate and the
       Board of Commissioners approve candidates.

       Almost every corporate governance system has the Board of Commissioners
       elect the President Director and other Board of Directors members. In
       Indonesia, although the ICL only expressly requires that the Board of
       Directors elect the President Director and is silent on other Executive
       Board members, it is common for joint venture companies to require that
       the Board of Directors approve certain executive positions, such as Deputy
       President Director, Chief Operating Officer, or Chief Accountant. The Board
       of Commissioners is in a better position compared to shareholders to set
       the key criteria for what kind of President Director the company needs,
       organize proper succession planning and search for such a person. For this
       purpose, the Board of Commissioners may set up an independent Human
       Resource Committee, which will be in charge of making a recommendation
       as to potential candidates for the position of President Director. Shareholder
       interests are not adversely affected, as Board of Commissioners members
       are bound by their duties of loyalty and care to act in the best interests of
       the company and its shareholders. It is especially advisable to delegate
       this power to the Board of Commissioners in countries in transition such as
       Indonesia, where Board of Commissioners are nascent in their development
       vis-à-vis controlling shareholders, and need to be strengthened. Finally,
       because management oversight is one of the Board of Commissioners main




The Board of Directors                      196      The Formation and Termination of the Board of Directors
       authorities, the Board’s authority to dismiss the President Director and other
       members of the Board of Directors should coincide with its authority to elect
       these important individuals.

       A public company may consider delegating the Human Resource Committee
       (if any) with the following duties in connection with the appointment of Board
       of Directors’ members:
           •	 Submit the proposal for a Board of Directors’ member
           •	 Give an opinion on proposals for the appointment of Executive Board
              members originating from shareholders or the Board of Commissioners
           •	 Draft or evaluate the draft of appointment procedures for Executive
              Board members
           •	 Periodically (at least twice a year) assess the size and composition
              of the Executive Board, conditions for the appointment and make
              recommendations with regard to any changes, which will be presented
              to the shareholders at the next GMS.

       Shareholders should have the opportunity to receive sufficient information (in
       writing and/or electronic form) about candidates for the position of President
       Director and Board of Directors before the GMS. Up-to-date information
       should also be made available to all shareholders during the GMS. The
       information about candidates for the executive bodies should include the:
          •	 Identity of the candidate
          •	 Age and educational background of the candidate
          •	 Position(s) held by the candidate during the last five years
          •	 Position(s) held by the candidate at the moment of his/her nomination
          •	 Relationship(s) that the candidate has with the company
          •	 Membership(s) of the candidate in the Board of Directors of other legal
             entities, or any other positions held in such entities
          •	 Information on the nomination(s) of the candidate for a position in
             executive bodies and other positions of other legal persons
          •	 Relationship(s) of the candidate with affiliated persons
          •	 Relationship(s) that the candidate has with major business partners of
             the company
          •	 Information related to the financial status of the candidate and other
             circumstances that may affect the duties of the candidate as a member
             of executive bodies
          •	 Refusal of the candidate, if any, to provide information to the company.




The Board of Directors                      197      The Formation and Termination of the Board of Directors
       It is recommended that candidates present a written statement to the
       Board of Directors that indicates their willingness to accept the position of
       President Director or Board of Directors member, should they be elected for
       that position. In the absence of such a statement, candidates should verbally
       confirm that they are willing to accept the position.




ICL does not set the maximum term, neither limit the re-election of the board of
Directors’ member for a certain number of terms. The company’s AoA would specify
the period. However, the common practice in Indonesia is that the terms usually 5 years
and can be re-elected for maximum 2 times. Please note that members of the Board
of Directors may be dismissed at any time by virtue of a GMS resolutions stating the
reason therefor.20
For public listed company, Regulation Number IX.J.1 in Article 13(b) provides that
term for the member of the Board of Director and Board of Commissioner must not
execeeds 5 (five) years for 1 period or until the end of the annual GMS at the end of 1
period of tenure.

       It is recommended that the Board of Directors’ members be elected for a
       period that will enable them to become acquainted with the company’s
       business and not to be constrained by short-term goals.

defined by the ICL, the AoA, or the internal regulations of the company. The Board of
Directors of a Company shall consist of 1 (one) member of the Board of Directors or
more. For Companies engaging in mobilizing public funds, issuing debt instrument or an
Issuer shall have a minimum of 2 (two) members of Board of Directors. In the event the
Board of Directors consists of 2 (two) members of the Board of Directors or more, the
distribution of duty and authority among the members of the Board of Directors shall
be determined based on the GMS resolution.22
President Director for Board of Directors meetings, the President Director should have
the authority to:
   •	 Convene, organize and preside over Board of Directors’ meetings;
   •	 Sign all documents, decisions and minutes of the Board of Director;
   •	 Perform any other duties as specified in the AoA, internal regulations or a

2.	 The Board of Directors’ Meetings
The AoA, or a specific resolution by the Board of Directors should establish:
   •	 The frequency of Board of Directors meetings
   •	 The procedures for organizing and conducting Board of Directors meetings
   •	 The procedures for making decisions during Board of Directors meetings.




                                                                          Best Practices

       The precise frequency of meetings should, however, ultimately depend on the
       unique circumstances of each company.




3.	 The Right to Call a Board of Directors’ Meeting
The AoA or a specific resolution by the Board of Directors should establish who has the
power to convene a meeting of the Board of Directors. It usually stipulated in the AoA
that the President Director have this power.




                                                                          Best Practices

       The Board of Directors is a hands-on, problem-solving mechanism. Other
       Board of Directors members should also have a voice in calling Board of
       Directors meetings and setting the meeting agenda.

       The AoA or a specific resolution by the Board of Directors must specify the
       procedures for convening and conducting Board of Directors meetings.

4.	 Meeting Notification
Since the Board of Directors is a management tool, it will likely need to respond to
the changing demands of the company and its external environment, and be prepared
to act quickly. While rapid response is necessary, it may make careful and extensive
preparation for meetings difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Obviously, Board of
Directors’ members should be as well-prepared as practical. They should be notified in
advance to give them time to prepare and effectively participate in meetings.




                                                                           Best Practices

       Directors should not vote on agenda items unless they are well informed.
       Whenever possible, materials should be sent to Board of Directors’ members
       in advance, together with the notice and the meeting agenda, to give them
       sufficient time to explore all the questions that will be raised at the meeting
       and to decide how they will vote. This may, however, not always be the case
       and, under some circumstances, sound decision-making may not be possible.
       Decision-making may be postponed when members:
          •	 Cannot be notified in a timely manner
          •	 Have not received the required information on time
          •	 Have not been provided with sufficient time to prepare for the meeting.




The internal regulations or other internal documents should determine the form in
which notice and materials are to be delivered to Board of Directors’ members in the
most convenient and appropriate way.


5.	 The Quorum of the Board of Directors’ Meetings
The quorum of Board of Directors meetings refers to the number of members that
must participate in the meeting before it can make a valid decision. The AoA or a
specific resolution by the Board of Directors should specify the required quorum for
Board of Directors meetings. The quorum should not be less than one half of the total
number of Board of Directors members. A Board of Directors’ meeting that lacks a
quorum cannot make valid decisions. However, usually under the AoA, in the event that




The Board of Directors                      202      The Formation and Termination of the Board of Directors
the quorum for meeting of Board of Directors is not fulfilled, then the second meeting
can be held in the next day, and the President Director can decide solely if in the second
meeting, the quorum was not fulfilled again.


6.	 Voting During the Board of Directors’ Meetings
A simple majority of Board of Directors members who participate in the meeting
should be sufficient to approve Board of Directors decisions, unless the AoA or a specific
resolution by the Board of Directors require a supermajority vote. Each Board of
Directors’ member should have one vote. The AoA, internal regulations or a resolution
by the Board of Directors can specify that the President Director can cast a deciding
vote in the case of a tie.


7.	 The Minutes of the Board of Directors’ Meeting
Boards of Directors shall make a register of shareholders, special register, GMS
minutes and minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors. All registers and minutes,
and the Company’s financial documents and others of the Company’s documents as
contemplated above shall be kept in the Company’s domicile.23




                                                                           Best Practices

       The minutes of Board of Directors meetings should include the following
       information:
          •	 The location and time of the meeting
          •	 The names of the persons present at the meeting
          •	 The agenda of the meeting
          •	 The issues on the agenda, as well as the voting results on an individual
             basis
          •	 The decisions made by the Board of Directors
          •	 The rationale for the decisions.

       Although it is not legally compulsory, in order to practice good corporate
       governance and improve transparency, the minutes of the Board of Directors
       meeting should be made available upon the request of:
          •	 Board of Commissioners or Audit Committee members
          •	 The External Auditor
          •	 A shareholder (or a group of shareholders) possessing voting shares.

E.	            The Duties and Liabilities of the
               Members of the Board of Directors

The members of the Board of Directors have the same duties of care and loyalty as
Board of Commissioners members, and are subject to the same liability standards as
Board of Commissioners members, unless either the AoA, internal regulations, other
general internal documents, or employment contract provide for stricter standards.

          For more information about the duties and liabilities of directors, see Chapter 4, Section F.

F.	            Performance Evaluations

Periodic performance evaluations of the Board of Directors are an important oversight
tool. They can help create a system of constant performance management. The results
of periodic evaluations can be a solid ground for defining measures for the work
improvement of this corporate body.




                                                                            Best Practices

       The AoA or internal regulations of the company can stipulate that the
       performance of the Board of Directors be evaluated by the Board of
       Commissioners at least annually, if not more frequently. The Board of
       Commissioners may also find it useful to receive evaluations on the
       performance of the Board of Directors that are carried out by the President
       Director and Board of Directors members themselves, through self-evaluation
       within the framework of the company’s human resources performance
       evaluation and planning process.




          For an example of a self-evaluation framework, see Chapter 4, Section G.

G.	            The Remuneration and Reimbursement
               of the Board of Directors

The provision regarding the amount of remuneration of the members of the Board of
Directors shall be determined based on the resolution of GMS and may be conferred to
the Board of Commissioners.24




                                                                     Best Practices

       Executive remuneration is an important aspect in attracting managerial
       talent. Excessive executive remuneration packages, on the other hand, are
       often perceived as an unjustified privilege of power. Consequently, it is of
       the utmost importance that executive compensation be competitive, yet stay
       within reasonable limits, ideally in relation to a peer group of companies.

       The remuneration of executives should not be left to the sole discretion of the
       executive bodies themselves. This should fall under the Board of Directors’
       authority. Companies should state in their charters that the approval of
       executive remuneration is a prerogative of the Board of Directors. It is
       important that the Board of Directors take into consideration performance-
       related factors that are based on the company’s key performance indicators
       when determining the remuneration of executives. Some of the issues that
       have a bearing on remuneration are:
          •	 Scope of responsibilities
          •	 Required type and level of qualifications
          •	 Experience of the candidates
          •	 Personal and business qualities of the candidates
          •	 Typical level of remuneration in the company and in the industry in
             general
          •	 The financial performance of the company.

The Board of Directors                      207                     Remuneration and Reimbursement
       Comparative corporate governance practice usually divides an executive
       director’s remuneration into two parts, base salary and variable part
       (performance-related remuneration). An executive’s base salary is usually
       a function of his/her background and experience, whereas variable
       compensation is generally based upon the executive’s performance.




1.	 Remuneration Policy
As a matter of good corporate governance, the remuneration policy for the
individual directors should be disclosed in detail in the annual financial statements of
the company. It should be an explicit item on the agenda of the annual GMS to give
shareholders the opportunity to debate these matters.
The Remuneration Committee (if it is established) should draft a proposal to the
Board of Commissioners for the remuneration policy or give an opinion on the
remuneration policy proposal made by the Board of Commissioners.
The remuneration of directors can consist of a fixed and a variable component.
The fixed component typically consists of a base salary. The most important factor
in determining an executive’s base salary is compensation practice among a peer
group of similar companies.
The most important factor in determining an executive’s variable remuneration is
his/her contribution towards the short and long-term financial performance of the
company. The variable component often consists of an annual bonus and is based
on key performance indicators. Variable compensation has come to represent a large
part of an executive’s remuneration package in many countries, to better motivate
performance.

       The variable component of the remuneration should align the interests of
       the executive directors with the long-term interests of the company and its
       shareholders. There are many ways to link executive pay to individual and
       company performance. Some common financial indicators utilized in variable
       compensation plans are:
          •	 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)
          •	 Operating profit
          •	 Return on Assets (ROA)
          •	 Return on Investment (ROI) or Equity (ROE)
          •	 Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
          •	 Economic Value Added (EVA) and
          •	 Achievement of specific individual objectives.

       There are many other financial indicators. Non-financial indicators are
       equally important and valuable in managing executive performance, and can
       be organized around:
         •	 Customers: For example, customer satisfaction levels, retention rates,
            customer loyalty and acquisitions
         •	 Operational Processes and Efficiency: For example, quality, cycle time
            and cost measures, and after sales service
         •	 Internal Growth/ Knowledge Management: For example, training
            programs, employee satisfaction rates, absenteeism and turnover.

       The Board of Directors will want to carefully develop key performance
       indicators and link executive remuneration to these indicators.




The practice of offering executives long-term incentives such as shares options has now
been exercised widely in Indonesian companies. Currently, it is very common to offer
a competitive compensation package, of which shares options or performance-related
bonuses comprise a major part, to executives of public companies.

       While remuneration is generally considered a responsibility of the Board
       of Directors, stock-and option-based compensation is increasingly an
       issue for which shareholder approval is required. The reason is that equity
       compensation contains considerable hidden costs for shareholders. These
       costs are hidden since accounting practices do not generally reveal the
       true price-tag of option-based compensation plans. For this reason, more
       and more companies are attempting to disclose the true cost of option
       compensation. In addition, some exchanges such as the New York Stock
       Exchange and the NASDAQ now require shareholder approval of all equity-
       based compensation plans.25

       While remuneration plans may serve to attract top executive talent and
       motivate better performance, the field of executive remuneration is both
       complex and a lightning rod for shareholder and public criticism. Companies
       that introduce such plans, in particular stock-option plans, should do so with
       a good deal of circumspection and a maximum level of transparency.




2.	 Employment Contracts for Directors
The ICL is silent on the contract for Board of Directors, and a director is not
considered as employee under the Indonesian Manpower Law. From a legal point
of view, such contract can be considered as a commercial contract rather than an
employment contract. The Board of Director is a company organ appointed by the
GMS, and such appointment being reflected in the Deed of Minutes of GMS meeting
made before the Public Notary. GMS will decide the policy and amount of the
remuneration that will be given to the members of Board of Director, and the Deed
will be the legal evidence or underlying document from which the appointment of a
director is made, including terms and condition of his/her engagement. For the GMS
of public companies, terms and conditions (such as tenure, remuneration and position)

of the appointment or engagement of a director shall be decided by the shareholders
in the GMS, and the Deed of GMS’s resolution will serve as legal document for the
company to disclose or address the issue. For certain non-public companies, the terms
and conditions of the engagement are usually incorporated in a letter of appointment
made by the (majority) shareholders.




                                                                    Best Practices

       In addition to the general data of contracting parties (the name of the
       President Director, or members of the Board of Directors and the name of the
       company), these employment contracts must include:
          •	 The starting date of the contract
          •	 The rights and duties of the President Director, or member of the Board
             of Directors
          •	 The rights and duties of the company
          •	 Remuneration
          •	 The term of the contract.

       The company may consider including the following additional terms and
       conditions in the employment contracts with the President Director and
       members of the Board of Directors:
         •	 Sanctions to be applied for failing to carry out one’s responsibilities
         •	 Benefits and other privileges (e.g., discounts on purchases of company
            shares, health insurance, reimbursement for housing costs)
         •	 Indemnification
         •	 Confidentiality clauses during the term of the contract and after the
            executive leaves the company regardless of the reason for leaving
         •	 Non-competition clauses during the service period and after the
            executive leaves the company for whatever reason
         •	 A commitment to protect the interests of the company and its
            shareholders
         •	 Grounds for early termination.




The Board of Directors                      211                    Remuneration and Reimbursement
If a Remuneration Committee is established, the company (through the company’s AoA
by the Board of Commissioners) should require the Remuneration Committee to draft a
proposal for the remuneration of each individual member of the Board of Directors, or
give an opinion about the Board of Commissioners proposal.




                                                                    Best Practices

       The Board of Directors should negotiate the employment contracts with the
       President Director and members of the Board of Directors. Good corporate
       governance practice would suggest that the Board of Directors should never
       determine their own remuneration. The Board of Directors and, ideally,
       an independent Remuneration Committee should do so. To avoid potential
       conflicts of interest, executive directors who are also Board of Directors
       members should not vote on their own employment contracts. In summary, it
       is recommended that Board meetings deal with these issues:
           •	 Board of Directors be counted for the quorum of the Board of Directors
           •	 The votes of Board of Directors not be counted when approving the
              terms and conditions of their own employment contracts.




3.	 Severance Payments to the President Director and
    Board of Directors’ Members
In many other countries, executives may, under certain circumstances, be dismissed
without cause and yet receive severance payments. This may occur when a company
has been acquired and the acquirer wishes to install new management. These
severance plans are sometimes referred to as golden parachutes. Golden parachutes
can be defined as a clause in an executive’s employment contract specifying that
he/she will receive large benefits in the event that the company is acquired and
the executive’s employment is terminated. These benefits can take the form of
severance pay, a bonus, stock options or a combination thereof. Like other forms of
compensation, golden parachutes are often the object of criticism.

       It is recommended that the employment contracts of the President Director
       and members of the Board of Directors include a provision for severance
       payments when their employment contracts are terminated prematurely
       without justifiable reasons.

               Does the company have a Corporate Secretary? Does the
               company need a Corporate Secretary? What contributions
               can a Corporate Secretary make to the company’s governing
               bodies?

               Is the position of Corporate Secretary filled on a full-time

               professional and personal skills and competencies?

               How does the company regulate the activities of the
               Corporate Secretary? Has the company mentioned the
               position of Corporate Secretary in its articles of association
               or internal regulations, or even adopted internal regulations
               for the Corporate Secretary?

From an international perspective, the work of the Corporate Secretary is essential to
the governance and administration of a company. The Corporate Secretary helps the
governing bodies perform their duties and execute their responsibilities. This chapter
focuses on the functions, qualifications and authorities of the Corporate Secretary,
and the role that the Corporate Secretary plays in implementing good corporate
governance practices.
In Indonesia’s regulatory framework, the Corporate Secretary is a concept introduced
and recognized by the CG Code as obligatory for listed company, state owned
company, province and region-owned company, companies that raise and manage
public funds, company of which products or services are widely used by public,
and companies with extensive influence on environment.1 Moreover, based on the
Regulation No. IX.1.4, the Corporate Secretary is an obligation for public companies.

A.	            The Role of the Corporate Secretary

1.	 The Need for and Importance of the Corporate
	Secretary
In the beginning of 2004, The National Committee on Corporate Governance had
launched The Indonesian Banking Sector Code for Corporate Governance, which
its provisions include guidance for corporate secretary for all banks in Indonesia.
While OJK as a regulatory body for public and listed companies had issued CG
regulation regarding corporate secretary in its regulation No. IX.I.4. regarding
Corporate Secretary.
The Corporate Secretary ensures that the governing bodies follow existing internal
corporate rules and policies, changes them or institutes new ones, when appropriate.
The Corporate Secretary can also assist in establishing and maintaining clear
communication between the various governing bodies of the company in compliance
with the company’s article of association, CG code and other internal regulations. In
addition, the Corporate Secretary helps to ensure that the governing bodies adhere to
all relevant regulatory requirements, both domestic and possibly foreign. Accordingly,
the Corporate Secretary often acts as an advisor to Board of Commissioners and
Board of Directors on regulatory requirements, listing rules and legislation related to
corporate governance. The Corporate Secretary may also identify gaps in corporate
governance matters and propose ways to address such weaknesses.
Figures 1 and 2 below demonstrate the increasingly prevalent view that the Corporate
Secretary can play an important role in companies and also indicate the types of
companies that might benefit the most from the creation of such a position.


                                                      Comparative Practices

       An increasing number of companies are introducing the position of Corporate
       Secretary. A number (47%) of surveyed companies in Russia state that they
       have a Corporate Secretary whose main function is to provide legal support
       to the Board of Commissioners. An increasing number of companies also
       understand that Corporate Secretaries contribute to improved corporate
       governance.

joint stock companies, especially for companies with more than 1,000 shareholders.

In Indonesia, the appointment of the Corporate Secretary is not mandatory for all com-
panies. However, it is mandatory if the relevant company has submitted a registration
application with OJK or for public listed company and bank. However, other companies
can have a Corporate Secretary, if they consider the establishment of this corporate
body to be in their best interest. Best international practices indicate that the bigger
companies, both public and private, appoint the Corporate Secretary as a part of good
corporate practice.

2.	 The Qualifications of a Corporate Secretary

A full-time staff member, exclusively dedicated to this task, can best fulfil the functions
of the Corporate Secretary.
When selecting a Corporate Secretary, the Board of Directors should look for an
individual with the highest qualifications and skills. The Board of Directors will need to
assess the candidate’s education, work experience, professional qualities and skills. The
general outline as well as the detail and specific criteria and requirement for evaluating
the candidates will be determined by the general documents adopted by the Board
of Directors (for example, the CG Code or the internal regulations for the Corporate
Secretary). A detailed Corporate Secretary job description, including rights and duties
that are not determined by the law, is the responsibility of the Board of Directors and
needs to be developed in conjunction with the contract signed between the Corporate
Secretary and the Board of Directors. At the same time it is important to note that
the term of office of the Corporate Secretary has to be stipulated by the company
regulation.
The core qualifications for Corporate Secretaries are illustrated in Figure 3.

company should avoid appointing individuals with criminal record or significant
administrative offences.

        required qualifications and mix-of-skills, as illustrated in Figure 4.2

More than 93% of surveyed companies felt that the Corporate Secretary would benefit
from specialized training to more effectively meet the requirements of the position.
More than 79% of companies were confident that it was necessary to develop a
professional set of standards for Corporate Secretaries to ensure the highest degree of
professionalism.


3.	 The Independence of the Corporate Secretary

To act in the interests of the company and its shareholders at all times, the Corporate
Secretary must be shielded from undue influence from management and other parties.
The Corporate Secretary should, thus, be accountable to and controlled by the Board
of Directors.




                                                                     Comparative Practices

       Figure 5 shows that, in practice, most Corporate Secretaries surveyed
       have been subject to some degree of influence by executives that could
       compromise their independence. Approximately 43% reported directly to
       either the President Director or the Executive Board.3

The Role of the Corporate Secretary                   222                          The Role of the Corporate Secretary
The Corporate Secretary should devote sufficient time to his/her responsibilities and
duties. Therefore, all companies in Indonesia established a fulltime Corporate Secretary
unit in their organization structure headed by an executive officer. In smaller companies,
the Legal Counsel or person holding a similar position, may carry out the duties of
the Corporate Secretary, if there are no adverse effects on efficiency and quality of
performing Corporate Secretary duties.


4.	 The Appointment of the Corporate Secretary

The procedure for selecting the Corporate Secretary should be set forth in the
company’s internal regulations as well as other detail information such as general and
specific criteria. The Corporate Secretary is designated by appointment. The Corporate
Secretary is appointed by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors should define
the terms and conditions of the employment contract and specifically address the issues
of remuneration and termination.


a. Information about Candidates for the Corporate Secretary
Before deciding who will be the Corporate Secretary, the Board of Directors should
possess all necessary information about potential candidates, in order to adequately
assess their qualifications, experience, personal capabilities and qualities for that job.
Therefore, a nominee for the position of Corporate Secretary should provide the Board
of Directors with sufficient information to evaluate his/her candidacy. Candidates
should, at a minimum, be required to provide information on:
   •	 Educational background
   •	 Employment in other companies
   •	 Any relationship they may have with affiliated persons and/or major business
      partners of the company
   •	 The number and type of company shares they own, if any
   •	 Declaration of non-conviction for criminal or significant administrative offences
   •	 Any other aspects and circumstances that may influence their performance as
      Corporate Secretary, in accordance with general company documents and Board
      of Directors’ requests.
This information may be supplemented by personal references and interviews with
directors and, in particular, with the Chairman (President Director), since a good



The Role of the Corporate Secretary        223                    The Role of the Corporate Secretary
personal rapport between the Chairman and other directors and the Corporate
Secretary will be important in maintaining effective working relationships. The
Corporate Secretary should notify the Board of Directors immediately of any changes
in circumstances that may influence his/her ability to effectively serve as the company’s
Corporate Secretary.


b. The Contract with the Corporate Secretary
Remuneration and other rights and duties of the Corporate Secretary are precisely
defined by the contract concluded between the Board of Directors and the Corporate
Secretary, in a form of an employment contract. As mentioned above, large companies
are well advised to employ the Corporate Secretary on a full-time basis to allow them to
properly execute their duties.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors is authorized to make a draft of the contract
that will be concluded with a Corporate Secretary.


c. The Office of the Corporate Secretary
Large companies may even find it necessary to establish an Office of the Corporate
Secretary, staffed by several assistants. Additional staffing may be useful for companies
with a large number of shareholders, a large number of Board of Commissioners and
Board of Directors and/or numerous Board of Commissioners committees.




                                                                  Basic Practices

       Many foreign companies, particularly publicly listed companies, have an
       Office of the Corporate Secretary with several staff members. Figure 6 shows
       the situation in U.K. companies.

In Indonesia, CG Code has stipulates the authorization of the Corporate Secretary
under the function of Board of Directors which related to the Public Relations sections
as follows:
   a.	The Board of Directors shall ensure the existence of a sound communication
      between the company and its stakeholders by empowering the function of a
      Corporate Secretary;
   b.	Function of the Corporate Secretary is to ensure: (i) a sound communication
      between the company and its governed bodies; and (ii) the availability of
      information that is accessible to the governed bodies in accordance with the proper
      need of the governed bodies;
   c.	 Publicly listed companies, state-owned enterprises, province and region- owned
       companies, companies that raise and manage public funds, companies of which
       products or services are widely used by public, and companies with extensive
       influence on environment, shall have a Corporate Secretary whose function may
       also include investor relations;
   d.	In the event that the company does not have a separate compliance work unit to
      ensure the compliance with laws and regulations, such function shall be carried out

       function shall be responsible to the Board of Directors. Report on the
       implementation of the Corporate Secretary’s duty shall also be submitted to the

2.	 Developing Corporate Governance Policies and
	Practices

Taking into consideration the authority of the Corporate Secretary, as well as practical
experiences in implementing corporate policies and practices, this corporate body
is ideally suited to help the company and its Board of Directors develop a system of
corporate governance. More specifically, the Corporate Secretary can play an important
role in the development of, compliance with and periodic review of the company’s
governance policies and practices.
In developing an explicit and clearly stated plan to improve the company’s corporate
governance policies and practices, the Corporate Secretary lays the groundwork for
reforms in this area. Perhaps more importantly, he/she can demonstrate the company’s
commitment to corporate governance by monitoring compliance with these policies and
informing the Board of Directors of any breaches. Finally, by reviewing the company’s
policies on a regular basis (by keeping abreast of the latest developments in corporate
governance, changes in the legal and regulatory framework, and international best
practices), the Corporate Secretary ensures that the company’s governance standards
remain high and up-to-date.



3.	 Legal and Organizational Support of the Board of
	Directors

Most of the Corporate Secretary’s time will be spent supporting the Board of Directors
as depicted in Figure 8.

a. Organizing Board of Directors Meetings
Although the CG Code or other Indonesian Law does not stipulate the function of
the Corporate Secretary specifically, the company internal regulation may stipulates
that The Corporate Secretary is responsible for organizing Board of Directors
meetings. Although Board of Directors meetings are ultimately the responsibility of
the Chairman, the Corporate Secretary handles all administrative and organizational
matters such as:
   •	 Helping the Chairman prepare the agenda
   •	 Developing presentations on substantive and procedural issues under discussion
   •	 Preparing model briefs for boardroom discussions.
This is the reason why it is recommended that the Chairman organizes Board of
Directors meetings together with the Corporate Secretary.

It is also advisable that the Corporate Secretary is responsible for communicating with
other members of the Board of Directors connected with organizing and conducting
Board meetings. These activities include:
   •	 Giving notice of Board of Directors meetings to all directors
   •	 Distributing voting ballots to directors
   •	 Collecting completed ballots and the written opinions of directors who are
      notphysically present at the meeting
   •	 Forwarding the ballots and written opinions to the Chairman
   •	 Conducting other activities in order to organize mutual communication between
      members of the Board of Directors and the Chairman in the period between
      Board meetings.
In addition, the Corporate Secretary should help ensure that proceduresfor Board of
Directors meetings are followed.
Along with the Chairman, theCorporate Secretary is responsible for drafting the
minutes of Board of Directors meetings, as well as keeping them in the company’s
archives.
The Corporate Secretary should brief newly elected directors on:
   •	 The corporate procedures that regulate the operations of the Board of Directors
      and other governing bodies
   •	 The organizational structure and officers of the company
   •	 The company’s internal documents
   •	 The decisions of the GMS and the Board of Directors that are in effect
   •	 The availability of information required by directors for the proper dischargeof
      their duties.


b. Providing the Board of Directors with Access to Information
According to the CG Code, the Corporate Secretary plays a key role in assisting
directors in obtaining the information they need for sound decision-making. The
Corporate Secretary provides directors with timely and full access to:
   •	 The minutes of the Board of Commissioners meetings
   •	 Decisions and documents approved by the President Director and the Board of
      Commissioners



The Role of the Corporate Secretary          230              The Authority of the Corporate Secretary
   •	 The minutes of meetings and reports prepared by the Audit Committee, the
      Internal Auditor, the External Auditor, or any other Committees established by
      the Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors
   •	 Financial documents.
It would be useful for a company to describe the role of the Corporate Secretary in
the internal regulations or other internal documents of the company.


c. Providing Legal Assistance to Directors on Governance Issues
While there are no laws and regulations stipulated the authority of the Corporate
Secretary for companies in Indonesia, best practices recommend that the Corporate
Secretary should assist directors with interpreting legal andregulatory acts related
to corporate governance, including listing rules, corporategovernance codes, and
international regulations and developments. This also holdstrue for procedural
issues regulated in the article of association, internal regulations and/or other
internaldocuments relating to preparing and conducting the GMS and Board of
Directorsmeetings, and on information disclosure. The Corporate Secretary should
not,however, render legal advice that falls outside the scope of his/her duties. The
duties of the Corporate Secretary should be clearly defined in relation to those of
the company’s Legal Counsel.
The Corporate Secretary should directly notify the Chairman of any
possibleviolations of corporate procedures, if and when he/she becomes aware of
such violations. Such violations may include, among others:
   •	 Alleged illegal acts or omissions of corporate officers or other corporate
      employees in fulfilling their legal duties and obligations
   •	 Violations of procedures regulating the organization of the GMS, Board
      of Directors meetings, the disclosure of information and protection of
      shareholder rights.

regard:

a. Liaising between Shareholders during Control Transactions
The Indonesian regulations do not cover the role of the Corporate Secretary during
control transactions. However, according to best practices, the Corporate Secretary acts
as a liaison between the controlling shareholder(s) in a buyout of common shares (and
securities convertible into common shares) and the other shareholders of the company
during a control transaction. The Corporate Secretary does this by ensuring that the
mandatory offer is distributed to all shareholders. The Corporate Secretary should
follow the procedures for the distribution of the mandatory offer to non-controlling
shareholders. The same can be applied to squeeze-out and sell-out procedures. This
role of the Corporate Secretary also includes active co-operation with external persons
(like brokers, dealers and banks), specialized and authorized for the realization of those

activities. The Corporate Secretary should also communicate with minority shareholders
to inform them about their rights in the context of takeovers.


b. Assisting in Enforcing Shareholder Rights
Best practices suggest that the Corporate Secretary:
   •	 Ensures that the company takes proper notice of all duly submitted shareholder
      petitions
   •	 Channels all duly submitted shareholder inquiries to the appropriate governing
      bodies and departments of the company.
The Corporate Secretary should try to resolve any conflicts, especially those concerning
the maintenance of the book of shareholders, promptly and fairly.


c. Assisting in Resolving Corporate Conflicts
It is recommended from best practices that the Corporate Secretary should be
responsible for recording corporate conflicts. The Corporate Secretary registers
inquiries, letters, or demands filed by shareholders,reviews these and duly transmits them
to the governing bodies that have the authorityto resolve the conflict. The effectiveness
of the company in preventingand resolving conflicts depends on its responsiveness to
all legitimate complaints.The Corporate Secretary also needs to periodically follow up
on the status ofcomplaints in order to make sure that they have been properly and fully
addressed,and either resolved or rejected.
Conflicts can arise among Board of Commissioners, Board of Directors members, and
shareholders. The Corporate Secretary should notify the Chairman of any potential or
existing conflicts so that they can be dealt with appropriately. Best practices suggest that
the Corporate Secretary acts as a liaison in case of conflicts among them.



5.	 Providing for Information Disclosure and Transparency
The Corporate Secretary can play an important role in helping the Board of Directors
and President Director in particular; fulfil their respective obligations to disclose material
information on a timely basis to external institutions and company’s shareholders,
in accordance with the financial market regulations.According to best practices, the
Corporate Secretary’s authority related to information disclosure is shown in Figure 10.

The Corporate Secretary also helps to ensure the transparent control procedures. More
specifically, he/she acts as a liaison between the Board of Commissioners and the Board
of Directors.




                                                                                  Comparative Practices

       Figure 11 illustrates the views of some Russian companies on the role that the
       Corporate Secretary plays in providing informationabout the company. Most
       companies agree that the Corporate Secretary should provide information
       in support of Board of Commissioners meetings, and to management and
       shareholders. There is, however, considerably less agreement with respect
       to the Corporate Secretary’s role in providing other types of informationto
       outsiders, for example, control and supervisory authorities.

The position of Corporate Secretary requires a unique skills-set, as shown in Figure 3
above. The Indonesian Corporate Secretary Association (ICSA) is currently promoting
the benefits of having a Corporate Secretary; training efforts are also being organized to
train the nascent profession. In foreign markets, professional associations or Corporate
Secretaries institutes often perform this role. Typically, such association is agroup od
corporate secretaries and have several functions, such as to:
   •	 Promote good governance, management, and efficient administration of
      companies
   •	 Support and protect the character, status, and interests of member Corporate
      Secretaries
   •	 Promote the efficiency and usefulness of the service and standard of professional
      conduct provided by Corporate Secretaries
   •	 Train Corporate Secretaries
   •	 Comment on proposed and existing laws, rules and regulations in areas of
      particular interest to members
   •	 Promote and assist in the voluntary exchange of information and experience
      relating to the duties, problems and practices of Corporate Secretaries and their
      companies.

On February 28, 2008, Indonesian Corporate Secretary Association (ICSA) was
established to provide assistances for public as well as private companies in trainings and
knowledge sharing on corporate secretary.

An Introduction to Shareholder Rights      240                       The Chairman’s Checklist
By investing in shares, investors become shareholders and receive a number of rights
attached to these securities. Shareholders rely on the rights they receive in return for
their investment. For most shareholders, this includes the right to participate in the
profits of the company. Other rights are also important, especially from the perspective
of the maintenance and increase of investment. These rights include, among others, the
right to vote on the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors composition,
any amendment to the AoA including the capital changes, approve the annual report
and financial statements, and the right to access information about the company and its
activities. Through these rights, shareholders ensure that the Board of Directors of the
company do not misappropriate their investment.
The quality of investor protection has several corporate governance implications,
such as the depth of capital markets, ownership patterns, dividend policy, and the
efficiency of allocating resources.1 Where laws are protective of shareholders and well
enforced, shareholders are willing to invest their capital, financial markets are broader
and more valuable. In contrast, where laws do not adequately protect shareholders, the
development of financial markets is stunted. When shareholder rights are protected
by the law, and indeed by the company itself, outside investors are willing to pay more
for financial assets such as equity. They pay more because they recognize that, with
better legal protection, more of the firm’s profit will return to them as dividends and/
or capital gains as opposed to being expropriated by Board of Directors or controlling
shareholders.
According to the Indonesia’s CG Code, Shareholders as owners of share capital
shall have certain rights and responsibilities within the company in accordance with
the laws and regulations and the AoA of the company. In exercising their rights and
responsibilities, the shareholders shall observe the following principles:2
     1.	The shareholders must be aware that in exercising their rights and responsibilities,
        they shall also consider the sustainability of the company.
     2.	The company shall facilitate the exercise of the ownership rights and
        responsibilities of the shareholders based on the principle of fairness and in
        accordance with laws and regulations and the articles of association.

This chapter provides an overview of shareholder rights and the rules a public company
must follow to protect these rights. Some specific rights, such as the participation in the
GMS, are discussed in detail in other chapters of this Manual.

	              Shareholder Rights

1.	 Reasons for Being a Shareholder
Investors purchase company shares for a variety of reasons. The most common reasons
are shown in Figure 1.


            Figure 1. Common Reasons for Becoming a Shareholder


                         Control: Shares provide investors with the opportunity to legally control the company and
                        influence decision-making by nominating directors and, possibly, management. The greater
                           the number of voting shares a shareholder holds, the greater the influence he wields.
                                                                    Monetary Returns vs. Control




                                                       Cash Payments vs. Capital Gains



               Dividends: Dividends play an important role in                                      Capital Gains: Investors purchases shares to
               the decision to invest. Regular dividend payments,                                  benefit from capital growth. Unlike dividends,
               especially if an investor holds a portofolio                                        shares need to be sold to realize the gains
               of shares, can generate predictable cash flows.                                     represented by rising share prices.

Shares bestow on their owners the right to attend and cast votes in GMS, receive
payment of dividends and the remainder of assets from liquidation, and exercise other
rights under the ICL. However, these rights will apply after the shares are recorded in
the register of shareholders under the name of the shareholders and do not apply to
certain classification of shares as determined in the ICL. Each share provides its owner
indivisible rights.3


2.	 Classification of Shares
The AoA shall determine 1 (one) or more classifications of shares. In the event that
there are more than one share classifications, the AoA shall determine one of them
as common shares.4 The various types of classification of shares do not always show
that the classifications are each independent and separate from one another, but may
constitute a merger of 2 (two) or more classifications.5 Shareholders shall be provided
with the proof of shares ownership.6

          For more information on authorized capital and shares, see Chapters 9 and 11.


a. Common Shares
Owners of common shares have the right to participate in the decision-making process
of the company, most commonly exercised by voting during the GMS. They also have
the right to share in the profits of the company either through dividends or through
capital gains.
In Indonesia, common shares have the following characteristics:7
     1.	The right to vote to adopt resolutions in GMS regarding all matters related to the
        management of the Company;
     2.	The right to receive dividends allocated; and
     3.	The right to receive the remainder of assets in liquidation.

Each share will have the same nominal value or accountable par, which is a portion of
the capital of the company. The AoA of a company define the number, nominal value
or accountable par, and rights attached to common shares. Every common share carries

An Introduction to Shareholder Rights                  243            General Provisions on Shareholder Rights
the same rights, interests and obligations to their owners in accordance with the ICL
and the AoA.


b. Preferred Shares
A company has the right to issue various classes of preferred shares. It is stipulated
under the Article 53 of ICL that in the event the company issued more than 1 (one)
share classes, then the AoA shall determine one amongst them as common shares. All
preferred shares of the same class must have the same rights to their owners. In the
case of listed companies that have various preferred stocks, the rights and obligations
attached to those preferred stocks must be fully disclosed to shareholders and approved
by the GMS.
Although there is no specific regulation, it is a good practice that the company AoA
specifies the amount of dividends and/or the liquidation value of preferred shares or,
alternatively, the procedure for determining the amount of dividends and the liquidation
value of preferred shares.
The ICL distinguishes preferred shares according to the specific rights they grant.
Preferred shares include shares of types as described hereunder:
   •	 Share with voting rights or without voting rights;
   •	 Share with special rights to nominate members of the Board of Directors and/or
      members of the Board of Commissioners;
   •	 Shares which after a certain period of time will be withdrawn or exchanged for
      some other classification of shares;
   •	 Shares which bestow on their holder the right to priority over holders of shares
      with other classifications in receiving dividends in the allocation of dividends
      cumulatively or non-cumulatively;
   •	 Shares which bestow on their holders the right to priority over holders of shares
      with other classification in receiving allocations of the remainder of the Company’s
      assets in liquidation

Under the ICL, the principal comparisons between common and preferred shares of
shareholding companies are summarized in Figure 2.

3.	 Types of Shareholder Rights
The ICL distinguishes between the rights of individual shareholders and the rights held
collectively by a group of shareholders. It is also possible to distinguish shareholder
rights according to their nature. Some rights relate to the decision-making process
and the organization of the company. Others relate to the capital and the return on
shareholder investment.
Figure 3 below illustrates the two-sided nature of the shareholder rights.

company AoA can however provide additional rights to shareholders as long as they are
not prohibited by legislation.

An Introduction to Shareholder Rights                      246                   General Provisions on Shareholder Rights
The Indonesia’s CG Code has code provisions on Rights of Shareholders and Key
Ownership Function.8
     1.	The rights of shareholders shall be protected and exercised in accordance with
        laws and regulations and the articles of association of the company. The rights of
        the shareholders shall essentially include:
         a.	The right to attend, express an opinion, and vote in the General Meeting of
            Shareholders based on the provision that one share entitles the right of the
            holder to issue one vote;
         b.	The right to obtain information regarding the company on a timely, proper
            and regular basis, except with respect to confidential matters, so that the
            shareholders can make a decision in relation to their investment in the
            company based on accurate information;
         c.	 The right to receive shares of profit appropriated for shareholders in the form
             of dividends and other profit sharing, in proportion to the shares owned;
         d.	The right to obtain full explanation and accurate information with regard to
            the procedures to be met in relation to the convening of the General Meeting
            of Shareholders in order for the shareholders to participate in decisions, including
            those affecting the existence of the company and the rights of the shareholders;
         e.	 In the event that there is more than one type and classification of shares in the
             company, then: (i) each shareholder is entitled to cast a vote in accordance with
             the type, classification and number of shares owned; and (ii) each shareholder
             is entitled to obtain a fair treatment based on the type and classification of the
             share owned.
     2.	The shareholders as owner of share capital shall be responsible for observing the
        laws regulations and the articles of association of the company. The responsibility
        of a shareholder shall include:
         a.	The controlling shareholder shall: (i) consider the interest of the minority
            shareholders and other stakeholders in accordance with laws and regulations;
            and (ii) disclose information regarding the company’s ultimate shareholders
            to the law enforcement agencies, in the event that there is suspected that a
            violation is committed against laws and regulations, or when requested by the
            relevant authority;
         b.	The minority shareholder shall be responsible for exercising its right properly in
            accordance with laws and regulations and the articles of association;

An Introduction to Shareholder Rights          247                General Provisions on Shareholder Rights
         c.	 As shareholders shall: (i) segregate the company’s asset from his/her personal
             asset; and (ii) segregate his/her function as a shareholder from that as a
             member of the Board of Commissioners or the Board of Directors, it that
             shareholder holds position in one of the two organs;
         d.	In the case where a shareholder becomes the controlling shareholder in several
            companies, it is necessary that the accountability and inter-company relations
            are carried out clearly.
In addition to that, here in Indonesia, each shareholder is entitled to file suit against the
company in the district court if the shareholder has been harmed by any action of the
company considered unfair and unreasonable as a result of a resolution of the GMS,
Board of Directors and/or Board of Commissioners.9




                                                                        Best Practices

       A shareholder should have the right to file suit against directors including
       derivative and class action law suits. The country’s legal system should
       provide and enforce mechanisms for minority shareholders to bring lawsuits
       when they have reasonable grounds to believe that their rights have been
       violated (see OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, pages 40 & 42).

B.	            Specific Shareholder Rights

1.	 The Right to Vote
Shareholders can participate in the decision-making of the company through their
right to vote during the GMS. Important matters that fall within the authority of
voting at GMS include: i) amendments to company AoA; ii) development strategy of
the company; iii) authorization of additional shares; election or dismissal of the Board
of Commissioners and the Board of Directors ; iv) extraordinary transactions such as
investment or sales of assets in equivalent to 50% or more of the company’s total assets;
vi) approval of dividend and annual financial statements; and vi) reorganization or
resolution of the company.
Each share issued shall carry one vote, unless the AoA determine otherwise. However,
the vote shall not apply to:10
   a.	Shares in the company controlled by the company itself;
   b.	Shares in a parent company directly or indirectly controlled by its subsidiary; or
   c.	 Shares in the company controlled by another company whose shares are directly or
       indirectly owned by the company.

Holders of a fraction of the nominal value of a share shall not be granted individual
voting rights unless the holder of a fraction of the nominal value of a share individually
or together with another holder of a fraction of the nominal values of a share with
the same classification of share has a nominal value equal to 1 (one) nominal value of
that classification.11 It is because each share bestows on its owner indivisible rights and
in the event that 1 (one) share is owned by more than 1 (one) person, the rights arising
out of the shares shall be exercised by means of appointing 1 (one) person as their joint
representative.12

An Introduction to Shareholder Rights       249                         Specific Shareholder Rights
                                                                     Best Practices

       Shareholders should be able to make their views known on the remuneration
       policy for board members and key executives. The equity component of
       compensation schemes for board members and employees should be subject
       to shareholder approval (see OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, page 18).




The right to vote can be conducted either severally or through a representative by
virtue of a power of attorney.13 A proxy holder is authorized to act on behalf of
the shareholder and to make any decision the shareholder could have made during
the GMS. However, shareholders are not permitted to give a power of attorney to
more than one proxy for part of the shares they own with different votes.14 A listed
company is not allowed to restrict the participation by its shareholders in the GMS and
should facilitate its shareholders’ authorization of their representatives to participate
in the GMS when shareholders so request. A standard form of letter of proxy must
be attached to GMS’ invitation and sent to shareholders prior to the GMS. Except
for limitations provided by legislation, any individual can serve as a proxy so long as
this person is given an appropriate written proxy. Letters of proxy shall be in writing
in the form as prescribed by the company and need not be notarized. However in
voting, members of the Board of Directors, members of the Board of Commissioners,
and employees of the company concerned are prohibited from acting as proxies for
shareholders.15

                                                                   Best Practices

       The corporate governance framework should ensure that proxies are voted
       in accordance with the direction of the proxy holder and that disclosure is
       provided in relation to how undirected proxies will be voted. It is important
       to disclose how the Chairperson of the meeting (as the usual recipient of
       shareholder proxies obtained by the company) will exercise the voting rights
       attached to undirected proxies. The objective of facilitating shareholder
       participation suggests that companies favorably consider the enlarged use
       of information technology in voting, including secure electronic voting in
       absentia (see OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, page 35). A common
       electronic voting system that helps shareholders to vote in absentia is the
       public network DRE (direct recording electronic) voting system which uses
       electronic ballots and transmits vote data from the polling place to another
       location over a public network. Voting data may be transmitted as individual
       ballots as they are casted, periodically as batches of ballots throughout the
       election day, or as one batch at the close of voting. This includes Internet
       voting as well as telephone voting. Some countries that use this system for
       voting include the Estonia, Ireland, Switzerland, the UK and the US.




          For more information on the GMS, see Chapter 8.


a) The Right to Vote Common Shares
Common shares grant voting rights to their holders. However, there are some
circumstances when common shares become non-voting. These circumstances are as
follows:16
   a.	Shares owned by the Company itself;
   b.	Main shares of the Company that are owned by its subsidiaries, either directly or
      indirectly; or
   c.	 Shares of the Company which are owned by other Company which shares, either
       directly or indirectly, owned by the Company.

       Current laws and regulations in Indonesia have not stipulated cases where
       voting rights are precluded. The following cases are considered good
       practices:

           Precontitions                                         Legal Consequences

           Violation of Rules on Acquisition of shares           Precludes voting on all issues
           in control transactions: When a person (or a          during the GMS
           group of affiliated persons) has not followed the
           procedures specified by the law on securities when
           acquiring these shares


           Violation of Rules concerning a mandatory bid         Common shares cannot be

           When a person (or a group of affiliated persons):

           • Acuires common shares of the target company
             that exceed 25% of common shares (i.e. 25% of
             votes in the GMS of that company) or

           • Holding 25% or more of the shares with voting
             rights intends to buy more shares that leads to
             ownership of 51%, 65%, or 75% of the total
             shares with voting rights of that company

           That person (or group of affiliated persons) will
           have to submit their public bit registration to
           the OJK/Authority. The public bid is conducted
           only after it is approved by th OJK/Authority and
           announced in advance by bid-making organizations
           or individuals on the mass media.


           The Right of squeeze-out: When the offer or              Precludes voting on the
           following the tender offer holds at least 80% of         waiver of the controlling

           subsidiary directly or indirectly acquires shares in a   rights at the GMS
           parent company


           Preclusion of voting rights: When the GMS is             The shareholder may not vote
           deciding the following issues:                           at a GMS when deciding
                                                                    these issues
           • Shareholders’ relief from duties to the company
             or diminution of such duties

           • Whether to initiate or abandon legal proceedings
             against the shareholder




b) The Right to Vote Preferred Shares
ICL specifically regulates three types of preferred shares, namely voting preferred
shares, dividend preferred shares and redeemable preferred shares.17

       All investors should be able to obtain information about the rights attached
       to all series and classes of shares before they purchase. Any changes in
       voting rights should be subject to approval by those classes of shares which
       are negatively affected. Their rights should not be changed unless those
       holding voting shares have had the opportunity to participate in the decision.
       Proposals to change the voting rights of different series and classes of
       shares should be submitted for approval at the GMS by a specified majority
       of voting shares in the affected categories (see OECD Principles of Corporate
       Governance, page 41).




2.	 The Right to Appeal Decisions of the General
	 Meeting of Shareholders

Each shareholder is entitled to file a suit against the Company to the District Court if
they suffer losses due the action of the Company which is considered to be unfair and
unreasonable as a result of a resolution of the GMS, the Board of Directors, and/or the
Board of Commissioners.18
Furthermore, the ICL stipulates that each shareholder is entitled to request the company
that the shareholder’s share be bought at a fair price if the shareholder concerned does
not approve actions by the company which harm that shareholder or the company, in
the form of:
   •	 Amendments of the AoA;
   •	 Assigment or securing of assets of the company which have a value of more than
      50% (fifty per cent) of the company’s net assets; or
   •	 Merger, Consolidation, Acquisition, or spin-off.19

          For more information on appealing decisions of the GMS, see Chapter 8, Section E.4.

3.	 The Right to Receive Information about the Company
Every shareholder shall have the right to examine the register of shareholders, the
special register, the minutes of GMS.20 In the forum of a GMS, shareholders are entitled
to obtain information related to the company from the Board of Directors and/or
Board of Commissioners in so far as it is connected to the agenda items and does not
conflict with the company’s interest.21 The shareholders may also request the copy of
materials to the company in a GMS.22
The AoA and internal regulations should specify the procedures that the company
and shareholders must follow for the distribution of information and documents. The
information rights of common and preferred shareholders under best practices are
depicted in Figure 5.

With such a large number and variety of documents and information, it is preferable
for companies with large numbers of shareholders to define in the AoA or the
internal regulations the procedures for realization of shareholders’ rights to receive all
information. These procedures should ensure that shareholders are provided with all
information within a reasonable timeframe and without disturbing the company’s day-
to-day activities.



                                                                             Best Practices

       It is good practice to provide the requested documents to the shareholders
       for their examination at the company’s premises within five days after the
       request is received. The company should not charge shareholders more than
       the actual cost of copying the requested documents.



          For more information on information disclosure, see also Chapter 13.




4.	 The Right to Freely Transfer Shares
Shares constitute moveable property23 and shareholders are free to transfer their shares
as stipulated in the company’s AoA.
Except for voting preferred shares and shares subscribed by founding shareholders at
the establishment of the company, the owners of common and preferred shares of a
company have the right to freely transfer their shares to other shareholders and other
persons who are not shareholders of the company. They can sell their shares at any time
and at any price, without the consent of, or any pre-emptive right on the part of, the
company and other shareholders.
Voting preferred shares are held by only government-authorized organizations and
founding shareholders. The voting preference of founding shareholders shall be effective
for three years from being granted a business registration license. After that, voting
preferred shares of founding shareholders shall be converted into common shares when
they can be freely transferred by the owners.

An Introduction to Shareholder Rights             256                            Specific Shareholder Rights
There are some restrictions on the transfer of common shares subscribed by founding
shareholders at the establishment of the company. Within three years from the date of
being granted the business registration certificate, founding shareholders may freely
transfer their common shares which are subscribed at the establishment of the company
to other founding shareholders and only may transfer those shares to other non-
founding shareholders upon the agreement of the GMS. After this three-year period, all
restrictions imposed upon founding shareholders shall be abolished.

          For more information on the transfer of shares, see also Chapter 11.


5.	 Pre-Emptive Rights
Pre-emptive rights for shareholders may be mandated by the article of association of
company. In the event the article of association mandate that selling shareholders first
offer their shares to shareholders with a particular classification or other shareholders,
and within the period of 30 (thirty) says as from when the date the offer is made it
transpires that such shareholders have not made the purchase, the selling shareholder
may offer and sell the shares to third parties. So that after the lapse of the 30 (thirty)
day period, any selling shareholders compelled to offer shares is entitled to withdraw the
offer. This obligation to offer to shareholders with a particular classification or to other
shareholders shall only apply once.24
In certain circumstances, shareholders have pre-emptive rights that allow them to
purchase shares or convertible securities on a priority basis before they are offered
to third parties. Thus, a shareholder has the right to subscribe newly issued shares in
proportion to the par value of the shares or the book value of no par value shares he/
she owns at the time the company decides to issue new shares. For listed companies, it is
regulated that existing shareholders shall be given priority to be offered ordinary shares
for sale at the ratio corresponding to their ownership percentage of ordinary shares in
the company, except where otherwise stipulated by the GMS.25

a) The Purpose of Pre-Emptive Rights
Pre-emptive rights ensure that all shareholders of the same class are treated equally.
They provide the opportunity to purchase new shares when the company wants to
increase its capital. Pre-emptive rights help protect shareholders from dilution, which
can result in losing some of their rights due to the decrease of the percentage of shares
they hold.

b) When Pre-Emptive Rights Exist
Whenever the capital is increased by consideration in cash, the shares must be offered
on a pre-emptive basis to shareholders in proportion to the capital represented by
their shares.

c) Pre-Emptive Rights and Fractional Shares
When shareholders exercise pre-emptive rights, fractions of shares (fractional shares) can
result.26 However, market practice is that the number of additional shares issued will be
rounded down to the unit of share. The Board of Directors can distribute the remaining
shares due to rounding to shareholders of the company or to others in an appropriate
way provided that the offering conditions of such remaining shares are not better than
that offered to existing shareholders.

d)The Procedure for Exercising Pre-Emptive Rights
For a listed company that intends to increase its capital stock through pre-emptive rights,
the company shall conduct the following:27
   1.	Convene a GMS to consider and approve the proposed offering;
   2.	Disclose the following information:
       a)	 The full name of the listed company, the address of the head office, telephone,
           telex, facsimile, email and post office box numbers;
       b)	 A description of the Securities that resulted from the exercise of the pre-
           emptive rights;
       c)	 The date of the GMS;
       d)	 The record date that determines the shareholders recorded on the Share
           register books have pre-emptive rights, or the coupon numbers for determining
           the pre-emptive rights;
       e)	 The last date for exercising the pre-emptive rights with a notification that rights
           not exercised will expire on that date, and the last date for payment;
       f)	 The trading period of the pre-emptive rights;
       g)	 The price of Securities subscriptions;
       h)	 The ratio of pre-emptive rights to existing shares;

           underlying shares are listed (if any);
       n)	 The plan of the listed company to issue or not to issue shares or other
           Securities that may be converted into shares within 12 (twelve) months after the
           effective date;

       A shareholder that has pre-emptive rights can exercise these rights fully or in
       part by submitting to the company:
          •	 A written statement requesting the purchase of additionally issued
             shares or other convertible securities, must include:
          •	 The name of the shareholder
          •	 The place of residence (location) of the shareholder
          •	 The number of shares to be purchased by the shareholder
          •	 A document verifying the payment for shares.




An Introduction to Shareholder Rights         259                        Specific Shareholder Rights
6.	 The Right to Demand the Redemption of Shares
Each shareholder is entitled to request the company that the shareholder’s shares be
bought at a fair price if the shareholder concerned does not approve of actions by the
company which harm that shareholder or the company, in the form of:
   1)	Amendments of the AoA;
   2)	Assignment or securing of assets of the company which have a value of more than
      50% (fifty per cent) of the company’s net assets; or
   3)	Mergers, Consolidations, Acquisitions or Demergers.28

In the event that the shares requested to be purchased exceed the limit of the buyback
requirements that, the amount of nominal value of all shares redeeem by the company
and the pledge of shares or the fiduciary security on shares held by the company itself,
and/or other company which shares are directly or indirectly owned by the company
does not exceed 10% (ten percent) from the amount of issued capital in the company,
except otherwise regulated in the legislation in the field of capital markets, the company
shall make efforts so that the remainder of the shares is purchase by the third party.29
The company may redeem the shares which have issued under the following conditions:30
   a.	The redemption of shares shall not result in the net assets of the company becomes
      less than the issued capital plus the statutory reserve that has been set aside; and
   b.	The amount of nominal value of all shares buy back by the company and the
      pledge of shares or the fiduciary security on shares held by the company itself,
      and/or other company which shares are directly or indirectly owned by the company
      does not exceed 10% (ten percent) from the amount of issued capital in the company,
      except otherwise regulated in the legislation in the field of capital markets.

The ICL requires that the redemption of shares shall first be agreed in the forum of
GMS under the following conditions:
   1.	Unless otherwise stipulated under the Law of Capital Market;
   2.	The resolution of the GMS in order to conduct redemption of shares shall be
      valid if adopted in accordance with the provisions regarding notice of meeting,
      quorum, and approval on the number of votes to amend the articles of association
      as regulated in the ICL and/or the AoA.

7.	 Shareholder Rights during the Liquidation
	 of the Company
Shareholders are residual claimants when a company is being liquidated, i.e. they will
receive a portion of the assets remaining after creditor claims are satisfied. Owners
of common shares have a right to receive a portion of the company’s property in
proportion to their holdings in the company after the company has paid out its creditors
and shareholders of other classes in accordance with law.
During liquidation, a company must first satisfy its priority claimants (usually liquidation
and administrative expenses, salaries, wages, employee benefits and taxes), and then
obligations to creditors. Finally, the liquidator divides the remaining assets among the
shareholders following a specific order of priority:
   1)	Redeemable preferred shares
   2)	Dividend preferred shares
   3)	Voting preferred shares and common shares.




An Introduction to Shareholder Rights                          261                                          Specific Shareholder Rights
The company’s assets must be distributed to each group in order of priority. For
example, the company cannot pay the liquidation value of preferred shares until it has
paid the full liquidation value of higher priority shares. If the company does not have
sufficient assets to pay all shareholders of the same priority class, then the assets must be
distributed in proportion to the number of shares in the class.
Article 149 (1) of the ICL stipulated that a liquidator’s obligations in settling a
company’s assets in the liquidation process shall cover implementation of payment of
the reminder of assets resulting from the liquidation to shareholders. In the event that
remaining assets have been divided among shareholders and there are creditors’ bills,
the District Court shall order the liquidator to retrieve the remaining assets resulting
from the liquidation already divided among shareholders.31



8.	 The Right to Review the Shareholder List
The list of shareholders shall be made on the basis of the date of establishing the
shareholders using an extract from the Register Book of Shareholders.
Every shareholder shall have the right to check, search, extract and copy the list of
shareholders, to request amendment of incorrect information or addition of necessary
information.
This right gives shareholders the opportunity to contact other shareholders and
coordinate voting for collective action purposes. It is also important for verifying the
information in the shareholder list, as well as exercising rights attached to shares.
Companies’ Board of Directors shall make and keep a register of shareholders,
containing at least:
   •	 Shareholders’ names and addresses;
   •	 The number, serial number, and date of acquisition of shares held by shareholders
      and their classification in the event that more than one classification of shares has
      been issued;
   •	 The amount paid up on every share;
   •	 The name and address of an individual or legal entity who has a pledge over
      the shares or is the recipient of fiduciary security over shares and the date of
      acquisition of the pledge or registration of the fiduciary security;
   •	 Information on the shares having been paid up in other forms.

An Introduction to Shareholder Rights       262                           Specific Shareholder Rights
Apart from the register of shareholders, companies’ Board of Directors must make
and keep a special register which contains information regarding shares in the
Company or in other Companies of members of the Board of Directors and Board of
Commissioners together with their families and the date such shares were obtained.32
The register of shareholders and special register must be made available in the
Company’s domicile so that they can be seen by the shareholders.33 And at a
shareholder’s written request, the Board of Directors shall give the shareholder
permission to examine the register of shareholders, special register, and GMS minutes
contemplated in paragraph (1) and the annual report and to obtain copies of GMS
minutes and copies of the annual report.34



9.	 The Right to File a Claim on Behalf of the Company
The ICL introduced, in principle, the right of shareholders to request the court to
overturn GMS decisions.
Each shareholder is entitled to file suit against the Company in the district court if the
shareholder has been harmed by any action of the Company considered unfair and
unreasonable as a result of a resolution of the GMS, Board of Directors and/or Board
of Commissioners.35




                                                                    Best Practices

        A shareholder should have the right to file suit against directors including
        derivative and class action law suits. The country’s legal system should
        provide and enforce mechanisms for minority shareholders to bring lawsuits
        when they have reasonable grounds to believe that their rights have been
        violated (see OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, pages 40 & 42).

Furthermore, on behalf of the Company, shareholders representing at least 1/10 (one
tenth) of the total number of shares with voting rights may file suit through the district
court against the members of the Board of Directors and/or the members of the
Board of Commissioners who by their fault or negligence gave rise to the losses for the
Company.36

          For more information on the liability of directors and managers, see Chapter 4, Section F, and
          Chapter 5, Section E, respectively.


10.	The Right to Receive Dividends
Dividends play an important role in the decision to invest in a company. One important
right of shareholders is to receive dividends. The Board of Directors shall make a
proposal on the pay-out ratio for each class of shares and submit it to the GMS for
approval. For listed companies, the final decision is exclusively vested with the GMS
which shall not be higher than the rate proposed by the Board. Dividends can be made
in cash or in the form of common shares.
All net profits after the deduction to be set aside as reserves shall be allocated to the
shareholder as dividends unless determined otherwise in the GMS.37 The Board
of Directors may decide a mid-term payment of dividends when such payment is
considered to conform with the profitability of the company. Provisions regarding mid-
term payment or interim dividends are stipulated in the ICL Article 72.

          For more information on the Right to Receive Dividends, see Chapter 10.


11.	The Right to Summon a General Meeting of
	Shareholders
This right is very important to shareholders to protect their rights. The ICL Article 79
stipulated that GMS may be convened at the request of 1 (one) or more shareholders
who jointly represent 1/10 (one tenth) or more of the total number of shares with voting
rights, unless the AoA determine a smaller number and the request shall be submitted to
the Board of Directors by Registered Letter accompanied by the reasons therefor.

          For more information on the Right to Summon a GMS, see Chapter 8.

	 as Members of the Board of Commissioners and

C.	            The State as a Shareholder

The State can become a shareholder in shareholding companies through buying
shares or through the conversion of State companies into shareholding companies
(i.e. this process is normally called as “nationalization”).
In Indonesia, the government owned shares in the State Owned Enterprises (SOEs),
wholly owned or a fraction of the shares in the case of SOEs under privatization
programs.
Further detail of the practices regarding this issues will be explained in Chapter 15
on SOCs.


1.	 The State as an Ordinary Shareholder
In this case, the influence of the State in a company is determined by the percentage
of owned shares.


2.	 The State as the Holder of Privileged Rights
The regulatory framework in Indonesia does not provide any provision regarding
this item.




                                                                    Best Practices

       (Foreign) investors are usually cautious about investing in companies where
       shares are issued having privileged rights. Despite the fact that privileged
       rights arrangements can play a useful role in protecting the interests of the
       State and the public, it is recommended that State agencies carefully weigh
       all the pros and cons of implementing privileged rights arrangements for each
       company.

3.	 Exercising the Rights of the State as a Shareholder
In the event that all of the State-Owned Limited Liability Company (Persero)’s shares
owned by the state, then the MOLHR shall acts in his/her capacity as a shareholder,
while in the event that not all of the Persero’s shares owned by the state, then the
MOLHR acts as a shareholder.39 The MOLHR may authorize an individual or a legal
entity with the right of substitution to represent him/her in the GMS, the authorized
party must first obtain approval of the MOLHR with respect to:
   a.	A change in the amount of capital;
   b.	Amendments to the AoA;
   c.	 Planned utilization of profits;
   d.	A merger, consolidation, acquisition, dissolution of the Persero;
   e.	 Long-term investment and financing;
   f.	 Cooperation of the Persero;
   g.	 Formation of subsidiaries or participation;
   h.	Transfer of assets.

D.	            The Shareholder Register

The shareholder register is an important document that identifies the shareholders and
the owners of other registered securities of the company. It can be used to verify the
number, nominal value, type, and class of shares and other registered securities held.
The shareholder register is also maintained to secure shareholder rights and to monitor
the circulation of shares and other registered securities.


1.	 The Company Share Register - Register Book of
	Shareholders
A company shall make and maintain a register book of shareholders from the date of
being granted the certificate of business registration. Such a book may be in writing, in
electronic files, or both.
The register book of shareholder shall contain at least:40
   a)	 Shareholders’ names and addresses;
   b)	The number, serial number, and date of acquisition of shares held by shareholders

2.	 Registration for Obtaining the Effective Statement
Under the regulatory framework in Indonesia, a company who intends to conduct a
public offering shall first submit a prospectus to the OJK. The prospectus must contain
details and material facts regarding a public offering, which may influence an investor’s
decision. This is including a description of the capital structure, prior to and after the
public offering which include a description of ownership by shareholders that own 5%
or more, and directors and commissioners (number of shares, nominal value and the
percentage).43
In addition to this, for public companies whose registration statement has become

5% (five percent) ownership of issuers’ or public companies’ shares, director and
commissioners that own the issuers’ or public companies’ shares and group of public
shareholders that own less than 5% (five percent) of issuers’ or public companies’ shares
must be included in the annual report.44
Other than the above, the company is also required ro submit the following reporting
obligation:
   a.	Obligation To Report Any Events, Information, or Material Facts

       Available to Public provides that every pulic company or issuer whose the
       registration statement has become effective, must report to OJK and announce it to
       public, no later than 2 (two) working days after the event occurs, which may affect
       the price of securities or investor’s decision.
   b.	Obligation to Submit Periodic Financial Statement
       Regulation no. X.K.2 regarding the Obligation to Sumbit Periodic Financial
       Statement requires every issuer and public company whose registration statement

3.	 Registration with the Business Registrar
Moreover, under the Law No. 8 year 1982 concerning Mandatory Company Registry,
Company Register is a list of official record containing matters to be registered by each
company. The aim of Company Register is to record any material information of the
company and is the official source of information for all interested parties regarding
the identity, data, and other information about the company in order to ensure business
certainty.45 This list shall include data on the company’s shareholding structure (i.e
authorized capital, number and nominal value of each shares and amount of subscribed
and paid-up capital).46 The competent authority who is responsible to conduct the
Company Register is the Ministry of Trade.47 For companies that have been registered
in the Company Register will be given a Company Registration Certificate for a period
of 5 (five) years from the date of issuance and shall be updated at least 3 (three) months
before the expiry date.48

E.	            The Protection of Shareholder Rights

The protection of shareholder rights lies at the center of corporate governance and is
of particular importance for companies operating in emerging markets or transition
economies. This protection is realized both internally (i.e. through internal corporate
procedures and other guarantees envisaged by the ICL and other legislation), and
externally (i.e. through outside parties).


1.	 Guarantees in the Indonesian Company Law
The ICL provides many guarantees to realize and protect shareholder rights. Some of
these guarantees are procedural in nature and relate to the organization of the GMS.
Others are reflected in the respective obligations of the governing bodies and officers of
the company, i.e. members of the Board of Commissioners, the Board of Directors, the
President Director.


                                                                    Best Practices

       It is important for the AoA to ensure that shareholder rights, and the
       mechanisms designed to ensure and protect these rights, are clearly defined.




2.	 Judicial Protection
Failing to convene an irregular meeting of the GMS as requested in accordance with
the ICL within a specific period of time, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and/
or Board of Commissioner shall be responsible to the law and compensate any damages
and losses caused to the company. Shareholders can file a petition requesting the Court
or an arbitrator to consider and/or cancel resolutions of the GMS in certain specific
cases.49

Shareholders representing at least 1/10 (one tenth) of the total number shares with
voting rights may file suit through the district court in certain specific circumstances.50


3.	 Non-Governmental Organizations for the
	 Protection of Shareholder Rights
The regulatory framework in Indonesia does not provide any provision regarding this
item.




                                                         Comparative Practices

       In some countries, NGOs play an important role in exerting pressure on
       companies, particularly those companies that wantonly disregard shareholder
       interests. NGOs may do this in a number of different ways. They may become
       shareholders themselves and participate in the GMS. They may also conduct
       letter or media campaigns to exert pressure on companies and draw public
       attention to the issue of shareholder rights protection. NGOs have the right to
       assist shareholders with:
          •	 Providing legal help for filing a claim in court to protect shareholder
             rights.
          •	 Establishing special funds for the protection of shareholders’ interests.




4.	 Company Article of Association
A listed company shall build a rational corporate governance apparatus and an effective
system of communication with shareholders in order to ensure that:
   •	 Shareholders can fully exercise the rights provided for by law and the company’s
      AoA.
   •	 Shareholders are fairly treated.

An Introduction to Shareholder Rights        272                   The Protection of Shareholder Rights
A listed company shall elaborate its AoA according to the model AoA promulgated by
the OJK. Pursuant to a Regulation No. IX.J.1, the main content of a listed company’s
AoA includes what follows:
       •	 Name and domicile of the company
       •	 The company’s period of incorporation
       •	 The purposes and objectives and business activities of the company
       •	 Capitalization
       •	 Issuance of equity securities
       •	 Increase in the company’s authorized capital
       •	 Shares
       •	 Proof of share ownership
       •	 Share certificates and collective share certificates for damaged or lost shares
       •	 Collective custody
       •	 Transfer of rights to shares
       •	 Members of the board of directors and commissioners
       •	 Works plans, annual reports, annual financial reports and use of profits
       •	 The GMS


5.	 Shareholder Activism and Collective Action
The protection of shareholder rights begins with good corporate behaviour, an
appropriate legal and regulatory framework and appropriate enforcement procedures.
Shareholders themselves must also play a role in this process. Shareholders are often the
only parties aware of violations to their rights and are in the best position to either file a
complaint with the company or, ultimately, with the regulatory and judicial bodies.
ICL adopts a one share one vote system. Unless the AoA stipulates otherwise, each
shareholder has the right to one vote.51 The arrangement of legal protection of minority
shareholders in the ICL is as follow:

An Introduction to Shareholder Rights          274                         The Protection of Shareholder Rights
                                         Company Practices in Indonesia

       The protection of minority shareholder rights remains a key concern for many
       (international) investors considering investing in Indonesian companies.
       Powerful owners/Board of Directors often pay little or no heed to minority
       shareholders. On the other hand, shareholders themselves are often passive,
       reflecting the lack of a shareholder culture among Indonesian investors. In
       fact, minority shareholders seldom participate in shareholder meetings unless
       they are employees. This makes the role of regulatory and supervisory bodies
       even more important in ensuring that proper attention is paid to the protection
       of shareholder rights.




6.	 Shareholder Agreements
Shareholder agreements can be an important device for exercising collective action
among shareholders. In fact, such agreements can enable minority shareholders to make
use of minority rights (e.g. acquiring the 10% necessary to elect a fiduciary to examine
the financial statements). The situation is more complex if agreements are concluded
between shareholders and the company (or one of its governing bodies). In those
circumstances, shareholders may be “locked in” in a variety of ways, e.g. by obliging
themselves to always vote in favor of proposals by directors or to always follow the
instructions of management in matters relating to essential shareholder rights (the right
to sell their shares, the right to receive dividends and other rights).




An Introduction to Shareholder Rights       275                   The Protection of Shareholder Rights
                                                                     Best Practices

       Shareholder agreements can often be used to abuse shareholder rights and
       force (minority) shareholders to act in a way that is suitable for directors,
       managers and/or controlling shareholders. Therefore, such agreements must
       be carefully regulated. For example, in the U.K., shareholder agreements
       cannot require a shareholder to vote in one of the following ways:
          •	 Always to follow the instructions of the company or one of its bodies
          •	 Always approve the proposals of the company or one of its bodies
          •	 To vote in a specified manner or abstain in consideration of special
             advantages.




Shareholder agreements are, in principle, a form of private, civil law contract. Yet, because
of their corporate governance implications, it is necessary to make certain provisions.
First, shareholder agreements cannot substitute (or contradict) the founding documents
(AoA) of the company.
Second, it is necessary to prevent the above-mentioned forms of abuse to the ability to
control the voting power of minority shareholders by prohibiting the inclusion of certain
terms in such agreements.
Lastly, it is necessary (particularly for publicly traded companies) to provide for greater
transparency of voting control by requiring the disclosure of such arrangements.
Accordingly, shareholders are required to inform GMS about the concluded contract on
the next meeting of shareholders.
Under prevailing laws, there is no specific regulation on the terms of shareholder
agreements or on the disclosure of shareholder agreements.

F.	            Responsibilities of Shareholders

1.	 Obligation to Make Full Payment for their
	 Subscribed Shares
In addition to rights, shareholders also have responsibilities. The main legal
responsibility of shareholders is to make full payment for shares for their subscribed
shares. At least 25% (twenty five per cent) of the authorized capital must be issued and
paid up in full.52




2.	 Obligation to be Liable to Debt and other
	 Liabilities of the Company
Companies’ shareholders are not personally liable for legal relationships entered into
on behalf of the Company and are not liable for the Company’s losses in excess of the
shares they own. However, this provisions above do not apply if:53
   a)	 The requirements for the Company to be a legal entity have not been or are not
       fulfilled;
   b)	The shareholder concerned directly or indirectly exploits the Company in bad
      faith in his/her personal interest;
   c)	 The shareholder concerned is involved in illegal acts committed by the Company;
       or
   d)	The shareholder concerned directly or indirectly illegally uses the Company’s
      assets with the result that the Company’s assets become insufficient to pay off the
      Company’s debts.

3.	 Other Obligations
Other responsibilities may exist. Shareholders are responsible to comply with the AOA
and the other prevailing laws and regulations, to observe resolutions of the GMS and
the Board of Director, to provide the correct address when he/she registers subscription
for shares and to perform other obligations in accordance with current law.
Other obligations may include disclosure obligations when certain thresholds of
ownership are passed, or disclosure of the intent to acquire further shares or gain
control of a company. These additional responsibilities generally apply to larger
shareholders and are described throughout the Manual.

          For a discussion on the disclosure of beneficial ownership, see Chapter 13, Section B.3.
Under certain conditions, shareholders may be held liable despite their limited liability.
In particular, this refers to controlling shareholders who have the opportunity to
determine the actions of or give mandatory instructions to the company.
Finally, in some countries, shareholders (especially institutional investors) may be
required to vote their shares. In other countries, there is no legal requirement but it may
be considered a moral imperative. Good corporate governance depends heavily on the
active participation of shareholders in the governance of the company.




                                                                              Best Practices

       Institutional investors acting in a fiduciary capacity should disclose their
       overall corporate governance and voting policies with respect to their
       investments, including the procedures that they have in place for deciding
       on the use of their voting rights. They should also disclose how they manage
       material conflicts of interest that may affect the exercise of key ownership
       rights regarding their investments (see OECD Principles of Corporate
       Governance, page 19).

The General Meeting of Shareholders      283                      The Chairman’s Checklist
Shareholders are the main contributors of equity capital. However, shareholders
do not always wish to participate in the day-to-day management of the company’s
affairs. Most shareholders lack the necessary time or skills to run a company. Thus,
shareholders entrust professional individuals in the Board of Directors to run the
company’s day-to-day operations, and elect Board of Commissioners to supervise
and guide the work of the Board of Directors. However, this does not mean
that shareholders completely give up their governance rights. Shareholders most
commonly exercise their governance rights through the GMS.
GMS and other company organs are aligned in the same level with the separation
of power to differentiate them. GMS are given the authorities which are not
given to the Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners. However, GMS
authorities’ are limited by the provisions in the ICL and/or stipulated in the
company’s AoA. It is through the GMS that shareholders express their will with
respect to such important company matters as the amendment of company’s AoA,
approval of annual reports and financial statements, the election and dismissal of
Board of Directors and the Board of Commissioners, the payment of dividends
and distribution of company profits, reorganization, major corporate transactions
and more as stipulated in the ICL and company’s AoA. The GMS also provides
shareholders with the opportunity to, at least once a year, discuss these and other
important matters, meet in person with their directors and commissioners, ask
questions and determine the future of the company. Hence, shareholders exercise
their rights to participate in the decision-making of the company through the GMS.
Preparing for and conducting the GMS is subject to detailed procedural
requirements as determined by law, corporate policies and procedures. This chapter
describes the authorities of the GMS, its organization and legal requirements for
adopting valid decisions.




The General Meeting of Shareholders        284                           The Chairman’s Checklist
A.	           General Provisions

1.	 Types of General Meetings of Shareholders
There are two types of GMS, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (“AGMS”)
and the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (“EGMS”).

a.	 The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders
       ICL requires companies to hold a GMS at least once a year where the Board of
       Directors present all documents of the company annual report stated in Article
       66 paragraph (2) of the ICL. The AGMS must be held within six months as of
       the end of the fiscal year. The Board of Directors shall convene the AGMS in
       the company’s domicile or in the place where the Company conducted its main
       business activity.
       For public companies, the AGMS shall be held in the domicile of the stock
       exchange where the company’s shares are listed. However, if all the shareholders
       are present and/or represented in the AGMS and all the shareholders agree to
       the holding of an AGMS with a particular agenda, the AGMS may be held at
       any place located in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. In this case, the
       AGMS may adopt resolutions if the resolutions are unanimously agreed.1

b.	 The Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders
       Besides the AGMS, the company can hold more meetings of this corporate body.
       All GMS other than the AGMS are called the EGMS. They are convened in
       response to specific needs and interests of the company, such as giving approval
       for consolidation, merger, acquisition, or spinoff, to elect and dismiss the Board
       of Directors and the Board of Commissioners, or to approve the capital increase
       or reduction.
       There are no limitations on the number of EGMS that a company can conduct
       during the year.

The authorities of the GMS are set forth in Chapter VI of the ICL. The AoA may,
however, provide additional authorities to the GMS, unless otherwise determined by
the law.

       number and compositions of the Board of Commissioners and the Board of
       Directors, as well as their salary and remuneration package. It is also stated in
       ICL Article 96 that a GMS may set the salary and remuneration of the Board of
       Directors and the Board of Commissioners.

1.	 Drafting the Agenda
The first step in preparing for an GMS is to draft the agenda. The agenda structures
the GMS, and lists issues that must be addressed. Only the items properly included in
the agenda in conformity with the ICL may be decided on at general meetings. Other
issues, not included in the agenda may only be discussed. However, in the case where
all shareholders representing 100% of the voting shares attend the GMS directly or via
an authorized representative, the resolutions which are unanimously approved by the
GMS shall be deemed to be effective even if the items voted on were not included on
the agenda.5
For a public or non-public company, the GMS shall have the right to alter the meeting
agenda being enclosed with the invitations sent to all shareholders. Subsequently, for
these public and non-public company, it is stipulated that all resolutions and issues
included in the agenda must be discussed and voted at the GMS.

       In the period preceding the decision to conduct the AGMS, the Board of
       Commissioners should review all the proposals, formal and informal, made by
       shareholders to include specific items on the agenda. Mutual understanding
       and cooperation between the Board of Commissioners and shareholders is
       very important in the corporate governance framework. In that respect, good
       practice would be to notify shareholders about rejected agenda items. This
       by no means precludes the shareholders’ legal right to include items on the
       agenda after the decision to conduct the GMS.

a)	 The Decision to Conduct the GMS
       The Board of Directors must decide to conduct the GMS before its preparation
       may start. As part of this decision, the Board of Directors decides the final agenda,
       date, place and time, notification procedures, list of materials, sample of power of
       attorney (if represented by proxy) and record date.

b)	 The Date of the GMS
       A distinction has to be made between the AGMS and the EGMS. ICL regulates
       that the AGMS shall be conducted within not more than six months from the end
       of the financial year The Board of Directors then determines the exact date for
       each AGMS, within the period stipulated by the AoA.
       On the other hand, the date of the EGMS may be decided at anytime deemed as
       required for the Companies’ interest.6

c)	     The Place of the GMS
        According to ICL Article 76, GMS shall be held in the Company’s domicile or in
        the place where the Company does its main business as specified in the AoA. While
        the GMS of Public Companies shall be held in the domicile of the stock exchange
        where the Company’s shares are listed. The location of the GMS as contemplated
        above must be located in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. However,
        if all the shareholders are present and/or represented in the GMS and all the
        shareholders agree to the holding of a GMS with a particular agenda, the GMS
        may be held at any place with due attention to the condition contemplated above.




                                                         Comparative Practices

        Comparative corporate governance practices recommend that:
          •	 The GMS should be held at a location and time that allows shareholders
             to participate and does not impose undue expenses upon them
          •	 The GMS should be held where the company is located or at a location
             defined by the AoA
          •	 Companies that are located where access is difficult should choose
             a venue that is easy to access, for example by public transport. This
             location should be specified in the AoA
          •	 The premises should be able to accommodate all shareholders who
             want to participate
          •	 Companies should estimate how many participants are likely to attend
             the GMS and plan accordingly.




3.	 Preparing the Shareholder List
Shares bestow on their owners the right to attend and cast votes in GMS.7 However,
these rights will apply after the shares are recorded in the register of shareholders under
the name of the shareholder.8

8	    ICL, Article 52 paragraph (2)




The General Meeting of Shareholders         293    Preparing for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders
The next step in preparing for the GMS is to compile the list of shareholders who are
entitled to participate in the GMS. Pursuant to Article 50 paragraph (1) of ICL, the
Board of Directors shall keep and maintain the list of shareholders of the Company.9
For listed companies, administration on the shareholders is conducted by Securities
Administration Agency.
a)	 Who Should be Included on the Shareholder List
       Only persons included on the shareholder list are entitled to participate in the
       GMS. The distinction has to be made between right to participate in the meeting
       and the right to vote. Although shares bestow on their owners the right to attend
       and cast votes in GMS, this right do not apply to certain classification of shares as
       determined under the ICL.10




                                                                            Best Practices

       The right to participate in the GMS is a fundamental shareholder right.
       Processes and procedures for GMSs should allow for equitable treatment
       of all shareholders. (See OECD Principles, page 44). This is in accordance
       with the OECD principles II C, which stated that shareholders should have
       the opportunity to participate effectively and vote at the GMA and to be given
       information about the rules, including voting procedures that govern the
       delivery of the GMA . Therefore, the shareholder list should encompass all
       registered shareholders on the record date.




b)	 Nominal Shareholders and the Shareholder List
       The regulatory framework in Indonesia prohibits the practice of nominee
       shareholder for company.

       To ensure that all shareholders are included in the shareholder list, nominal
       shareholders are required to provide the company with information on the
       ultimate or beneficial owners they represent.




                 See Chapter 13, Section B.3 for more information on the disclosure of beneficial
                 ownership.


c)	    Information in the Shareholder List
       Article 50 paragraph (1) of the ICL, the company’s Board of Director shall make
       and keep a register of shareholders, containing at least:
       a.	name and address of the shareholders;
       b.	amount, number, date of shares acquisition held by the shareholders; and the
          classification in the event that more than one classification of shares has been
          issued;
       c.	 amount paid-up for each share;
       d.	name and address of individual or legal entity having a pledge over the shares or
          as the fiduciary guarantee of the fiduciary over shares, and the acquisition date
          of pledge on share or registration date of the fiduciary security;
       e.	 description on the payment of shares in other form.




                                                                                   Best Practices

       It would be considered a good corporate practice to include the email
       addresses of each shareholder in the shareholder list.




The General Meeting of Shareholders                295     Preparing for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders
d)	 Disclosure of Information in the Shareholder List
       The register of shareholders and special register must be made available in the
       company’s domicile so that they can be seen by the shareholders.11 In some
       countries, information regarding physical persons, including their mailing address,
       may only be disclosed with their permission.
       Shareholders are entitled to verify the accuracy of the information in the register
       about themselves and their holdings. They are entitled to make objections to any
       irregularity on the list and request the amendment of incorrect information or
       addition of necessary information. It would be a good corporate practice for a
       company to issue a statement within a couple of days highlighting any objection.

e)	    Shareholder Obligations when Selling Shares after the Record Date
       but Prior to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders
       Shareholders lose voting rights when they sell their shares, as voting rights are
       transferred automatically to the new owner. Article 55 of ICL stipulates the
       transfer of rights upon shares in such way regulated in the AoA and is not
       against the applicable laws and regulations. The transfer of rights of shares may
       be excercised through deed of rights transfer and then the copy of the deed is
       submitted in writing to the company. After the copy of the deed of transfer of
       shares is received, the Board of Directors must update the Shareholders List.
       In practice, if the shareholder list is not updated after the record date, the selling
       shareholder still has the right to attend the meeting and vote. This shareholder
       must ensure that the new shareholder may vote at the GMS. There are two ways
       for the selling shareholder to fulfil this obligation:
       •	 Grant a power of attorney to the new owner; or
       •	 Participate in the GMS and vote in accordance with the instructions of the
          new owner.




11	 ICL, Article 50 paragraph (4)




The General Meeting of Shareholders           296    Preparing for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders
       In practice, these two options only work when the shareholder knows:
       •	 The identity of the buyer: for public companies, shares are generally sold
          anonymously through intermediaries, thus making it impossible for the seller to
          identify and contact the buyer. It gets more complicated when shares are sold to
          multiple shareholders or during multiple and sequential transactions.
       •	 The record date: In practice, shareholders are not notified about the record
          date before they are notified of the GMS. This makes it difficult for the seller
          to know if he/she is obliged to act in order to allow the new shareholder to
          participate in the GMS.




                                                                                   Best Practices

       There are some ways to ensure the rights of the new shareholders as follows:
         •	 If the instructions of the new owners coincide, their votes must be
            combined
         •	 If the instructions of new owners do not coincide, the seller must vote in
            accordance with the instructions of new owners
         •	 If the new owners receive power of attorney from the predecessor
            shareholder, the new shareholders must be registered in order to
            participate in the GMS and they must be given new voting ballots
         •	 If voting shares are being circulated in foreign markets in the form of
            depositary receipts, voting must be based on the instructions of the
            depositary receipt holders.




                 For more information on depositary receipts, see Chapter 11, Section G.

4.	 Providing Proper Notice
Once the procedures set out in Section B.3 are completed, all shareholders eligible
for participation in the GMS must be notified of the GMS no later than fourteen
working days prior to the opening date of the GMS,12 without calculating the date
of announcement and the date of GMS, For public companies, the announcement,
invitation and time arrangement of the GMS is regulated under Bapepam LK
Regulation No. IX.J.1 concerning the Main Substances of Articles of Association of
Company Performing A Public Offering Having Equity Nature and Public Company.13




                                                                                    Best Practices

       It is good practice that notification of the GMS:
           •	 Allows sufficient time for all shareholders to prepare for the GMS
           •	 Is given to all shareholders
           •	 Allows sufficient time for shareholders to contact other shareholders
           •	 Occurs at least 30 days in advance.




a)	 How to Notify
       Article 82 of ICL regulates that invitation to the GMS may be issued by Registered
       Letter and/or by an advertisement in Newspapers.
       If the company has a website, the company shall publish the notice of the general
       meeting on the company website together with the dispatch of the notice to
       shareholders.
       For public companies, invitations to a GMS must be preceded by an
       announcement that invitations to a GMS will be issued.14 Further, under Bapepam
       LK Regulation No. IX.J.1 concerning the Main Substances of Articles of

       1)	The announcement of the GMS shall be made at least 14 (fourteen) days before
          the invitation, excluding the announcement and the invitation date.
       2)	The invitation to the GMS shall be made at least 14 (fourteen) days before the
          GMS, excluding the invitation and the GMS date.
       3)	The invitation to the second GMS shall be made at least 7 (seven) days before
          the second GMS, excluding the invitation and the GMS date, with a notification
          that the first GMS has already been held but it did not reach the quorum.
       4)	The invitation to the GMS must include the date, time, location, agenda and
          notification that the materials to be discussed in the GMS are available at
          the Company’s office as specified in ICL except the provisions of legislative
          regulations in the field of capital market stipulate otherwise.
       5)	The second GMS may be held no sooner than 10 (ten) days and no later than
          21 (twenty one) days after the first GMS.
       The company may also notify shareholders of a GMS by television or radio,
       or other methods such as the internet. These other methods may not, however,
       replace those required by ICL and those specified in the AoA.




                                                                            Best Practices

       Every reasonable effort should be made to inform shareholders of an
       upcoming GMS. A broader reach may be achieved by:
         •	 Permitting the use of email and the internet
         •	 Using widely read print media to disseminate notice
         •	 Using no less than two and, ideally, several publications to give notice.

       deadline for making all the materials for the AGMS available to shareholders.
       Thirty days prior to the AGMS could be an appropriate solution. ICL does
       not stipulate that the GMS materials must be delivered together with
       written notice to every shareholder, it is advisable that these materials be
       posted on the internet, preferably on the company’s website as electronic
       dissemination is a simple and cost effective method of allowing broad
       public access. Besides, the GMS materials should also be made available
       at the company’s headquarters during its working hours. Information and
       materials may also be made available at other places, preferably in an area
       where a significant number of shareholders reside, as long as the address is
       specified in the GMS notification.


       Each shareholder of record has the right to receive copies of GMS materials. AoA
       or internal regulations can specify a short period, for example three days after the
       request, when copies must be provided to the shareholder.

e)	    When and How Voting Ballots Circulated to Shareholders
       The regulatory framework in Indonesia does not provide any provision regarding
       this item. However, voting ballots are circulated to the Shareholders and/or its
       proxies when the GMS is conducted.



                                                         Comparative Practices

       Voting ballots must be distributed to all shareholders of record:
         •	 No later than 20 days prior to the AGMS
         •	 By registered mail, if the AoA does not provide otherwise; or
         •	 By hand with a delivery receipt.

       In some countries, for companies with more than certain number of
       shareholders (for example, 500,000) with voting rights, the AoA may allow for
       the publication of voting ballots in the print media.

f)	     When and How to Use an Option of Written Voting
        Although there are no guidelines under current law and regulations, the
        company should allow its shareholders and their proxies to use a written
        voting option. Written voting consists of giving written instructions to a person
        delegated by the company to vote in his/her name in his/her absence. When
        the company allows written voting, shareholders should be notified about the
        possibility of written voting and the identity of a person who is in charge of
        receiving written instructions.



                                                                             Best Practices

        When the company allows written voting, the Voting Committee should
        adopt the written voting manual. This manual should be applicable for every
        shareholders meeting where written voting is allowed. The company should
        publish the manual on its website and make available written copies to
        shareholders without charge.




5.	 Approving the Agenda - Shareholders’ Rights to
    Amend the Agenda
ICL does not stipulate in detail regarding the agenda of the GMS. It only stated that
the convenors of the GMS should issue invitations which include agenda of the GMS.
Resolutions on items added to the agenda must be unanimously approved.
For non-public company, it is stipulated that the GMS shall have the right to alter the
meeting agenda being enclosed with the invitations sent to all shareholders.
The agenda is composed of items that are:
      •	 Included upon the Board of Directors’ initiative
      •	 Proposed by shareholders.

The Board of Directors may include:
      •	 Items in addition to those required by the law or those proposed by shareholders.

In addition to the meeting agenda, a shareholder or a group of shareholders may have
the right to nominate candidates for governing bodies of the company. Figure 4 shows
the items that the AGMS agenda must include.

    Board of Commissioner Report
                                                                       continuity of the company




For public companies, the AGMS shall also discuss and approve the short-term and
long-term developmental plans of the company.
The GMS is bound by the determined agenda, Shareholders have the right to propose
issues to be included in the GMS meeting agenda.

a.	 Who May Submit Agenda Items
       A shareholder (or a group of shareholders) holding at least 10% shares in the
       company and member of the Board of Commissioners. In some cases, this
       provision is also stipulated under the company AoA where it regulates that for
       every submission of any agenda items for GMS, the Board of Directors must
       convene a meeting to discuss and to make the decision to conduct the GMS.

b.	 How and When to Submit Agenda Proposals
       There is no specific regulation on the way of submission or how to determine
       the date of submission. It is good practice that the company AoA stipulates these
       matters in detail.

                                                          Comparative Practices

       Shareholders may submit the proposals of agenda items in writing:
         •	 By regular mail to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Proposals are
            considered submitted as of the postmark date
         •	 By hand to the Chairman of the Board of Directors (or to the Corporate
            Secretary, or any other person entitled to receive mail on behalf of the
            company). The delivery must be verified by dated receipt. The date of
            receipt of such a proposal is deemed to be the date of submission
         •	 By other means, such as email or fax (if allowed by the charter and/
            or internal regulations). In this case, the charter or internal regulations
            determine the date of submission.




                                                                            Best Practices

       Shareholder proposals should be included as separate items on the agenda.
       However, certain agenda items should be grouped together. For example, a
       decision on reorganization through spin-off may only be approved if the GMS
       also approves the following related issues:
          •	 The spin-off procedure
          •	 Terms and conditions of the spin-off
          •	 The establishment of new companies as a result of reorganization
          •	 The procedure to convert the reorganized company’s shares into shares
             of new companies
          •	 The approval of a transfer balance sheet.

c.	    Information to be Included in Candidate Proposals
       Members of Board of Directors shall be appointed by the GMS. Initially,
       members of Board of Directors shall be appointed by the founders in the deed of
       establishment. GMS authority to appoint members of Board of Directors may not
       be delegated to company organs or other parties.16 Based on Article 79 paragraph
       2 (a) and (b), a shareholder (or a group of shareholders) owning at least 10% of
       shares or the Board of Commissioners may request to conduct GMS in order to
       propose candidates for the Board of Directors and the Board of Commissioners.
       The number of candidates that may be proposed is limited to the size of the body
       specified in the Company AoA. In practice, the majority shareholders often control
       the election and removal of board members. The number of candidates that can
       be nominated by majority shareholders to the Board of Directors or the Board
       of Commissioners is not expressly stated in ICL. Companies may determine the
       procedure of proposing candidates and the number of candidates that can be
       nominated in the AoA. The determinant to propose candidates of the Board of
       Directors and the Board of Commissioners usually based on total shares or the
       classification of shares own by the shareholders.




                                                                          Best Practices

       Candidates should be informed of their nomination. In addition, the GMS
       documents should contain an agreement that, if elected, candidates will
       accept the position. In the absence of such an agreement, it is recommended
       that the candidate physically attend the GMS and verbally confirm his/her
       acceptance if elected, before shareholders vote on his/her candidacy.

d.	 Review of the Board of Directors on the Proposal of GMS by the
    Shareholders
       The Board of Directors must decide whether to accept or reject shareholder
       proposals. It may reject a proposal only when:
       •	 The proposal is incomplete or is in relation to an irrelevant matter
       •	 The items proposed do not fall within the authority of the GMS for discussion
          and approval.

       It is a good practice that the Board of Directors is entitled to refuse if the proposal
       does not otherwise comply with legislation, such as if the shareholder proposes to
       declare dividends when this recommendation may only be made by the Board of
       Directors. The regulatory framework in Indonesia does not provide any provision
       regarding this item.
       The convenors of the GMS shall put all shareholder proposals that were not
       rejected in the proposed meeting agenda and contents. The proposed items will
       be officially added to the agenda upon the approval of the GMS. For public
       companies, any decision of the GMS Chairman on the order and procedures or on
       events arising outside the agenda of the GMS shall be final.

e.	    The Notification of Shareholders of Rejected Proposals
       The Board of Directors should notify shareholders if their proposals are rejected
       or accepted. The ICL does not specify when this decision has to be made and how
       shareholders should be notified. However, the regulatory framework in Indonesia
       does not provide any provision regarding this item.




                                                                             Best Practices

       The Board of Directors should notify shareholders within three days of making
       the decision if their proposals are rejected. It must provide them with the text
       of its decision stating the reasons for the rejection. Shareholders should be
       notified by registered mail.

       The rejection of or failure to make a decision on shareholder proposals may
       be appealed to a court. The court is authorized to issue an order, at request of
       such shareholders, and render a decision to that effect within 48 hours from
       receipt of the request.




6.	 Preparing Draft Resolutions on Each of the Items
    on the Agenda
The Board of Directors must prepare draft resolutions on each of the items on the
agenda and make GMS minutes.17
Approving the annual report and financial statements are some of the most important
decisions made by the AGMS. Therefore, it is a good practice that the Board of
Commissioners preliminarily approves the annual report and financial statements.
Before it does so, the company’s Board of Directors should verify the annual report and
financial statements.

C.	           Conducting the General Meeting of
              Shareholders
The company may conduct the GMS once all the preparatory steps have
been completed. The GMS is a key corporate governance event and its proper
implementation thus takes on added importance.




                                                                     Best Practices

       The GMS should be used to inform shareholders about company activities,
       achievements, plans and to involve shareholders in important decisions.
       For a minority shareholder, the GMS is often the only chance to obtain
       detailed information about the company’s operations, and to meet
       management and directors.




Convening and conducting the GMS is a complex task and a number of steps must
be followed to ensure that the GMS meets legal requirements and good corporate
governance recommendations.
Clearly, one should steer away from a marathon GMS in order to avoid exhausting
participants. This may pose considerable organizational challenges when the issues to be
decided are either complex, contentious and/or numerous. The overriding principle for
organizing the GMS is that it should be conducted in such a manner so as to facilitate
effective shareholder participation and decision-making.




The General Meeting of Shareholders       310          Conducting the General Meeting of Shareholders
An overview of the steps necessary to organize the GMS is provided in Figure 5.

                                                     Step 3.
           The President Director (for public companies, a GMS is chaired by a commissioner which
           is appointed by the Board of Commissioners) or the convenor of the GMS opens the GMS,
                                          except in special cases. C.4

                                               Step 4.
           The GMS Chairman may appoints the GMS secretary (can also be a notary), who will take
                                       minutes of the GMS. C.4

                                                     Step 5.
                        The GMS Chairman presents the agenda and the rules of order. C.7

                                                     Step 6.
                          The GMS Chairman opens the discussion on agenda items. C.6

                                                     Step 7.
                                      Shareholders vote on agenda items. C.7

                                                     Step 8.
                          The GMS Chairman announces voting results and decisions. C.8

                                                     Step 9.
                                      The GMS Chairman closes the GMS. C.9

                                                     Step 10.
                     The GMS Secretary archives voting ballots and voting instructions. C.10

                                                     Step 11.
                      The company secretary prepares and archives the GMS minutes. C.11




ICL, CG Code and the AoA of the company do not provide provisions regarding detail
steps for conducting the GMS. The common practice is that the company stipulate it in
internal company regulations using best practices as its reference.




The General Meeting of Shareholders                   311             Conducting the General Meeting of Shareholders
1.	 Shareholder Participation Options
Shareholders may attend the GMS in person or grant a power of attorney to a
representative (proxy) who attends the GMS on the shareholder’s behalf.
If participation is by proxy, letters of proxy shall be in writing in the form as prescribed
by the company with adequate signatures and need not be notarized. Any person
authorized to attend a GMS must submit his/her written authorization prior to entering
the meeting room.
The current law and other related regulations are silent on the case where an individual
shareholder dies or a legal entity shareholder reorganizes after the record date.
Comparative practice suggests that in this case the legal heir or the new shareholder
should be entitled to attend the GMS.


2.	 Shareholder Registration
The company registers shareholders and shareholder representatives before the GMS
may begin. Participants must be registered to verify the quorum.




                                                                        Best Practices

       To avoid company officials preventing shareholders from participating in
       the GMS, e.g. by blocking registration, the registration procedure should
       be described in detail in the internal regulations of the company and in the
       GMS notification.




a)	 Who Registers Shareholders
       Under the ICL, there is no guideline on how the registration will be conducted and
       who is responsible for these actions.




The General Meeting of Shareholders          312          Conducting the General Meeting of Shareholders
                                                                           Best Practices

       The AoA, the internal regulations or other internal corporate documents
       should specify the body or the person who is responsible to conduct the
       registration of participants of GMS. Registering shareholders can be seen as
       a Corporate Secretary authority, because this corporate body is responsible
       for GMS preparations.




b)	 What Documents Must Be Verified for the Registration
       The Board of Directors or those who convene the GMS may require shareholders
       or authorized representatives entitled to attend the GMS to be checked or subject
       to other security measures which it considers appropriate. They may also ask
       competent agencies to maintain the order of the meeting, expel those who do
       not comply with the Chairman’s instructions or intentionally cause disorder and
       hinder the smooth progress of the GMS or refuse to comply with the security
       checking requirement. However, no specific regulations on how to check and what
       documents must be verified are given.
       It is a normal practice that in the notification of the GMS, a company usually
       states the documents that a shareholders or authorized person need to bring to
       and present for the registration at the GMS, including ID card, passport or copy
       of business registration certificate, invitation letter and letter of proxy (in case of
       being authorized).

c)	    Registration of Participants and Voting Ballots
       Where a shareholder is registered, the company shall grant such shareholder or
       his/her authorized representative with voting rights.

d)	 The Time for the Registration of Participants
       The registration of participants of the GMS officially starts at the time stated in
       the notice of the GMS and ends after the discussion of the last agenda item. Any
       shareholder ors authorized representative who comes after the opening of the
       GMS shall be entitled to register and shall have the right to vote after registration.
       The effectiveness of votes that have already been made shall not be affected.

       The registration of participants should be carried out on the same day
       just prior to conducting the GMS. Poorly organized registration may result
       in shareholders having to wait in line while the GMS starts. Accordingly,
       companies should make every effort to ensure that the registration process is
       quick and efficient, and that participants are not prevented from participating
       in the GMS due to administrative delays. This means that the registration desk
       needs to be adequately staffed and open well in advance of the GMS.




e)	    Where Participants Must Be Registered
       Registration must take place where the GMS is held.



3.	 Verifying and Announcing the Quorum
There is no regulation or guideline under ICL or AoA for these activities. It is best
practice that the AoA, the internal regulations or other internal corporate documents
should specify the body or the person who is responsible to verify and announce the
quorum. The quorum should be announced after the registration completed and before
shareholders may vote.
ICL provides the following minimum quorum and voting thresholds (applicable at the

      which represents 50% or more of the Company’s net assets.

The shareholders participating in the GMS are those who are registered (in person or
by proxy).
When the number of attendees required is insufficient, the meeting shall be
reconvened within a period between 10 (ten) days after the first GMS to 21 (twenty
one) days at the latest, as of the first GMS is held. The second GMS invitation must
be sent off to the shareholders at the latest 7 (seven) days before the GMS is held. The
second called GMS shall be conducted when the number of attending shareholders
and authorized representatives represent at least 1/3 of the voting shares. In the event
that the second GMS cannot be convened, the invitation for the third GMS must
explain that the second GMS has been convened but the quorum is not sufficient to
proceed the second GMS and also inform that the third GMS will be conducted with
quorum stipulated by the head of the relevant district court.
For the third GMS, the company may propose to the head of district court of its
domicile to determine the quorum. The same period of time is applied for the third
GMS in case the second GMS cannot be convened.


4.	 Opening the General Meeting of Shareholders
A GMS session shall be deemed valid where it is attended by a number of shareholders
that own at least 1/2 of the voting shares.
For a GMS convened by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of
Directors shall chair the meeting. When the Chairman is absent or temporarily lost
the ability to work, the remaining members shall select one of them to be the GMS
Chairman of the meeting. In case none of the Board of Directors members can be the
GMS Chairman, the highest ranking member of the Board shall guide the GMS to vote
for a GMS Chairman. In other cases, the person who signs the decision to convene the
meeting shall guide the GMS to vote for a GMS Chairman.
For listed companies, in every case, a commissioner whichs is appointed by the Board
of Commissioners shall preside over the GMS. In a case where the no commissioners
is available, the director which is appointed by the Board of Directors or shall preside
over the GMS. Where none of such persons is able to preside over the GMS, then




The General Meeting of Shareholders         315           Conducting the General Meeting of Shareholders
a shareholder who attend the GMS and which is appointed by other attending
shareholders shall preside the GMS.18


5.	 Electing the Voting Committee
The Chairman of the GMS must request the GMS elect Voting Committee members
at each GMS. It is recommended that the company establish a Voting Committee,
conditions and method for the election of its members and to determine its authority
and procedures in the charter, the internal regulations or some other general internal
documents of the company. The Voting Committee must have at least three members
and it is advisable that one of them is a graduated lawyer. The voting committee
provision is not regulated in the regulatory framework in Indonesia. However, voting
committee may be regulated in the GMS order stipulates by the company.




                                                                      Best Practices

       It is recommended that at least one member of the Voting Committee is the
       representative of the minority shareholders.




6.	 Inviting Outside Guests as Observers
As a practical matter, the company may invite a notary and/or a legal consultant to
the GMS. The role of the notary is to take minutes of the GMS and assisting the
management to conduct the GMS. The AoA and internal regulations may specify
procedures on inviting the notary and/or legal consultant to the GMS.

The General Meeting of Shareholders            316      Conducting the General Meeting of Shareholders
7.	 Presenting the Agenda and the Rules of Order
The meeting agenda must define details and timing for each of the issues to be
discussed. The agenda which has been sent to shareholders together with the
GMS invitation may be amended once the GMS is held in the case where all the
shareholders approve such amendment.
For public companies, any decisions by the GMS Chairman on the order and
procedures or on events arising outside the agenda of the GMS shall be final.



8.	 Discussing Agenda Items
Although there is no regulation under current law, beside shareholders, the Chairman of
the Board of Directors should invite Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners
members to the GMS. Good corporate governance suggests that auditors or
representatives of audit companies be invited to attend and express their opinions on
audit issues at GMS meetings.




                                                                      Best Practices

       It is good practice that:
           •	 Shareholders have the opportunity to question members of the Board of
              Commissioners, the Board of Directors and the External Auditor.
           •	 Shareholders receive clear answers to questions.
           •	 Questions from shareholders are answered immediately. If a question
              cannot be answered immediately, a written response should be given as
              soon as possible after the GMS.
           •	 The GMS be conducted so that all shareholders have an opportunity to
              make balanced and informed decisions on all agenda items.
           •	 The External Auditor, the President Director, and members of the Board
              of Commissioners, the Board of Directors, other subcommittees of the
              Board of Directors (if any) and members of the Management Board are
              present at the GMS. If they are not, the GMS Chairman should explain
              their absence.




The General Meeting of Shareholders        317          Conducting the General Meeting of Shareholders
           •	 Key officers of the company, including the Chairmen of Board of
              Directors committees, speak at the GMS.
           •	 To set aside some time for presentations by shareholders.
           •	 The Chairman of the GMS interrupts speakers only to maintain order or
              comply with procedural requirements.




9.	Voting
After one or several agenda items have been thoroughly discussed, the Chairman
of the GMS invites shareholders to vote. Voting is based upon the principle of “one
voting share—one vote,” except for voting preferred shares and cumulative voting.
Any shareholder who comes late shall be registered and shall have the right to
immediately participate in voting at the GMS. There is no regulatory framework on
this matter. However, this matter may be regulated in the GMS order stipulates by
the company.
Each shareholder with voting rights or his/her authorized representative may vote
corresponding with the number of issues to be voted in the meeting. Under the ICL,
there is no regulation on whether the vote shall be public or secret and no regulation
on the specific format and details to be included in the voting ballots. However, the
voting ballot mechanism may be determined pursuant to the GMS order.
Information recommended to be included in the voting ballots is summarized in
Table 5.




The General Meeting of Shareholders         318          Conducting the General Meeting of Shareholders
            Table 3. Information That Must or Should Be Included on the Voting Ballot


   1.	 The full name and location of the company
   2.	 The form of the GMS
   3.	 The date, place and time of the GMS
   4.	 Issues to be voted on in the order given in the agenda
   5.	 Voting options “for”, “against” or “abstained” on each issue
   6.	 In the case of the appointment of Board of Directors or Board of Commissioners
       members, the name of each candidate
   7.	 Deadline prior to which completed ballots must be sent to the company (if they have to
       be sent to the company)
   8.	 The mailing address to which completed ballots must be sent (if they have to be sent to
       the company)
   9.	 The instruction that the ballot must be signed by the shareholder, unless the voting
       ballots are used as a method of secret voting
   10.	 An explanation of cumulative voting with the following text: “When Board of Directors
        members are elected with cumulative voting, the shareholder may cast all his/her votes
        for one candidate or for several candidates”
   11.	 The ballot must have a designated area where shareholders must insert the number of
        votes they cast for each candidate
   12.	 The ballot must show the number of votes each shareholder may cast to decide on each
        decision based on information from the shareholder list
   13.	 Instructions on how to complete the ballot
   14.	 The instruction that an individual who completes the ballot on behalf of a shareholder
        that is a legal entity must indicate his/her name and position and the full name of the
        legal entity which he/she represents
   15.	 The instruction that a copy of the power of attorney must be attached to the ballot, and
        that the representative of the shareholder must sign the voting ballot (if the voting is by
        proxy).



A ballot is valid if a shareholder marks only one of the possible options for a particular
item. A failure to do so invalidates the ballot with regard to that item. Improperly
completed voting ballots with respect to one or more items do not cause the voting ballot
to be invalid for other agenda items. Again, this provision may be applied in the GMS
pursuant to the GMS order.

       The procedure for counting votes should be transparent. To avoid any
       perception that the voting results have been manipulated, the Voting
       Committee should be independently monitored when counting votes. The
       charter and other internal regulations should provide for such monitoring and,
       additionally, define the authority of those persons appointed to monitor the
       counting process.




10.	Counting and Documenting Votes
The votes which agree with the resolution shall be collected first, thereafter the votes
which do not agree with the resolution shall be collected, and finally the overall
number of votes which agree and do not agree with the resolution shall be counted for
a final decision.




                                                                       Best Practices

       The Voting Committee must summarize voting results in its minutes. The
       Voting Committee minutes should contain specific information. All Voting
       Committee members must sign the minutes of the voting results.




         See Section C.15 of this Chapter.




The General Meeting of Shareholders          320         Conducting the General Meeting of Shareholders
11.	Announcing the Voting Results and Decisions
Although the ICL is silent on this matter, it is recommended that for public, non-public
companies, the voting results shall be announced by the GMS Chairman before the
meeting is closed. For a public company, the overall numbers of votes which agree, do
not agree and abstentions shall be announced immediately after an issue is voted on.


12.	Closing the General Meeting of Shareholders
The GMS Chairman closes the GMS when:
   •	 All agenda items have been discussed and voted upon
   •	 The voting results have been announced.


13.	Archiving Voting Ballots
Basically, there are no obligations to maintain archiving of the voting ballots after the
GMS is held. However, it is most likely that the secretary of the GMS will keep the
voting ballots and then documented them in the companies’ document control along
with other GMS documents.


14.	Preparing the General Meeting of Shareholders
    Minutes
In each GMS convened, GMS minute must be made and signed by the chair of the
meeting and at least 1 (one) shareholder appointed by and from the participants in
the GMS. However, signature shall not be required if the GMS minutes are made
by notary deed.19 The signature by the chair of the meeting and at least 1 (one)
shareholder appointed by and from the participants in the GMS is intended to ensure
the certainty and accuracy of the contents of the GMS minutes.20

       The GMS should appoint two shareholders to verify the minutes. These two
       shareholders should also sign the minutes.




         For more information on the information that must be contained in the GMS minutes, see
         Section C.15 of this Chapter.
The GMS minutes are inserted in the minute book. The company must provide a
copy of the GMS minutes to shareholders upon request. Shareholders may be asked to
reimburse the company for reasonable copying costs.
The GMS minutes can be in Indonesian or a foreign language with equal value and
must include specific information.
The following documents should be attached to the GMS minutes:
   •	 list of shareholders registration
   •	 documents approved and decisions adopted by the GMS
   •	 all materials attached with the meeting invitation.

D.	           An Overview of the Extraordinary
              General Meeting of Shareholders
According to article 78 of the ICL, other GMS may be hold at any time based on need
for the Company’s interests. An EGMS may be convened for the company to make
important decisions between two AGMSs. The organization of an EGMS is mostly the
same as the procedure for preparing and conducting the GMS explained in Parts B and
C. (The particularities in the organization of an EGMS are the focus of this section.)


1.	 When to Conduct an Extraordinary General
    Meeting of Shareholders
The convention of EGMS can be performed upon the request of 1 (one) person
or more shareholders jointly represent 1/10 (one tenth) or more of the total shares
with legal voting right, except the AoA stipulates a less number; or the Board of
Commissioners.21
The power to request an EGMS is an important shareholder right. Though rarely
exercised in practice, it allows the controlling bodies of the company to convene an
EGMS when they deem it necessary and appropriate.



2.	 Preparatory Procedures
Under the ICL and the AoA, there is no difference in preparing and conducting the
EGMS and AGMS except for the timing of the meeting.

a)	 Initiating Preparation
       The Board of Directors initiates preparations if required by the ICL or at its own
       discretion.
       The Board of Directors has the right to reject the request when:
       •	 The request to conduct the EGMS is inconsistent with the requirements of the
          ICL



21	 ICL, Article 79 paragraph (2).




The General Meeting of Shareholders         324                                     Overview
       •	 A shareholder (or a group of shareholders) do not own or do not represent the
          required percentage of votes (at least 10% of shares giving them the right to
          vote on the issue put before the EGMS)
       •	 The proposed agenda items do not fall within the authority of the EGMS.



                                                        Comparative Practices

       Rejection may be appealed to the courts. The court should be obliged to
       render a decision, in extra-judiciary proceedings within a regulated period of
       time from receipt of the request.




       All expenses arising from the convocation and process of the GMS as
       mentioned above shall be reimbursed by the company. This provision is not
       stipulated in Indonesia regulatory framework.

b)	 Drafting the Agenda
       The convention of GMS can be performed upon the request of 1 (one) person
       or more shareholders jointly represent 1/10 (one tenth) or more of the total
       shares with legal voting right, except the AoA stipulates a less number; or the
       Board of Commissioners.
       It is recommended that the proposal has to be made in writing and forwarded
       to the company no later than three working days prior to the opening date of
       such meeting.




                                                                     Best Practices

       The agenda may contain different items, including the election of directors.
       However, in the event that the number of directors becomes less than the
       quorum as specified by the charter, the EGMS agenda may only include a
       single item, that is to elect the new Board of Directors. For another mandatory
       EGMS, the agenda may include additional items.




The General Meeting of Shareholders         325                                         Overview
c)	    Specific Requirements Depending on the Agenda Item
       In Indonesia, all time periods for procedural steps in connection with the EGMS
       convocation are equal. The specific agenda issue does not change this rule.




                                                       Comparative Practices

       Different time periods can exist for different procedural steps, depending
       on whether the election of Board of Directors members, which must be
       conducted by cumulative voting, is on the agenda. Time periods are longer
       in case of cumulative voting. These differences are connected with the
       following procedural steps:
          •	 Maximum period between the decision to conduct a mandatory GMS
             and the meeting
          •	 Maximum period between the request to conduct a voluntary GMS and
             the meeting
          •	 The record date
          •	 The notification of shareholders.




3.	 Circular Resolution of the Shareholders
Pursuant to Article 91 of ICL, shareholders may take a binding decision outside a GMS
through a resolution. This draft resolution must be circulated to all of the shareholders.
This resolution must be unanimously approved and signed by all of the shareholders in
order to create a valid and binding resolution.
The draft resolution and documents explaining it must be sent by registered mail to the
permanent address of each shareholder.
The draft resolution must contain the following basic particulars:
   •	 Name and head office address
   •	 Purpose of the resolution




The General Meeting of Shareholders        326                                      Overview
   •	 Full name, permanent address, nationality and the numbers of the people’s
      identity cards or passports or other lawful personal identification, number of shares
      of each class and number of votes of the shareholder
   •	 Issue on which it is necessary to obtain approval in order to pass a resolution.

This circular resolution shall have the same validity as a resolution passed by the GMS.




The General Meeting of Shareholders         327                                      Overview
E.	           Decisions of the General Meeting of
              Shareholders
It is important to follow procedures for preparing and conducting the GMS to ensure
the validity and lawfulness of decisions reached by this governing body. However,
resolutions approved during GMS sessions by shareholders and their authorized
representatives representing 100% of the voting shares shall be lawful and take
immediate effect even in the case where the order and procedures of convention, the
meeting agenda and the conducting procedures are not in accordance with regulations.


1.	 Decisions Requiring a Simple Majority Vote
Article 87 of the ICL states that GMS resolutions shall be adopted on the basis
of deliberation to reach a consensus. In the event that resolutions on the basis of
deliberation to reach a consensus cannot be achieved, resolutions shall be lawful if
approved by more than ½ (one half) of the number of votes cast unless Statute and/
or the AoA specify that resolutions shall be lawful if approved by a greater number of
affirmative votes.




                                                      Comparative Practices

       In some countries such as Serbia, most GMS decisions can be approved by a
       simple majority vote of participating shareholders.




2.	 Decisions Requiring a Supermajority Vote
All resolutions of the GMS shall require approval by more than one half of total votes
of participating shareholders, except vital resolutions which require at least 65% and
75% of the total vote. Resolutions of the GMS that require approval of at least 75% of
total votes of participating shareholders include to approve Mergers, Consolidations,
Acquisitions, or Spinoffs, to file applications for the Company to be declared bankrupt



The General Meeting of Shareholders       328          Decisions of the General Meeting of Shareholders
or extensions of its period of incorporation, and the dissolution of the Company.22
Unless otherwise stipulated in the AoA of the Company, the supermajority vote is
applied for the assignment of Company assets and to make security debt over company
assets which constitutes more than 50% of the assets in one or more transaction, or
inter-related transactions.23


3.	 Decisions Requiring a Unanimous Vote
Under the ICL, the decision that requires an unanimous vote is stipulated in Article 91.
Based on the Article 91, the shareholders may have a decision outside RUPS through
circular resolution. In this case, the resolution will be valid and binding if the resolution
is approved unanimously by the shareholder.


4.	 Filing Lawsuit Against GMS Decision
Under certain circumstances, GMS decisions may be filed to (and potentially invalidated
by) the courts. Pursuant to Article 61, every shareholder may file a lawsuit against the
GMS decision to the court. The filing of the GMS decision to the court may occur
in the event where the decision is deemed as unfair and decided without reasonable
considerations which cause losses to the shareholders. The lawsuit may be filed to the
district court in the company domicile.

       Any of the following violations are significant enough to revoke a decision
       taken by the GMS:
          •	 Failure to provide timely notice of the GMS to all shareholders
          •	 Depriving a shareholder the opportunity to familiarize him/herself with
             materials for the GMS
          •	 The GMS lacked a quorum
          •	 The decision has been approved in violation of the GMS’ authority
          •	 The issue in question was not included in the agenda.

Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   333       The Chairman’s Checklist
The ICL and other related regulations attach certain protective functions to charter
capital, protecting shareholders from dilution and providing a minimum guarantee
that obligations toward company creditors will be fulfilled. Although the charter capital
per se cannot fulfil that role, it is still considered one of the elements guaranteeing the
interests of creditors. Regarding shareholders, the charter capital plays an important
role since many shareholder rights are directly linked to the size of their investment in
the charter capital.
Charter capital has a legal, rather than economic meaning. It only exists in accounting
terms, as fixed in the balance sheet. For this reason, its protective function is often
criticized as a formality. Regardless, it is a legal requirement when establishing and
operating a company. Legislation provides for certain rules that govern both increases
and decreases in the charter capital. In addition, there are other procedural guarantees
of shareholder and creditor rights, such as the buyback by the company of its own
shares, the redemption of shares, reciprocal shareholdings and the maintenance of
statutory reserves, all of which are discussed in this chapter.

A.	            General Provisions Related to
               the Charter Capital

The charter capital is an important element of the legal definition of a limited
liability company, which is defined as a commercial entity, whose charter capital is
determined and divided into a specified number of shares, certifying the company
shareholders’ rights in relation to the company. The charter capital has important
legal implications for:
   •	 Determining the minimum amount of a shareholder’s liability
   •	 Determining shareholder rights in relation to their proportionate share in the
      charter capital
   •	 Offering support to protect creditor rights by setting the minimum amount
      of assets a company must have. This is one of the legal instruments upon
      which creditors can rely when seeking to ensure that the company will fulfil its
      contractual obligations.



1.	 The Definition of Charter Capital
The charter capital is defined as the amount of capital that is contributed or
committed within a specific period by all shareholders and is recorded in the
company’s AoA. For a limited liability company, the charter capital is divided into
several equal proportions being called shares. Bonds and other credit instruments are
not part of the charter capital.


2.	 Legal Capital or Minimum Charter Capital
Legal capital means the minimum level of capital as stipulated by law to establish a
company. In Indonesia, the legal capital is regulated in the ICL. Article 32 stipulates
that companies’ charter capital shall be at least Rp. 50.000.000 (fifty million Rupiah).
However, statutes regulating certain business activities may determine a minimum
amount for companies’ charter capital which is greater than the provision for charter
capital contemplated above.
The legal capital requirement is to protect the benefits of consumers and creditors of
companies operating in an industry.


Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   335   General Provisions Related to the Charter Capital
3.	 Charter Capital and Shares Capital
Companies’ charter capital shall consist of the total nominal values of their shares.
However, this provision does not close off the possibility of legislative provisions in the
field of capital markets providing for companies’ capital to consist of share without
nominal values.1
The company is not required to issue all its authorized shares. Generally a much
greater number of shares are authorized than required, to give the company flexibility
to issue more shares as needed. If the company chooses not to issue authorized shares,
these shares are referred to as authorized, but not issued.
Only those shares that are issued and fully paid constitute the charter capital.
The total charter capital that a company sets forth in its AoA is based upon the
amount of money that the company requires at its establishment for further financial
development. In addition, this decision is conditioned by the percentage of dilution its
founders are willing to accept in the future.
During its business operation, the company may decide to issue additional shares
to increase the charter capital. One of the purposes of authorized shares is to avoid
costly and time-consuming GMS organization procedures every time the company
seeks additional capital.




                                                                                 Best Practices

       Good corporate governance practices stipulate that the AoA should
       authorize the Board of Directors to increase the charter capital by issuing
       authorized shares. When doing so, the AoA should include the following
       information:
          •	 Maximum number of authorized shares. In general, the maximum
             amount must not exceed 50% of the charter capital at the moment of
             the authorization for the Board of Directors to issue authorized shares.
          •	 Types and classes of authorized shares
          •	 Form of payment for additionally issued shares.

4.	 Full Payment for Shares
Founding shareholders shall subscribe together and paid up in full at least 25% of the
total common shares issued by the company as stipulated in the Article 33 paragraph (1)
of the ICL. The capital subscribed and paid in full shall be proven by lawful evidence
of deposit.2 “Lawful evidence of deposit” means, amongst others, evidence of deposit
by the shareholders into a bank account under the name of the company, data from
financial reports audited by an accountant, or the company’s balance sheet signed by the
Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners.3 Any further issuance of shares at any
time to increase the subscribed capital must be paid up in full. This means that the ICL
does not provide the possibility to pay up shares by means of installments.4
If any founding shareholder does not pay in full for his/her subscribed shares, the
uncontributed shares shall be resolved by one of the following methods:
     •	 All of the other founding shareholders will buy the unpaid subscribed shares
        corresponding to their share proportion owned in the company
     •	 One or a number of founding shareholders agree to fully contribute the unpaid
        shares
     •	 Call for other persons who are not shareholders to contribute the unpaid shares
        and that person shall become the founding shareholders of the company.

When all subscribed shares of all founding shareholders are not paid in full, all founding
shareholders shall jointly responsible for all the debts and other obligations of the
company to the extent of the value of the unpaid shares.
Although the regulatory framework in Indonesia does not provide any provision
concerning procedure when a shareholder fails to pay in full and on time the committed
amount to purchase shares, the AoA may stipulates that where a shareholder fails to
pay in full and on time the committed amount to purchase shares, GMS shall notify
and have the right to request such shareholder to pay the unpaid amount together with
interest on such sum, plus costs arising from failure to pay in full to the company within
a specified period of time (at least seven days from the date on which the announcement
is sent). If the shareholders still do not pay for the shares purchased within this time
period, the GMS shall have the right to withdraw the relevant number of shares before
all amounts payable including interest and relevant costs are paid for in full. Any
withdrawn shares shall be the assets of the company. GMS may directly sell or authorize

Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   337   General Provisions Related to the Charter Capital
to sell or re-distribute such shares to, or resolve them in favor of, the individuals who
owned such withdrawn shares or to other entities, on conditions and in the manner the
GMS considers appropriate.
Shareholders holding withdrawn shares shall be required to waive their shareholdership
status with respect to such shares, but shall still be required to pay all relevant amounts
plus proportional interest at the rate stipulated at the time of withdrawal, from the
date of withdrawal up to the date of payment, in accordance with a GMS decision.
GMS shall have full power to make a decision on enforcement of payment of amounts
payable as at the time of withdrawal, or may make a decision on remission of part or all
of such amounts.




                                                                 Comparative Practices

       Penalties or obligations in cases of non-payment or failure to pay in full
       should be stipulated in the company’s AoA or shareholder agreement.




5.	 Contributions to the Charter Capital
In general, shares issued during the establishment of the company and in the course
of business can be paid in the form of money and/or in other forms.5 Other forms
contributions are, however, subject to certain rules. Other forms contributions upon
the establishment of the company shall be appraised based on a reasonable value
determined in accordance with market prices or by an expert not affiliated with the
company.6
The assets used for capital contributions during the course of business need to be
evaluated either as agreed upon between the company and the contributors or by a
professional appraiser, in which case, the value of the assets should be accepted by
both the company and the contributors. If the value of assets is appraised higher than

their actual value at the time of capital contribution, the contributors or the appraiser
and the legal representative of the company shall jointly assume their liability with
respect to the company’s debts and other obligations by the difference between the value
determined and the actual value of the assets at the time the valuation is completed.
For listed companies, the payment for shares in the form of other than money, either in
the form of tangible or intangible assets, must fulfill the following requirements:7
     1)	assets used as payment for shares must be published on the invitation date to the
        GSM regarding the payment;

     2)	assets used as payment for shares must be appraised by an appraiser registered with
        the OJK and are not pledged as collateral in any way;

     3)	approved by the GSM attended by quorum as referred to in article 86 paragraph
        (1) and (4) of the ICL;

     4)	if the assets used as payment for shares are in the form of shares of another
        company listed on the stock exchange, the price of the shares is determined based
        on its fair market value;

     5)	if the sources of payment come from the Company’s retained earnings, capital
        paid up in excess of par value, net profit and or other component of the
        Company’s equity capital, then the retained earnings, capital paid up in excess of
        par value, net profit and or other component of the Company’s equity capital must
        have been stated in the latest annual financial reports audited by an Accountant
        registered with the OJK with an unqualified opinion.




                                                                                 Best Practices

       Any individual (or a legal entity) needs a license to be an Independent
       Appraiser. An Independent Appraiser cannot be a founder, an owner,
       shareholder, employee, contractor, or any other person affiliated with the
       company.




7	   OJK Regulation Number IX.J.1




Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   339   General Provisions Related to the Charter Capital
       A company should use a licensed Independent Appraiser to determine the
       market value of property, value debts and assess liabilities. An Independent
       Appraiser can also play an important role in assisting management and
       shareholders during the company reorganization.

       It is a good comparative corporate practice to insure an Independent
       Appraiser against civil liability.

B.	            Increasing the Charter Capital

A number of different factors, such as market conditions, reorganizations, development
programs and growth, may necessitate an increase in charter capital. The charter capital
can be increased from:
     •	 Utilizing external sources, such as when the company attracts financial resources
        from existing shareholders or third parties
     •	 From internal sources when the company uses its own funds to capitalize its
        internal reserves.

As discussed further in this subchapter, the most important questions when considering
increasing the charter capital will be evaluated mostly from the public companies’ point
of view. In that respect, these questions will be observed through relevant legislature that
regulates the organization and operation of companies, as well as the securities market.


1.	 Methods of Increasing the Charter Capital
Companies’ capital may be increased with the consent of the GMS. However, the
GMS may deliver to the Board of Commissioners the authority to consent to the
implementation of the resolution of the GMS for a period of not more than 1 (one) year
and may be withdrawn by the GMS at any time.8
A resolution of the GMS to increase the subscribed and paid up capital within the limits
of the charter capital shall be valid if adopted with a quorum attending of more than
½ (one half) of all the shares with voting rights and votes in favour from more than ½
(one half) of all the votes cast, unless larger numbers are determined in the AoA. The
MOLHR must be informed of increases in capital so that they can be recorded in the
register of companies.9
For listed companies, Increases in charter capital that result in subscribed and paid
up capital becoming less than 25% of the Company’s charter capital shall refer to
Regulation Number IX.J.1 point 7 item b.

Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   341         Increasing the Charter Capital
Regarding the conversion of issued convertible bonds into shares, the increase of charter
capital shall be affected only when the conditions for converting bonds into shares as
prescribed by law and stated in the plan on issuance of convertible bonds are fully met.
In general, the increase in the charter capital can be conducted under three methods as
follows:
   1)	A capital increase against contribution
   2)	A conditional capital increase
   3)	A capital increase out of a capital surplus, retained earnings and other funds
      available from internal sources.

Technically, every method of increasing the charter capital can be done by issuance of
additional shares. In many countries, companies can increase their charter capital by
issuing shares with a higher nominal value.
All methods to increase the charter capital are summarized in Table 1.

2.	 Methods of Placement
There are three methods of placing shares:
  1)	Distribution among existing shareholders
  2)	Conversion of convertible bonds; and
  3)	Subscription by shareholders and third parties.


3.	 Internal Sources for Increasing the Charter Capital
Depending on the method chosen to increase the charter capital, the company can
use the funds of shareholders and/or third parties. It can also choose to capitalize
using its internal resources. The company may use the following internal resources for
capitalization purposes:
   •	   The capital surplus
   •	   Funds for investment and development
   •	   Retained earnings
   •	   Other reserve funds as defined by specialized law and regulation.

All shares issued for an increase in capital must be first offered to each of the
shareholders in proportion to their ownership of shares for the same classification of
shares according to regulation No. IX.D.1 Number 4.10 However, this provision does not
apply to issuance of shares:11
   a)	 directed to the company’s employees;
   b)	directed to holders of bonds or other securities which are convertible into shares
      and which were issued with the consent of the GMS; or
   c)	 made in the context or re-organisation and/or restructuring with the consent of
       the GMS.

Public companies that wish to issue shares for payment of dividends to current
shareholders to increase charter capital must have that issuance adopted by the GMS
and have sufficient sources for issuance from after-tax profits which are reflected on their
latest audited financial statements.

11	 ICL, Article 43 paragraph (3)




Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   344         Increasing the Charter Capital
Public companies that wish to issue bonus shares to current shareholders to increase
charter capital must have that issuance adopted by the GMS and have sufficient sources
for issuance from the internal resources.
Companies are not allowed to use the increased fixed assets value due to self-revaluation
of assets (without the State’s policies) to increase the charter capital.
The issuance of shares for payment of dividends or issuance of bonus shares must be
supported by the GMS decision approving the issuance plan and the latest audited
financial statements or other necessary documents proving lawful capital sources to be
used for issuance of additional shares.


4.	 Ownership Rights Protection When Increasing the
    Charter Capital
The company’s ownership structure will likely change if the charter capital is increased
from external sources. As previously mentioned, issuing additional shares results in the
dilution of the ownership rights of existing shareholders. Therefore, the default rule is
that the existing shareholders have pre-emptive rights to protect them from dilution.12

          For a more detailed discussion on pre-emptive rights, see Chapter 7, Section B.5.
When increasing the charter capital from internal sources, additional shares must be
distributed to all owners of shares of each type and class. In addition, the number of
new shares of each type and class that are distributed to each shareholder must be pro
rated to the number of shares already held by him/her. Market practice is that the
number of additional shares issued will be rounded down to a unit of share. The GMS
shall decide on how to treat the remaining shares due to rounding. Some companies
may transfer the face value of those shares to fund for investment and development;
some may repurchase those shares for treasury shares.

5.	 Procedural Guarantees for Increasing the Charter
    Capital
The ICL and securities legislation provide detailed procedures that public companies
must follow to increase charter capital. These procedures are aimed at guaranteeing that
shareholder rights are protected. OJK, by giving approval and registering share issues,
plays an important role in overseeing the legality of the increase, thus enforcing proper
corporate governance practices in such cases.
At a company level, the GMS plays the leading role in increasing the charter capital,
depending on the method chosen and the authority for decision-making in the
procedure for increasing the charter capital.

a)	 The GMS Makes the Decision to Increase Capital
       As previously mentioned, the ICL stipulates that companies’ capital may be
       increased with the consent of the GMS which consent may be assigned to the
       Board of Commissioners for a period of not more than 1 (one) year and the
       delivery of such authority may be withdrawn by the GMS at any time.13
       However, it is required that the GMS approve the issuance of shares for payment
       of dividends and the issuance of bonus shares. There is no specific regulation on
       the issuance of additional shares for capital increases against contribution.
       For listed companies, the approval of the GMS for the issuance of additional
       shares is needed.

                 For a more detailed discussion of shareholders right to amend the agenda, see Chapter
                 8, Section B.5.

b)	 The Board of Directors’ Involvements in the Decisions to Increase
    Capital
       The regulatory framework in Indonesia does not provide any provision with regard
       to this item as the power to decide private placement of shares rests with the GMS.

       The Board of Directors should conduct a meeting where directors are
       physically present to approve the decision to place shares. The Board of
       Directors may only approve the decision to place shares if the number of
       additional shares of each type and class to be issued does not exceed the
       total number of authorized shares of each type and class as set forth in
       the AoA.




c)	    Information that Must Be Included in the Decision to Place Shares
       The ICL stipulates that the GMS shall decide the time, method and offer prices of
       shares within the shares to be offered. However, there is no requirement on what
       information needs to be included in the decision to place shares.
       The public offering of shares shall need to be registered with the OJK which will
       then grant the company a public offering of shares certificate. For the registration
       of the public offering of shares, the issuing organization must submit the OJK with
       the following documents:14
       •	 A written registration of public offering of shares
       •	 A prospectus
       •	 The issuing organization’s article of association
       •	 The GMS decision adopting the issuance plan and the capital usage plan
          generated from the public offering of shares
       •	 An issuance underwriting commitment (if any).

       Public offering of shares registration dossiers must be accompanied with Boards
       of Directors decisions approving those dossiers. For the public offering of credit
       institution securities those dossiers must be approved in writing by the OJK.

d)	 Issue of Shares for Other Forms Contributions
       Share capital of a limited liability company may be paid up in the form of money
       and/or in other forms. In the event that the share capital is paid up in some other
       form , the valuation of the share capital paid up shall be specified based on a
       reasonable value determined in accordance with market prices or by an expert not
       affiliated with the company. Shares paid up in the form of immoveable property
       must be announced in 1 (one) or more newspapers within a period of 14 (fourteen)
       days after the deed of establishment is signed or after the GMS resolves on such
       paying up of shares.15
       It is good practice that if the decision to place shares allows shareholders to pay for
       additional shares with other securities, or with other assets having monetary value,
       such a decision should include the:
       •	 Detailed description of the other forms contribution
       •	 Person from which they are to be acquired
       •	 Number and nominal value (or accountable par in case of shares without
          nominal value) of shares which are to be acquired by such contribution.

C.	            Protecting the Charter Capital

One of the purposes of the charter capital is to provide a minimum guarantee that
the company will fulfil its obligations toward creditors. However, this function will only
exist in theory if it is not linked to preserving a minimum level of company assets. The
company has to send a notice of the decision to reduce the company’s charter capital
to the authorized business registration body. The company has to commit that it will
make payments to all debts and other obligations after the reduction of the charter
capital. The Board of Directors must inform all creditors of the resolution of the GMS
to reduce the company’s capital by announcing it in 1 (one) or more newspapers within
a period of not more than 7 (seven) days from the date of the GMS resolution.16 Where
the company operates in an industry that requires legal capital, the company can only
register to reduce the charter capital if the registered capital after reduction is not lower
than the applicable legal capital.
There are other actions that may, in one way or another, affect the charter capital and
net assets. Such actions and mechanisms, which protect against the distribution of the
company’s assets to shareholders or other parties to the detriment of creditors, are listed
in Figure 1.

1.	 Overview of Decreasing the Charter Capital
The question of decreasing the charter capital is of great importance because of the
potential for abuse in practice, because it can be used as a tool to create returns for
shareholders without paying dividends. A decrease in the charter capital can favor some
shareholders at the expense of others. It is essential to ensure the equitable treatment
of all shareholders. This holds particularly true if the company has several classes
of shareholders with different rights or holders of other securities. At the same time,
a decrease in the charter capital reduces the level of shareholders’ liability and the
minimum amount of assets intended to serve as a guarantee that the company will fulfil
its obligations toward creditors.
Thus, any decrease in the charter capital can be:
   •	 Real when it involves a share buyback from shareholders; or
   •	 Nominal when the charter capital is decreased by writing off losses, intended
      to reorganize the company’s financial position, or when the charter capital is
      transformed into reserves that can be used for future distribution.

a)	 Methods of Decreasing the Charter Capital
       Resolutions of the GMS concerning reductions in subscribed and paid up capital
       shall be carried out by means of a withdrawal of shares or a reduction in the
       nominal value of shares. The withdrawal of shares may be carried out against
       shares which have been re-purchased by the company or against shares with a
       classification which may be withdrawn. Reductions in the nominal value of shares
       without repayment must be carried out in proportion against all shares of every
       classification of shares.17
       The regulatory framework in Indonesia does not provide details provision on how
       to perform a capital reduction. In practice, the charter capital can be decreased
       using the following methods:
       •	 The company shall purchase and cancel a number of treasury stocks with par
          value equal to the amount of capital planned to be reduced as approved by the
          GMS, or the company cancels the treasury shares which must be cancelled. By
          this mode, companies shall not have to return money to their shareholders.
       •	 Companies shall withdraw and cancel a quantity of shares from shareholders
          with a total par value equal to the amount of capital reduced. By this mode,



17	 ICL, Article 47 paragraph (1), (2) and (3)




Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   350        Protecting the Charter Capital
           the company shall buy back a number of shares from each shareholder in
           accordance with his/her equity proportion in the company. The company shall
           have to pay their shareholders an amount of money equal to the number of
           shares withdrawn times the par value of shares.
       •	 Reducing the nominal value of shares without changing the number of shares.
          By this mode, the company shall withdraw shares from shareholders and issue
          new shares with reduced par value. The company shall have to pay to their
          shareholders an amount of money equal to the number of shares of each
          shareholder times the difference between old and new par values.
       •	 Combination of the above methods based on the actual situation, joint stock
          companies may apply the above-mentioned methods in combination in reducing
          the charter capital.

       For listed companies, in case a shareholder does not pay the full amount of shares
       purchased on time, these shares can be withdrawn under the request of the GMS.
       Any withdrawn shares shall be assets of the company. The GMS may directly sell
       or authorize to sell or re-distribute such shares to, or resolve them in favor of, the
       individuals who owned such withdrawn shares or to other entities, on conditions
       and in the manner the GMS considers appropriate.

b)	 Mandatory and Voluntary Decreases of the Charter Capital
       The regulatory framework in Indonesia does not provide provision regarding this
       matter.

c)	    Procedures for Decreasing the Charter Capital
       The ICL stipulated a general guideline for a limited liability company to follow in
       the case of capital reduction in fourth part article 44 until 47. The principles are
       including:
       1.	Conducted with the approval of the GMS;
       2.	The GMS shall be valid if adopted with due attention to the requirements
          for a quorum and number of votes in favour for amendments to the AoA in
          accordance with the provisions of the ICL and/or the AoA;
       3.	Notify all creditors of the company the resolution of GMS;
       4.	Must obtain the MOLHR approval.

                                                                 Comparative Practices

       The decision to decrease the charter capital must be taken by a simple
       majority vote of shareholders participating in the GMS.

       The Board of Directors can make the following decisions in connection with
       the capital decrease:
          •	 First, the decision to retire treasury shares, unless otherwise provided
             by the authorized or the internal regulations. Therefore, the Board of
             Directors is presumed to decrease the charter capital in the described
             manner.
          •	 Second, the decision to decrease the charter capital using other ways
             (for example, by decreasing the nominal value of issued shares), if the
             authorized or the internal regulations authorize the Board of Directors
             for such a procedure.

       If the GMS is authorized to decide on decreasing the charter capital, that
       is the legal presumption except for retiring treasury shares, the proposal to
       decrease the charter capital can be placed on the GMS agenda either by a
       shareholder proposal or a Board of Directors’ initiative.

       If the proposal to decrease the charter capital is submitted by the Board of
       Directors, a simple majority vote of its members participating in the Board of
       Directors meeting is required, unless the authorized or internal regulations
       require a higher percentage of votes.




                                                                        Best Practices

       The quorum for the GMS meeting proposing or deciding to decrease the
       charter capital should be defined as two-thirds of all directors.




Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   352           Protecting the Charter Capital
d)	 Information Included in the Decision to Decrease the Charter Capital
       Under the ICL and related regulations, there are no specific requirements on the
       information that must be included in the decision to decrease the charter capital.



                                                                 Comparative Practices

       The decision to decrease the charter capital must include information on:
         •	 The amount of decrease
         •	 The purpose of decrease
         •	 The procedure for decreasing the charter capital
         •	 The method of decreasing the charter capital.




e)	    Decreases in the Charter Capital and Creditor Protection
       A decrease in charter capital typically affects creditor rights since it decreases the
       minimum amount of the company’s assets serving as a guarantee that the company
       can meet its obligations toward creditors. The ICL regulates that the Board of
       Directors must inform all creditors of the resolution of the GMS regarding the
       company’s capital by announcing it in 1 (one) or more newspapers within a period
       of not more than 7 (seven) days from the date of the GMS resolution.18



                                                                        Best Practices

       The company should notify creditors of a reduction in the charter capital. The
       announcement duties fall under the authority of the President Director who
       will commonly assign this task to the Corporate Secretary or another person.




18	 ICL, Article 44 paragraph (2)




Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   353           Protecting the Charter Capital
       The ICL provide regulations regarding the creditors protection in the case of
       liquidation or winding up of a company. Within a period of not more than 30
       (thirty) days as from the date the Company is wound up, the liquidator shall
       notify:19
       a.	all creditors of the winding up of the Company by means of an announcement
          of the Company’s winding up in a Newspaper and the State Gazette of the
          Republic of Indonesia; and
       b.	the MOLHR of the winding up of the Company for it to be recorded in the
          register of Companies that the Company is in liquidation.

       The notification of the creditors in the Newspaper and the State Gazette of the
       Republic of Indonesia shall contain:
       a.	the winding up of the Company and its legal basis;
       b.	the liquidator’s name and address;
       c.	 the procedure for the submission of claims; and
       d.	the period for submission of claims.


2.	 Share Buybacks
Under certain circumstances and conditions, companies have the right to repurchase
their own shares. This is called a share buyback. Share buybacks may have a number
of corporate governance implications. First, there may be a financial planning concern,
since cash is used to purchase shares, fewer funds may be available for further business
development. Second, shareholder rights can be abused if the company does not provide
equal opportunities to all shareholders to sell their shares back to the company. In this
respect, the ICL stipulates that each shareholder is entitled to request the company that
the shareholder’s shares be bought at a fair price if the shareholder concerned does not
approve of actions by the Company which harm that shareholder or the Company, in
the form of:20
   a.	amendments of the AoA;
   b.	assignment or securing of assets of the company which have a value of more than
      50% (fifty per cent) of the company’s net assets; or
   c.	 Mergers, Consolidations, Acquisitions, or spin off.

20	 ICL, Article 62 paragraph (1)




Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   354       Protecting the Charter Capital
In the event that the shares requested to be bought exceeds the limit on re-purchase
of shares by the Company, the Company must endeavor that the remaining shares be
bought by a third party.21
Companies may re-purchase issued shares provided that:22
   a)	 the re-purchase of shares does not cause the net assets of the company to become
       less than the subscribed capital plus the mandatory reserves set aside; and
   b)	the total nominal value of all the shares re-purchase by the company and any
      pledge of shares or fiduciary security over shares held by the company itself or by
      some other company whose shares are directly or indirectly owned by the company
      does not exceed 10% (ten percent) of the total amount of capital subscribed in the
      company unless otherwise provided in legislative regulations in the field of capital
      markets.

Third, the company distributes cash directly to selling shareholders and may, therefore,
diminish the company’s ability to service its debts or otherwise meet its obligations to
creditors.
Certain rules specify how to conduct a share buyback and are summarized in Table 2.
They differ depending on whether the buyback is to decrease the charter capital (specific
buyback) or for any other reason (general buyback).


            Table 2. Types of Buyback

   Specific                                                      General

   The decision to decrease charter capital by                   The decision to purchase is carried out by the
   retiring treasury shares is made by the GMS,                  GMS. Under specific legal circumstances this
   unless otherwise provided by the charter or                   decision can be made by the Board of Directors

   Shares must be retired upon the buyback.                      Purchased shares must be re-placed or retired

          For a more detailed discussion on the specific buyback of shares see previous section of this
          chapter.

a)	 Buyback Procedures
       To repurchase its own shares, a company must follow the steps summarized in
       Table 3.


            Table 3. General Buyback Procedure

   Procedural Steps                         Buyback

   Initiation                               All the discretion of the Board of Directors or a shareholder
                                            proposal

   Decision-making                          The Board of Directors shall have the right to decide a buyback of
                                            10% or less of each type of shares offered for every 12 months. In
                                            other cases, buyback of shares shall be decided by the GMS

   Limitations                              A joint stock company is entitled to buy back no more than 30%
                                            of its issued common shares, a portion or all of its sold preferred
                                            shares

   Share Retiring                           Must be retired within a certain period (three years) or re-placed
                                            in case the capital contributed by shareholders is smaller than the
                                            charter capital.


       The company must have a plan on redemption clearly stating the redemption time
       and pricing principles.
       The company must have sufficient capital from the following sources for
       redemption of treasury shares, a capital surplus, retained earnings and other
       sources stipulated by law.

b)	 Information Included in the Buyback Decision
       There is no specific regulation regarding the required information to be included in
       the decision to buy back shares. In practice, the following information that may be
       included in the notice of such decision to be sent to all shareholders are as follows:
       •	 Name and head office’s address of the company
       •	 Total number and type of shares to be repurchased
       •	 Price of such repurchased
       •	 Procedures and time-limit for payment
       •	 Procedures and time-limit for a shareholder to offer his/her shares to the
          company

c)	    Limitations on Share Buybacks
       Under Article 37 paragraph (1) of the ICL, a company is not allowed to
       repurchase its own shares if the re-purchase of shares cause the net assets of the
       company to become less than the subscribed capital plus the mandatory reserves
       set aside and the total nominal value of all the shares re-purchase by the company
       and any pledge of shares or fiduciary security over shares held by the company
       itself or by some other company whose shares are directly or indirectly owned by
       the company exceed 10% (ten percent) of the total amount of capital subscribed in
       the company.
       In practice, a company is also not allowed to repurchase its own shares in the
       following cases:
       •	 It is conducting business operations at a loss or owes overdue debts
       •	 It is offering shares to mobilize more capital
       •	 It is splitting up or splitting down shares
       •	 Its shares are subject to public bids.

       A company is not allowed to purchase shares from the following entities for use as
       treasury shares:
       •	 Its manager and spouse, parents, adopted parents, children, adopted children or
          blood siblings of that individual
       •	 Share owners subject to transfer restrictions according to law and its AoA
       •	 Shareholders holding controlling shares, except for cases where the State sells its
          shares to reduce its ownership percentage.

d)	 Implementing a Share Buyback Pro-Rata
       The regulatory framework in Indonesia does not provide details provision
       regarding this item.




                                                                 Comparative Practices

       In other countries, the company shall purchase shares from all shareholders
       in a number that is proportionate to the number of shares that have been
       offered by shareholders for sale.




Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   357           Protecting the Charter Capital
e)	    Reporting and Information Disclosure on Share Buybacks:
       The regulatory framework in Indonesia does not provide details provision
       regarding this item.
       For public companies, a report and written information disclosure shall contain the
       following principal contents:
       •	 Purpose of shares redemption
       •	 Maximum amount of shares expected to be redeemed
       •	 Capital sources for redemption
       •	 Pricing principles
       •	 Transaction time
       •	 Name of the securities company designated to conduct the transaction
       •	 Price quoted in the written information disclosure (if any).

       When repurchasing their own shares, public companies that have their shares listed
       on the IDX shall concurrently report such to the IDX and disclose information via
       the disclosure media mechanisms of IDX.


3.	 Reciprocal Shareholdings
Reciprocal or cross-shareholdings are quite common between different companies and
may be set up to establish mutual influence or diversify portfolios. Such shareholding
structures between two or more companies often cause governance problems. For
example:
   •	 If companies increase their charter capital by means of reciprocal subscriptions to
      shares, the same initial contribution serves to cause two capital increases
   •	 When two companies create a reciprocal shareholding by acquiring issued shares
      of each other, they are causing, at least partially, an indirect distribution or
      repayment to shareholders whose shares are purchased
   •	 Reciprocal shareholdings can decrease the normal influence of independent
      directors in both companies, and replace the normal control exercised by the
      shareholders over directors and officers, with a self-controlling system.

Indonesian legislation, however, does not provide any specific rules regarding reciprocal
shareholdings.




Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   358        Protecting the Charter Capital
D.	            Statutory and Voluntary Reserves

Protecting the charter capital to safeguard creditor rights is further extended by the
possibility of creating certain additional reserves. As with the charter capital, such
reserves only exist in accounting terms.


1.	 The Statutory Reserve
Article 70 of The ICL requires companies to have a mandatory reserve fund (statutory
reserve). The mandatory setting aside as a reserve applies if the company has a positive
balance of profits. Net profits shall be set aside until the reserve reaches at least 20%
(twenty per cent) of the total subscribed and paid up capital. Its main purpose is to
protect creditors by ensuring that part of the company’s assets, in addition to the charter
capital, cannot be distributed among shareholders.


2.	 Other Funds
Beside statutory reserves, a company may also establish other funds (voluntary, non-
obligatory reserves).

a)	 Employees’ Fund
       The GMS can establish a special fund from its net profits for company employees.
       The ICL does not require or define specific requirements for such a fund. Its
       establishment is, therefore, optional and all provisions governing such a fund
       should be specified in the AoAor in the internal regulations. For example, this fund
       can be used for acquiring shares, provided that such shares are to be transferred to
       the company’s employees.

b)	 Other Funds of a Company
       The AoA, internal regulations or a GMS decision may establish other internal
       funds, such as financial reserve, investment and development funds. Such internal
       funds are financed through a deduction from the company’s net profits.




Corporate Governance Implications of the Charter Capital   359      Statutory and Voluntary Reserves
3.	 Additional Paid-In Capital
Additional paid-in capital is part of the company’s equity and is typically composed of
the following sources:
   •	 Any increase resulting from the re-valuation of non-current assets
   •	 The positive difference between the nominal value and the placement value of the
      company’s shares.

Additional paid-in capital has an accounting meaning only and there is no actual
accumulation of funds. Additional paid-in capital can be used, for example, to:
   •	 Offset the losses as the result of re-valuating non-current assets
   •	 Increase the charter capital from internal resources of the company.

    The Chairman’s Checklist (in Indonesian company, the Board of
    Director is responsible to prepare a dividend policy and should
    be approved by the Board of Commissioners).

            Has the Board of Directors developed a dividend policy and
            has the Board of Commissioners approve it? What are the
            primary issues addressed in this policy?

            Does the Board of Directors properly weigh using net
            profits for the payment of dividends versus re-investing
            these profits?

            Does the Board of Directors properly communicate its
            dividend policy to shareholders and potential investors,
            and, if it deviates from this policy, the reasons for doing so?

            Does the company properly disclose information about its
            dividend policy and dividend history in a timely manner?

            Does the Board of Directors propose intermediary
            dividends and approved by the Board of Commissioners?
            How does the Board of Commissioners ensure that this is
            done in the best interests of the company?

            rights are protected when it declared and paid dividends to
            shareholders?



Successful companies produce profits that can either be retained in the company
or distributed to shareholders as dividends. In Indonesia, there is an expectation, in
particular among minority shareholders with small holdings, for companies to make (a
reasonable amount of) dividend payments, and not exclusively retain its earnings. The
vast majority of Indonesian companies need additional capital, and in the case which
there is no immediately alternate source other than company earnings, paying dividends
is still a difficult decision to make since internally generated financing is one of the few
viable sources of funding.
This chapter discusses dividends from both the shareholder and creditor protection
perspectives, the procedure for declaring and paying dividends, as well as a company’s
dividend policy.




Dividends                                   364                           The Chairman’s Checklist
A.	          General Provisions on Dividends

1.	 The Definition of Dividends
Under the ICL, shares bestow on their owners the right to receive payment of
dividends.1 This means that shareholders have a right to share in the profits of the
company. They may do so by enjoying capital gains (an increase in the market value of
shares they hold in the company) and/or through receiving dividend payments. From
this perspective, dividends are an important shareholder right.
The Indonesian CG Code stated that the rights of the shareholders shall essentially
include the right to receive shares of profit appropriated for shareholders in the form of
dividends and other profit sharing, in proportion to the shares owned.2
In addition, the payment of dividends means paying out cash to shareholders, which
may decrease the company’s cash and equity (profit balance or reserved profit) needed
to service debt on a timely basis. From this vantage point, dividends are also viewed in
light of preserving creditor rights by following certain rules. To protect creditor rights,
legislation imposes certain limitations on the types and payment of dividends.
From the company’s point of view, paying dividend should also be seen as company’s
obligation to its shareholders. The ICL stipulates that all net profits after the deduction
to be set aside as reserves shall be allocated to the shareholders as dividends unless
determined otherwise in the GMS.3



2.	 Distributable Profit
The accounting treatment of dividend payments is determined both by the ICL
and accounting standards. Under Article 70 of the ICL, the company shall form a
mandatory reserve and other reserves. The mandatory reserve is a certain amount
of the net profits each financial year as a reserve. The mandatory reserve need not
always be in the form of cash, but may take the form of other assets which are easily
liquidated and cannot be allocated as dividends. The dividends may only be allocated

if the company has a positive balance of profits. “Positive balance of profits” means
the Company’s net profits in the current financial year have covered the Company’s
accumulated losses from previous financial years.
Dividends on preferred shares can, however, be paid out of funds that are specifically
established for that purpose. Under no circumstances can dividends be paid out of the
charter capital.



3.	 Dividend Rights
Owners of common and preferred shares have different dividend rights. Distributing
dividends is solely at the discretion of the GMS. On the other hand, owners of shares
possessed by a company because of re-purchase, transfer by operation of law, by grant,
or by bequest are not entitled to any allocation of dividends.4


4.	 Types of Dividends
A company may declare dividends for common and preferred shares as shown in
Figure 1.

              Inetrim Dividends can be paid                   charter as a fix percentage of the
                    quarterly or semi-annualy.                nominal value of the preferred shares.

Moreover, the ICL has provisions regarding Interim Dividends as stipulated in Article 72
paragraph (1) to (6). These provisions include:
     •	 Companies may allocate interim dividends before the company’s financial year
        ends unless determined otherwise by the AoA.
     •	 Interim dividends may be allocated if the company’s total net assets do not become
        less than the total subscribed and paid up capital plus the mandatory reserve.
     •	 The allocation of interim dividends may not disrupt or cause the company to be
        unable to fulfill its obligations to creditors or disrupt the company’s activities
     •	 The allocation of interim dividends shall be determined by a resolution of the
        Board of Directors after obtaining the consent of the Board of Commissioners
     •	 In the event that after the financial year ends it transpires that the company has
        suffered losses, the interim dividends allocated must be returned to the company by
        the shareholders
     •	 The Board of Directors and the Board of Commissioners shall be jointly and
        severely responsible for the company’s losses in the event that the shareholders do
        not return the interim dividends


5.	 Forms of Dividend Payments
As a rule, dividends are paid in cash. Both the ICL and the Capital Market Law do
not specifically stipulate any provisions regarding the forms of dividend payments.
However, the OJK Regulation Number IX.D.5 recognizes stock dividend and cash
dividend. Stock dividend is part of retained earnings distributed to shareholders in
form of shares. While cash dividend is the part of retained earning distributed to
shareholders in form of cash.
However, according to Article 73 paragraph 1 of ICL, if the dividends paid by the
company are not taken by the shareholders 5 (five) years as from the date determined
for the payment of dividends, such dividends shall be placed in a special reserve.5
Furthermore, the GMS shall provide a procedure for the collection of dividends which
have been placed in the special reserve and if it is not taken within 10 (ten) years, the
dividend shall become the right of the company.6

       Companies should pay dividends in cash, since non-cash transactions are
       generally unsuited for dividend payments.




6.	 Decision-Making Authority Regarding Dividends
The procedure for the use of profits and allocations of dividends is contemplated in
the AoA.7 The Board of Directors with the Board of Commissioners’ approval has
the authority to recommend the amount of dividends to pay out to the GMS The
authority to approve dividends rests with the GMS. However, for dividend interim, its
allocation shall be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors after obtaining
the consent of the Board of Commissioners.8 The GMS approves or disapproves the
Board’s recommendation by a simple majority vote of participating shareholders. The
amount of dividend interim declared by the GMS may not exceed that recommended
by the Board of Directors and the Board of Commissioners.


7.	 The Amount of Dividends
The Board of Directors should seek to maximize shareholder value when formulating
its recommendation on the amount of dividends to be distributed. The target payout
ratio—defined as the percentage of net income to be paid out as cash dividends—
should be based on shareholder preferences. More specifically, the Board of Directors
will want to determine shareholder preferences for capital gains (for example, using
excess cash to buyback shares or re-invest in the company) versus receiving dividends.
The Board of Directors will then need to define its optimal dividend policy, which
ideally should strike a balance between current dividends and future growth.

Dividends                                 368                      General Provisions on Dividends
For any given company, the optimal payout ratio is determined by four factors:
   1.	Investor preference for capital gains versus dividends;
   2.	The company’s investment opportunities (for example, companies with excess cash
      but limited investment opportunities would typically distribute a large percentage
      of their income to shareholders via dividends, while companies in high-growth
      sectors typically reinvest their earnings in the business);
   3.	The company’s target capital structure; and
   4.	The availability and cost of external capital.


8.	 The Importance of Receiving Stable Dividends
The stability of dividends is important to shareholders. Dividend payments tend to vary
over time, since company cash flows may fluctuate. Many shareholders rely on dividends
to meet expenses, however, and would consequently suffer from unstable dividend
streams. A company needs to carefully balance between the stability and dependability
of its dividend policy.




                                                                    Best Practices

       Ideally, the company should formulate and communicate a dividend policy to
       its shareholders, for example to “pay approximately 30% of its current year’s
       earnings as dividends, which will permit the company to retain sufficient
       capital to provide for future growth.”

To declare and pay dividends, the company must follow specific steps, summarized in
Figure 2.


            Figure 2. The Procedure for Declaring and Paying Dividends – Best Practices

                   In the case of Indonesian company’s practices, the steps are as follows:

                                                     Step 1.
                  The Board of Directors with the approval from the Board of Commissioners
                    recommends that the GMS declare dividends, as well as the amount of
                                dividends and procedure for their distribution.

                                                     Step 2.
              The Board of Directors prepares a list of shareholders entitled to receive dividends.

                                                     Step 3.
                                The GMS votes to declare a dividend payment.

                                                     Step 4.
                                     The company pays declared dividends.




1.	 How Dividends Are Declared
A company may declare dividends annually, or more frequently if stipulated in its
AoA. The decision to declare interim dividends, can only be done if the company’s
total net asset do not become less than the total subscribed and paid up capital plus the
mandatory reserve.9 The decision to declare annual dividends is based on the decision
regarding the distribution of profits (losses) of the company and can be taken by a
simple majority vote of shareholders participating in the GMS.

Dividends                                             370               Procedures for Declaring and Paying Dividends
In other words, until the company has declared and paid all dividends (including
accumulated dividends) for preferred shares in full, as specified by the AoA, it cannot
declare and pay dividends for other preferred or common shares. Further, the company
cannot declare dividends if the claims of a higher priority shareholders are not satisfied
in full.




                                                                       Best Practices

       In order to help shareholders properly assess a company’s capacity to make
       dividend payments, companies are advised to:
          •	 Establish a transparent and shareholder-friendly mechanism for
             evaluating the payment of dividends;
          •	 Provide sufficient information to shareholders to enable them to
             understand the conditions that must be met before the company will pay
             dividends;
          •	 Provide sufficient information to shareholders to enable them to
             understand the procedures for the payment of dividends;
          •	 Prevent the dissemination of any misleading information on the company
             that might influence shareholders’ assessment of policies governing
             dividend payments;
          •	 Provide simple dividend payment procedures; and
          •	 Impose (financial) sanctions on the President Director and Board of
             Directors’ members for incomplete or delayed payments of declared
             dividends.

       Dividend reports are a useful tool for assessing a company’s dividend
       policy and its dividend payment record. Dividend reports are published by
       commercial firms that track the dividend performance of companies. These
       reports are usually available for a fee.

2.	 The Shareholder List for Dividends
The list of shareholders entitled to receive dividends for a specific period includes
shareholders of record entitled to participate in the GMS. This date upon which such
record is to be compiled is called the “ex-dividend date”. Shareholders included on this
list as of the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive any dividends that the company
pays out to shareholders. Consequently, shareholders who own shares on the ex-
dividend date, and who sell them after that date, retain the right to receive dividends;
shareholders who purchased shares after the ex-dividend date are not entitled to receive
dividends until the next declaration of dividends. However, the contract of sale for the
shares may provide that the right to receive declared dividends shall be transferred to the
new owner of shares. In the event that dividends on shares of a specified type and class
are declared, each shareholder must receive dividends in accordance with the number
of shares of the type and class he owns.


3.	 When Declared Dividends Are Paid
A company is obliged to pay dividends once they have been declared. The period for
paying dividends is established either in the AoA or by decision of the GMS.
The accumulation of declared but unpaid dividends gives shareholders the right to file a
claim in court against the company demanding payment.




                                                                       Best Practices

       Although it is not regulated under the Indonesian laws and regulation,
       it is recommended by the FCSM Code that companies penalize the
       President Director, Board of Directors members, or the External Manager
       when dividend payments are incomplete or in arrears. In particular, it is
       recommended that the Board of Commissioners have the authority to reduce
       the remuneration of the President Director, Board of Director members, and/
       or the External Manager, or to terminate their authorities, when the company
       fails to pay declared dividends in full and/or on time.

The company is prohibited from declaring dividends under the circumstances illustrated
in Figure 3.
This list of circumstances is not exhaustive.
Both the AoA and the company’s debt instruments can specify circumstances under
which the company is prohibited from declaring dividends.

5.	 When the Company Cannot Pay Declared Dividends
As some time may pass between the decision to declare dividends and the actual
payment, the company may find itself in contravention of some of the requirements for
the declaration of dividends noted above. The company may not pay declared dividends
under the circumstances illustrated in Figure 4.
This list of circumstances is not exhaustive. As mentioned above, legislation may
specify further grounds, as can the AoA and corporate debt instruments. As soon as the
specified conditions cease to exist, the company is obliged to pay declare dividends.

C.	         The Disclosure of Information on
            Dividends

A company must make available to all its shareholders the recommendations of the
Board of Commissioners regarding the distribution of profits, including the amount
of proposed dividends on all types of shares, and the procedure for the payment of
such dividends. Securities legislation regulates the information disclosure as pertaining
to dividends. For listed companies intending to conduct the distribution of cash
dividend, stock dividend, and or bonus stock, the company must submit a report to
the IDX, the relevant GMS resolution specifying details of such distribution at the
latest 2 (two) exchange days as of the GMS.10 The same provision also apply for the
distribution of interim dividend. In the event a listed companies intends to distribute an
interim dividend, the resolution of the Board of Directors meetings pertaining to the
distribution of the said interim dividend must be submitted to the IDX at the latest 2
(two) exchange days as of the said meeting of the Board of Directors is convened.11
A company needs to address two basic issues in deciding to declare dividends:
   1)	The percentage of profits to be distributed; and
   2)	The frequency of payments, i.e. should the dividends vary from year to year, or
      remain stable over time.

A company is also required to provide a report on its dividend payment record in its
annual report.

       Although it is not regulated under the Indonesian laws and regulation, it
       is recommended by the FCSM Code recommends that the company adopt
       a by law on information disclosure, and that this by-law include a list of
       information, documents, and materials that must be submitted to shareholders
       to enable them to make decisions regarding dividends. The information should
       refer to agenda items for the GMS, such as:
           •	 Recommendations of the Board of Commissioners regarding the
              distribution of profits;
           •	 Recommendations of the Board of Commissioners on the payment of
              dividends; and
           •	 Reasons for each recommendation.

       Companies should also disclose information on dividend payments, or when
       dividends have not been paid, the reasons for dividend non-payment.

D.	           Dividend Policy

Companies are best served by adopting a clearly stated and rational dividend policy, in-
line with shareholder preferences.




                                                                       Best Practices

       Companies should inform the markets of their dividend policy, for example,
       through the print media. This disclosure should be in the same publication
       specified by the AoA for publishing notice for the GMS. The company
       should also consider using the internet for this purpose. It is essential that
       shareholders receive information—at a very minimum—on the following
       issues:
            •	 The method the company uses in determining the portion of profits that
               may be paid as dividends;
            •	 The conditions under which dividends may be paid;
            •	 The minimum amount of dividends payable for shares of each type and
               class;
            •	 The criteria the Board of Commissioners uses in deciding on the
               recommendation to declare dividends; and The procedure for dividend
               payment, including the time, place, and form of payment.

       Companies should further implement a transparent and easy-to-understand
       mechanism for determining dividends. To do so, the company should approve
       a by-law on dividends that includes information on:
            •	 The percentage of net profits for dividend payments;
            •	 The terms and conditions for dividend payments;
            •	 The amount of dividends payable for shares of a specific type and class
               if this amount is not specified by the AoA;
            •	 The minimum amount of dividends payable for shares of each type and
               class;

               may be partially declared on preferred shares.

       Companies are free to change their dividend policies at any time; however,
       corporate officers should be aware that this may cause inconveniences for
       their shareholders and send adverse, if unintended, signals to the markets.

Corporate Governance Implications of     381                    The Chairman’s Checklist
Corporate Securities
Companies have a number of financing options. They may fund their investment needs
from internally generated capital or seek external financing. Among external sources of
funding, they may borrow from banks or issue securities.
Financing decisions are usually quite complex. The method(s) that a company chooses
to finance its operations will depend upon a large number of internal and external
factors. Some of the company specific factors include the intended use of the funds
(whether for short-term working capital needs or long-term capital investment), the
capacity to service interest payments and repay the principal, and the nature (and the
degree of risk) of the business. Important external factors include the level of a country’s
economic development, political stability, its banking system and financial markets.
Each financing option, whether bank lending or the sale of shares or bonds, has
different financial and legal characteristics and will have different corporate governance
implications. In addition, each form of capital has a different cost. Equity finance has
some important advantages for companies. Although it is not the cheapest source of
funding, equity finance has the advantage of permitting companies to access large
amounts of capital that do not need to be paid back in the same manner as debt
financing.
However, access to the enormous potential of securities markets, with its millions of
potential investors, comes at a price. Securities markets are traditionally tightly regulated
to limit the manifest potential for abuse. Regulators, therefore, make significant demands
on companies. They require that investors receive complete information on the risks
of investment and they also go to great lengths to protect investor rights. While market
regulators are often criticized for the burdens they impose on companies, real and
potential abuses are, ultimately, the reason for the imposition of regulations and of
corporate governance standards.
This chapter discusses the different types of securities that companies may issue and
their corporate governance implications.

Corporate Securities
A.	            An Overview of Corporate Securities

1.	 Basic Types of Securities - Shares and Bonds
There are two basic types of securities that companies use to raise capital, shares (also
referred to as stocks or equities) and corporate bonds. Shares represent an ownership
position in the company and come with certain ownership rights. Bonds, on the other
hand, represent a creditor relationship with the company.
Unlike shareholders, bondholders have no corporate ownership rights, although they
may be accorded a significant degree of control over (certain) corporate activities during
the life of the creditor/debtor relationship.
Bonds envisage the repayment of the principal as well as periodic interest payments
until the bond reaches maturity and the obligation of the borrower (the company) to
make any further payments of principal/interest is terminated. Corporate bonds come
in many different forms and may be structured in a number of ways. For example, there
is no provision for interest payments on “zero coupon” bonds. The bondholder, in such
a case, is compensated by a discounted purchase price and the gradual appreciation
in the price of the bond, which is then redeemed at its face value on its maturity date.
Despite the many differences, bonds have one element in common in that they come
with a predictable and contractually fixed repayment.
Shares function differently. Companies can use share capital for an unlimited period
and are under no immediate obligation to repay investors. Investors are compensated
for their investment either through the possibility of receiving capital gains (an increase
in the value of their shares) and/or the possibility of receiving dividend payments in
addition to governance rights. From an investor’s point of view, shares as an investment
class, are normally riskier than bonds. Capital gains are never guaranteed (share prices
go up and down) and dividend may not be distributed if the company does not have
positive net income.
An important implication of the difference in risk is that share capital is often more
expensive than bonds or bank lending. One of the most fundamental rules of finance
is the higher the level of risk, the greater the level of return that investors will expect
for taking such risk. Given, as mentioned, that the risk of receiving a return on one’s
investment is higher for equities than for bonds or other types of loan transactions,
investors will demand a higher price for the use of their capital by the company and will
charge what is referred to as a “risk premium”.

One of the methods to manage equity risk is by granting shareholders governance
rights, a full set of rights in the case of common shares and a limited set of rights in
the case of preferred shares. Another method of managing risk and, by extension, of
reducing the cost of capital is to ensure that these rights are uniformly respected and
adequately protected. This, from a financial perspective, is what helps to define good
corporate governance.
Shares and bonds offer different advantages and disadvantages for investors and
companies as outlined in Table 1.

2.	 Securities in Paper and Paperless Forms
Securities must be issued in certain forms and comply with legal requirements. Securities
may take two main forms, tangible securities issued in paper form and intangible
securities (also known as “paperless” or “dematerialized securities”).
In Indonesia, shares and other securities (warrants, bonds) may be issued in both types
of paper and paperless forms which must be stipulated in the company’s AoA. In
other countries, the rights of the holders of paper securities are usually embodied in a
certificate. However, in the case of Indonesia, even though the holders have tangible
shares which are in paper form, they still have to fully and correctly register their
information into the company’s shareholder book to allow their shareholders’ rights
to become effective. The rights of the holders of paperless securities are based upon
an entry into a bond or shareholder register (similar to an entry in a bank account
reflecting the depositor’s rights to funds). The electronic trading of securities is allowed
for. Therefore, securities can also be defined as transferable electronic documents. The
Indonesian Company Law stated that Companies’ AoA shall specify the method of
transferring rights over shares in accordance with the provisions of legislative regulations
and that rights over shares shall be transferred with a deed of transfer of rights.1
Securities of public companies must be registered in the Indonesian Securities Central
Custodian (KSEI – Kustodian Sentral Efek Indonesia)s information system regardless of
what form they take.


3.	 Domestic Issuers on International Markets
Companies may choose to raise capital in domestic as well as international capital
markets. In doing so, they may issue shares and bonds directly on international capital
markets, i.e. foreign stock exchanges. When issuing bonds on foreign stock exchanges,
there are two forms of bonds that a company can issue which are government
guaranteed corporate bonds and non-government guaranteed corporate bonds.
Another way for companies to raise international market capital is to issue shares
indirectly through depositary receipts. Depositary receipts require the registration of
the original security in the name of a foreign trust company or, more commonly, a
bank. The bank holds the share in safekeeping and issues receipts against shares. These
receipts are referred to as “depositary receipts.” This system was developed because
investors in the world’s largest capital markets discovered it could take several months to

have their foreign share purchases registered in their name. The system is also attractive
for companies, since it allows them to establish a presence in foreign markets without
having to go through the process of a complete issue. The corporate governance
implications of this system are that Indonesian issuers of depositary receipts must
comply, to varying degrees, with foreign standards of corporate governance.

          Raising capital in foreign markets is discussed at slightly greater length in Section G of this

B.	            Types of Securities

1.	Shares
Shares (stocks or equities) entitle their holder to a set of property and governance
rights. Shares mean a type of securities that certify their holders’ legitimate rights and
benefits to a portion of equity of an issuing organization/company and have several
fundamental characteristics:
Name of the holder: Article 48 of the ICL stipulates that Companies’ shares shall
be issued under the name of their owner. Moreover, Article 50 of the ICLrequires that
Companies’ BOD shall make and keep a register of shareholders with some required
contents including information about the shareholders.2 The shareholder identification
and/or the register book of shareholders are stored at the headquarters of the issuing
company, and may be entered into the information system at a custodian center, namely
the KSEI Article 52 paragraph (2) of the ICL regulates that shares bestow on their
owners the right after the shares are recorded in the register of shareholders under the
name of the shareholder. Registered securities help to make the company’s ownership
structure more transparent and assist in protecting shareholder rights.
     •	 Rights of the holder: Shares can be common or preferred shares. Rights of
        shares are specified in the ICL3 and the company’s AoA.
Nominal value: Each share has a nominal value (also referred to as “par value” or
“face value”) or accountable parwhich should be stated in rupiah4 and shares without a
nominal value may not be issued.5 However, it does not close off the possibility of the
issuance of shares without a nominal value being provided for in legislative regulations
in the field of capital markets. The nominal value or accountable par of shares is
established in the AoA and is used to calculate the charter capital. The par value of all
shares issued by the company must be the same, unless otherwise stipulated under the
AoA. The company may issue shares after its formation to attract new investors. The
BOD with approval from the BOC may decide the offer price of the shares, but the
share price to be offered must not be lower than the book value or the market price of
the share at the time of offer.

Corporate Governance Implications of        388                                Types of Securities
Corporate Securities
On the other hand, the Bapepam Regulation No. IX.D.6 stipulates that listed company
may issue shares with different nominal value of shares in the event that the market
price of the company’s shares is below the nominal value. Subsequent to that, the
issuance of different nominal shares value shall be complied with the following
requirements:
    a.	shares which have same classification with different nominal values is entitled with
       equal rights and level;
    b.	shares with the old nominal value cannot be converted into new nominal value.
The nominal value of shares rarely reflects the market value of the company. The
differences between the nominal value of shares and the price at which they trade on the
market can be enormous. In addition, market prices constantly fluctuate and depend on
a number of factors influencing the scope and prices of supply and demand.
The value of shares may be determined by investors and other professionals using
different analytical methods, taking into consideration a great number of factors that
can influence the investment decision, like the current performance and future prospects
of the company, its dividend policy, the reputation of the company and its management,
the macroeconomic situation and government support for, or interference in, business
development. In that respect, one of the most important factors that has great influence
on a potential investor’s decision to invest in company shares is the quality of the
company’s governance, because it is directly connected with the investor’s possibility to
protect ownership rights in the company.


2.	Bonds
Bonds (corporate bonds) are securities through which companies raise debt capital. A
bond has the following legal characteristics:
a.	 Registered and Bearer Bonds
	      Companies can also issue bonds as bearer securities. Bearer bonds have the
       advantage of privacy for the bondholder. Bearer bonds are issued with certificates,
       which contain certain legal requirements. Bearer bonds may facilitate the transfer
       of bonds and reduce for the company the administrative costs of maintaining a
       bond register.
	      Despite these advantages, the use of bearer bonds may result in violations of
       securities and tax laws. Because they are easy to transfer, owners of bearer bonds
       may not be as precise about adhering to the laws when they sell bearer bonds to
       another person as they would need to be in the event of registered bonds. Thus,



Corporate Governance Implications of        389                                Types of Securities
Corporate Securities
       for example, bearer instruments have the great disadvantage that they may conceal
       assets from creditors or tax authorities.
b.	 Nominal Value
	      Bonds are issued at a certain nominal value. The nominal value of bonds is most
       often referred to as their “face value”. The face value of bonds can be any value
       that the issuing companies find suitable


                                                                     Best Practices

       In the interests of bondholders and, one could argue, of shareholders as well,
       the face value of all bonds issued by the company must not exceed the value
       of the a guarantee submitted to the company by a third party for the purposes
       of the bond issue.



c.	    Rights of Bondholders
	      The bondholder has the rights of a creditor and is entitled to:
       •	 Redeem the bond at maturity for its face value. A company can issue bonds with
          different redemption alternatives. It can issue bonds that have the same payment
          period or a series of bonds with different payment periods. The company can
          also envisage the possibility of early payment at the request of the holder.
       •	 Receive interest payable on the bond. Interest payments on bonds are generally
          referred to as coupons. Historically, bonds were issued with detachable coupons
          that were submitted in exchange for payment.
       •	 Convert into shares (for bondholders of convertible bonds). There are two types
          of bonds, convertible bonds and non-convertible bonds. Convertible bonds can
          be converted into shares in accordance with the term of issue of such bonds and
          stipulations in the AoA of the company, whilst non-convertible bonds cannot be
          converted into shares.
       	 Since bonds are freely transferable, the bondholder can sell his/her bonds
         to another investor. As with equities, bonds are subject to a market pricing
         mechanism. This means that bond prices are constantly fluctuating and that
         bondholders can both make and lose money from buying and selling bonds.

d.	 Secured and Unsecured Bonds
	       Companies may issue both secured and unsecured bonds.



                                                          Comparative Practices

        In some countries, companies may not issue unsecured bonds during the first
        couple of years of their existence. This rule is intended to protect bondholders
        from the risks associated with a new business.


Secured bonds provide additional protections to bondholders in case the company
defaults on its obligations. The following guarantees can be applied:
      •	 Pledges of property. Securities can be the subject of the pledge. All secured
         bondholders of the same issue have equal rights with regard to the pledged
         property.
      •	 A third party guarantee can be submitted to the company for the purposes
         of the bond issue. This can be a bank guarantee or a corporate (for example,
         submitted by a parent company for bonds issued by a subsidiary) or personal
         guarantee. The guarantor is jointly and severally liable for the redemption of the
         bond.
The issue of secured bonds means that guarantee requirements must be fulfilled
(pledges, mortgages or bank guarantees) in addition to the normal requirements
associated with a bond issue.


e.	     Convertible Bonds
	       Companies can also issue bonds that can be converted into shares. Convertible
        bonds may be secured or unsecured.
	       Convertible Bonds are bonds exchangeable for a set number of common stocks at
        a pre-stated price. From the issuer’s standpoint, the convertible feature is usually
        designed as a sweetener to enhance the marketability of the bond. Under the
        Minister of Finance Regulation No. 18/PMK.010/2012, PE is permitted to
        purchase the convertible bond, and it falls within the criteria of “Quasi Equity
        Participation” (investment through purchasing the convertible bonds). The Pre-
        IPO convertible bonds structures are commonly used in sectors closed or restricted

       for foreign investors. Convertible bond structure will not trigger the Negative List
       restriction until it is exercised into equity. Provided however, under the Indonesian
       Investment Law, any investment in a public listed company through the market
       shall be considered as portfolio investment, as such it will not subject to Negative
       List restrictions. The rationale is that the portfolio investment shall be managed
       for gaining the capital gain purpose only, and it will not be intended for (long
       term) investment in nature. Provided however, Article 49 of the Head of BKPM
       Regulation No. 5 of 2013 provides that if one of the Controlling Shareholder (a
       party holding more than 50% of the total issued and paid up capital or a party that
       has an capacity to determine, either directly or indirectly, in any manner policy of
       the public company) of the public company is a foreigner, therefore such company
       is subject to the provision of foreign investment.
	      Commercially, while the benefits of holding the Convertible Bonds share
       similarities of the regular bonds such as interests, capital gains and the first right
       to claim, the clear benefit of holding this is the investors can convert the bond into
       stocks at a predetermined price, and will be entitled to have any benefits as stocks
       ownership. However, amongst the benefits holding Convertible Bonds also possess
       clear commercial risks such as default, capital loss and call-ability.
	      The total volume of bonds issued shall not exceed the approved limit of issuance.
       The time-limit for conversion of bonds shall be fixed by the issuing organization
       and publicly announced to investors upon issuance of bonds. The bond conversion
       ratio shall be fixed by the issuing organization at the time of issuance. If at the time
       of bond conversion, the share price fluctuation exceeds the share price fluctuation
       range announced at the time of issuance of the bonds, the company’s owner shall
       have the right to make an appropriate adjustment to the bond conversion ratio.


f.	    Differences between Bondholder and Shareholder Interests
	      Both shareholders and bondholders are interested in the profitability and health
       of the company. For shareholders, a healthy company generates free cash flows
       that generally lead to a higher market valuation. Healthy companies are also
       more likely to pay dividends than unhealthy ones. For bondholders, a healthy
       company reduces the risk of default on its obligation to repay the bond principal
       and interest. In short, for both, a successful and profitable company can lead to an
       increase in the market value of its respective securities.

There are, however, some important differences between the interests of these two types
of investors.
   •	 Interests diverge most distinctly during insolvency. During insolvency
      proceedings, different priorities are assigned to different types of claimants. In
      general, creditor claims (including those of bondholders) are always satisfied before
      those of shareholders.
   •	 Another difference is in the conversion of bonds. Shareholders are always
      interested in minimizing the dilution of their holdings. It is, in part, for this reason
      that they enjoy certain governance rights and that decisions that would result in the
      dilution of share ownership are always subject to the approval of the company’s
      governing bodies. Similarly, holders of convertible bonds are interested in
      preventing the reduction of capital or the redemption of shares when this conflicts
      with the exercise of their conversion rights.
   •	 The interests of shareholders and bondholders also diverge with
      respect to risk. Shareholders generally accept a higher level of risk than
      bondholders in exchange for potentially higher returns. If a company successfully
      takes greater risks, returns to shareholders will be higher. If a company fails in its
      risk-taking, the losses will be greater. Bondholders will, on the other hand, always
      receive the same contractually stipulated return regardless of the level of risk in
      projects the company undertakes. Bondholders only stand to lose if the level of risk
      to the enterprise ultimately results in corporate insolvency. This holds particularly
      true for holders of unsecured bonds. Bondholders always hope to see a predictable,
      stable cash flow and if possible, a reduction in the company’s risk profile.



                                                                      Best Practices

       In some countries, company laws incorporate special measures for balancing
       the conflicting interests of shareholders and bondholders by:
          •	 Granting bondholders consultation rights. In France, for example,
             bondholders meetings must be consulted with in a number of
             circumstances, such as the reorganization or issuance of bonds that are
             secured by significant company assets
           •	 Allowing bondholders to inspect documents during the GMS, as is the
              case in Germany
           •	 Prohibiting the redemption of shares or reduction of capital while bonds
              are open for conversion or offering, for example in France.

       As in France, information can also be sent to bondholders on issues that
       may be of special concern to them. Companies may wish to develop specific
       policies with respect to bondholders and are encouraged to integrate
       them into their overall programs on corporate governance. The holders
       of convertible bonds and share warrants have the same rights as the
       shareholders with regard to information and inspection of the company books
       and documents, unless otherwise provided by the decision on the issuance of
       such securities or agreed otherwise.

C.	            Issuing Securities

Issuing securities is a complex process involving a transfer of funds in exchange for
specific control and cash flow rights, all subject to different levels of assurances and
guarantees. Efficient capital markets help companies raise capital for productive uses.
They also allow investors to reap returns on capital that might otherwise lie dormant
and to select investments that correspond to their desired level of risk and return.
Capital markets cannot bring users and providers of capital together efficiently if the
markets are subject to misuse. Unfortunately, the history of international financial
markets is rife with such examples. Securities legislation has developed largely in
response to abuses and market failures. Its purpose is to protect the interests of
companies and investors, and to enhance the function and efficiency of capital markets.6
In Indonesia, securities legislation determines the conditions and methods of the
issuance of securities. During this proceeding, powers to ensure the transparency and
legality of the issuance are delegated to the Indonesia capital market regulator. It is also
important to take into consideration that the regulation is focused on the obligations
to issue shares of the public companies and practically it means that conditions and
methods for the private offer are different in comparison with private companies.
Legal requirements for issuing shares differ according to the method of placement,
which are public placement and private placement. Every limited liability company can
issue shares through public offer or private placement.
All public offerings must be registered with the Indonesia capital market regulator.
However, for companies operating under special business conditions such as financial
institutions or insurance companies, charter capital changes must be preliminary
approved by relevant authorities before they can register the public offering with the
Indonesia capital market regulator to implement changes in charter capital.
Table 2 summarizes private and public offering issuing method legal requirements for
different types of companies.




6	   At the same time, market regulators must make sure they do not strangle entrepreneurial drive or
     company growth. Companies are wealth generators in every economy and elaborate regulation usually
     entails costs. The challenge for regulators is to develop intelligent regulations that meet required goals,
     while imposing the minimum level of costs upon the economy and society.

Corporate Securities
The process of issuing securities involves a number of steps. They depend on the issuer,
type of securities involved and the method used for the issuance. Figure 1 below only
illustrates steps for the issuance of shares for a public company and they are divided into
Option A and B. Option A illustrates the procedure for private offering and Option B
for public offering.
Bonds have to be issued in conformity with the laws governing the securities market and
the AOA of the company.
The following section discusses the above-mentioned steps in greater detail and
highlights the differences between shares and bonds.


1.	 Making the Decision to Place Securities
The decision to place securities is made by different governing bodies, depending on the
type of issue and the AoA requirements, as summarized in Table 3.

            Table 3: The Decision to Place Different Types of Securities


   Shares                               The GMS generally makes the decision.

                                        For more information on the decision to place shares, see
                                        Chapter 9, Section B.


   Convertible and                      However, under the ICL and the Capital Market Law, there is
   Non-Convertible Bonds                no regulation on who shall have the right to make decision on
                                        the issuance of convertible bonds. Since convertible bonds will
                                        be converted into shares after expiry and make changes to the
                                        charter capital in the future, in practice the GMS will make
                                        the convertible bond issuance decision. The BOD makes the
                                        non-convertible bond issuance decision. Besides, if the issuing
                                        company is a State shareholding company, the private offering
                                        bond issuance plan needs to be approved by the MOF.




                                                               Comparative Practices

       The decision-making procedure for issuing bonds is simpler than for other
       securities, which may serve as an additional incentive for their use. However,
       the charter can provide for stricter approval requirements, for example, with
       regard to specific types of bonds.

Corporate Securities
The decision to issue securities is made by the GMS. The decision to issue securities
becomes the main document certifying the rights of the holders of securities and of the
company.
Although the contents of the decision depend on the circumstances of each issue, it
must generally include information on the:
   •	 Issuing company, i.e. full name, place of business and postal address
   •	 Decision to issue securities, i.e. date and the decision-making body
   •	 Securities to be issued, i.e. type and class, their nominal value, the rights of the
      holders of securities and number to be issued
   •	 Conditions of the placement.
In the case of bonds, the decision must include additional information on the:
   •	 Form of bond redemption (monetary or in-kind)
   •	 Maturity date (and details regarding early redemption, where applicable)
   •	 Other terms of redemption, i.e. the value of the payment, if early redemption is
      possible
   •	 If convertible bonds are issued, the procedure for their conversion into shares
   •	 If secured bonds are issued, information on the security or the person submitting
      the guarantee and the conditions of the guarantee (in the latter case, the decision
      must also be signed by the guarantor).
The Indonesia capital market regulator closely monitors the mandatory content of the
company decision to issue securities, if their lawful issuance is conditioned upon ex-ante
the Indonesia capital market regulator approval. Copies of the decision to issue shares
are kept with the registration authority and the company.


2.	 Registering the Decision to Issue Shares
An issuing organization making the public offering of shares must register its decision
with the Indonesia capital market regulator except for the following cases:
   •	 The public offering of SOEs’ stocks transformed into joint stock companies
   •	 The sale of securities under court judgments or rulings, or sale of securities of
      property managers or recipients in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency.
The best practice is that the decision to increase the share capital may not be registered
upon the expiration of six months from the date of its adoption.

3.	 Granting the Certificate for Public Offering of Securities
The public offering of securities can only be made after the company submits
Registration Statement to OJK and such Registration Statement has been stated
Effective by OJK. Included in the dossiers submitted to the Indonesia capital market
regulator, the prospectus is an important document through which investors obtain
information about the issuer of securities, rights and duties deriving from those
securities, including the risks, returns and any other relevant information associated with
the investment. For this reason, legislation requires that a prospectus be prepared and
published in the case of any public offering.
There are costs attached to the preparation of a prospectus that some companies may
wish to avoid. However, the short-term costs of preparing the prospectus are likely to
be greatly outweighed by the long-term benefits (e.g. lower cost of capital) that can be
achieved by clarifying the risks and returns of the company to investors.
Investor interests are protected by the information that must be included in the
prospectus, the liability attached to those who have signed it and the requirement for its
registration.
a.	 The Contents of the Prospectus
	      Based on Article 1 Number 26 of Law No. 8 of 1995 on Capital Market (“Capital
       Market Law”) A prospectus is a written information in relation to the public
       offering to attract another party to purchase the securities .Regulation No IX.C.2
       contains detailed provisions outlining what must be disclosed in the prospectus.
       These provisions are summarized in the introductory part of the prospectus and
       the main part of prospectus.
    1. The introductory part of the prospectus consists of:
       a.	The First Part
       •	   The effective date;
       •	   The offering period;

                                                                      Best Practices

       It is good practice to disclose all material information about the company
       in the prospectus. The company should seek to provide shareholders and
       potential investors with all information that may be important in valuing the
       company.

       Besides, it is also good if in the prospectus of IPO and public offering of bond,
       the issuer gives information about the company’s ratings to help investors
       make investment decisions. Ratings companies exist to help the issuer
       make the ratings and at the same time, help investors know about the credit
       worthiness of the company and the level of risk associated with their targeted
       investments through independent opinions.

       The three top companies dealing with credit ratings for the investment
       industry are Standard and Poor’s (S&P’s), Moody’s and Fitch ICBA. Each of
       them has different ratings systems, but share the same objective which is to
       help investors know about a company’s ability and willingness to repay debt,
       hence to evaluate risks associated with the money investors intend to put into
       a company. An important note is that the ratings are just for reference, not
       equal to buy, sell or hold recommendations.



b. 	 Prospectus Approval by the Company
	      The company (issuer) is responsible for the truthfulness and completeness of
       the information included therein. Beside all other people who participated in
       the preparation of the prospectus, including consulting companies, underwriter,
       appointed External Auditor, persons who signed the auditor’s reports and any
       organizations or individuals who signed dossiers of registration, are liable for the
       damage caused by the publication of incomplete and inaccurate information in
       the prospectus and summarized prospectus. The additional condition of their
       responsibility is that they knew, or by the nature of their work, had to know that
       the information was inaccurate or incomplete (for example the President Director,
       the Chief Accountant or the person fulfilling this function, the External Auditor).
       They are jointly and severally liable with the issuer for any damage caused to
       investors because of untruthful, incomplete, and/or misleading information. In

        some countries, if investors believe that they have suffered damages, they can file
        claims with a court.
c.	     Registration Dossiers Approval and Certificate Granting by the
        Indonesia Capital Market Regulator
	       Examining and approving the public offering of securities dossiers by the Indonesia
        Capital Market Indonesia is an important investor protection mechanism. This is
        a form of state control over the securities issuing process. Without proper approval
        and registration, securities cannot be issued and sold to investors.
	       In the course of examining the public offering of securities registration dossiers,
        the Indonesia capital market regulator may request issuing organizations to modify
        or supplement such dossiers in order to ensure that the disclosed information is
        accurate, truthful and complete and able to help protect legitimate rights and
        benefits of investors.
	       Within 45 days of receiving the valid dossiers, the OJK shall consider and grant
        a public offering of securities certificate. In case of refusal, the OJK shall reply
        in writing, clearly stating the reasons for the refusal. It may take a company a lot
        longer time than the 45-day period to get approval and the certificate if it cannot
        provide the OJK with valid information and documents as required.7 Therefore,
        the company should carefully prepare the public offering of securities registration
        dossiers. The company should select competent consulting company, underwriter
        and accredited auditing company, auditors to sign the audit reports and any
        organizations and individuals that certify the public offering of the securities
        registration dossiers that will be involved in this process.




4.	 Public Offer of Securities
Upon receiving OJK’s Effective Letter of the prospectus and the certificate of the
public offer, the issuer can begin placing securities after a public announcement of the
securities issuance (i.e. within two days from effective date of the certificate).8
The placement is the actual transaction between the company and the investor. This
transaction is subject to a number of legal requirements and only takes effect upon the
registration of its results, as discussed hereinafter.

a.	 Number of Securities Placed
	      The number of securities placed should be no more than indicated in the decision
       to issue securities.
	      The number of securities placed may, however, be less than the number indicated
       in the prospectus. In practice, the ability of a company to sell securities depends on
       investor demand. The actual number of securities placed must be disclosed in the
       report on the results of the issue.
b.	 The Timing of the Public Offer for the Offering and Payment of
    Securities
     •	 The Publication of the Announcement: After the effective date of the
        Registration Statement and prior to the Public Offering, an Issuer have to fulfil the
        following requirements:
       -	 Publish any correction and/or addition of Summary Prospectus, if any, in at
          least 1 Indonesian daily newspaper with a nation wide circulation no later than 1
          working days after the effective date;
       -	 Distribute the formal Prospectus required as part of Registration Statement to
          the public or the prospective purchasers;
       -	 Submit 2 copies of Prospectus and its soft copy to OJK;
       -	 Submit the proof of announcement as referred in point (i) at the latest 2 working
          days after such announcement.
     •	 Beginning of the Offering: The beginning of the offering of securities is
        determined by the public offer. The Issuer shall conduct Public Offering at the
        latest 2 working days after the Registration Statement become effective. The Public
        Offering period is 5 working days at the maximum. The payment of securities shall
        be made at the latest at the time of transfer of securities.
     •	 End of the Offering: Underwriter or Issuer (in the event an Underwriter is not
        used) must submit reports on the results of Public Offering to OJK no later than 5
        working days after the allotment date. Furthermore, an Underwriter or an Issuer
        (in the event an underwriter is not used) shall appoint an auditor registered in OJK
        to conduct examination on the receipt of fund from Public Offering by the Issuer.
        The examination report shall be submitted to OJK at the latest 30 working days
        after the expiration period of Public Offering.
To carry out a legally valid securities issuance several deadlines need to be met, as
illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 29.

The Issue Price of Securities
The GMS has the right to determine the issue price of securities. The discretionary
powers are limited to prevent directors or large shareholders from acquiring securities
below market price when the issue is made by offering (see Table 4).

            Table 4: Issue Price

  Security                      Price

  Shares                        Nominal value of the shares of prospective listed company minimum
                                Rp. 100 (one hundred Rupiah).

                                The issue price must correspond to the market value.

                                The issue price cannot be lower than the nominal value (only applied for
                                companies transformed from SOEs).

  Convertible                   The issue price must not be lower than the market price at the time of
  Bonds and                     offering or the most recent book value recorded of the shares, except in the
  Warrants                      following cases:
                                •	 Initial offering of shares to persons other than founding shareholders
                                •	 Shares offered to all shareholders in proportion to their current respective
                                     percentage of shares in the company
                                •	 Shares offered to brokers or underwriters. In this case, the specific
                                     amount of discount or rate of discount must be approved by the
                                     shareholders representing at least 75% of the total number of shares
                                     with voting rights
                                •	 Other cases and the rates of discount in such cases shall be stipulated in
                                     the company AoA.
                                •	 The issue price must correspond to the market value.
                                •	 Reference can be made by companies to the following comparable
                                     practices in Russia and Serbia:
                                •	 The issue price cannot be lower than the nominal value or book value of
                                     shares into which they are to be converted.
                                •	 When exercising their pre-emptive rights, shareholders can acquire
                                     convertible bonds or warrants at a price no more than 10% lower than
                                     the price determined for other investors.

  Bonds                         The value of bond is reflected by the bond yield. Depending on the nominal
  (non-convertible)             yield on the bond, compared with the market bond rates, the issue price of
                                bond can vary quite flexible. Comparable practices in Russia and Serbia also
                                indicate that the issue price does not have to correspond to the nominal value
                                of bonds.

c.	    The Amendment to the Business Registration
	      Companies have to amend their AoA in the case any amendment of the amount
       of the charter capital is occurred. After the securities are issued, the company is
       required to register the increase in the charter capital with an authorized business
       registration agency.11 The submission period to submit the increase of charter
       capital may vary depending on the provision provided by the relevant authorized
       business registration agency.

D.	            The Conversion of Securities

Companies not only issue securities when seeking to raise capital, but also when existing
securities or rights embodied in them must be restructured. A conversion of securities
occurs in the following circumstances:
   •	 Decreasing the charter capital by decreasing the nominal value of shares without
      changing the number of shares. By this mode, the company shall withdraw shares
      from shareholders and issue new shares with reduced par value. The company shall
      have to pay its shareholders an amount of money equal to the number of shares of
      each shareholder times the difference between old and new par values. Currently,
      there is no specific regulation or guidance on increasing the charter capital by
      increasing the nominal value or accountable par of shares.
   •	 Splitting shares
   •	 Converting one type and class of shares into another type and class of shares.
   •	 Converting bonds into shares.
   •	 Reorganizing the company.
In these cases, new investors are not involved. Shares are placed with existing
shareholders or other investors hold securities that grant them conversion rights.
The procedure for converting existing shares is simpler and quicker than for issuing
additional shares, because it does not change the charter capital of the company. The
conversion of convertible bonds into shares does increase the charter capital of the
issuing company, however, the change is anticipated beforehand.

E.	Derivatives

Shares and bonds can be described as primary securities, which directly certify a set of
rights. Companies can also issue derivative instruments that embody rights dependent
on the performance of underlying or primary securities, assets or other property. Such
instruments can, in international practice, relate to both equities and debt securities.
According to the elucidation of Article 1 paragraph f number 5 of Capital Market Law,
derivatives shall include options and warrants. However, there are several other kinds of
derivatives in Indonesia such as rights and futures contracts.
For the purpose of fund raising, the company shall issue:
   •	 Rights: A type of securities issued by a joint stock company along with an
      additional issuance of stocks to ensure that its existing shareholders can buy new
      stocks under specified conditions. Shareholders can transfer their rights to others
      within a specified period of time.
   •	 Warrants: A type of securities issued along with the issuance of bonds or
      preferred stocks, entitling securities holders to buy a stated amount of common
      stocks at a designated price within a given period.
   •	 Stock Options: A call option on the common stock of a company, issued as a
      form of non-cash compensation. In practice, stock options can play an important
      role in the context of executive remuneration programs and may have important
      corporate governance implications. Therefore, it is useful to make an overview
      of the comparative practice of using stock options as a method of compensating
      directors.

In the corporate governance context, a relatively mundane form of option — the
incentive stock option — is used to provide performance-enhancing incentives to
management and employees. In some countries, options are the primary component
of remuneration packages for top executives. They are popular because the returns
to executives can be large. They ostensibly align the interests of management and
shareholders, and because the true cost of options (the dilution of other shareholders) is
not readily apparent under current accounting standards. (need information on this issue
in Indonesia)

       Stock option compensation is a complex and contentious remuneration
       technique that requires close examination by the governing bodies of the
       company, GMS approval and disclosure in detail in the annual financial
       statements of the company. The BOD and shareholders need to be aware
       of the company’s use of these tools since they could potentially expose
       companies to unexpected and significant risks.



The other types of derivatives (call options, put options, futures, securities classes or
indexes) are usually used by financial institutions (banks, securities firms) for trading
purposes or as a risk-reduction instrument. Derivatives in stock trading can be seen
more commonly on the secondary market where the main players are securities
companies, institutional and individual investors and other financial institutions such as
banks, insurance companies. These derivatives are highly standardized and there are
official markets for them. The issuance of derivatives is associated with the existence of
mature capital markets. At the same time, their existence necessitates special regulations
to ensure accounting and information transparency.

F.	 Raising Capital in International 		
	Markets

A company can also raise capital in international markets through the issuance of either
bonds or shares providing it satisfies the conditions as regulated by the Indonesian
Government, including:
   •	 Not being on the list of business lines in which the participation of foreign parties
      is banned and ensuring participation ratios of foreign parties as specified by law
   •	 Having the overseas offering of securities and the plan on the use of mobilized
      capital approved under its BOD or GMS decision
   •	 Satisfying the offering conditions specified by a competent authority of the country
      where it registers the offering.
   •	 In compliance with regulations on foreign exchange management.

Regulation No. IX.I.3 concerning Issuance of Foreign Depositary Receipts stipulates
that any issuers or public companies who intent to issue its shares in Foreign Depositary
Receipts (such as American Depositary Receipts, Singapore Depositary Receipts, and
Global Depositary Receipts) must submit their plan to OJK. The report must contains
complete information concerning the plan such as the involvement of issuer or public
companies in the foreign depositary receipts and any additional requirements they might
have to fulfill to issue the securities in the international market.
Issuers and the public companies also have to report their foreign securities activities to
the Indonesia capital market regulator. Pursuant to Regulation No. X.K.7, it is stated
that the issuers and public companies must submit report to OJK immediately in the
same day the report is submitted in the country where the foreign depository receipt is
placed.
Listing on foreign stock exchanges brings advantages to listed companies such as a
lower cost of capital, higher liquidity and greater prestige. The world’s largest foreign
markets tend to have much higher standards of corporate governance than Indonesian
markets. The most popular markets are in the U.S., Hong Kong, and Singapore, which
arguably have some of the most rigorous governance standards in the world. Therefore,
Indonesian companies need to fulfil much higher corporate governance standards in
order to enter or remain strong on these markets.

               Do all commissioners and directors understand the concept
               of extraordinary transactions? Does the company AoA
               specify additional criteria for identifying transactions that
               are to be treated as extraordinary beyond the minimum
               criteria mandated by law? Does the Board of Directors
               distinguish between extraordinary transactions and those
               entered into in the ordinary course of business?

               How does the Board of Directors ensure that extraordinary

Material Corporate Transactions            417                        The Chairman’s Checklist
Shareholders should be legally protected when the company is involved in extraordinary
and/or affiliated transactions. Such protection is essential because of the impact that
these transactions can have on the value of the company, the price of its shares and
the property rights of shareholders. Nevertheless, corporate governance abuses in
these types of transactions continue to take place. For example, beneficial ownership
structures typically remain non-transparent, making it nearly impossible to identify
related parties in a transaction. In the meantime, insiders continue to develop complex
structures and sophisticated techniques that allow them to tunnel assets, profits, and
corporate opportunities away from the company and its shareholders.
In this chapter, we have illustrated some international practices on extraordinary
transactions and have also discussed all relevant situations implied by Indonesian laws
and regulations as extraordinary transactions.




Material Corporate Transactions            418                           The Chairman’s Checklist
A.	            Extraordinary Transactions

1.	Definition
Under the ICL, there is no specific definition of extraordinary transactions. ICL only
regulates certain material transactions in which Board of Directors shall seek GMS
approval which include assignment of company assets or making security debt over
company assets, of which constitute more than 50% (fifty percent) of Companies’
net assets in 1 (one) or more separate or inter-related transactions.1 In addition, those
transactions involve assigning company net assets which occur in a period of 1 (one)
financial year or a longer period provided for in the company’s AoA.2
However, Number 1 Letter a.2 Bapepam Regulation No.IX.E.2, Attachment of the
Chairman of OJK Decree Number 614 of 2011 concerning material transactions and
change of company’s main business. The decree stipulated that material transactions are
transactions which include:
   a.	capital participation in a business entity, projects and/or certain business activities;
   b.	procurement, sale, exchange, transfer of assets or business segment;
   c.	 rent of assets;
   d.	loan of funds;
   e.	 encumber company assets; and/or
   f.	 provide company guarantee;

with value 20% (twenty percent) or more of the company’s equity, in one or a series of
transaction for a certain activities or objectives.3
The transaction stipulated above is valued based on the latest audited annual financial
report, mid-term or other audited interim financial report if the company has any
interim report other than mid-term report, which one is the most recent.
Company with material transactions valued of 20% (twenty percent) to 50% (fifty
percent) of its equity is not obliged to seek GMS approval. However, the company

Material Corporate Transactions                 419                        Extraordinary Transactions
should declare the information on the material transaction to the public in at least one
national newspaper in Bahasa Indonesia and submit the transaction documents to OJK
at the latest 2 (two) business days after the transaction agreement were signed.
If transaction valued of more than 50% (fifty percent), the company should seek for
GMS approval.




                                                            Comparative Practices

       In Russia, a transaction (or several related transactions) is extraordinary
       when it meets all five of the following criteria:
          a)	The Nature of the Transaction
               •	 The transaction directly or indirectly involves the acquisition, sale, or
                  the possibility of sale of corporate assets
               •	 The transaction is a credit, pledge, or guarantee transaction
               •	 The transaction is not related to the issue of additional common
                  shares or securities convertible into common shares.
           b)	The Value of the Transaction
           	 The assets involved have a value of 25% (twenty five percent) or more
             of the book value of the company’s assets as determined by financial
             statements as of the most recent reporting date.
           c)	The Relation of the Transaction to the Business of the Company
           	 The transaction is not carried out in the “ordinary course of business” of
             the company.
           d)	Related Transactions
           	 Two or more related transactions involving the company’s assets
             totaling 25% (twenty five percent) or more of the book value of the
             company’s assets are considered a single extraordinary transaction.
             Factors that determine whether several transactions must be
             considered as a single extraordinary transaction include:
               •	 The purpose of the transactions




Material Corporate Transactions                 420                           Extraordinary Transactions
               •	 The market conditions under which the transactions have been
                  concluded
               •	 The sphere of activities of the company
               •	 The duration of relationships between the company and its
                  transactional counterparts.
           e)	Additional Charter Criteria
           	 The charter may define additional transactions that should be treated
             as extraordinary transactions. For example, the charter may specify that
             transactions involving assets with a lower percentage of the book value
             be considered extraordinary transactions. The charter can also provide
             that certain types of contracts (e.g. all loan agreements or all pledges
             of company shares) must be treated as extraordinary transactions,
             regardless of their nature. However, the company has no right to
             change the legal definition of an extraordinary transaction to limit
             cases of extraordinary transactions. For example, the company cannot
             provide that only transactions involving assets with a value in excess of
             30% (thirty percent) of the book value of the company’s assets will be
             considered as extraordinary transactions.




                                                                       Best Practices

       There are many cases when transactions should be subject to special
       procedures for extraordinary transactions, even though they fall well below
       the legislated threshold. For example, the sale of a subsidiary of a large
       petroleum company that holds significant oil drilling rights may be of such
       size and strategic importance that it should be considered as an acquisition
       or disposal of high-value assets regardless of the percentage of asset value it
       represents.
       Legislation establishes a minimum standard of behavior and there is some
       room for various interpretations regarding what is extraordinary and what is
       not. For this reason, it is good practice for charters to include provisions that
       “transactions that may have a significant effect on the company” be treated




Material Corporate Transactions               421                           Extraordinary Transactions
       as extraordinary (except for transactions that are concluded in the ordinary
       course of business).
       It is also recommended that the sale of shares of a subsidiary where
       the company would lose its majority stake be considered extraordinary
       transactions.
       When two companies are engaged in a transaction, each company must
       separately apply the criteria for an extraordinary transaction. This means that
       the same transaction may conceivably be an extraordinary transaction for
       one company, but not for the other.




2.	 Valuing Extraordinary Transactions
An important aspect in determining whether a transaction is a material transaction is
based on the transactionvalue compared with the equity of the company. The value
of the transactionmust be determined in order to identify which corporate approval is
required before the transaction can be implemented.


                                                          Comparative Practices

       In Russia and Serbia, the basis of valuation for sales of assets is the value
       of assets involved in the transaction as determined by reference to the
       company’s financial statements as of the most recent reporting date before
       the transaction. For the acquisition of assets, the acquisition price of assets
       involved in the transaction shall be used. The Board of Directors has the
       authority to determine the value of assets or services. In doing so, the
       Board of Directors must compare the book value of the assets involved in
       the transaction with the book value of the company’s assets as a whole.
       This comparison depends on the nature of the transaction (whether it is an
       acquisition or a sale), as illustrated in Table 1.

                                                 statements as of the most recent reporting date
                                                 before the transaction.

                                                 transaction.




                                                                             Best Practices

       An independent appraiser should assist the Board of Directors in determining
       the value of assets.




3.	 Procedure for Approving Extraordinary Transactions
ICL does not specifically mention extraordinary transactions. The law only stipulated
that transactions with valued of more than 50% (fifty percent) of the company equity
should be approved by the general meeting of Shareholders.
The Regulation No. IX.E.2 provides more detail procedure for material transaction
approval and disclosure.



                                                              Comparative Practices

       In Russia, the laws define extraordinary transactions very clearly as well
       as the procedures for approving them. Extraordinary transactions must be
       approved by different governing bodies depending on the value of assets of
       the transactions as illustrated in Table 2.




Material Corporate Transactions                 423                                Extraordinary Transactions

    Value of Assets                              Approving Governing Body

    Between 20% and 50% of the book value        The Board of Directors
    of the company’s assets

    More than 50% of the book value of the       The General Meeting of Shareholders
    company’s assets


The Board of Directors has the authority to approve extraordinary transactions that are
defined as such by the charter.
a)	 Transactions Involving Between 20% and 50% of the Book Value of 	
    Company Assets
	      Unanimous approval of all Board of Directors members is required to approve
       an extraordinary transaction involving assets with a value between 20% (twenty
       percent) and 50% (fifty percent) of the book value of the company’s assets.
	      If the Board of Directors is not able to reach a unanimous decision, it can request
       that the GMS approve the transaction. The Board can do this by a simple majority
       vote of directors participating in the Board meeting, unless the charter or internal
       regulations require a higher percentage of votes. The GMS can then approve the
       transaction with a simple majority vote of participating shareholders.
b)	 Transactions Involving More Than 50% of the Book Value of Company
    Assets
	      The GMS must decide on whether to approve transactions involving more than
       50% (fifty percent) of the book value of company assets by a ¾ (three-fourths)
       majority vote of participating shareholders.
c)	    Required Information for the Decision to Approve an Extraordinary
       Transaction
	      The decisions of the Board of Directors or the GMS must include information on:
       •	 The parties that are involved in the transaction
       •	 Other beneficiaries of the transaction (if any)
       •	 The price of the transaction
       •	 The object of the transaction
       •	 Any other significant terms and conditions related to the extraordinary
          transaction.

4.	 How Shareholders Can Protest Extraordinary 		
	Transactions
ICL does not stipulate in details on how shareholders can protest extraordinary
transactions. ICL only stated that each shareholder is entitled to request the company
that the shareholder’s shares be bought at a fair price in the event where the said
shareholder is dissented to any company activities which deemed as harm to the
shareholder or the company, in the form of the amendment of AoA and assignment
or encumbrance of assets of the company which have a value of more than 50% (fifty
percent) of the company net assets.


                                                                      Best Practices

       If a shareholder does not agree with an extraordinary transaction conducted
       in full compliance with procedural requirements and the law, he/she may:
           •	 Sell his/her shares: Practically, this is only possible if the company’s
              shares are liquid, i.e. there are interested buyers and shareholders are
              able to sell their shares at a fair price; or
           •	 Demand redemption of shares in part or whole: Taking into consideration
              the GMS decision to approve acquisitions and disposal of high-value
              assets of the company is one of the reasons which gives shareholders
              with voting shares the right to dissent and the right to have shares
              redeemed by the company.




5.	 Disclosure Requirements
Disclosure requirements for company undertaking extraordinary transactions are not
regulated in ICL. It is stipulated in the decree of Regulation No. IX.E.2 that company
should disclose its material transaction with value of 20% (twenty percent) to 50%
(fifty percent) of its equity by announcement to the public in at least one national daily
newspaper and submit its supporting documents to OJK not more than 2 (two) business
days after the transaction agreement was signed.

B.	            Affiliated (Related Party) Transactions

Affiliated transactions involve insiders, such as directors, managers, large shareholders,
or parties related to them. Some affiliated transactions have legitimate purposes and
can be conducted fairly, others cannot. Regardless, they are easily abused and warrant
particular attention since they may reduce the value of the company and expropriate
shareholder rights. Legislation contains detailed procedures to discourage insiders from
entering into related party transactions and to help ensure fairness when a related party
transaction does take place.
affiliated transactions not only occur between the company and its directors, managers,
and large shareholders, but more importantly, within groups of companies (holding
structures), where transactions between the parent and subsidiary companies frequently
occur. In other words, related party transactions are traded amongst related parties of
the company.


1.	Definition
According to Regulation No. IX.E.1, affiliated transaction is a transaction undertake by
a company or controlling company with affiliation of the company or affiliation of the
members of the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors, and controlling
shareholders of the company.
For a transaction to be considered an affiliated transaction, each party involved in the
transaction must check whether two conditions are met.

    Company and Connected Persons
	      A number of parties can be defined as related if they play a role in a transaction.
       Such parties are presented in Figure 1.

         The OECD Principles of Corporate Governance provide a general definition
         of related parties, including entities under common control, significant
         shareholders including members of their families and business associates
         and key management personnel.4
         International Accounting Standard (IAS) Number 24 provides a more detailed
         definition and thus parties are considered to be related if one party has the
         ability to control the other party or to exercise significant influence or joint
         control over the other party in making financial and operating decisions.5 A
         party is related to an entity if:

               •	 A single customer, supplier, franchisor, distributor, or general agent
                  with whom an enterprise transacts a significant volume of business
                  merely by virtue of the resulting economic dependence.
       The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Statement No. 57
       finally defines a related party as affiliates of an enterprise, trusts for the
       benefit of employees, owners and their family members, investment entities
       accounted for by the equity method by the firm, management and other large
       shareholders or parties that influence a firm’s policy.



b.	 Related Parties Are Involved in the Transactions
	      For the purposes of defining affiliated transactions, the parties specified in the
       previous section must be involved in the transaction in one of the following
       capacities:
       •	 Act as a transaction party in a legal transaction with the company
       •	 Has a financial relationship with a party to a legal transaction, who has
          concluded a contract with the company or who has financial interests in that
          transaction, which can reasonably be expected to make him/her act contrary to
          the company’s interests
       •	 Is controlled by a party to a legal transaction or a person having a financial
          interest in that legal transaction, so that the mentioned party/person can be
          reasonably expected to get him/her to act contrary to the company’s interests.

       Company (X) concludes a contract with Company (Y) that Company (Y) will
       sell products of Company (X) on-line. Mr. (A) is a member of the Board of
       Directors of Company (X) and is also the General Director of Company (Z),
       which will receive a special discount on products of Company (Y) sold to
       Company (Z) if the transaction between Company (X) and Company (Y) is
       concluded. In such a transaction between Company (X) and Company (Y),
       Mr. (A) is considered a related party who is a beneficiary of the transaction.
       The transaction will be affiliated transaction for Company (X) and will require
       approval. At the same time, it is not a affiliated transaction for Company (Y).

       As illustrated in Mini-Case 1, it is important to note that the same transaction
       can be a affiliated transaction for one company but not for another. In this
       case, only one company needs to approve the transaction as an affiliated
       transaction. Figure 2 depicts components of affiliated transactions, which
       must be present in a transaction.

Material Corporate Transactions                  431                   Affiliated (Related Party) Transactions
To determine whether a transaction is a related party transaction, it is necessary for an
interested party from the left column of Figure 2, to be involved in the transaction as
indicated in the right column of Figure 2. In practice, this means that a company must
create a list of related parties and always check whether any of these parties (1–6 of the
left column) or their affiliated persons (7 of the left column) is involved in each and every
transaction carried out by the company, as mentioned in A-C of the right column.


                                                            Comparative Practices

       Related party transactions are common in the context of groups of
       companies, e.g. in parent-subsidiary relations. If one company dominates
       another, there is a risk that the parent will utilize the subsidiary for its own
       business objectives, without care for the subsidiary’s long-term financial
       viability. In these cases, the creditors and shareholders of both the subsidiary
       and parent may be put at risk often unknowingly.
           •	 The risk for creditors at the subsidiary level is obvious. But the risk is
              present at the parent level as well, as the subsidiary’s insolvency can
              greatly damage the surviving parent.
           •	 Shareholders are also put at risk, although the position of shareholders
              at the subsidiary level is weaker. On the one hand, shareholders at the
              subsidiary level often benefit from being part of the parent’s business.
              While they may have to contribute to the parent’s welfare to their own
              detriment.

2.	 Approving Affiliated Transactions

                                                                                   Best Practices

        There are different means of regulating related party transactions.
        Prohibitions of specific types of transactions are found in the U.K., where
        the U.K. Companies’ Act prohibits directors from entering into certain
        transactions that are deemed detrimental to the company.8 The advantage
        of this first approach is clear, all practitioners know where the boundaries
        are. There is no definitive analysis on the possibilities to circumvent
        the prohibition. The disadvantage is the rule’s lack of flexibility, even
        economically useful transactions may not come into being when the law
        contains a flat prohibition. Additionally, parties may also make great efforts to
        circumvent the rule.
                                                                              Affiliated (Related Party) Transactions

        In some jurisdictions there have been calls to change the approach and foster
        more substantive criteria of fairness. Transactions with conflicting interests
        should always be open to challenge on the basis of unfairness, at least gross
        unfairness. This second approach is frequently found in U.S. law and in the U.K.9



Indonesian Company Law and other regulations including decrees of the Chairman of
OJK do not stipulate in details on the approving of affiliated transactions. ICL and the
OJK Regulation only stated that transaction with value of more than 50% (fifty percent)
of company’s equity should be approved by the GMS.
c.	     Required Information for the Decision to Approve Affiliated Transactions
	       According to Regulation IX.E.1, for affiliated transaction, a company is obliged
        to submit evidence of disclosure and supporting documents to OJK at the latest 2
        (two) business days after transaction occurred. The information includes:
        •	 Description of the transaction (object, value, parties involved and their relation
           with the company and the nature of the affiliation);
        •	 Summary of the appraiser report (identity, purpose, objects, assumptions,

       •	 Explanation, consideration and reasons for the transaction compare with similar

       •	 Company’s business plan, data of the acquired company and another related
          information in the event of acquisition transaction;
       •	 Statements from the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors that
          all material information has been disclosed and not misleading; and
       •	 Summary of report from experts or independent consultants, if necessary.




3.	 Identifying Affiliated Transactions
Any related party transaction that involves conflict of interest and/or the transaction
value exceeding 50% of the company’s equity should be properly approved before it
can be concluded. However, in practice not all transactions follow such procedures.
There are different reasons for this, including the fact that the Board of Commissioners,
Board of Directors and shareholders may not always know whether the transaction
involves related parties, in particular when insiders concealed their affiliation and
personal interest. In such cases, independent commissioners will need to play the lead
role in identifying and disclosing related party transactions. Creating the list of related
parties and their position in the transaction is but one aspect, made difficult by the fact
that most ownership structures remain opaque. The materiality of these transactions is
another important issue. Indeed, while the nature of some related party transactions is
easily identifiable, others are structured in an elaborate manner, involving complicated
off-shore schemes.


                                                                         Best Practices

       The Board of Commissioner’ composition and experience will largely
       determine the success of identifying such related party transactions.,
       Independent commissiones who enjoy an arms-length relationship with
       directors will certainly play a key role in this respect. The External Auditor
       also plays a key supporting role, and the Board of Commissioners and its
       Audit Committee will want to ensure that the company’s External Auditor

       uses the full range of audit procedures to evaluate managerial self-dealings.
       For example, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA)
       Statement of Auditing Standard No. 45, AU Sec. 334 (2001) sets forth criteria
       for identifying material transactions, such as interest free borrowing, asset
       sales that diverge from appraisal value, in-kind transactions, and loans made
       without scheduled terms.



4.	 Disclosure Requirements
Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners members, the President Director or
director and other managers of the company must declare their relevant interests to the
company, including:
   •	 Name and address of the head office, field of business, number and date of the
      issuance of the business registration certificate, place of business registration of
      any enterprise in which they own contributed capital or shares, ratio and period of
      such ownership of contributed capital or shares
   •	 Name and address of the head office, field of business, number and date of the
      issuance of business registration certificate, place of business registration of any
      enterprise in which their related persons jointly own or separately own shares or
      contributed capital of more than 35% (thirty percent) of the charter capital.
The declaration is reported to the GMS and is filed at the head office of the company.
Shareholders have the right to review the contents declared at any time considered
necessary.
In addition, public companies must follow disclosure requirements on related party
transactions as stated in Regulation No. IX.E.2.



                                                                       Best Practices

       Company laws of many countries require persons who are related parties to
       disclose information to the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, internal
       supervisory body and the External Auditor regarding:
          •	 Legal entities in which they, either independently or together with
             affiliated persons, own a certain percentage of voting shares




Material Corporate Transactions             435                   Affiliated (Related Party) Transactions
           •	 Legal entities in which they hold managerial positions
           •	 Pending or planned transactions in which they may be considered a
              related party.
       Moreover, the disclosure of beneficial ownership is an important aspect in
       detecting related party transactions. If the identity of the company’s true
       owners is hidden, then it is difficult, if not impossible, to establish whether the
       parties in the transaction are related (as mentioned in Section C.1.a of this
       Chapter).

       To protect shareholder interests, the Board of Commissioners members
       (especially independent commissioners) should demand that all owners
       of 5% (five percent) and more of common shares comply with the relevant
       disclosure requirements.

       The companies should be required to include the following information
       regarding related party transactions in their annual report:
         •	 A list of related party transactions concluded by the company during the
            reporting year
           •	 Significant terms and conditions of each related party transaction
           •	 The governing body that approved related party transactions.


       In addition, securities regulations should require that companies disclose the
       following information on related party transactions:
          •	 Copies of the minutes of the meeting of the approving body, including
             information on the quorum and the voting results
           •	 The list of persons, with whom transactions may be qualified as related
              party transactions and the list of those persons with whom transactions
              have already been approved by the company
           •	 Information on related parties before the placement starts, in case of an
              open subscription
           •	 The prospectus and quarterly reports must provide information on
              related party transactions.
       Finally, accounting legislation requires companies to disclose information on
       operations with related parties in their accounting documents.

5.	 Invalidation of Affiliated Transactions
A related party transaction which has not been approved in conformity with the law or
for which the proof of being in the company’s best interests at the time of its conclusion
or at the time of its execution has not been presented, is null and void. Furthermore,
OJK has the authority to apply sanction for any violation to the provisions stipulated in
the regulation.10


                                                                       Best Practices

       If the company can seek to invalidate a transaction that was not concluded
       in accordance with its internal approval procedures then this may create
       undue problems for the counterpart. It is recommended to follow the example
       of some western jurisdictions where the company needs to prove that the
       counterpart in the transaction knew or must have known of the irregularity in
       its approval.




6.	 Liability for the Violation of Procedural Requirements
Not with standing any sanctions stipulated under the capital market laws and
regulations, OJK has the right to impose sanction to any violation of Regulation No.
IX.E.2 provisions.


                                                                       Best Practices

       A company may wish to codify its policy regarding related party transactions
       in its company-level corporate governance code, AoA, or internal regulations.
       More importantly, the company may codify a director’s duty to properly
       handle related party transactions, i.e. not to authorize, or permit the company
       to enter into a transaction if he/she has an interest in the transaction and has
       not disclosed this interest.

               Does the company have a written disclosure policy? Does
               the policy fully express the company’s commitment to
               transparency? Is the disclosure policy easily available to
               market participants and other interested parties?

               Does the company fully comply with its legal disclosure
               obligations? What systems are in place to ensure that full
               and timely disclosure of material information occurs?

               Are commissioners and directors fully aware of the personal
               and corporate repercussions of false or incomplete
               disclosure? Do commissioners and directors act accordingly
               to ensure good disclosure?

               Is the company’s ownership structure transparent?

               What steps are being taken to ensure that the company’s
               financial position is communicated clearly to the markets?

               Is the disclosure fair? For example, does the company
               ensure that all investors receive information at the
               same time, not giving special access to a privileged few
               individuals or institutional investors?

               Does the company have a policy on insider trading and does
               it enforce this policy? What systems are in place to manage
               the flow of insider and other sensitive information?

               Does the company appreciate that it is in its own interest to
               make voluntary disclosures to the market? If so, how does it
               ensure the veracity of this information and that its disclosure
               is not merely for marketing or public relations purposes?

               Does the company truly understand the definition of
               commercially sensitive information? Or, does the company
               hide behind protections provided for sensitive information in
               order to withhold important material facts from the markets?

               In the case of joint stock companies with the capital
               participation of foreign shareholders, how does the
               company’s disclosure compare to international disclosure
               requirements, for example, the OECD Principles of Corporate
               Governance?



There are two basic forms of market regulations, substantive rules-based regulations and
disclosure-based regulations. Both regulatory approaches seek to protect shareholders
and provide for fair and stable financial markets. Rules-based regulations set down what
companies can and cannot do, and seeks to establish a wide-reaching set of regulations
that cover a number of potential circumstances. Disclosure-based regulations rely more
heavily upon market mechanisms to punish and reward certain types of corporate
behaviour, and shifts part of the responsibility for protecting investors to market
participants, according to the motto caveat emptor or buyer beware. Disclosure-based
regulations are partly predicated upon the faith that markets are better at policing
corporate misconduct than regulatory agencies, and that disclosure is an effective and
inexpensive substitute for substantive regulations. In practice, the two approaches are




Information Disclosure                    441                          The Chairman’s Checklist
almost always used in combination with one another, though some countries rely more
heavily on disclosure than others.
For disclosure-based regulations to work effectively, a number of elements and
incentives need to work together. These include a proper legal and regulatory
environment, combined with effective enforcement mechanisms such as regulators that
screen financial information for misstatements and courts that provide effective redress.
Independent External Auditors also play an important role, providing assurance to the
markets, as does an active and interested medium that questions company strategies
and communications. Finally, a competent and vigilant Board of Commissioners
is crucial. It is broadly accepted that even the best disclosure system cannot thwart
individuals who are intent upon defrauding a company and its shareholders. Without a
Board of Commissioners that is uniformly intolerant of obfuscation, disclosure cannot
be fully effective.
While disclosure based-regulations may function imperfectly in an emerging financial
market such as in Indonesia, disclosure is, nevertheless, important and is only likely to
grow in importance as Indonesia’s financial markets mature. Among the broad palette
of disclosures, particular importance must be attached to financial and operating
results, related party transactions and ownership structures.

A.	 An Introduction to Information
	Disclosure

1.	 Definition and Rationale
Disclosure is defined as ensuring access to information for all interested parties,
regardless of the purposeof obtaining the information, through a transparent procedure
that guarantees information is easily found and obtained in timely manner.
Timely and accurate disclosure is essential for shareholders, potential investors,
regulatory authorities and other stakeholders. Access to material information helps
shareholders protect their rights and improves the market participants’ ability to
make sound economic decisions. Disclosure makes it possible to assess and oversee
management, as well as to keep management accountable for the company and
shareholders. Disclosure benefits companies since it allows them to demonstrate
accountability towards shareholders, act transparently towards the markets, and
maintain public confidence and trust. Good disclosure policies should also reduce the
cost of capital. Finally, information is also useful for creditors, suppliers, customers and
employees to assess their positions, respond to changes and shape their relations with
companies.
The power of a sound disclosure regime is expressed clearly and eloquently in the
following quote:
     	 “Requiring disclosure of information can be a powerful regulatory tool in company law. It
       enhances the accountability for and the transparency of the company’s governance and its affairs.
       For those who participate in or do business with companies, information is a necessary element
       in order to be able to assess their position and respond to changes that are relevant to them.” 1


2.	 Principles of Disclosure
Indonesia, through its Law on Capital Market has regulated the disclosure of
information and reporting obligation for issuer, public companies and all capital market
supporting professions and institutions.

Information Disclosure                             443                  An Introduction To Information Disclosure
The Law on Capital Market defines the Disclosure Principle as the general guidelines
that obliged public companies and all other capital market member institutions to
disclose within a certain time, material information regarding its businesses or securities
which may impact the investors’ decisions in such securities and/or the securities’ price.2
Furthermore, OJK as the Indonesia capital market supervisory agency had issued
several decisions regarding the disclosure of information obligation for public
companies, namely:
     1.	Decision of the Chairman of OJK Number Kep-82/PM/1996 dated 17
        January 1996 concerning Disclosure Requirements for Certain Shareholders
        (OJKRegulation Number X.M.1);
     2.	Decision of the Chairman of OJK Number Kep-86/PM/1996 dated 24 January
        1996 concerning Disclosure of Information that must be made Public Immediately
        (OJK Regulation Number X.K.1);
     3.	Decision of the Chairman of OJK Number Kep-39/PM/1997 dated
     	 26 December 1997 concerning Documents That Are Open To the Public
     	 (OJK Regulation Number II.A.1);
     4.	Decisionof the Chairman of OJK Number Kep-346/BL/2011 dated
     	 5 Juli 2011 concerning Obligation to Submit Periodic Financial Statements
     	 (OJK Regulation Number X.K.2); and
     5.	Decision of the Chairman of OJK Number Kep-431/BL/2012 dated
     	 1 Agustus 2012 concerning Obligation to submit annual report for Issuers or
     	 Public Companies (OJK Regulation Number X.K.6).
These decisions will be further discussed in Section A subsection 5 of this chapter.

       A more practical expression of what constitutes good disclosure follows in
       these four basic principles:
          1.	 Provided on a regular and timely basis
          2.	 Easily and broadly available
          3.	 Correct and complete
          4.	 Consistent, relevant and documented.

3.	 Confidential Information (Business Secret)
Securities legislation requires publicly held companies to disclose a broad range of
financial and non-financial information. At times, information disclosure required by
regulations can adversely affect a company’s business and financial condition because
of the competitive harm that could result from the disclosure. Despite the fact that
many Indonesian companies often consider business related information commercially
sensitive, in reality competitive harm only arises in a limited number of circumstances.
Some examples of truly sensitive information include pricing terms, technical
specifications and milestone payments. To address potential disclosure hardship,
legislators and regulators develop systems for allowing companies to request confidential
treatment of information.
With regard to protection of undisclosed information, Article 39 of the Trade Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (“TRIPS”) regulates that natural and
legal person shall have the possibility of preventing information lawfully their control
being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others without their consent in a manner
contrary to honest commercial practices. This provision applies for information which:
     1.	is secret in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration and
        assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible to
        persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in
        question;
     2.	has commercial value because it is secret; and
     3.	has been subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by the person
        lawfully in control of the information, to keep it secret.
As one of the countries that have ratified the TRIPS Agreement through Law Number
7 of 1994 concerning the Ratification of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade
Organization, Indonesia has the obligation to implement the provisions of the TRIPS
Agreement, in this case specifically related to business secrets. Following the ratification,
the Government of the Republic of Indonesia enacted the Law on Trade Secret dated
20 December 2000.
Under the Law on Trade Secret, trade secret means information in the field of
technology and/or business that is known by the public and has economic values as
it is useful in business activities, and the confidentiality of which is maintain by its
owner.3 Constitute as trade secret under this law are methods of production, methods
of processing (preparation), methods of selling, or other information in the field of

technology and/or business that has economic values and is not known by the public
in general.4 Trade secret which shall be given protection, must meet the following
characteristics:5
     1.	the information is confidential in a way that such information is only known by
        a certain people or such information is not known by the public in general;
     2.	the information has economic values in a way that the confidentiality of the
        information can be used to run commercial activities or business or can improve
        the benefit economically; and
     3.	the secrecy of which is maintained with necessary efforts in a way that the
        owner or the parties that control the information have taken necessary and
        appropriate efforts.



                                                                       Best Practices

       Companies should be clear on what truly constitutes confidential information
       and should not interpret the broad definitions provided for by law so widely
       as to withhold relevant information from investors. To guide practices with
       respect to commercially sensitive information, companies are well advised
       to develop written policies and procedures, and define what should be
       considered confidential in their internal regulations. For example, they can
       consider personal data as confidential information, and forbid the collection,
       storage, usage and dissemination of private information without the person’s
       consent, unless otherwise provided by a court decision.

4.	 Inside Information and Insider Dealing
Insider trading encompasses both legal and prohibited activity. Insider trading takes
place legally, every day, when corporate insiders buy or sell shares in their own
companies within the confines of company policy, law and regulations.
There is also an illegal variety of insider dealing. It is the dealing that takes place when
those with access to insider information use their knowledge to reap profits or avoid
losses on the stock market. Investors lacking access to insider information often pay the
costs of insider dealing.
Another, and far greater, cost of insider dealing is the damage done to the credibility
of securities markets. One of the main reasons that capital is easily available in the
world’s most successful stock markets is that investors largely trust them to be fair. The
common belief in some countries that privileged investors should be allowed to profit
from their access to insider information may explain, in part, relatively low public
share ownership in these countries. Governments cannot afford to ignore insider
dealing if they hope to promote an active securities market and attract international
investment. The same holds true for a Board of Commissioners that wish to protect
shareholders and attract investment.
Insider information is defined as any information of a precise nature relating to a
public company, which is not made public, and which can, directly or indirectly, have
significant influence on the trade of the securities or on the prices of the company on
the market. An insider is a person who possesses inside information knowing, or ought
to have known, that it is inside information. Under the elucidation of Article 95 of
the Law on Capital Market, individuals with access to insider information particularly
include:
   a.	a commissioner, director or employee of an issuer or public company;
   b.	a substantial shareholder of an issuer or public company;
   c.	 an individual, who due to his position or profession, or due to a business

information, is prohibited from buying or selling securities of the issuer or public

company.6 An insider is also prohibited to influence a person to buy or sell the
securities in question, providing inside information to a person he has reason to believe
may use such information to buy or sell the securities in question.7
Indonesian legislation also recognises criminal responsibility for insider information
abuses. Namely, persons who may be considered insiders have an obligation to
keep the insider information as a business secret and its disclosure is sanctioned as a
criminal offence.



                                                                       Best Practices

       Disclosure of insider information may substantially affect the market value
       of shares and other securities of a company. Therefore, persons who have
       access to insider information may not use it to execute transactions, nor
       may they transfer insider information to a third party. Illegal use of insider
       information can damage shareholder interests and adversely affect the
       financial position and reputation of the company as well as securities
       markets overall. The company should have a written insider dealing policy in
       place and vigorously enforce it. The Internal Auditor of the company should
       monitor whether directors, managers and other officers comply with the law,
       regulations and internal rules on insider dealing.




5.	 Disclosure in Listed and Public Non-listed Companies
Disclosure requirements are different for publically listed companies, public (non-listed)
companies and private joint stock companies. Private joint stock companies usually
need only to comply with minimal disclosure requirements and are not subject to the
reporting obligations determined by regulations governing the securities market. More
stringent rules apply to listed and public companies. Tight regulation of information
disclosure among listed companies is needed because of the greater impact of
potential fraud when a company may have many thousands of shareholders. Given the
importance of capital markets in a modern economy, governments are, understandably,
keen on ensuring the integrity of the financial system. The increased number of

funds available on capital markets.
The regulatory framework in Indonesia requires public companies to disclose
information in accordance with the Decisions of Chairman of OJK as shown below:
As already mentioned, public companies’ reporting obligations are greater than for non-
public companies.

          Chapter 2, Section A.2.



6.	 Disclosure Versus Transparency
Disclosure is sometimes confused with transparency. Unfortunately, these two terms are
frequently and erroneously used interchangeably. While disclosure and transparency
would at first glance, appear to be the same, they are not. Companies may disclose an
enormous amount of information that is of no particular value to the users of such
information. Important pieces can be withheld. Disclosure can be irrelevant or, worse,
manipulated in such a way as to conceal the true picture of the state of the enterprise.
For example, while many companies may disclose their ownership as required by law,
the true owners and the extent of their control often remain hidden behind complex
legal structures such as special purpose entities, off-shore holding companies and trusts.
A strong disclosure regime that promotes real transparency is a pivotal feature of
market-based monitoring of companies and is central to shareholders’ ability to exercise
their ownership rights on an informed basis.


7.	 Personal Liability for Non-Disclosure
As a rule, companies are liable for damages caused to shareholders and third parties
by providing false, incomplete or distorted information. Beside the company, all other
people who participated in the preparation of disclosed information are liable for the
damage caused by the publication of incomplete and inaccurate information. The
additional condition of their responsibility is that they knew or by the nature of their
work had to know that information was inaccurate or incomplete (for example, the
President Director, the Chief Accountant or the person fulfilling this function, the
External Auditor). They are jointly and severally liable with the issuer for any damage
caused to investors because of untruthful, incomplete, and/or misleading information.
If investors believe that they have suffered damages, they can file claims with a court.

Regarding violation of information disclosure regulations, violating individuals and
organizations shall be subject to either of the following two principal sanctioning
forms cautions and fines. Under the Law on Capital Market, violation of information
disclosure shall be subject to imprisonment for a maximum of ten years and a maximum
fine of IDR15,000,000,000.00 (fifteen billion Rupiah).8

B.	            Disclosure Items
The OECD Principles suggest that:
     “…timely and accurate disclosure be made on all material matters regarding the corporation,
       including the financial situation, performance, ownership, and governance of the company.” 9
The key concept that underlies the OECD’s recommendation is the concept of
materiality. Material information is information the omission or misstatement of could
affect economic decisions taken by the users of information. Materiality may also be
defined as a characteristic of information or an event that makes it sufficiently important
to have an impact on the company’s share price.
The application of the materiality concept allows companies to avoid overly detailed
disclosure that is ultimately irrelevant to shareholders. For example, damage to
IDR130 million worth of paper in a large, publicly traded company is, clearly, of little
importance to the investor. It may, on the other hand, be material to a small family-
owned print shop. Materiality is, consequently, a relative concept that depends on
the context. It is often difficult to define with great precision in practice. Companies
and auditors may sometimes apply certain numerical thresholds (for example, 5%
of earnings) to simplify its application. However, these thresholds can only serve as a
starting point for a more rigorous application of the concept of materiality.
The concept of materiality is also recognised by Indonesian regulations which, in
addition to mandatory, itemised information, prescribe all other matters relevant for
the understanding of the legal, financial and profit situation of the securities issuer
as contents of the document intended for informing the investment public. Thus,
the assessment of circumstances, for example, “significant litigations” or “other
circumstances that may significantly affect the price of securities” is left to companies
themselves. The availability of that assessment should be provided to the public.
According to the Decision of the Chairman of OJK Number Kep-86/PM/1996
(Regulation No. X.K.1), public companies whose registration statement has become
effective, should disclose to OJK and make public any material information regarding
events that could affect the investors’ decision or the value of the companies’ securities,
to OJK and public, as soon as possible, at the latest by the second working day after the
event occurs. Constitute as event, information or material fact are as follow:

       The OECD Principles call for disclosure of all material information in the
       following areas:

           •	   Company objectives

       This list is comprehensive, if general. The Technical Committee of the
       International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has developed
       more detailed, high-level principles for on-going disclosure and material
       development reporting for public entities. These principles are:10
           •	 Materiality of information for an investor’s investment decision
           •	 Disclosure on a timely basis, immediate or periodic
           •	 Simultaneous and identical disclosure in all jurisdictions where the
              entity is public
           •	 Dissemination of information by using efficient, effective and timely
              means
           •	 Disclosure criteria fairness, without misleading or deceptive content and
              containing no material omissions
           •	 Equal treatment of disclosure, no selective disclosure to investors and
              others before public disclosure
           •	 Compliance with disclosure obligations.




Indonesian legislation covers these essentials in considerable detail. The following sub-
sections discuss Indonesia requirements and disclosure practices with respect to the
above-mentioned OECD disclosure items as stipulated in the Decision of the Chairman
of OJK Number Kep-346/BL/2011 (Regulation No. X.K.2) and Decision of the
Chairman of OJK Number Kep-431/BL/2012 (Regulation No. X.K.6).

1.	 Financial and Operating Results
a.	 Presenting Financial Information
	      Information about financial results, performance, the situation and operations
       of the company is of utmost importance for shareholders, potential investors,
       creditors and other stakeholders. The following list constitutes the most typical
       forms of, and additions to, financial reporting:
       •	 The balance sheet provides a snapshot of the company’s assets, capital
          and liabilities on a particular date. To skilled analysts, it provides important
          information on, inter alia, the degree of risk an investment in the company
          carries or the company’s ability to pay creditors.
       •	 The income statement provides information on the company’s performance
          during a specified period of time. Income statements may be organized in a
          number of different ways. According to internationally recognized practice,
          income statements must show 1) revenues or sales, 2) the results of operating
          activities, 3) financing costs, 4) income from associates and joint ventures, 5)
          taxes, 6) profit or loss from ordinary activities and 7) net profit or loss. The
          income statement demonstrates business sustainability.
       •	 The cash flow statement illustrates a company’s sources and uses of cash.
          It lists all changes affecting cash in operations, investments and financing.
          For example, net operating income increases cash, the purchase of a plant
          is an investment that decreases cash and the issuance of shares or bonds is a
          financing activity that increases cash.
       •	 The explanatory notes to the financial statements help explain the
          company’s financial statements by providing important details and insights into
          how the company prepared its accounts. It also briefly describes features of the
          company’s activities, its main performance indicators and factors that affected
          the company’s financial results, as well as decisions on financial statements
          and distribution of net profit reviews. This refers to any relevant information
          that would enable users to receive a complete and objective picture of the
          company’s financial condition, financial results for the reporting period and
          any changes in its financial position. The notes to the financial statements must
          specifically state the contents of related party transactions in accordance with
          the Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards (Peraturan Standar Akuntansi
          Keuangan - PSAK).

Furthermore, this part contains, when needed, the statement of changes in owners’ equity that
shows all changes in the AoA, additional paid-in and reserve capital, as well as retained
earnings. In addition, it provides information on changes in statutory and additional
funds and briefs on net assets.


                                                                             Best Practices

      International practice also calls for the Management’s Discussion and Analysis
      (MD&A), which provides management’s view of the performance and future
      prospects of the company. The MD&A, which is typically disclosed in the
      company’s annual report, should:
         1)	 Complement as well as supplement financial statements
         2)	 Have a forward-looking orientation
         3)	 Focus on long-term value creation
         4)	 Integrate long- and short-term perspectives
         5)	 Present information that is significant to the decision-making needs of users
         6)	 Embody the qualities of reliability, comparability, consistency, relevance
             and understandability.
      The MD&A presents a more analytical and qualitative view than the rest of the
      financial statements.



Finally, the External Auditor’s report with conclusions enable an independent External
Auditor to express an opinion on whether or not the company’s financial statements are
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an identified financial reporting
framework and whether they are reliable. This provides shareholders, managers,
employees and market participants with an independent opinion about the company’s
financial position and, if performed properly, should attest to the accuracy of the
statements. The annual financial statements of all public and listed companies must be
audited by an independent and eligible audit firm Annual audited financial statements
must be submitted for approval by the GMS.11

          For more information on the role of the External Auditor, see Chapter 14, Section B.

b.	 Preparing Financial Information
	      Regulatory framework regulating financial reporting must recognizes the following
       basic concepts and principles:
       •	 Accrual based accounting, according to which revenues and expenses are
          booked over time and not at the point of payment or receipt of funds. This
          requires that sales and expenses relating or pertaining to a particular period
          be recorded in the period of occurrence irrespective of when the amount was
          received or paid.
       •	 Going concern assumption, i.e. that financial statements are prepared on
          the assumption that the company is operating and will continue to operate for
          the foreseeable future and that it has neither the intention nor the necessity of
          liquidation or of materially curtailing the scale of its operations. The going
          concern assumption is a fundamental principle in the preparation of financial
          statements. For this reason, it is recognized that management has a responsibility
          to assess the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. However,
          management’s assessment may not always involve detailed analysis, particularly
          when there is a history of profitable operations and ready access to financial
          resources.
       •	 Consistency, which states that the presentation and classification of items in
          the financial statements shall be retained from one period to the next unless a
          change is justified either by a change in circumstances or a requirement of a
          new accounting standard.
       •	 Separation of assets and liabilities, meaning that the assets (fixed and
          current) and liabilities (debt payables and equity of owners) of the company
          shall be separated from those of its owners and other organizations.
	      In addition, company accounting policies should ensure:
       •	 Completeness of information disclosure, meaning that information
          contained in the company’s financial statements should disclose all material
          business facts and results (actually and potentially) influencing economic
          decision-making by the users of these financial statements from the standpoints
          of materiality of such information and the cost of its preparation (an omission
          can cause information to be false or misleading and thus unreliable and
          imperfect from the standpoint of its relevance).




Information Disclosure                      456                                 Disclosure Items
       •	 Timeliness, i.e. the company needs to publish reports quickly, as up-to-date
          information is of much more value to users than older information that may
          have been superseded by events. For companies which financial report is audited
          by a public accounting, such reports shall be publicized not later than 7 (seven)
          days after they are ratified by the GMS12
       •	 Conservatism, requiring a company to make prudent and deliberate
          accounting choices and estimate when future events would have negative
          impacts on its financial condition.
       •	 Substance over form, meaning that for the faithful presentation of
          information in the financial statements it is necessary that transactions and
          events are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and
          economic reality (which should prevail) and not merely their legal form.
       •	 Balance between benefits and cost, which, given the complexity and
          breadth of certain reporting requirements, allows smaller companies to tailor
          their financial information to be cost-effective. This concept, however, should
          not be used to deny information to users. The presumption must be that
          information required by law and accounting standards should be provided to
          users unless there is a clear indication that the cost outweighs the benefit.
       •	 Matching. Expenses are matched to related revenues in determining earnings
          for the period.
Legislation, accounting and other standards will determine the specific content and
format of financial statements. Taken together and compared over time, the financial
statements should provide a well-rounded picture of the company’s operations and
financial position.

       If companies plan to access international capital markets or, simply to
       improve upon the quality of financial reporting, they will need to prepare
       financial statements according to an internationally accepted body of
       accounting standards. The most recognized standards are the International

       Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
       Principles (U.S. GAAP).13
       In addition to standard financial reporting according to the PSAK, a company
       may consider reporting in accordance with IFRS for the following reasons:
           •	 IFRS have clear economic logic and provide better information to
              the company’s management than the current Indonesian accounting
              standards do, allowing for a better comparison with a peer group of
              international companies.
           •	 There is global convergence of national standards towards IFRS.
           •	 All public companies in Europe with consolidated accounts were
              required to present their consolidated financial statements using IFRS as
              of 2005.14
           •	 Unification of standards will allow users of financial statements to
              “read” financial statements under common rules.
           •	 Implementing IFRS could help Indonesian companies decrease
              expenses in attracting investment.
       Applying IFRS typically has the following impact on the balance sheet of a
       standard Indonesian company:
           •	 The need to prepare consolidated financial statements Inventories
              can no longer be generally carried at cost, but at the lower cost or net
              realizable value
           •	 A significant change in the value of fixed assets
           •	 Use of a fair market valuation rather than the historical cost approach
              for many assets and liabilities
           •	 The appearance of new financial instruments, derivatives in particular
           •	 Recognition of assets and liabilities, the control over which does not
              stem directly from participation in equity.

       Additional items are included in the income statement, such as fair value
       adjustment for financial instruments and recognition or recovery of asset
       impairment, amongst others. Disclosures also become more informative and
       user-oriented.
       Depending on where the company intends to list, statements will likely need
       to be prepared according to one of these two standards.



c.	    Disclosing Financial Information
	      Financial information will typically be presented in different forms and at different
       times throughout the financial year. Financial and operating results will appear
       in the prospectus, annual report, annual, semi-annual and quarterly financial
       statements.
	      It is determined by Article 68 paragraph (5) of the ICL that all companies are
       obliged to disclose the annual audited financial statements no later than 7 (seven)
       days after ratified by the GMS. The date of completion of annual financial
       statements shall be no later than 6 (six) months from the last day of the annual
       accounting period in accordance with the ICL15. The annual financial statements
       must be in Bahasa Indonesia (accompanied by English translation if applicable),
       must also be disclosed in the publication and on the electronic information site of
       the company, and must be archived at the head office of the company to enable
       investors to refer to such items. Finally, all the contents and information about the
       annual financial statements must be disclosed on the information disclosure media
       of the OJK and IDX (in the case of a public company) and concurrently the full
       text of the auditors’ report (as a part of the audited financial statements) must be
       published at least in one edition of a nationwide newspaper in Bahasa Indonesia.16
	      Public companies must disclose additional financial information as follows:
       •	 Semi-annual financial statements  must be disclosed within 30 days from the end
          of the second quarter of each year if not attach by the accountant report, at
          the latest at the end of the second month after the date of semi-annual financial
          report, if supported by an accountant report for limited audit and 90 days if
          audited report from accountant is required.17

       Companies should disclose all material information and do so in a timely basis
       and in such a manner as to make the information as clear and understandable
       to users as possible. Companies should adhere to the spirit of the law, not
       just the letter and should not limit themselves to the minimum standards of
       statutory disclosure.



d.	 Financial Information in Groups of Companies
	      Complete disclosure of intra-group relations, transactions and their financial
       terms, and consolidated accounts is a crucial pre-requisite to make the group’s
       functions transparent.



                                                                               Best Practices

       When preparing consolidated accounts, companies should follow uniform
       accounting policies for the parent and its subsidiaries or, if this is not
       practicable, the company must disclose that fact and the proportion of items
       in the consolidated financial statements to which different policies have been
       applied. In the parent’s separate financial statements, subsidiaries may be
       shown at cost, at re-evalued amounts, or using the equity method. According
       to IFRS, a company’s consolidated accounts should include, inter alia:18
           •	 The name, ownership and voting percentages for each significant
              subsidiary
           •	 The reason for not consolidating a subsidiary

           •	 The nature of the relationship if the parent does not own more than 50%
              of the voting power of a consolidated subsidiary
           •	 The nature of the relationship if the parent owns more than 50% of the
              voting power of a subsidiary excluded from consolidation
           •	 The effect of acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries during the period
           •	 In the parent’s separate financial statements, a description of the
              method used to account for subsidiaries.



Indonesian regulations also impose an obligation to prepare consolidated financial
statements and to make separate reports on the companies that are the subject of
consolidation. This data also presents an integral part of the required contents of the
prospectus and are subject to disclosure obligations in the process of the mandatory
informing of the public by the company. In that regard, the regulation on reporting
stipulates special obligations in preparing the excerpt of the financial statement for legal
entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, which relate to the basic data
on the companies that are the subject of consolidation and to their individual financial
statements.


2.	 Company Objectives
It is important for markets, shareholders and other stakeholders to be aware of the
company’s objectives. The communication of company objectives can be either in
response to legal requirements or it can be voluntary.


                                                                       Best Practices

       Comparative legislation requires that company objectives (such as the
       issuance of securities, acquisition plans, replacement and sales of assets,
       or research and development) be disclosed in the prospectus. In addition,
       quarterly (semi-annual) reports must contain forward-looking information
       including sources of revenue, plans for new production procedures,
       expansion or reduction of production, new product development, substitution




Information Disclosure                        461                                   Disclosure Items
       of old products, modernization or repair of fixed assets and modification of
       the types of company activities. In addition, the annual report must outline the
       company’s position in the industry, priority areas of activity and development
       trends.


Voluntary disclosure may cover issues such as the company’s policies concerning
corporate governance, business ethics, environmental issues and other public policy
commitments. This information can help to properly evaluate the prospective
performance of the company, its relationship with various stakeholders and communities
in which it operates and the steps that the company has taken to implement its
objectives. As with other types of disclosure, the quality of information provided to the
public is greatly enhanced by adhering to a widely accepted standard.19



                                                                               Best Practices

       Companies may choose to voluntarily disclose their objectives in its AoA,
       company-level corporate governance code, and/or ethics code and annual
       report. Regardless of the form, companies should ensure that this information
       is readily accessible to the public, for example, on their websites.




3.	 Major Share Ownership and Voting Rights
a.	 Major Share Ownership
	      It is important that shareholders are informed about company ownership
       structures to understand their rights, role and authority in governing the company
       and influence its policy. Depending on the size of ownership, shareholders have
       various degrees of influence over decision-making in a company. Legislation
       provides greater rights to shareholders with larger holdings.

                 For more information on the rights of shareholders according to their ownership
                 percentage, see Chapter 7.

19	 For a general discussion of non-financial disclosure, see the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational
    Enterprises. See the OECD website at www.oecd.org or consult the Guidelines directly under: www.oecd.
    org/dataoecd/62/58/2438852.pdf.




Information Disclosure                             462                                      Disclosure Items
Clearly, it is vital to know who is in a position to make (or influence) decisions within
a company. For this reason, full information on the amount of the issued capital, its
increases and decreases, the rights attached to shares of different types and classes, and
the number of shareholders is crucial.
Shareholders with large stakes have the opportunity to exercise control over decision-
making in a company. In practice, lower thresholds may suffice to exercise control over
a company. In particular, in companies with dispersed ownership it is not necessary for a
shareholder to hold the percentages of votes since the quorum for decisions of the GMS
is counted based on votes cast. Since it is rare for all shareholders to vote at the GMS, a
lesser percentage of shares usually provide the same degree of influence. In any event,
the larger the ownership stake, the greater the ease with which shareholders can control
the company.
Under Indonesian regulations, public companies must disclose periodically on every
principle shareholder (i.e. who own more than 5% of the total voting right shares20),
including the following subjects:
   •	 Full name, date of birth (as for individual shareholders)
   •	 Contact address
   •	 Occupation (as for individual shareholders), areas of business (as for institutional
      shareholders)
   •	 Number and percentage of its ownership in the company
   •	 Changes of ownership of principle shareholders
   •	 Information that may cause big changes in terms of shareholders of the company
   •	 The principle shareholders’ increase, decrease or pledge of company’s stocks

In addition, public companies shall be responsible to report quarterly to IDX and semi-
annually as well as annually on the changes of shareholders ownership in accordance
with the regulations of the OJK.

Information Disclosure                      463                                  Disclosure Items
                                                                          Best Practices

       Companies seeking to disclose their ownership structure may wish to follow
       examples under U.S. and EU regulations. U.S. regulations define a beneficial
       owner as any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract
       arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares:
           •	 Voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of
              such a security; and/or
           •	 Investment power that includes the power to dispose, or direct the
              disposition of such security.
       U.S. securities law states that any person who is directly or indirectly the
       beneficial owner of more than 5% of any equity security of a class, shall
       notify the issuer and each exchange where the security is traded of such
       acquisition within 10 days, as well as of any increase or decrease by 1%
       of more.21 If the beneficial owner acts in concert with other institutions or
       persons, their names and the relationship with the beneficial owner must be
       disclosed.
       The EU Transparency Directive of 2004 provides a framework for disclosure.22
       In summary:
           1.	 Article 9 stipulates that investors must disclose the acquisition or
               disposal of major shareholdings in public companies, based on
               thresholds starting at 5% and continuing at intervals of 5% until 30% of
               voting rights, or charter capital or both.
           2.	 Article 11(2) shortens the reporting obligation of the acquirer to the
               company and the competent regulatory authority from seven calendar
               days to five business days on the one hand and, on the other, of the
               company to the public from nine calendar days to three business days.
           3.	 Article 2 extends the definition of “security holder” to include custodians
               and those holding securities for clearing and settlement purposes.

             4.	 Finally, Article 11(5) extends notification requirements to various classes
                 of shares, such as warrants and convertible bonds if the holdings reach
                 or fall below the thresholds defined in Article 9.
       Six member states have already introduced this directive by law or
       regulation. In addition, the EU Takeover Bids Directive’s Article 10 regulates
       transparency issues, including the disclosure of beneficial ownership
       structures. Public companies in the EU are thus required to disclose
       information in their annual report on, inter alia:
       1.	     The structure of their capital
       2.	     Any restrictions on the free transferability of securities
       3.	     Significant direct and indirect shareholdings (including pyramid
               schemes and cross-shareholdings)
       4.	     The holders of any securities with special control rights
       5.	     The system of control of any employee share scheme where the control
               rights are not exercised directly by employees
       6.	     Restrictions on voting rights
       7.	     Shareholder agreements that are known to the company
       8.	     The rules governing the appointment and replacement of Board of
               Directors members
       9.	     Significant agreements made by the company that take effect upon a
               change of control
       10.	 Compensation agreements between the company and its directors in the
            case of a successful takeover bid.



Indonesian companies wishing to comply with good corporate governance practices
should disclose their ownership structure, including beneficial owners, in a transparent
manner.

b.	 Indirect Control
	      Shareholders owning less than the majority of shares can exercise indirect control
       over the company through pyramid structures and/or cross shareholdings.
       Relationships with related parties may also alter the control structure of the
       company.



                                                                              Best Practices

       Information on indirect ownership, related parties, and related party
       transactions should be fully disclosed, specifically in the annual, quarterly
       and material events reports and other notifications to regulators or creditors.


          For more information on the procedure to disclose the company’s related parties, see Section
          C.5 of this Chapter and for more information on the disclosure requirements for related party
          transactions, see Chapter 12, Section C.5.

c.	    Shareholder Agreements and Voting Caps
	      Shareholder agreements and voting caps can also impact on control.
	      Shareholder (voting) agreements typically oblige parties to vote as a block and
       may give first-refusal rights for the purchase of shares to another shareholder.
       Shareholder agreements can cover many issues including which candidates
       to nominate for the Board of Directors or the selection of the Chairman.
       Shareholder agreements are clearly of material interest to shareholders. While
       difficult to detect, companies should make reasonable efforts to obtain information
       about the existence of shareholder agreements and to disclose such information to
       all shareholders. In principle, parties to shareholder agreements should voluntarily
       disclose this information themselves.
	      Voting caps limit the number of votes that a shareholder may cast regardless of the
       number of shares he/she actually possesses. As such, caps go against the principle
       of one share, one vote and control that is proportional to ownership. Voting caps
       are often used to either entrench the position of existing controlling shareholders
       or management, and are rarely supported by good faith investors. The ICL has
       implicitly prohibited voting caps by adopting the mandatory one share, one vote
       principle.

4.	 Information on Commissioners and Directors
a.	 Personal Data
	      Investors and shareholders should have access to relevant information relating
       to capability and qualifications of the Board of Commissioners and Board of
       Directors members to evaluate their experience and qualifications. Educational
       background, current occupation and professional experience of commissioners and
       directors should be disclosed and readily accessible to interested parties. It is also
       important that shareholders and investors have information about any (existing
       or potential) conflicts of interest that may affect the independence and decision-
       making capacity of the Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors. The
       right to access information is most important, that may protect shareholders in the
       market with the information asymmetry.
	      Shareholders should also be able to assess whether or not Board of Commissioners
       and Board of Directorsmembers dedicate sufficient time to their duties and
       properly carry out their responsibilities. Accordingly, companies should disclose all
       the meeting attendance records.




                                                                        Best Practices

       Legal disclosure requirements clearly fall short of best practices. According
       to the best practices, a company should also disclose the following
       information in its annual report:
          •	 Other key officials of the company, including their curriculum vitae
           •	 Information about all transactions between these other key officials and
              the company
           •	 Age, profession, employment and citizenship of each Board of Directors
              member, as well as all other positions, the date of initial appointment
              and the current term of appointment
           •	 Information on all claims filed in courts (or arbitration tribunals) against
              Board of Directors members and executive directors and/or the General
              Director.

b.	Remuneration
	      Incentive remuneration schemes are common in many countries and come in
       many varieties. Few companies have such arrangements that are identical to one
       another.
	      Executive remuneration plans are usually put in place in an effort to motivate
       executives, and better align their interests with the interests of shareholders.
       They normally include performance based bonuses. Incentive remuneration
       schemes may not be the most effective way of alleviating inherent conflicts of
       interests and, in any event, should always be subject to careful legal and financial
       examination and the approval of both the Board of Commissioners and the GMS.
       Remuneration plans for non-executive directors will differ considerably.
	      In Indonesia, the remuneration granted to each individual member of the Board
       of Commissioners and the Board of Directors over the relevant financial year
       should be disclosed as a separate item in the annual financial statements of the
       company and shall be reported to the GMS at its annual meeting.



                                                                                Best Practices

       Shareholders should be provided with a clear and comprehensive overview
       of the company’s remuneration policy. Disclosure of information on the
       remuneration policy allows shareholders and investors to assess the main
       parameters and rationale for the different components of the remuneration
       package and the linkage between remuneration and performance. Such
       disclosure aims to strengthen the company’s accountability to shareholders.
       The remuneration policy should be part of an independent remuneration
       report and/or be included in the annual financial statements and annual
       report or the notes to the annual financial statements of the company. The
       remuneration policy should also be posted on the company’s website.24
       Companies should not only be transparent with respect to the levels of
       remuneration but also to the methods for determining remuneration. The
       criteria for determining the amount of remuneration for Board of Directors

       members, the President Director and/or Executive Board members — as
       well as the total amount of remuneration paid or to be paid depending on
       the results of the reporting year — must be disclosed in the annual report.
       The methods for determining remuneration are usually an integral part of the
       remuneration policy.
       A large majority of EU member states have introduced high disclosure
       standards with regard to the remuneration of individual Board of Directors
       members and key executives, putting shareholders in a better position to
       assess the extent to which an individual’s remuneration is justified in view
       of his/her responsibility and/or performance. It also allows shareholders to
       hold executives and Board of Directors members fully accountable for the
       performance of their duties.
           •	 With respect to executive remuneration plans, shareholders and
              investors should have sufficient information to properly assess
              their costs and benefits to the company and the relations between
              the performance of the company, on the one hand, and the level of
              executive remuneration, on the other.
           •	 At some point, the independence of non-executive directors may be
              compromised if they earn a significant amount of their total income
              from their Board activities. Some countries have monetary thresholds
              that serve as convenient “rules of thumb” or warning signals. While
              numerical thresholds may be a reasonable starting point, judgments
              on independence will, of course, require a much more sophisticated
              analysis. The disclosure of a non-executive director’s remuneration
              remains critical in order to judge the extent to which his independence
              may be compromised.

          Section H and Chapter 5, Section G, respectively.

5.	 Material Foreseeable Risk Factors
Risk (along with return) is one of the most important considerations for any investor.
Risks may include particular industry risks as well as political, commodities, derivatives,
environmental, market, interest and currency fluctuation risks. In short, risk is an
omnipresent feature of business activity.
Risk is, by its very nature, forward looking and extremely difficult to quantify.
Nevertheless, specific industry, financial and legal risks as well as other material risks all
need to be disclosed in prospectuses.


6.	 Employees and Other Stakeholders
Strictly speaking, most of the information on employees and other stakeholders may
not be “material” according to the accounting or financial definitions of the term. On
the other hand, information about the company’s employees, creditors and suppliers,
as well as the company’s relationship with local communities can be “material” to other
constituencies. Employees are also users of information, and disclosure helps them to
make better employment decisions, protect themselves in the workplace and participate
in other aspects of company life. Stakeholder disclosure is becoming increasingly
common as an issue of interest and attention worldwide.


                                                                       Best Practices

       While some forms of stakeholder disclosure are required by law, it is good
       practice to provide stakeholders with other relevant information. For example,
       stakeholder disclosure might include health protection for employees,
       safety conditions in the workplace and environmental or community impact
       statements.




7.	 Corporate Governance Structures and Policies
When assessing a company’s governance structure, market participants may want
to obtain information on the company’s governing bodies, including the division
of authority between shareholders, commissioners and directors, as well as on the
company’s corporate governance policy, its commitment to corporate governance
principles and compliance mechanisms.

The AoA is the document that sets the rules and procedures of the company’s
governance system. It is a fundamental document of the company that is to be made
publicly available. Company-level corporate governance codes also serve to highlight
general corporate governance concepts and structures. Internal regulations provide
more detailed guidance on processes.
Regulation X.K.6 requires that a public company must disclose information on its
corporate governance practices in the AGM, annual reports, including the following
contents:
   a.	Name, position and a brief description of every member of the Board of Directors
      and the Board of Commissioners and its structure
   b.	Actions performed by the Board of Directors and the Board of Commissioners
   c.	 Actions performed by independent members of the Board of Commissioners
   d.	Actions performed by the committees of the Board of Commissioners
   e.	 Plans to enhance the efficiency of corporate governance
   f.	 Remuneration and expenses for the members of the Board of Directors, the Board
       of Commissioners
   g.	 Information on transactions of company shares by members of the Board of
       Directors, and the Board of Commissioners, major shareholders as well as other
       transactions by Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners members and
       related persons
   h.	Number of Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners members who have
      attended training courses on corporate governance
   i.	 Matters which are not in compliance with the CG Regulations, causes and
       approaches to overcome.



                                                                  Best Practices

       It is necessary to disclose information about corporate conflicts resulting
       from improper implementation by the company of those corporate governance
       recommendations that the company declared binding upon itself in one
       form or another. Also, companies must adhere to the “comply or explain”
       principle in the application of accepted corporate governance rules and
       recommendations, and that respect, explain in their reports the reasons for
       possible deviations from their implementation in practice.




Information Disclosure                    471                                Disclosure Items
a.	 Commitment to Corporate Governance
	      Markets are keenly interested in understanding the level of a company’s
       commitment to good governance practices. They wish to determine whether
       a company sees governance as a public relations, “box-ticking,” or “window-
       dressing” exercise, or whether the company is in fact willing “to do right” by
       shareholders and to institute and implement real change as necessary and
       appropriate. While good disclosure, in and of itself, is not sufficient to consistently
       and uniformly ensure good corporate governance, it is clearly one way of
       demonstrating the commitment a company is willing and able to make to its
       shareholders and to its other stakeholders.
b.	 Corporate Governance Structures
	      Companies must describe their governance structures, including the authority of
       each governing body and internal control mechanisms, in their prospectus and
       reports. Also, companies should regulate and make publicly available through
       their internal documents the procedures for convening and conducting the GMS
       and make decisions made at the GMS publicly available through material events
       reports.



                                                                        Best Practices

       Companies should disclose information about changes in the identity of (or
       contractual arrangements with) the company’s External Auditor and other
       externally engaged persons that provide the company with material impact
       services on the company’s business operations (e.g. lawyer’s offices engaged
       for representation in major litigations).



c.	    Corporate Governance Policies
	      Companies should disclose their corporate governance policies and provide
       interested users with easy and inexpensive access to this information.




Information Disclosure                        472                                  Disclosure Items

       The CG best practices recommend companies develop disclosure policies
       that should be approved by the Board of Directors and be binding upon the
       company. Some of the provisions suggested for inclusion in company policies
       include:
          •	 List of information the company intends to disclose
           •	 Rules for communicating with the mass media, as well as the sources
              and regularity of communications
           •	 Media contacts, including press conferences, publications, brochures
              and booklets
           •	 The requirement for executive bodies to conduct meetings for
              shareholders and analysts
           •	 Procedures for answering questions from all shareholders
           •	 List of information, documents and materials to be provided to all
              shareholders for the GMS
           •	 List of confidential information
           •	 Procedures for the identification and treatment of insider information.


In addition, companies should consider disclosing other internal policies or internal
regulations such as a code of ethics, environmental policies, and the internal regulations
for the Board of Commissioners and its committees amongst others.
          For more information on company policies and internal regulations, see Chapter 3.


8.	 Disclosure during the Placement of Securities - 		
	Prospectus
The public offer of securities may only be performed with prior registration of the
prospectus with the OJK. A prospectus provides material information on the company
so that investors can make informed decisions on the merits of potential investments.
Prospectuses set forth the nature and object of shares, debentures, or other securities,
and the investment and risk characteristics of the issue. Investors must be furnished with
a prospectus before purchasing securities.
          For more detailed information on the prospectus, see Chapter 11, Section C.



Information Disclosure                            473                                     Disclosure Items
C.	            Voluntary Disclosure

It is good practice for companies to voluntarily disclose material information beyond
formal legal requirements. This holds particularly true for companies operating in
emerging markets that are often marred by weak legal and regulatory environments and
poor enforcement mechanisms. To the extent possible, companies are encouraged to use
existing forms of disclosure and adhere to the same quality standards that are demanded
for these forms of reporting. They are also encouraged to use existing channels of
communication, such as the internet and the print media.


1.	 Corporate Websites
Corporate websites are easily accessible to the public at low cost and can be an
exceptionally powerful means of communication. At present, the internet is beginning
to be accepted as an official disclosure channel.


                                                                   Best Practices

       The following information should be placed on the company’s website:
         •	 The company’s AoA and amendments thereto
         •	 Information on the company’s development strategy
         •	 Business reports with financial reports
         •	 Prospectuses
         •	 External Auditor’s reports
         •	 Information on material events
         •	 Information regarding the GMS
         •	 Important Board of Directors decisions.



The internet is an effective tool for rapid and cost-effective communications and is
increasingly used by Indonesian companies for voluntary disclosure.

                                                       Comparative Practices

       Public companies place their annual and financial reports and governance
       information (such as information on Board of Directors members and key
       executives) on their websites. The better websites have special sections
       devoted to corporate governance and include contact addresses and
       telephone numbers for inquiries.


Some companies are already following best practices and disclose additional information
on their websites, including:
   •	 Financial statements for the last three years
   •	 Financial ratios for the last three years
   •	 Internal corporate documents
   •	 Structure, authorities, and composition of the governing bodies
   •	 List of affiliated persons for the last year
   •	 Annual and quarterly reports for the last three years
   •	 Materials and decisions of the GMS for the last three years
   •	 Information on corporate securities
   •	 Corporate news ticker.



2.	 Mass Media
The print media is an additional channel for disclosure. Although publication may entail
additional costs, it is a recognized legal channel for disclosure and (unlike the internet,
which is passive) ensures the active dissemination of information among the public.
Most companies disclose information about new products, major contracts, acquisitions,
financial results, production plans and securities issues in the print media.

       Financial statements are the most important document for shareholders and
       potential investors to understand the financial position of the company. In this
       respect, companies with a larger number of shareholders (for example, 10,000
       or more) should publish their financial statements in at least two newspapers
       distributed throughout the entire territory of the country. In principle,
       these newspapers should be accessible to the majority of the company’s
       shareholders.

An internal and external audit system is an important tool in the management and
oversight of a company, which also contributes to transparent and sound financial
reporting. There are a number of internal structures and external agents involved in
the management and oversight of company finances and operations. These bodies are
diverse in their nature, functions and reporting lines. Some are mandatory, while others
are optional.
ICL has specific provisions for the establishment of the Board of Commissioners. The
Board of Commissioners shall supervise in general or any specific focus in accordance
with the AoA of the company and give advise to the Board of Directors 1. The specific
focus may be to supervise Board of Directors to control financial and business activities
of the company as well as monitoring compliance with laws and regulations.
In addition, considering the development of business activities based on sharia
principles, ICL also stipulates that any companies who carry out its business activities
with sharia principles, other than establishing Board of Commissioners, shall also
establish the Sharia Supervisory Board.
The Sharia Supervisory Board gives advise and suggestions, and also supervise the
company activities to be in accordance with the sharia principles.2 In carrying out their
duties, the Board of Commissioners should be independent of the Board of Directors.
Board of Commissioners members must act diligently in the best interests of company
shareholders. The Board of Commissioners reports directly to the GMS and in theory, it
should have the ultimate inspection role to ensure proper controls are established by the
company.
The independent External Auditor examines a company’s financial and accounting
records, as well as supporting documents, in all material respects. Shareholders depend
upon the External Auditor to express an independent opinion on whether the financial
statements of a company are reliable.
In case of having an ineffective performance of the Board of Commissioners, the Board
of Commissioners should consider the establishment of an Audit Committee. The
Board of Commissioners’ Audit Committee safeguards the company by questioning
executive bodies regarding the way in which financial reporting responsibilities are
handled, as well as by ensuring that corrective actions are taken. The Audit Committee
oversees the company’s relations with the External Auditor. It may consider the
appointment of an External Auditor, review the internal audit plan, review the
effectiveness of internal control systems, consider major findings of internal audit
investigations and management responses to these and promote co-ordination between

the Internal and External Auditors. The Audit Committee is part of the Board of
Commissioners, and as such, develops recommendations for their consideration. The
Audit Committee consequently has no independent decision-making authority.
The Internal Auditor is responsible for the on-going daily appraisal of the financial
health of a company’s operations. The internal control system is jointly designed by the
Board of Directors, the management and employees to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the achievement of the company’s objectives with regards to the effectiveness
and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting and compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. The main objective of the Internal Auditor is to
advise management if the company has sound internal control systems to protect the
organization against loss. The Internal Auditor evaluates internal control systems,
assess risks and components of risk management, communicate and make suggestions
for improvement. An internal audit not only covers the finance function, but also the
company’s operations and systems.
This chapter discusses the role, authority and duties of these various bodies in detail and
how they specifically contribute to company transparency and information disclosure.
For an overview of these bodies and their reporting lines, see Figure 1 for Indonesia’s
current model and see Figure 2 for the best practice model used in many other
countries.

A.	            The Board of Commissioners

The Board of Commissioners controls the operations and financial activities of the
company. Its primary function is to supervise the work of the Board of Directors, the
director or President Director, as well as the company’s compliance with laws and
regulations during business operations.3

          Refer to Chapter 4 for more detailed narrative description on the roles and responsibilities,
          structure and functioning of the BOC.

Information Disclosure                              484                             The Board of Commissioners
B.	            The Independent External Auditor

An independent audit conducted by an External Auditor is an important element
of the company’s control framework. The objective of an audit is to enable the
External Auditor to express an opinion on whether or not the financial statements of
the company are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an identified
financial reporting framework and whether they are reliable. It gives shareholders,
managers, employees and market participants an independent opinion about the
company’s financial position and, if performed properly, should attest to the accuracy
of the statements. An independent audit conducted by a publicly recognized and
accredited accounting firm normally enhances the company’s credibility, and
accordingly, its prospects for attracting investment.
Three key points about the independent audit are:
   1.	Management remains responsible for preparing and presenting the company’s
      financial statements
   2.	The External Auditor is responsible for forming and expressing an opinion on the
      financial statements prepared by management
   3.	The audit of the financial statements does not relieve management of any of its
      responsibilities.


1.	 When an Annual Audit is Required?
The annual financial statements of all public and listed companies must be audited
by an independent and eligible public accountant. Furthermore, the annual financial
statement of a public listed company must be audited by an independent puclic
accountant that has been registered with OJK.


2.	 The Rights and Duties of the External Auditor
In relation to the external audit of a company, the External Auditor (or Auditing
Company) has rights to:
   •	 Receive fees for services provided to clients
   •	 Request the company to supply fully and promptly accounting documents and



Information Disclosure                       485                  The Independent External Auditor
       other necessary documents and information related to the performance of the
       audit under the contract
   •	 Request, inspect and confirm economic and financial information related to the
      companies being audited from relevant sources of information inside and outside
      such entities.
In relation to the external audit of a company, it is recommended to appoint an
External Auditor who has the following ethics:
   •	 Allocate adequate and professional human resources to ensure the quality of the
      audit service delivery. Pay compensation for damages caused by its audit team
      members to their clients when providing auditing and other relevant services
   •	 During the course of auditing, if it detects signs of financial and accounting
      legislation violations, violation to the Capital Market law (including its
      implementing regulation) and any other issue that may endanger the company’s
      financial condition and the interest of its client it is obliged to notify such to the
      audited companies or write appropriate comments in the audit reports
   •	 To provide information about operating licensed auditors and audited clients to
      the audited companies in accordance with legal provisions to be held responsible
      before law, clients and partly responsible before users of audit results and provided
      services
   •	 To refuse providing services if it finds out that the Audit Company is not able to
      ensure independence and professional auditing conditions or if the client violates
      the Law on Auditing or other related regulations
The auditor or Auditing Company representative may be permitted to attend all GMS
meetings and be entitled to receive other notices and information which shareholders
are entitled to receive relating to the GMS and may be entitled to express his/her
opinions about issues relating to the audit.



                                                                       Best Practices

       The External Auditor will often submit, and companies seeking to implement
       good corporate governance should demand, what is referred to as a
       ‘management letter’ in addition to the audit report. This management letter
       typically covers all material weaknesses in the company’s internal control,




Information Disclosure                       486                       The Independent External Auditor
       accounting and operating procedures. The purpose of the letter is to provide
       constructive suggestions to management concerning improvements for such
       procedures.
       The findings contained in the management letter are considered to be “non-
       reportable” to third parties, yet require corrective action by management.
       Companies wishing to attract external finance should be aware that investors
       would typically request a copy of the management letter.




3.	 The Rights and Duties of the Company
The audited company has the right to:
   •	 Select an External Auditor or Auditing Company fully satisfying the conditions
      for lawful professional practice in Indonesia to sign contracts on the provision of
      auditing services, except otherwise provided for by law
   •	 Request the External Auditor provide relevant information in its registered business
      license file, an audit opinion or other information about the Auditing Company’s
      practicing auditors
   •	 Refuse to provide information that is not for the purpose of the audit and request
      the change of the practicing auditors if they violate the independent principle of
      auditing
   •	 Discuss or demand written explanations relating to unclear issues stated in the draft
      audit report
   •	 Complain about practicing auditors if they commit illegal acts during the audit
   •	 Request the External Auditor compensate for damages caused by the audit
The audited company is obligated to:
   •	 Provide accurate, sufficient and timely information/documents according to the
      External Auditor’s requests and be responsible for the accuracy, integrity and
      objectivity of the information provided
   •	 Coordinate with and facilitate the auditors during the audit
   •	 Not block or hinder the scope of the audit




Information Disclosure                      487                      The Independent External Auditor
     •	 Implement all recommendations made by the External Auditor in a complete and
        timely manner
     •	 Inform, in a sufficient and timely manner, all violations by the practicing auditors
        to the State authorized agency and the professional auditing body
     •	 Pay audit fees in accordance with terms provided in the audit contract
     •	 In case of an audit contract signed by an individual accountant for more than
        three consecutive years and not more that six consecutive years by a public
        accountant office, the company must request the External Auditor change the
        practicing auditors who sign the audit report
     •	 Refuse the Auditing Company’s services if the Auditing Company is deemed not to
        be qualified to perform the audit services
     •	 Other obligations in accordance with legal provisions.


4.	 The Appointment of the External Auditor
Under the ICL, there is no provision on the authority to appoint and dismiss the
External Auditor. Indonesia CG Code stipulated that for a company with an Audit
Committee, the appointment of an external auditor shall consider opinion of the
committee rendered to the Board of Commissioners before approved by the GMS.4


                                                                       Best Practices

       It is increasingly common for external auditors to be recommended by an
       independent audit committee of the board or an equivalent body and to
       be appointed either by that committee/body or by shareholders directly.
       Moreover, the IOSCO Principles of Auditor Independence and the Role of
       Corporate Governance in Monitoring an Auditor’s Independence states
       that, “standards of auditor independence should establish a framework of
       principles, supported by a combination of prohibitions, restrictions, other
       policies and procedures and disclosures, that addresses at least the following
       threats to independence: self-interest, self-review, advocacy, familiarity and
       intimidation” (see OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, pages 55).

1.	     Who Can Be an External Auditor
	       Any legal entity with a license to perform auditing services can be appointed an
        External Auditor. However, as mentioned above, the External Auditor of public
        companies must be an independent and eligible Auditing Company which is
        registered with OJK.
	       An external audit is served by a public accountant office. A public accountant
        office is a business entity who obtains a permit from the Minister of Finance as a
        platform for the public accountants to deliver their service.5 A public accountant
        office may form as a civil association or a firm or individual. In the event where
        the public accountant office is formed as civil association or firm, it may only be
        established by at least 2 (two) public accountant which one of them appointed as
        managing partner. In the event where the civil association or firm has a non public
        accountant associate, it may be established at least with composition of 75% of
        partners are public accountants.6 Furthermore, to obtain the permit for the public
        accountant service from Minister of Finance, several requirements are set out in
        Article 18 of the Minister of Finance Regulation No. 17/PMK.01/2008 on Public
        Accountant Service (“MOF Reg. 17/2008”).
	       In delivering its service, a public accountant and public accountant office must
        comply with7:
        •	 Public Accountant Professional Standard which stipulates by the Indonesia
           Accountant Public Association (“IAPA”);
        •	 Code of Ethics of Public Accountant Profession which stipulates by IAPA;
        •	 Applicable laws and regulations in public accountant service.
	       Pursuant to Article 46 of MOF Reg. 78/2008, a public accountant cannot be a
        partner in more than one public accountant offices. Public accountants are also
        prohibited to occupy a double position as follows:
        a.	government officials;
        b.	chairman, member, or officer in a government agency, government institution,
           or any other agencies which are formed with laws;
        c.	 chairman, manager, or officer in a state-owned enterprise, regional-owned
            enterprise, private entity, or partner in other business entity;

             executing the same function as commissioners or the said committee in not
             more than 2 (two) state-owned enterprise, regional-owned enterprise, private
             entity, or partner in other business entity;
          c.	 chairman, manager, or officer in Indonesia Accountant Association, IAPA,
              religious foundation, or any other business entities for social purposes only.
	         For public accountants who occupy the abovementioned positions, must report to
          the Secretary General of the Finance Department of the Republic of Indonesia.8

           In the U.S., the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act prohibits public accounting
           firms from providing non-audit service to their audit clients including, (1)
           bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial
           statements of the audit client, (2) financial information systems design
           and implementation, (3) appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions,
           or contribution- in-kind reports, (4) actuarial services, (5) internal audit
           outsourcing services, (6) management functions or human resources, (7)

        services and expert services unrelated to the audit and (9) any other service
        that the Board of Directors determines, by regulation, is impermissible.9
        An exception to this rule is made should non-audit services that are not listed
        above be pre-approved by the Board of Directors Audit Committee. The Audit
        Committee should, however, disclose these services to investors in periodic
        reports. Another exception is made when the non-audit services constitute
        less than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid to its auditor, these services
        were not recognized to be non-audit services at the time of engagement, and
        the Audit Committee promptly approves these services prior to the completion
        of the audit.



2.	     The Contract with the External Auditor
	       The company must enter into a contract with the External Auditor once it has
        been approved by the GMS. The ICL does not specify who must sign the contract
        on behalf of the company, provided however one of the authorities of the
        Board of Directors is to represent the company, therefore a President Director is
        authorized to sign the contract on behalf of the company. The contract with the
        Auditing Company stipulates the rights and duties of the External Auditor and the
        company, and may include any additional terms that the parties agree upon.


5.	Compensation
The company pays for the Auditing Company’s services. The Audit Committee shall
review the External Auditor fees and submit its recommendation to the Board of
Commissioners. Clearly, the procedure for the payment of compensation and the
amount of compensation must not be made dependent upon the audit results.
Auditing companies and audited companies may agree to apply one of the following
methods of calculating the auditing service charge:
     •	 Calculating according to working hours of practicing auditors and a charge rate
        per hour
     •	 Calculating according to each auditing service with a package charge

      of the contract or project values
   •	 Calculating under multi-period audit contracts with a fixed charge rate for each
      period.


6.	Reporting
For a listed company, the External Auditor shall prepare an audit report and submit it to
the Board of Directors no later than three months from the end of the financial year.
The External Auditor presents conclusions on the reliability of the company’s financial
statements and compliance with accounting procedures. The opinion paragraph
of the auditor’s report should state the auditor’s opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view (in all material respects) in accordance with the
financial reporting framework used by the company and, where appropriate, whether
the financial statements comply with statutory requirements. The External Auditor must
prepare a report on the annual audit that includes:
   •	 Opinions on the accuracy of the company’s reports and other financial documents
   •	 Information on violations of accounting or financial reporting procedures,
      disclosure rules and relevant laws and regulations.


                                                                     Best Practices

       The External Auditor should divulge (potential) errors, misconduct, and
       violations of legislation or the company’s internal rules during audits, and
       report them immediately to the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee or
       Supervisory Board. The External Auditor should make the company aware,
       as soon as practical and at an appropriate level of responsibility, of material
       weaknesses in the design or operation of the accounting and internal control
       systems, which have come to the Auditor’s attention. The Board of Directors’
       Audit Committee or the Supervisory Board should take appropriate steps to
       remedy these problems.
       If the company plans to seek access to international capital markets,
       the External Auditor should prepare the report in accordance with the
       International Standards on Auditing (ISA) issued by the International

       Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The audit report must give opinion on
       the financial statements prepared in accordance with the International
       Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the International Accounting
       Standards Board (IASB).




                                                                      Best Practices

       The External Auditor should participate in the AGM and answer shareholder
       questions with respect to the audit report. Moreover, the Audit Committee or
       the Supervisory Board should evaluate:
          •	 Whether the audit was made in accordance with the established
             procedures and whether the External Auditor omitted any matters in
             carrying out the audit
           •	 The opinion of the External Auditor before it is presented at the GMS.




7.	 The External Auditor’s Liability
Indonesia laws have not stipulated stringently and clearly the liabilities to which the
licensed auditor is relevant. Since the licensed auditor or the Audit Company is liable for
civil, administrative, and criminal infractions, he/she should be adequately insured by a
reputable (domestic or international) insurance provider with appropriate coverage. The
Audit Company has to be insured from the risks associated with the inaccurate audit
opinion given by the licensed auditor, as well as non-application of the ISA, if required
and code of ethics for professional accountants.
a.	 Civil Liability
	      The grounds and terms of civil liability are usually specified in the contract
       between the Audit Company and the audited company. The licensed auditor and
       Audit Company must keep company operations information confidential. If they
       divulge confidential information, the company may seek compensation for the
       resulting losses.




Information Disclosure                        493                     The Independent External Auditor
b.	 Administrative Liability
	      Auditing and accounting regulations state that the licensed auditor bears
       administrative liability if he/she provides the company with an obviously false
       opinion. In such cases, the best practice suggested is that the auditor’s license may
       be revoked by the MOF.
c.	    Criminal Liability
	      The Penal Code stipulates that when the licensed auditor uses his/her authority for
       his/her own purposes and violates the rights of a company or related parties, the
       licensed auditor may be prosecuted.10
	      The damages caused by Auditing Company for which it is responsible to
       compensate for shall be agreed between the auditing companies and the audited
       companies or determined by the authorized agency in accordance with laws and
       regulations. Methods of compensation as agreed between the two companies can
       include:
       •	 Cancellation of the signed auditing contract
       •	 Not being allowed to sign an auditing contract in the following years
       •	 Deduction of the agreed audit fee
       •	 Maximum compensation 10 times of the year’s audit fee.

C.	 The Audit Committee of the Board of 	
	Commissioners
The Board of Commissioners is encouraged to establish an Audit Committee, as it is
increasingly seen as an essential element of the corporate governance structure in many
countries. Indonesia CG Code Part IV 3.7. stipulated that in carrying out its duty, the
Board of Commissioners may form committees. Any proposal from the committees shall
be submitted to the Board of Commis¬sioners for approval. According to Regulation
Number IX.I.5, for publicly listed companies, state-owned enterprises, province and
region-owned companies, companies that raise and manage public funds, companies
of which products or services are widely used by public, and companies with extensive
influence on environment, an Audit Committee shall be established, whereas other
committees are formed as required.
The following are some best practices on the functions of the Audit Committee (in case
the function of the Board of Commissioners is abolished or ineffective).



                                                                                   Best Practices

       The Audit Committee typically focuses on financial reporting, risk
       management, internal and external auditing (see Figure 3).

       International best practices suggest that the Audit Committee develop and
       maintain an internal document, for example an internal regulation for the
       Audit Committee that addresses its purpose, duties and responsibilities. The
       following are suggested by the New York Stock Exchange:11
           •	 The purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist supervisory function of
              the Board of Commissioners to oversee the integrity of the company’s
              financial statements, the External Auditor’s qualifications and
              independence, and the performance of the company’s internal audit
              function and External Auditor on the one hand and to prepare the report
              that OJK rules require be included in the company’s annual proxy
              statement.
           •	 The duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to, inter alia:
               - 	 Review company’s financial information that will be released, such
                   as financial statement, financial projection and other financial
                   information
               - 	 Review the company’s compliance to the law and regulation
                   regarding Capital Market and Public Companies
               - 	 Conduct independent recommendation regarding dissenting opinion
                   of management and accounting
               -	 Conduct recommendation to Board of Commissioner regarding the
                  appointment of Accountant based on independency, scope of task,
                  and fee
               - 	 Review of audit implementation then supervise the Director’s action
                   regarding such audit
               - 	 Review any risk faced by company which is conducted by Director if
                   it is not monitored under Board of Commissioner
               -	 Review any complain related with Issuers or Public Company’s
                  financial report
               -	 Review and give opinion to the Board of Commissioners regarding
                  any potential conflict of interest
               -	 To keep the confidentiality of company’s document, data and the
                  issuer’s information
           •	 Conduct an annual performance evaluation of the Audit Committee.

                                                                                Best Practices

       The National Association of Corporate Directors’ (NACD) is an international
       independent training institute for directors, which aims to improve leadership
       of the director on Blue Ribbon Commission on Audit Committees has identified
       the following indicators of risk that the Audit Committee should monitor and
       closely examine: 12

           •	 Complex business arrangements which appear to serve little practical
              purposes
           •	 Large last-minute transactions that resulted in significant revenues in
              quarterly or annual reports
           •	 Auditor changes over accounting or auditing disagreements
           •	 Overly optimistic news releases in which the Chief Executive Officer
              (General Director) seeks to cajole investors into believing in future
              growth
           •	 Widely dispersed business locations with decentralized management
              and a poor internal reporting system
           •	 Inconsistencies between management’s discussion and analysis, the
              President’s letter and the underlying financial statements
           •	 Insistence by the General Director or Chief Financial Officer that he/she
              be present at all meetings of the Audit Committee, Internal or External
              Auditor
           •	 A consistently close or exact match between planned results and
              reported results, and managers who always achieve 100% of their bonus
              opportunities
           •	 Hesitancy, evasiveness, and/or lack of specifics from management or
              auditors regarding questions about the financial statements;

              Auditor
           •	 A pattern of shipping most of the month’s or quarter’s sales in the last
              week or last day
           •	 The internal audit operating under scope restrictions, such as the
              Internal Auditor not having a direct line of communication to the Audit
              Committee
           •	 Unusual balance sheet changes, or changes in trends or important
              financial statement relationships such as, for example, receivables
              growing faster than revenues, or accounts payable that are continually
              delayed
           •	 Unusual accounting policies, particularly for revenue recognition and
              cost deferrals such as recognizing revenues before products have
              been shipped (“bill and hold”), or deferring cost items that are normally
              expensed as incurred
           •	 Accounting methods that appear to favor form over substance
           •	 Accounting principles/practices at variance with industry norms and
           •	 Numerous and/or recurring unrecorded or “waived” adjustments rose in

       Members of the Audit Committee must be financial literate. An experienced
       individual who is a financial expert should chair the Audit Committee. The
       independence, aptitude and leadership skills of the chairman are crucial for
       the committee’s success. According to Regulation Number IX.I.5, for public
       listed company, the head of the Audit Committee shall be the Independent
       Commissioner.
       Further, the member of the Audit Committee shall consist of 2 Indepent
       Commissioner or any other external party.

3.	Meetings
If a Board of Commissioners meeting considers matters pertaining to Audit
Committee activities, an Audit Committee meeting should take place before the Board
of Commissioners meets. This meeting should occur sufficiently in advance of the
Board of Commissioners meeting to allow the Audit Committee to communicate its
conclusions and allow the Board of Commissioners to thoroughly consider them.
The Audit Committee should also:
   •	 Regularly informs the Board of Commissioners about violations of procedures and
      legislation by the company’s officers
   •	 Informs the Board of Commissioners about individuals who are responsible for
      irregularities, the circumstances under which they took place and how errors could
      be prevented in the future
   •	 Analyzes and give recommendations to the Board of Commissioners regarding
      risks associated with transactions and operations of the company.
The Audit Committee should conduct meetings at least on a quarterly basis.



                                                                              Best Practices

       In some countries the Audit Committee is required to conduct meetings once
       a month. However, meeting once a month may be regarded as onerous and
       burdensome, as well as costly. The new U.K. Combined Code suggests that
       Audit Committee meetings be held to coincide with key dates in the financial
       reporting and audit cycle, with no fewer than three formal meetings per
       year.13 The Audit Committee’s Chairman will likely call additional meetings to
       establish an on-going and informal contact with the Board of Commissioners
       and Board of Directors.

4.	 Access to Information and Resources
The Board of Commissioners should be provided with information on the financial and
operating results of the company. Therefore, Audit Committee members will need to
have unfettered access to documents and corporate information to allow them to fulfil
their functions of reporting to the Board of Commissioners. The Corporate Secretary
often plays a crucial role in this respect, facilitating a free flow of information to fulfil the
Audit Committee’s requests.


                                                                            Best Practices

       It is recommended that the Audit Committee be authorized and be provided
       with resources to hire outside audit, financial, legal and other professional
       advisors, on which must be acknowledged by the Board of Commissioner.

D.	            Internal Control Function
Internal control in fact is a process conducted by the Board of Directors, management
and the company’s employees, to provide a reasonable guarantee that financial reporting
is reliable and accurate, operations are efficient and effective, and the company complies
with legislation, its own internal rules and guidelines.
Indonesian CG Code has stated internal control as one of the Board of Directors’ role
and function. It covers as follows:14
   •	 The Board of Directors shall establish and maintain a sound internal control
      system to safeguard company’s assets and performance and its compliance with
      laws and regulations;
   •	 Publicly listed companies, state-owned enterprises, province and re¬gion-owned
      companies, companies that raise and manage public funds, companies of which
      products or services are widely used by public, and companies with extensive
      influence on environment, shall have an internal control function or unit;
   •	 The internal control function or unit shall to assist the Board of Directors in
      ensuring the attainment of objectives and business sustainability by: (i) evaluating
      the implementation of the company’s program; (ii) providing recommendations
      to improve the effectiveness of the risk management process; (iii) evaluating the
      company’s compliance with company’s regulations, implementation of GCG and
      the laws and regulations; and (iv) facilitating sound coordination with external
      auditor;
   •	 The internal control unit or the head of an internal control function shall be
      responsible to the President Director or to the Director in charge for the internal
      control function. The internal control unit has a functional relation with the Board
      of Commissioners through the Audit Committee.
In fact, an effective internal control structure can help the company:15
   •	 Make better business decisions of a higher quality and more timely information
   •	 Gain (or regain) the trust of investors
   •	 Prevent loss of resources
   •	 Provide security over its assets

   •	 Prevent fraud
   •	 Comply with applicable laws and regulations
   •	 Gain a competitive advantage through streamlined operations.
The internal control system can be defined as control over the conduct of the company’s
financial and business operations (including the implementation of its financial and
business plan) by the company’s divisions and bodies.
To have a better understanding of the internal control system, in the following section,
we shall discuss the internal control principles, elements of internal control systems,
bodies and persons responsible for the internal control as well as the roles of internal
auditing in the internal control system.


1.	 Internal Control Principles
A company’s internal control system should be based on the following principles:
   •	 The internal control system should function at all times and without interruption.
      A system that functions on a permanent basis allows the company to identify
      deviations on a timely basis and helps to predict future deviations.
   •	 Each person involved in the internal control process should be held accountable.
      The performance of each person carrying out control functions should
      consequently be managed by yet another person in the internal control system.
   •	 The internal control system should segregate duties. Companies should prohibit
      duplication of control functions and should distribute functions among the
      employees so that one and the same person do not combine functions relating to
      the authorization of operations with certain assets, recording of such operations,
      ensuring and safe-keeping of assets and inventory of these same assets.
   •	 The proper authorization and approval of operations. Companies should establish
      procedures for approving financial and business operations by authorized persons,
      within the scope of their authority.
   •	 Companies should ensure the organizational separation of its subdivision
      responsible for internal control and ensure that this subdivision is accountable
      directly to the Board of Directors. This organizational separation ensures that
      internal controls are verified by an independent authority, in this case the Board
      of Commissioners, which is not involved in the implementation or maintenance of
      internal controls.




Information Disclosure                     502                           Internal Control Function
   •	 All units and departments of the company should integrate and cooperate to allow
      the internal control system to be properly implemented.
   •	 A culture of continuous development and improvement needs to be put in place.
      A company’s internal control system should be structured to allow it to flexibly
      address new issues and be easily expanded and upgraded.
   •	 A system for the timely reporting of any deviations should be put in place.
      Ensuring the timeliness of reporting on deviations with the shortest possible
      deadline allows authorized persons to act swiftly to correct problems.


2.	 Elements of the Internal Control System
The internal control system includes the following inter-related elements:16
   a.	Control environment: The control environment sets the tone of an
      organization and influences the control consciousness of its people. It is the
      foundation for all other components of internal control, providing discipline and
      structure. Control environment factors include the integrity, ethical values, and
      competence of the company’s employees and officers, management’s philosophy
      and operating style, the way management assigns authority, responsibility and
      organizes and develops its staff and the attention and direction provided by the
      Board of Directors.



                                                                                Best Practices

       An essential element of an effective internal control system is a strong
       control culture.17 It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors and senior
       management to emphasize the importance of internal control through their
       words and actions. This includes the ethical values that management displays
       in business dealings, both inside and outside the organization. The words,
       attitudes and actions of the Board of Directors and senior management affect
       the integrity, ethics and other aspects of the company’s control culture.

   b.	Risk assessment: Every entity faces a variety of risks from external and internal
      sources. A precondition to risk assessment is setting the company’s objectives. Risk
      assessment is the identification and analysis of relevant risks to achieve company
      objectives, forming a basis for determining how risks should be managed.
   c.	Control activities: Control activities are the policies and procedures that
      help guarantee that management directives are carried out. They help ensure
      that necessary action is taken to address risks and achieve the entity’s objectives.
      Control activities occur throughout the organization, at all levels and functions.
      They include a range of activities as diverse as approvals, authorizations,
      verifications, reconciliations, reviews of operating performance, security of assets
      and segregation of duties.



                                                                     Best Practices

       Control activities should be as strict on the top as on the bottom of the
       company’s operations, lending credibility to the control environment and the
       tone at the top.



   d.	Information and communication: Pertinent information must be identified
      and communicated in a form and within a timeframe that enables employees to
      carry out their responsibilities. Information systems produce reports containing
      operational, financial and compliance-related information that make it possible
      to run and control the business. They not only deal with internally generated
      data, but also information about external events, activities, and conditions
      necessary to informed business decision-making and external reporting. Effective
      communication must also occur in a broader sense — flowing up, down and
      across the organization. All personnel must receive a clear message from senior
      management that control responsibilities must be taken seriously. Furthermore,
      they must understand their own role in the internal control system, as well as how
      individual activities relate to the work of others. Of particular importance is that
      management do not limit itself to communicating on a control measure in and of
      itself, but properly emphasize the meaning and purpose of the particular control
      element. They must also have a means of communicating significant information
      upstream. There also needs to be effective communication with external parties,
      such as customers, suppliers, regulators and shareholders.




Information Disclosure                      504                            Internal Control Function
   e.	Monitoring the efficiency of the internal control system: Internal
      control systems need to be monitored over time to assess the quality of the system’s
      performance. This is accomplished through on-going monitoring activities,
      separate evaluations, or a combination of the two. On-going monitoring occurs
      during the course of operations. It includes regular management and supervisory
      activities and other actions personnel take in performing their duties. The scope
      and frequency of separate evaluations depend primarily on an assessment of
      the risks and effectiveness of on-going monitoring procedures. Internal control
      deficiencies should be reported upstream, with the most serious matters reported
      directly to the Board of Commissioners. The Board of Directors and the Board
      of Commissioners need to clearly formulate sanctions to be imposed as a result of
      control violations on an ex ante basis.


3.	 Bodies and Persons Responsible for Internal Control
Internal control is, to some degree, the responsibility of everyone in an organization
and should be an explicit or implicit part of everyone’s job description. Virtually all
employees produce information used in the internal control system or take other actions
needed to effect control. Also, all personnel should be responsible for communicating
upward problems in operations, non-compliance with an internal code of conduct or
company-level corporate governance code, should such documents exist, or other policy
violations or illegal actions.



                                                                     Best Practices

       The company’s department responsible for corporate training programs
       should ensure that all employees and executives receive training on
       the company’s control culture and system. Furthermore, although each
       company has its own specific internal control system and bodies, there are
       some general rules that a company should follow. Internal control always
       starts at the top of the company, at the level of the Board of Directors and
       executive bodies. In particular, the Board of Directors and executive bodies
       are responsible for establishing the proper internal control environment and
       maintaining high ethical standards at all levels of the company’s operations.
       Furthermore, the approval of internal control procedures falls within the
       competence of the company’s Board of Commissioners, commonly through




Information Disclosure                      505                           Internal Control Function
       the Audit Committee. The Board of Commissioners’ Audit Committee is
       also assigned to review and evaluate the efficiency of the internal control
       system as a whole, and prepare proposals on how to improve it. Finally, the
       implementation of internal control procedures is the responsibility of the
       executive bodies.




                                                                             Best Practices

       The President Director is ultimately responsible for and should assume
       ownership of the system.18 More than any other individual, he/she sets the
       ‘tone at the top’ that affects the integrity and ethics of a positive control
       environment. In a large company, the President Director fulfils this duty by
       providing leadership and direction to senior managers and reviewing the way
       they control the business. Senior managers, in turn, assign responsibility to
       establish more specific internal control policies and procedures to personnel
       responsible for the unit’s functions. For example, controls for the company’s
       IT system should fall under the responsibility of the Chief Information Officer
       or manager responsible for IT. Of particular significance are financial officers
       and their staff, whose control activities cut across, as well as up and down,
       the operations and other units of a company.
       The executive bodies, in particular the President Director or the Finance

4.	 The Internal Auditor
The Internal Auditor plays a significant role in a company’s governance structure to
ensure good controls are in place. The Internal Auditor carries out regular internal
audit. The internal audit is an integral part of a company’s internal control system.

While internal control is wider in scope, the internal audit can be defined as an
independent, objective assurance and consultation activity designed to add value
and improve an organization’s operations.19 It helps an organization accomplish its
objectives by introducing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the
effectiveness of risk management, control and corporate governance processes.
More specifically, internal auditing reviews and ensures the reliability and integrity
of information, compliance with policies and regulations, the safeguarding of assets,
economical and efficient use of resources and the attainment of established operational
goals and objectives. Internal audits encompass financial activities and operations
including systems, production, engineering, marketing and human resources.
The Head of Internal Audit is appointed and dismissed by the Board of Directors,
provided that any appointment, replacement, or dismissal of the Head of Internal Audit
shall be notified to OJK. The Deputy Head of Internal Audit and other positions are
appointed and dismissed under requests from the Head of Internal Audit
The internal audit function shall be responsible to keep confidential documents and
information in accordance with prevailing laws and regulations, the credit institution’s
charter and the internal regulations on internal audit of the credit institution. Based
on Regulation Number IX.I.7, the internal audit unit’s duty and responsibility are as
follows:
   a.	compiling and performing annual Internal Audit plan;
   b.	reviewing and evaluating the operation of internal control and risk management in
      accordance to company’s policy;
   c.	 performing audit and assessing the efficiency and effectiveness in the area
       of finance, accounting, operation, human resource, marketing, information
       technology and other activities;
   d.	performing compliance audit to related regulations and laws;
   e.	 identifying the efficiency and effectiveness of improvement and enhancement
       alternative of resources and funding consumptions;
   f.	 giving objective improvement of advice and information regarding audited
       activities for all management levels;
   g.	 reporting the audit result and delivers the report to President Director and
       commissioner;

                                                           Comparative Practices

       The typical internal audit tasks include:

           •	 Appraise compliance of business activities with internal policies and
              procedures
           •	 Provide advice in setting up internal policies and procedures
           •	 Appraise controls over the safeguarding of assets
           •	 Appraise compliance with laws and regulations
           •	 Appraise internal controls over financial information
           •	 Appraise internal controls over business processes
           •	 Appraise the process for identifying, evaluating, and managing
              business risks
           •	 Appraise operational efficiency
           •	 Appraise compliance with contractual obligations
           •	 Conduct audits of information technologies
           •	 Investigate fraud
           •	 Audit subsidiary companies.

In order to function properly, the Internal Auditor should enjoy a reasonable degree of
independence. This can be attained by making him/her accountable to the Board of
Commissioners (through the Audit Committee) rather than an executive of the company
(the President Director or Finance Director).



                                                                          Best Practices

       In reality, it is difficult for the internal audit function to be entirely independent
       of management. Indeed, the internal control function is a key management
       tool. It would lose a great deal of its utility if it did not report to management.
       Cognizant of the need to maintain independence while working closely with
       management, the Institute of Internal Auditors suggests that the Internal
       Auditor report administratively to the President Director and functionally to
       the Board of Commissioners’ Audit Committee.

Framework of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)
A.	Introduction

1.	 The Origin of Indonesian SOEs
The history of SOEs in Indonesia began since the Dutch colonial era. The Dutch
government formed many enterprises for public use, such as railways, post office,
seaports etc.1 These SOEs were governed by two laws, namely Indonesische
Comptabiliteitswet Stb 1925 No. 448 (ICW Enterprises) and Indonesische
Bedrijvenwent Stb 1927 No.419 as amended by Stb 1936 No. 445 (IBW Enterprise).
Both ICW enterprises and IBW Enterprises obtained their capital entirely from the
Dutch Government, provided that it was only IBW Enterprises were allowed to raise
additional capital from government loans subject to interests and accordingly prudent
audit was applied to ensure that these enterprises could settle their debts.
After Independence, the Indonesian Government took over most of the SOEs
established by the Dutch government. Following takeover, for controlling purposes, the
government turned all of the SOEs into a single form entity called State Enterprise or
Perusahaan Negara (PN) and such transformation was governed by the Government
Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 19 of 1960 concerning State Enterprise. Many believed
that this initiative was unsuccessful and created repercussions.
Starting 1966 under the New Order regime (Orde Baru), SOEs arrangement was
reformed. The New regime issued Law No.9 of 1969 concerning the forms of state
business. This law changed the single form of enterprise into three categories, namely
Departmental Enterprise (Perusahaan Jawatan or “Perjan”), Public Enterprise
(Perusahaan Umum or “Perum”), and Limited Liability Enterprise (PERSEROAN
or “Persero”). These SOEs by law and nature had their own characteristics as shown
exhibited in the following table:

During this regime era, the “state control” over SOEs was levied under the Directorate
General of SOEs in the Ministry of Finance2. The state control means there was no
clear separation between the state’s ownership functions and state controlling functions.
Accordingly the state had absolute control over SOEs. While this power could have been
used to positively manage SOEs, many believed that SOEs were not managed properly3.
The poor performance of SOEs was not only because of their management, but also
because of the organizational structure and its unfavourable position4. In view of these
circumstances, SOEs had reduced their contribution to the state from time to time and
finally many of them were collapsed during the financial crises in the late 90s.

2.	Turnaround
The economic crises in the late 90s were the most important milestone in the history
of Good Corporate Governance practise in Indonesian SOEs. The collapse of large
corporations and financial scandals in several countries has brought attention on the
importance of corporate governance. During the crises, the government was forced to
reform the corporate governance system5. Accordingly, the government along with a
number of stakeholders such as the Capital market Supervisory Agency (Badan Pengawas
Pasar Modal - “Bapepam”, currently known as Financial Service Authority - OJK),
the Jakarta Stock Exchange (currently known as Indonesian Stock Exchange) and the
certain professionals launched several initiatives such as establishment of National
Committee on Corporate Governance (NCCG), the Indonesian Institute for Corporate
Governance (IICG), and the Forum for Corporate Governance in Indonesia (FCGI).6

Framework of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)
B.	           The Structure and Challenges for
	             the Governance of Indonesian SOEs

1.	 The Legal and Regulatory Framework
As an effort to establish strong foundation of Good Corporate Governance practise
in Indonesian SOEs, Government believes the importance of having a specific law
regulating SOEs in a more comprehensive manner to tap the business growth. These
needs were then responded by the issuance of Law No. 19 of 2003 concerning SOEs
(“SOE Act”). The Law has successfully addressed regulatory framework for the SOEs,
provided however it does not specifically address the good corporate governance related
issues. Despite of these fact, there are number of Good Corporate Governance (GCG)
codes/guidelines that could be taken as references for SOEs to implement GCG such
as those issued by the National Committee on Corporate Governance (“KNKG Code”)
and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD Guidelines”).
It should be noted that while these guidelines are not mandatory, especially to the
OECD guidelines where Indonesia is not an OECD states member, these guidelines set
out important references that can be followed by SOEs in exercising the GCG. The legal
reference concerning this respect was issued through the Regulation of SOEs Minister
No. 01 of 2011 (“GCG Regulation”) concerning the Implementation Good Corporate
Governance in SOEs.

The Issues:
While the Indonesian SOEs have already had legal reference to exercise GCG in
their operation, they remain bound to the other prevailing legislations. One of the
major challenges in this respect lies in inter-legislations consistency. As an example, the
inconsistency occurs amongst rules concerning capital structure of SOEs. In reference
to SOEs Law, the capital of SOEs is separated from the State assets. However, in
reference to the Corruption Act the losses of SOEs are in the category of State losses.
In view of this issue, the main concern here is that how to develop effective legal and
regulatory framework that favours SOEs best practice in implementing GCG.

Framework of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)                        The Governance Of Indonesian Soes
                                                                         Best Practices

       Developing effective legal and regulatory framework shall consider
       consistency aspects. Besides, this framework shall satisfy a number of
       requirements of GCG best practices and consideration of market economy
       where SOEs shall be granted equal access to commercial and legal certainty
       in carrying out its business activities as private corporations have. In doing so
       there has been best practice recognised. In the national context, KNKG code
       of GCG issued in 2006 setting out basic principles in promoting the creation of
       a healthy, efficient and transparent business climate. Accordingly this shall
       be implemented along with consistent law enforcement.



In reference to the OECD guidelines, in order to ensure effective regulatory
development, the first requirement is to make sure that state functions are separated.
This is aimed at preventing massive intervention from outside political interest groups
thus ensuring independency of the Boards in exercising their function to grow the
SOEs. However, it is thought that this could be the one and only measure exposed to
great challenges. Hence, while this seems not easy, this is the utmost requirement that
the state shall pay attention in managing SOEs through developing effective framework.
While the intervention shall be managed, Walker states that the rule of law should take
into account that some degree of governmental intervention to some extent is required7.
He further states that this intervention requires checks and balances for necessary
accountability and to prevent arbitrary and unfair actions8.
Simplification of operational policies and legal forms are the next important measure.
These are accordingly deemed as the measure that can be directly linked to reduction
of inconsistency. Accordingly, to approach this Walker indicates the core requirements
for a Legal System shall clearly define the roles, rights and responsibilities of the
directors, managers and shareholders. So, practically, the inconsistency can be mitigated
through developing clear definitions and conducting thorough reviews to the prevailing
legislations thus ensure if the more technical regulations will provide clauses that will
likely be against the higher legislations, such reasons need to be clearly explained.

Framework of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)                            The Governance Of Indonesian Soes
Apart from those two measures, some other measures from these guidelines are also
applicable and important to take into considering whilst developing the regulatory
framework. Besides, while there have been efforts to apply similar measures, there is a
need to keep the efforts going. One of these measures is Disclosure on SOEs obligations
and responsibilities. It is noted that certain public listed SOEs have disclosed their
performance, obligations and responsibilities uploaded in their website which is a
positive improvement. However, they shall keep ensuring that disclosure is updated.
Futher, SOEs shall not be exempt to get exposed over general laws and regulations. In
this respect, SOEs are subject to the other legislations and thus this principle has been
well done although often faced by a number of inconsistencies. When SOEs are faced
with this issue, it is thought that this is the time that the state to protect the interest of
SOEs without violating the rights of stakeholders and without violating the prevailing
legislations.
In view of the above Issues and their suggested mitigation measures, the OECD
guidelines provides that “the Legal and regulatory framework for SOE should ensure
a level-playing filed in markets where SOEs and private sector companies compete
in order to avoid market distortions”. Hence, the effective regulatory framework shall
stimulate good practice of SOEs in the efforts of GCG implementation.



2.	 The Position of the State as an Owner of SOEs
The position of state:
Considering the main objectives of SOEs to generate income and to serve public, the
authority of the state/government over the SOEs and how this is exercised is very
critical. The SOE Law clearly governs that the state is the owner of SOEs and a Line
Minister shall represent the state in an SOE. In reference to the Clause 14 of the Law
the Line Minister represents for and on behalf of the state as a the General Meeting
of Shareholders (GMS) where the state owns all of the shares in an SOE or only
as a shareholder where the state does not own the entire shares of an SOE. Hence,
irrespective to degree of shares possession, the Law guarantees that the control over the
SOEs is granted to the state represented by a Line Minister.

Concerns:
While the state may control the SOEs, the primary concerns lie in the effectiveness of
the Line Minister as the State representative to make sure that the SOEs can work accordingly.
In reference to the best practice as set out in the OECD guidelines, ideally “the state
should act as an informed and active owner and accordingly establish a clear and
consistent ownership policy, ensuring that the governance of SOE is carried out in a

transparent and accountable manner with the necessary degree of professionalism and
effectiveness”.
Many believe that the ideal stage where the state can act as a good owner over an SOE
is considered as a continuous homework to work on. Furthermore, there have been
numerous failures found in managing the SOE although sets of necessary legislations
to support positive change have been issued. The recent Pre IPO of Krakatau Steel
best illustrates state failures to act as a good owner of SOEs that yielded to turbulence
in their IPO launch where the initial stock price publicly offered was way too low9.
Besides, it was estimated only 2% of the entire stocks were offered to the public. Hence,
irrespective to the primary culprits determining this case, this issue shows the failure of
the state to act as a good owner over SOEs.



                                                                          Best Practices

       Best Practices: In improving the effectiveness of the Line Ministries there
       have been numerous efforts taken by the state. However, many do not feel
       that the government is a good representative of the state to manage SOEs.
       Accordingly they shall re-define their practice to ensure their effectiveness
       and accordingly they may consider some measures from international best
       practice. OECD guidelines have set up some measures that the state may
       consider in order to be a good owner of SOE. Accordingly, the state shall:
           1.	 develop and issue an ownership policy that defines the overall
               objectives of state ownership, the state’s role in the corporate
               governance of SOEs, and how it will implement its ownership policy.
           2.	 not be involved in the day-to-day management of SOEs and allow them
               full operational autonomy to achieve their defined objectives.
           3.	 let SOE boards exercise their responsibilities and respect their
               independence.
           4.	 define the exercise of ownership rights within the state administration.
               This may be facilitated by setting up a coordinating entity or, more
               appropriately, by the centralization of the ownership function.

               clearly defined relationships with relevant public bodies, including the
               state supreme audit institutions.
           6.	 exercise its ownership rights according to the legal structure of each
               company. Its prime responsibilities include:
              a.	 being represented at the GMS and voting the state shares.
              b.	 establishing well structured and transparent board nomination
                  processes in fully or majority owned SOEs, and actively participating
                  in the nomination of all SOEs’ boards.
              c.	 setting up reporting systems allowing regular monitoring and
                  assessment of SOE performance.
              d.	 when permitted by the legal system and the state’s level of
                  ownership, maintaining continuous dialogue with external auditors
                  and specific state control organs.
              e.	 ensuring that remuneration schemes for SOE board members foster
                  the long term interest of the company and can attract and motivate
                  qualified professionals.



While numerous efforts have been exercised to satisfy those principles, the only measure
that is unlikely to be easy to be applied is the government involvement in the day-to-day
management of SOEs to allow them full operational autonomy to achieve their defined
objectives. As previously already mentioned, by law they are the owner of the SOEs and
have full control over the SOEs.
In order to facilitate those best practices, the only way is through developing mindset
of the Line Ministers to exercise high degree of Commitment and Consistency in the
inclusion of GCG to the SOEs operation and to increase the corporate performance.
Besides developing trust allowing the boards to work autonomously and independently is
definitely required.

3.	 Equitable Treatment of Shareholders
The Shareholders Treatment Arrangement:
The right of minority shareholders in PERSERO is considered an issue. In reference
to the OECD guidelines, the state and the SOE should recognise the rights of all
shareholders and ensure all shareholders are treated equitably and have equal access to
corporate information. The equal treatment of shareholders in the Minister Regulation
01/2011 is governed in Article 10 which is provided that “the shareholders who possess
the same shares classification must be treated equitably (Equal Treatment)”. Further, this
regulation also reserves the right of Shareholders to attend and vote in GMS, access to
SOEs material information, receive dividend and other rights stipulated in SOEs, AoA
and Legislation10. Thus, these imply that the minority Shareholders have the same right
with the other Shareholders as long as they have the same shares classification.

The issues:
While there are almost no substantial issues concerning the equal treatment of
shareholders, it was quite common where the right of minority Shareholders triggered
the right of first refusal. While the issuance of Minister Regulation 01/2011 has
improved the practice, such issues in particular who should manage of minority
Shareholders of SOEs still remain. It is noted that are some uncertainties in terms
of a line minister managing the minority shareholders in the SOEs both as owner of
minority shares in private company and inside the SOEs itself.11 In this case, not only the
equitable treatments of shareholder that should be considered by the State, but it should
be concerned more to the minority shares ownership by SOEs in other company. For
public listed company, the minority shareholders regulation is subject to the regulations
issued by the Capital Market regulator. This body has issued numerous regulations that
may favour the minority shareholders in both private companies and SOEs.


                                                                         Best Practices

       It is noted that in practice minority shareholders are sufficiently protected and
       further in some cases market seeks to purchase minority shares and thus it
       is likely that in general in terms of the shareholder treatment the practice in

Overview of the Corporate Governance           520                       The Structure And Challenges For
Framework of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)                            The Governance Of Indonesian Soes
       Indonesian SOEs has closely met the following best practices:
           1.	 The coordinating or ownership entity and SOEs should ensure that all
               shareholders are treated equitably.
           2.	 SOEs should observe a high degree of transparency towards all
               shareholders.
           3.	 SOEs should develop an active policy of communication and
               consultation with all shareholders.
           4.	 The participation of minority shareholders in shareholder meetings
               should be facilitated in order to allow them to take part in fundamental
               corporate decisions such as board election.




4.	 Equitable Treatment of Shareholders
Theoretical Framework:
In terms of stakeholder relations, Allen and Gale (2000) argue on the effectiveness of the
agency theory approach based on several reasons. One of these reasons is “The agency
approach to corporate governance is somewhat narrow in its focus”. In many instances,
managers are responsible to other stakeholders, including employees, who may be legally
entitled to exert control on the firm’s policies.12 Further, Meidyah Indreswari also states
“in SOEs where the stakeholders’ value is the main objective, the emphasis of corporate
governance is to safeguard the interests of diverse groups such as employees, customers,
and the community at large”.

The Rights of Stake Holders:
In reference to Clause 38 the Minister Regulation, SOEs shall consider the right of
Stakeholders arising due to legislations and/or agreement entered into between SOEs
and employees, customers, and creditors as well as the society around SOEs, and other
Stakeholders. Hence, it is understood that SOEs have multiple stakeholders where their
rights shall be respected and thus the relationship amongst them shall be maintained.

Overview of the Corporate Governance               521                          The Structure And Challenges For
Framework of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)                                   The Governance Of Indonesian Soes
While the SOEs are mandated to consider the stakeholders rights in their operation, the
implementation shows some challenges. Managing employees in particular during privatization
is case in point. It is noted that there is no such clear governance on how to manage the
industrial relationship during the privatization. Yet, there have been apparent issues
whenever the privatization initiative will be launched there will be huge pros and cons
and this creates anxiety to the existing employees.


                                                                    Best Practices

       It is to reiterate that Stakeholders are parties concerned with the State due
       to its legal relationship with the State.13 SOEs must accordingly respect the
       rights of the stakeholders arising under the laws and regulations and/or
       agreements made by SOEs with its employees, customers, suppliers, creditors
       and the community around the concerned SOE, and other stakeholders.14
       Hence, it is thought that there should be no discriminations against the
       stakeholders in particular, in the context of GCG to employees based on their
       races, religion, class and gender.




Managing relationship with employee stakeholders is specifically governed under
the Employment Law No. 13 of 2003. This Law regulates a number of important
principles to favor mutual cooperation between SOEs and their employees. However,
some issues arise due to numerous reasons. Accordingly, OECD guidelines and KNKG
code have pointed out some measures that the state and SOEs shall consider to manage
stakeholder relationship such as provide reports on SOEs relationship with stakeholders,
develop stakeholders relationship ethics and respect the rights of stakeholders. These
principles amongst others include:
   1.	Governments, the coordinating or ownership entity and SOEs themselves should
      recognize and respect stakeholders’ rights established by law or through mutual
      agreements, and refer to the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance in this
      regard.
   2.	Listed or large SOEs, as well as SOEs pursuing important public policy objectives,
      should report on stakeholder relations.

   3.	The board of SOEs should be required to develop, implement and communicate
      compliance programmes for internal codes of ethics. These codes of ethics should
      be based on country norms, in conformity with international commitments and
      apply to the company and its subsidiaries


5.	 Transparency and Disclosure
General Point of View:
It is noted that Transparency and Disclosure issues are amongst the most critical points
in the SOEs operation and these remain challenging issues although the Indonesian
SOEs have been required to apply GCG in terms of transparency and disclosure. In
the past, lack of transparency and disclosure was apparent. These days, efforts to create
transparent SOEs seem to be everlasting homework for SOEs.
Governance of Transparency and Disclosures:
Information disclosure in SOEs is governed in Clause 32 of the Minister Regulation.
This clause states “SOEs must disclose important information on its annual report
and financial statements in accordance with the State laws and regulations not only
in a timely manner but also in an accurate, clear and objective way”. While SOEs
are required to be transparent they shall respect any confidential information. Unless
otherwise provided by statutory provisions, AoA, and/or company rules the external
auditors, internal auditors and the audit committee and other committees (if any), SOEs
must keep confidential information obtained while performing their duties. Accordingly,
it is the responsibility of both the BOD and BOD to maintain the confidentiality of
company information.
Transparency Vs Confidentiality:
The conflict between principles of transparency and disclosures and confidential
information is considered the primary issue that the Indonesian SOEs shall take into
account. Meanwhile, it is understood that there are no clear measures on the extent of
transparency and confidentiality. This is coupled with the fact that the Indonesian SOEs
are still reluctant in disclosing their financial statement15. Hence, the number of SOEs
who are listed in the stock exchange is low. Since the establishment of Indonesian Stock
Exchange (previously Jakarta Stock Exchange) dating back 20 years ago, there have been
only 18 SOEs listed16.

Framework of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)                          The Governance Of Indonesian Soes
While information disclosure has been clearly regulated under SOE Act, GCG
Regulation and Act No. 14 Year 2008 concerning Public Information disclosure, there
are no clear reasons upon the reluctance to exercise the transparency amongst the
Indonesian SOEs. Many believe that Lack of transparency seems to be an intentional
agenda of political interest groups and bureaucrats17. Hence, lack of transparency
is linked to inefficiencies in the SOEs18. One of the commonly noted cases is in the
budgeting in procurement of Goods and Services. This is the fragile area where the lack
of transparency entails to inefficiencies due to breach of integrity committed by the
SOEs boards and personnel.
Breach of Integrity:
While a number of SOEs have performed well, it is noted that many of them are
exposed to the alleged Breach of Integrity issue. In several SOE’s, there is a resistance
to commit to reforms, and often there are close ties between business and politics19.
Indeed, the integrity of SOEs personnel is still questionable. As widely known, a number
of officials in a number of SOEs have been committed to and processed for breach
of integrity allegations such as corruption and collusion. Hence, breach of integrity
issues may be considered as the top challenge in SOEs operations. In the last 3 years,
the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has processed quite a few
numbers of the alleged cases.
In view of Transparency and Disclosure issues, there is no quick fix to favor these in the
SOE operation. Go Public can be one of the best ways where SOEs can exercise their
transparency and disclosure initiative. However, the road to go there is quite stiff and
there is always a need to have right measures.

       While set principles of Transparency and Disclosures are accommodated in
       the GCG Regulation, this does not provide technical guidance on how SOEs
       shall be transparent and disclose their information vis-à-vis keeping the
       confidential information.

       In managing the stakeholder relations, in reference to OECD guidelines, the
       state/Line Minister shall:
           a.	 Observe high standards of transparency;
           b.	 Develop consistent reporting on state-owned enterprise operation and
               publish it annually;

               audit function that is monitored by and reports directly to the board and
               to the audit committee or the equivalent company organ;
           d.	 Be subject to an annual independent external audit based on
               international standards. The existence of specific state control
               procedures does not substitute for an independent external audit.
           e.	 Be subject to the same high quality accounting and auditing standards
               as listed companies. Further, Large or listed SOEs should disclose
               financial and non-financial information according to high quality
               internationally recognised standards.
           f.	 Disclose material information such as:
              -	 A clear statement to the public of the company objectives and their
                 fulfillment.
              -	 The ownership and voting structure of the company.
              -	 Any material risk factors and measures taken to manage such risks.
              -	 Any financial assistance, including guarantees, received from the
                 state and commitments made on behalf of the SOE. And
              -	 Any material transactions with related entities

6.	 The Boards of SOEs
	 (Responsibilities and the Appointment)

The Boards of SOEs both in the form PERSERO and PERUM are found similar
with those in regular companies. These mainly involve Boards of Directors (BOD) and
Boards of Commissionaire (BOC).
Board of Directors (BOD) is considered the executive organ of Indonesian SOEs
who runs them in daily basis. The BOD shall report to the Shareholders through a
General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS) mechanism. In view of GCG perspective to
the responsibilities of BOD, they shall perform their duties with good faith for the sake
of corporate goals and ensure the SOE perform its social responsibilities taking into
account the interest of the stakeholders20. Further, the BOD is required to avoid conflict
of interest21. So, in principles the BOD has set of duties mandated by law and this
regulation that they have to perform taking into account no conflict of interest principle.
The GMS appoints the members of BOD with an initial appointment period of 5
(five) years, with the possibility of extending the tenure period by 5 more years. The
appointment of BOD is considered as one of the critical aspects that entails to further
dynamics in the SOE operation as the state remains in possession of powerful authority.
In reference to clause 15 of the SOE Law, the GMS or a Line Minister are authorized
to appoint BOD. Further there is not yet further legal reference upon clearer mechanism
on the BOD appointment.
While the SOE Act and the SOE Minister Regulation state a number of criteria for
the appointment of BOD and this further detailed by the SOE Minister Regulation
No.4 of 2009 concerning the appointment of BOD in SOEs there is no clarity on the
conditions where the BOD members shall be appointed through GMS mechanism
or shall be appointed by a Line Minister. In practice where the minister appoints the
member of BOD, the members of parliament may not agree. One of the noted cases is
the appointment of President Director of PT. PTPN III. On this appointment, the vice
chair of Commission VI of the parliament, Mr. Aria Bima requested the SOE minister
to cancel this appointment22.
The Board of Commissionaire (BOC) is the organ that supervises the BOD and
provides advice. In addition, the BOC is able, at anytime, to take over BOD functions
in daily business activity in certain instances such as in the absence of BOD. Like BOD,

Framework of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)                         The Governance Of Indonesian Soes
The appointment of BOC is also one of the critical aspects that entails to further
dynamics in the SOE operation as the state remains in possession of powerful authority.
In reference to clause 27 of the SOE Lawt, the GMS or a Line Minister are authorized
to appoint BOC. Further, like the appointment of BOD, there is not yet further legal
reference upon clearer mechanism on the BOC appointment in terms of conditions
where the GMS or Line Minister is authorized to appoint the BOC.
In light of the appointment of BOD and BOC members, the dynamic can be a
political process that may involve members of parliament to interfere. Besides, failures
in appointing the right person to lead SOE may create repercussions that can be linked
to the management failures of the SOEs. The World Bank identifies one of the chronic
problems faced by SOEs elsewhere involves the ability and capability of the BOD23.
Further, the World Bank notes that members of the BODs are influenced and driven
by the government because most of them are public servants. This experience shares
similarities to Indonesian SOEs. This issue is coupled by various objectives amongst
Boards of Directors conflicting each other thus considered as Conflict of Interest. Board
members who come from labors also have their own agenda against the interests of the
company as a whole and vice versa24. These conflicting objectives are then brought to
where the boards exercise their responsibilities, and accordingly independency from
political affairs in such corporate actions is always an issue.



                                                                          Best Practices

       It is noted that the most intriguing dynamic in the appointment and
       responsibilities of the Boards of SOE (BOD and BOC) is political affair. This
       issue is strongly linked to the absence of clear separation amongst state
       functions as discussed above. While the political affair is normal and a sign of
       lucrative activities, the primary concern is that if this affair entails to failures
       in appointing the right members and assigning inappropriate tasks to wrong
       personnel.

In respect to the appointment of the SOEs boards (BOD and BOC), it is to reiterate
that the procedures are governed in the SOE Minister Regulation No 4 Year 2009. In
principle, in order to reduce the political process in the appointment of the Boards,
the appointment shall be made in transparent manner. This means there should be
clear measures on the appointment such as developing clear criteria of the candidates’
profile, clear stages of recruitment and there shall be evaluation team consisting the
professionals who will appraise the competency of the candidates. In light of these
matters, the procedures in the said regulation shall be exercised with high integrity.
Besides the appointment, another severe issue is found in the independency of exercising
the boards’ responsibilities. Accordingly, in order for the BOD to perform their duties
independently, any parties other than the organs of an SOE shall not interfere with the
management of the SOE.25 In so doing, again OECD guidelines indicate some of the
best practices and therefore the boards shall:
   1.	Have the necessary authority, competencies and objectivity to carry out their
      function of strategic guidance and monitoring of management.
   2.	Be assigned a clear mandate and ultimate responsibility for the company’s
      performance.
   3.	 Carry out their functions of monitoring of management and strategic guidance.
   4.	Exercise objective and independent judgment.
   5.	Develop employee representation mechanism.
   6.	Set up specialised committees to support the full board in performing its functions,
      particularly in respect to audit, risk management and remuneration. And
   7.	Carry out an annual evaluation to appraise their performance.

In addition to the above measures, to meet the requirement of accountability,
transparency and administration order the boards must:
   1.	Make the list of shareholders, the special register, the minutes of GMS and
      minutes of meetings of the BOD;
   2.	Make annual reports and financial documents;
   3.	Maintain all lists, minutes, and financial documents, and other documents;
   4.	Keep at the company domicile, the entire list, minutes, financial documents, and
      other documents.

C.	Summary

Corporate Governance rules, norms and procedures evolve gradually time to time as
SOEs grow and develop26. These days as the set of legislations concerning SOEs and
the implementation of GCG have been issued the SOEs have taken change initiative
and thus start applying GCG idea in their operation. Along with improving economy
in Indonesia and plummeting business climate occurring some of developed countries,
the businesses and the investor have turned their eyes to invest in Indonesia and one of
ways is to invest in the Indonesian SOEs. The government is confident that the IPO of
Indonesian SOEs is highly lucrative to foreign investors27. Hence, this is the right time to
change and develop GCG in the SOEs operation. However, given the issues surrounding
the initiatives, the GCG implementation shall be safeguarded.
The practice of SOEs during the new order era and the financial crises marked the
development of GCG inclusion in SOEs. The legacy of SOE operation from the new
order gave challenges and accordingly these challenges can be viewed in 6 perspectives
including the Legal and Regulatory Frameworks, The Legal Standing of the State as
an Owner, Equitable treatment of Shareholders, Transparency and Disclosure and the
Appointment and Responsibilities of the Boards. While there numerous initiatives to
improve the SOE operation through the inclusion of GCG have been taken, challenges
remain and there is no quick fix to overcome these issues. Accordingly continuous
improvement shall be taken to ensure that the inclusion of GCG can be safeguarded
and the goals of having SOEs with high accountability, integrity and transparency can
be achieved.
