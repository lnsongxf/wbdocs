The main rail corridors in India are part of the ‘Golden Quadrilateral’ connecting New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai
and Kolkata. They account for 16 percent of the railway network’s route length but carry more than 60 percent of
its freight load. Recognizing that the rail sector urgently needs to add capacity to these routes, the Government
of India has, therefore, approved a long-term plan to build dedicated freight-only lines, parallel to the existing
Golden Quadrilateral passenger and freight mixed traffic routes. The new freight network will allow trains to
carry more freight, faster, with greater reliability and at lower cost. The relief on the existing lines will allow
improvements in passenger services. On completion, the total corridor railway capacity will double, thereby
unleashing further economic activities and job growth.

The first two Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) to be built were the Western and Eastern Corridors. The
Western Corridor (Delhi-Mumbai), which is 1,499 km long and funded by the Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA), is in the early stages of implementation. The Eastern Corridor is 1,839 km in length and extends
from Ludhiana to Kolkata, traversing the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West
Bengal. The World Bank support for the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) was conceived as a series of
projects in which three sections (total length 1,176 km, including the Khurja-Dadri section) would be delivered
sequentially, but with considerable overlap in their construction schedules. The first loan (EDFC1) in the EDFC
Program was approved by the World Bank in May 2011 and is already being implemented. The second loan
(EDFC2) for the line from Kanpur to Mughal Sarai was approved by the World Bank in April 2014 and is also
being implemented. The table below provides information on the three EDFC sections which are supported
by the World Bank. The remaining 663 km of the EDFC is proposed to be funded by the Government of India
and Public Private Partnerships.

The Government of India believes that the large investments being made in developing the EDFC will lead
to large-scale job growth and overall economic development in the six corridor states. Based on an initial

non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) to prepare options for developments along the EDFC.

The initial work by the World Bank on the NLTA was directed and coordinated by the MoUD, Government of India.
Subsequent work by the World Bank is being coordinated by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion
(DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. The Uttar Pradesh state-specific work is
being conducted in close collaboration with the Department of Infrastructure and Industries, Government of

   An economic assessment of all 70 districts in Uttar Pradesh indicates that four sub-regions with
     14 districts show promising economic potential for industrial estates and logistics hub development.
   This report is based on fundamental economic analysis that considers:
     zz   Market accessibility
     zz   Industrial diversity
     zz   Commodity flow
     zz   Per capita industrial investment
     zz   Specialization in agriculture
     zz   Social conditions
   Four promising sub-regions have been identified:
     zz   Auraiya-Kanpur
     zz   Ghaziabad-Gautam Buddha Nagar
     zz   Aligarh-Hathras-Firozabad-Agra
     zz   Allahabad-Varanasi
   Based on discussions with decision-makers in the Government of Uttar Pradesh and Department of
     Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India and taking
     into consideration the World Bank’s India Country Partnership Strategy, the options paper suggests
     proceeding with Auraiya-Kanpur sub-region and, at a later date, focusing on Allahabad-Varanasi.
   Careful, systematic and financially viable implementation will be needed.
