Executive Summary

Study Context and Objectives

The North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment (NGEST), with its Wastewater Treatment Plant
(WWTP) and Recovery Scheme (RS), requires cost-efficient and reliable power supply to operate.
The Palestinian Water Authority (PWA), with the support of the World Bank (WB), the French Develop-
ment Agency (AFD), the Government of Belgium, the European Commission and the Swedish Interna-
tional Development Agency, has been developing the NGEST project with the aim of improving sanita-
tion in the Northern Gaza Governorate. The project is also to alleviate the complexity surrounding the
old Beit Lahia Wastewater Treatment Plant (BLWWTP) and the random lake formed around it due to
capacity limits. The NGEST project includes a WWTP with an initial daily capacity of 35,600 m³ (ex-
pandable to 65,700 m³) and an RS of 29 recovery wells to refill the ground water aquifer with treated
water and retrieve the infiltrated water for agricultural purposes. The WWTP processing loads at the
WWTP and the pumps at the RS have relatively high-energy consumption rates. But overall power
supply in Gaza is limited due to political obstacles, lack of power and fuel supply options, high cost of
fuel, and an inefficient and fragmented distribution network. All these are factors that hinder the opera-
tion of the NGEST plant.

Given the limited electricity supply in Gaza, the PWA, together with the Palestinian Energy and Natural
resource Authority (PENRA) and with support from the World Bank, sought to identify and assess the
most viable, long-term, and sustainable power supply options for operating NGEST. The objective of
this study is to review the already planned power supply options, suggest improvements to these op-
tions, propose a photovoltaic system, and identify the most viable, long-term, and sustainable power
supply option for the NGEST plant (assuming that an external solution to the issues may be difficult to
achieve in the short to mid-term).

The WWTP is almost ready for commissioning and the RS is planned for development. At the
time of writing, construction of the NGEST WWTP was around 95% complete. All buildings on site have
been completed and equipment is installed. During the site inspection in March 2015, the facility was in
good condition and solid workmanship was observed.

NGEST project site encompasses areas suitable for the installation of PV systems. No barriers to
the PV installation or the combined biogas/PV based on-site generation, supported by the grid and the
emergency gen-sets were identified during the site visit. While no major technical risks exist, NGEST
and the potential PV system are exposed to external threats due to the political situation, similar to other
infrastructure in Gaza. Since NGEST is located close to the border with Israel, any changes in the local
security setting might affect its operation.



Technical Assessment Results

Through the comprehensive analysis of the design loads and energy consumption, the project demand
profile was drawn up for the different project phases and two locations. The peak load of the WWTP and
RS together in 2018 is estimated to be 9 MVA with a daily energy consumption of 102 MWh (128 MVAh)
resulting in an annual energy consumption of 37,286 MWh (46,608 MVAh). In 2025, the peak load is
estimated at 15 MVA with a daily power consumption of 173 MWh (216 MVAh) resulting in an annual

energy consumption of 63,271 MWh (79,089 MVAh).

Current power supply has been designed to cope with the constraints of the power supply in Gaza.
The existing power supply options include an external supply from the Gaza Electricity Distribution Cor-
poration (GEDCo) grid via a 22 kV overhead feeder line and on-site generation from emergency diesel
generators with sufficient capacity to cover the load of the facility. Additionally, the local biogas as a by-
product of the sludge treatment cycle is used for electricity production.

The grid-based supply faces several obstacles impeding a reliable and cost-efficient operation
of the plant. These are mainly issues concerning power sourcing and payment structure of the
utility. Due to the shortfalls in the distribution network, on-site generation needs to bridge the
demand gap. GEDCo’s current situation underlines the need for optimising on site power supply and
only emphasises the importance of a PV system in creating a more reliable and autonomous operation
of the WWTP. The existing portfolio of on-site generation should be expanded to include a PV system
in the designated areas within the NGEST plant to allow for a more cost-efficient, sustainable, and reli-
able power supply.

The proposed PV system design uses proven and market standard technologies. The configuration
generates high-energy yields in a cost-efficient way. The PV system uses arrays composed of poly-
crystalline modules with a total rated power of 5.1 MWp. The fixed-mounted structure with a 25
degree tilt angle is adapted in its azimuth angle to the geometry of the areas. The assessment concluded
that this configuration has the lowest specific costs per installed module power and out of all evaluated
PV system variants; this option provides a high annual production at lowest costs. Decentralized invert-
ers with sizes suitable for each installation area were chosen to avoid mismatch losses between areas
with different orientation and to ease maintenance. The system generates an average of 8,442 MWh
annually over the project's lifetime totalling to 214,291 GWh over a period of 20 years. Investment costs
(CAPEX) are estimated at USD 1,350 /kWp which amount to a total value of USD 6,897,993 . The OPEX
appraisal resulted in an estimate of USD 9.44 /kWp totalling to USD 48,856 /annum.

With the optimised energy set-up for NGEST, the PV system increases energy independence, re-
duces expenses on costly diesel fuel, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. By incorporating
the PV system into the NGEST project, the annual supply from the grid in 2018 is reduced by 24% to
8250 MWh, and the required annual energy from the emergency diesel is decreased by 27% to reach
14,476 kWh. This reduces the diesel consumption by 30% and as a result, 1,293,615 litres of diesel fuel
would be saved.

The energy mix in 2018 is estimated to have the following structure: (i) a PV share of 8,909 MWh rep-
resenting 23.89% of the total annual power generation, (ii) diesel backup with 14,476 MWh (38.82%),
(iii) grid-based supply with 8,250 MWh (22.13%), and (iv) biogas contribution of 5,651 MWh (15.16%).
The following graphs show the energy mix for 2018 and 2025.

Environmental and Social Impact Assessment

For the preliminary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the proposed PV system,
Palestinian laws and World Bank guidelines were used as the main reference. The outcome of the
preliminary ESIA was reviewed by PWA's ESIA expert and World Bank's safeguard team and no con-
cerns were identified. The areas allocated for the PV system installation are part of the overall
NGEST terrain and have been already covered by a previous ESIA study. Nevertheless, the new
investigation of the impact of the proposed PV system on the local environment and the community
demonstrated that there would be no permanent negative impact beyond smaller disturbances
during the construction period.

Economic and Financial Analysis Results

An economic and financial analysis was conducted with the objective of identifying the costs and benefits
of the installation of a solar PV plant as a power supply option for NGEST. The financial analysis in
particular examines closely the investment profitability and the different potential financing scenarios.

Results of the economic and financial analysis at a glance:

   1. The economic and financial analysis of the different supply options concluded that a system with
      the PV option is the most reliable, cost efficient and sustainable option.
   2. The calculation resulted that the LCOE is USD 0.23/kWh for a system without PV, and the LCOE
      is USD 0.20 /kWh for a system with PV. This demonstrated that financial savings could potentially
      amount to USD 15,627,543 over a period of 20 years when solar PV is included into the energy
      mix for NGEST. Along with the cost saving potential, the installation of PV would lead to a higher
      autonomy in power supply, granting the emergency sewage treatment independence over 16%
      of its annual overall electricity need.

The total investment cost of USD 9.7 million was considered for the calculations and the different sce-
narios. This is due to the fact that the power supply options (PV, biogas, and diesel) are interrelated and
those options combined could only generate enough electricity to meet NGEST’s energy demand.

                                                                    Unit              Grand total

lated and evaluated.

Recommendations

Based on the feasibility assessment, the installation of PV systems at the two NGEST sites can be
recommended:

           The integration of the PV system into the existing electrical infrastructure is feasible
           Additional local electricity generation contributes to the autonomy of the overall power supply.
           The PV system reduces fuel consumption and grid reliance leading to emission reduction.
           The PV plant lowers the cost per energy unit and allows for cost savings over the project lifetime.

Consequently, the technical feasibility as well as economic and financial viability of the PV system is
confirmed. However, prior to the procurement and instalment of the PV plant, a few outstanding issues
are yet to be solved.

The following technical aspects should be clarified:

      1. GEDCo should be consulted on the proposed design and modifications to the network connec-
         tion at the point of common coupling;
      2. Update of the recovery scheme design to the proposal of the new contractor1;
      3. Development of the final grid connection design and update of the power supply agreement with
         GEDCo.

The investment and operational budget needs to be secured by clarifying relevant issues:

      1. The final commercial set-up needs to be decided upon.
      2. Given the ownership and risk structure it is recommended:

1   The EPC contractor ("Stulzgruppe Planaqua GmbH") that built the NGEST facility, more specifically the WWTP, almost to the
      finish went into bankruptcy in 2014. Consequently, a new Contractor had to be identified for finalising the construction and
      commissioning of the facility. Since this new company would have to guarantee for the works to a certain extent, it is very
      likely that there are minor modifications to the WWTP. In addition, whichever contractor will be responsible for building the
      recovery scheme will probably revise the existing design and drawings in order to reflect the latest status of the project. This
      offers the opportunity to integrate the PV plant in the design.

             a. the project be procured as a turn-key EPC bidding process and
             b. NGEST be the staff responsible for the operation.
   3.   Alternatively, the new contractor may be requested to propose a subcontract as addendum order
        to reduce interfaces.
   4.   The budget shall also foresee suitable contingencies for unforeseen expenses during:
             a. construction, e.g. additional expenses for system integration at the point of connection
                  interruption of works due to administrative procedures;
             b. operation, e.g. training of staff, repair of external damages.
   5.   The funding of the system needs to be confirmed by the institutions responsible for NGEST's
        budget.
   6.   A suitable structure for financing needs to be decided upon.

Since the installation of the PV system depends as well on external procedures, these must be
followed-up in parallel:

   1. Facilities at the Recovery Scheme (Stage 1) must be installed.
   2. Local permits and licenses must be available.
   3. Non-objection certificates from Israeli authorities must exist.

If these conditions are met, the implementation could commence. The proposed activities are outlined
below:

   1. Update of information basis and project condition:
           a. Identification permit, legal and security requirements with impact on implementation;
           b. Definition of principal technical restrictions;
           c. Update of drawings, if necessary.
   2. Preparation of bidding documents
           a. Drafting of the structure in compliance with World Bank guidelines and Palestinian reg-
               ulations;
           b. Elaboration of commercial definitions including contractor's guaranties;
           c. Definitions of interfaces and responsibilities of NGEST's contractor and other external
               entities such as authorities and institutions.
   3. Specification of technical requirements including interfaces, BoQ, data sets and drawings for
      bidders:
           a. PV system(s);
           b. Modification and optimization of existing energy supply;
                     i. Control and monitoring via SCADA;
                    ii. Integration with WWTP.
           c. Final review of design drawings and proposal of changes in the existing NGEST design

1.        Introduction

1.1       Background on the NGEST Project

The Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) is developing the North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment
(NGEST) project in North Gaza to improve sanitation in the Northern Gaza Governorate and alleviate
the complexities around the old Beit Lahia Wastewater Treatment Plant (BLWWTP) and the random
lake, which was formed due to capacity limits at the BLWWTP.

The NGEST project was designed with three main components:

     a) Part A: The installations of the Terminal Pumping Station (TPS) located at the BLWWTP, the
        construction of a 7 km pressure pipe line to conduct the wastewater from the BLWWTP to the
        NGEST WWTP site to eliminate the risk from the random lake and the building of nine infiltration
        basins (East to Al-Shuhada Cemetery).
     b) Part B: The construction of a waste water treatment plant (WWTP) adjacent to the infiltration
        basins with an initial daily capacity of 35,600 m³ (expandable to 65,700 m³) to treat the influent
        coming from the TPS and to provide long-term, sustainable solution to the sanitation services
        in North Gaza.
     c) Part C: A recovery scheme (RS) of 29 recovery wells to refill the ground water aquifer with the
        treated water and retrieve the infiltrated water for agricultural purposes by using it for irrigation
        of 1500 ha in the eastern part of the North Gaza Governorates. This measure shall help to
        achieve a positive impact by reducing the pressure on the limited coastal aquifer and by provi-
        sion of good quality irrigation water for the local community.

The processing loads at the WWTP and the pumps at the RS have relatively high-energy consumption
rates. Thus, reliable and economically sound power supply is a key requirement for operating NGEST.
The overall power supply, however, in Gaza is limited due to the Israeli blockade and constraints on fuel
entry into the Gaza Strip. High cost of fuel, limited capacity and fragmentation of the grid are yet addi-
tional predicaments hindering the Gaza Power Plant from operating at full capacity. As a result of these
challenges, the PWA, in collaboration with PENRA and with support from the World Bank (WB), is seek-
ing to identify the most viable and sustainable power supply option for the NGEST facility during its
whole life-cycle.

This feasibility study assesses power supply of Part B and Part C, because the TPS and connected
facilities grouped under Part A are already implemented and are operational. Further, the location of
these components that is 7 km away from the WWTP and RS, renders their inclusion into the integrated
power supply system impossible.




1.2       NGEST Project Timeline

The different expansion stages of the NGEST project, driven by increased loads are grouped into two
main phases: Phase I is planned to be completed by 2018 and Phase II shall be incorporated by 2025
(Table 1-1). Within Phase I, there are separate stages characterised by the annual increase of volume
of treated wastewater and effluent pumped at the recovery scheme. The uptake volumes are then re-

flected in the respective power demand and energy consumption at the two locations. The correspond-
ing energy profiles are assessed in the load and demand analysis of this report.

Part A is completed and in operation since 28 April 2009. The construction of Part B is completed to
about 95%. Due to an insolvency of the joint-venture leader of the treatment plant contractor, the project
is currently stalled waiting for conclusion of construction and final commissioning. The start of regular
operation is expected for the first quarter of 2016. The installation of Stage I of the recovery scheme is
expected by the end of 2016. Likewise, the implementation of Stage II is expected to take place towards
the end of 2017. In Phase 2 another expansion of the recovery scheme is envisaged.

This report thus separates the power supply situation into two main phases:

    1) Phase I with the planning horizon 2018 (to be completed by the end of 2017), where
          a. the main treatment plant is to be completed and commissioned by the end of 2016;
          b. the recovery scheme Stage 1 and Stage 2 to be completed.
    2) Phase II with the planning horizon 2025 (to be completed between 2019 and 2024) where
          a. an expansion of the treatment plant and an expansion of the infiltration basins;
          b. an extension of the recovery scheme.

The potential addition of the PV system is planned to be procured and installed within Phase I by mid-
year 2017. The assumption behind this scheduling is that the planning, detailing of the concept, system
specification and financing may easily take until the end of 2015 or later. The procurement will require
at least the first semester of 2016 and implementation including executive design, construction and
installation may take another year. Thus any power supply system with contribution from a PV system
would most likely be operational sometime in 2017. Although this would lead to the design horizon of
2018, full operation of PV already in 2017 is assumed in the study in order to assess the different con-
ditions during the upscaling of NGEST's operations. Some areas designated for installation of PV mod-
ules are on the recovery fields and connected facilities. Consequently, the implementation of the recov-
ery facilities is a precondition to the installation of the PV system at this location.

This particular timeline also explains the principal difference of the assessment of the power supply from
other projects currently in planning by the Palestinian Authorities. At NGEST, planning of the whole
system including basic power supply had been conducted in the past years and major components of
the system are already installed. The study presents a re-assessment of the designed and installed
structures and proposes modifications aimed at reducing interference with the existing project to a min-
imum. In contrast to this, other projects, such as the Gaza Central Desalination Plant or the Gaza Central
Wastewater Project are still on the planner's desk, which might potentially allow for integrating more
recent and advanced renewable energy technologies right from the start.

Feasibility Study

1.3         Power Supply Conditions

The principal objective of any power supply concept for NGEST is defined by the need to safeguard the
continuous and uninterrupted operation of the WWTP and the effluent recovery scheme.

The main reasons for analysing and reviewing the supply options are:

      a) The technical instability and unreliability of the local distribution grid, which render it unable to
         provide steady power supply.
      b) Projected high operational expenses from the on-site emergency diesel generators due to grid
         shortfall.
      c) Uncertainty of fuel supply, needed for running the diesel generators.

It is assumed that the current adverse conditions of the power supply system in Gaza will prevail at least
for the mid-term. Thus, the intermittent and constrained supply from the local distribution network is the
key driver behind any investigation into alternative solutions that could potentially bridge the supply gap
arising from the regular load shedding. This insecurity is what compels developers and operators of
critical infrastructure projects with high-energy consumption, such as the water sector, to ensure con-
stant operation by incorporating alternative sources of power supply into the exiting systems. Diesel
generators are normally used as a primary on-site emergency solution because the gen-sets provide
flexible and reliable energy to cover the loads. But this strength comes with a huge price tag and in-
creased emissions, as the facility requires a large amount of fuel to run the facility when in off-grid mode.
The high price of fuel needed for the diesel generators will further increase the operational budget of the
facility. In addition, the large reliance on diesel increases the overall environmental footprint of the pro-
ject. As a consequence of the high fuel costs, there is need to identify alternative solutions in order to
ensure sustainable power supply. The biogas as by-product of the sewage treatment process has al-
ready been considered as an alternative fuel source in the design of the NGEST WWTP. Given the
availability of spare land within the areas of NGEST’s jurisdiction and given the good solar resource in
Gaza, incorporating a photovoltaic system into NGEST’s energy portfolio seems to be a logical step.

Consequently, the NGEST project stakeholders aspire to catch the two ends of this challenge through
an optimisation of the existing set-up and the inclusion of a PV system:

        Higher independence from intermittent grid-based supply;
        Fuel cost saving during times when the grid is unavailable.

The consumption of NGEST is determined by the fixed load and variable process consumers. The op-
eration of the wastewater treatment plant and its flows is the leading driver for the fluctuations of the
variable demand:

        When wastewater inflow is high, power demand from the different components will rise and vice
         versa;
        The production of biogas depends on this process flow and its cycles.

The general power network situation leads to two operational scenarios which the power supply struc-
ture must be capable of supporting:

    1) On-grid mode – when the facility is mainly supplied from GEDCo network:
           a. All consumers can be supplied and normal operation is ensured;
           b. The embedded captive on-site renewable energy generation (biogas, PV) would reduce
                costs of energy supplied by GEDCo in an auto-consumer or net-metering fashion.
    2) Off-grid mode – when the facility has to self generate the required power:
           a. The limited supply from the grid may necessitate the management and curtailment of
                some loads, e.g. the non-priority consumers such as some wells in the recovery
                scheme;
           b. The embedded captive on-site generation (biogas, PV and diesel) would need to ensure
                the provision of the required power and heat. Renewable power from biogas and PV
                would serve as fuel-saver for the emergency diesel displacing costly fossil fuel as much
                as possible through operation as auto-producer.

The technical analysis and economic evaluation will therefore need to:

       verify if and how these envisaged operational set-ups can be sustained;
       assess the consequences for the technical concept design and operation;
       evaluate the associated costs and economic viability.




1.4       Objectives of the Feasibility Study

The objective is to review the planned power supply, to propose improvements to it including the as-
sessment of the installation of a photovoltaic system and, finally, to identify the most viable, long-term
sustainable power supply option for the NGEST facility under the expectation that an external solution
to the issues may be difficult to achieve in the medium term.

Guiding questions of the study:
    1. Which supply option ensures a reliable and sustainable operation of the NGEST plant on a long-
       term basis?
    2. How would a more autonomous generation supported by PV with less GHG emissions need to
       be designed and implemented?
    3. Which approach shall be adopted to finance the energy supply and potential PV plant of the
       NGEST plant, and how should the project be commercially structured?

The study answers these questions through (1) evaluation of the loads and consumption of the sewage
treatment facility and effluent recovery scheme, (2) review of the existing supply options; (3) assessment
of the share of each supply option on the total demand; (4) development of a conceptual PV system
design to be added to the portfolio of local generation sources; (5) optimisation of the utilisation of re-
newable sources (biogas and solar PV); (6) analysis of the economic implications and financing options;
and finally (7) proposal of a suitable project structure with a way forward to implementation. Each of
these assessment steps are regarded as decision gates, where available options or variants are evalu-
ated and recommendations based on the results of analysis are provided.

The assessment is complemented by a preliminary environmental impact analysis, an outline of the
implementation strategy as well as an appraisal of the effects on the local political economy.

2.          Site Conditions

2.1         Localisation of the Site

The NGEST plant site and recovery fields are located south east of Jibalya municipality and west of the
Israeli border as shown on the satellite imagery in Figure 2-1. The main NGEST plant is situated closer
to the border and south -east of the al-Shuhada cemetery. The effluent recovery and reuse scheme is
planned on the north east side of the al-Shuhada cemetery. At both locations there are electrical loads
required to drive the processes and operation of the facility. For the local electrical supply during off-grid
periods, generators are foreseen as backup power at the two locations. Within the two boundaries of
the two sites, certain areas have been designated by PWA for the installation of PV systems.

The construction of Phase I of the NGEST plant has been completed to about 95%. All buildings have
been completed, and equipment is installed. During the site inspection, the PWA had given proof that
there are no major obstacles which would block the commissioning of the facility although some minor
punch list items would still have to be finished. These items involve mainly non-critical civil or mechanical
work.

The recovery scheme is then planned to be added at the later Stages 1 and 2 of Phase I and then finally
expanded in Phase II. Currently, this Waqf2 land (common property) lies fallow but is rented out on a
seasonal basis for farmers for cultivation of seasonal crops.

2.2         Overview of the Areas Designated for PV Systems

The areas of the NGEST project potentially considered for the design and installation of PV systems
were identified by the PWA using site drawings of the facility3. The drawing4 identifies the areas within
the current boundaries of the treatment plant and additional areas on the recovery scheme. An overview
of these areas is provided in Table 2-1.

Most of the abovementioned areas have been visited and assessed during the site visit, except for areas
A3, A9, A10 and A11, where access was not possible during the short time of the site visit and due to
security reasons. But all areas were visually screened from high-standing points.

It is not expected that the terrain and characteristics differ from the other areas. This assumption is
based on existing data on the areas, i.e. from the digital elevation model of the area, topographic survey
and topographic maps, the slope and shape of the terrain can be confirmed.

3 All suitable locations from the designated area presented by PWA were taken into account when designing the PV system. On
     the roof-top locations only installed facilities (HVAC / water tanks) were excluded. There is no other available adjacent land
     to expand the plant. The NGEST plant itself is built close to the green zone. Additionally, land is extremely scarce in Gaza,
     and this designated land is available because it cannot be built on, and is Waqf land.

2.3       PV Areas within Treatment Plant Boundary

Within the treatment plant, suitable space is available on the rooftop of all major buildings with the ex-
ception of the power house (“Blower and Energy Building”). The areas around the facilities’ installations
(open space for ground-mounted systems) are available at the boundaries of the plant. The areas are
shown in Figure 2-3.

2.4           PV Areas at Recovery Scheme

The second location with designated PV areas is the effluent recovery scheme behind the cemetery. It
can be reached either via an untarred road from Jibaliya or by following the road along the plant’s fence
and then branching left at the northern site corner. These areas are illustrated in Figure 2-4.

Figure 2-5 below shows the planned locations of the recovery and reuse scheme wells. The Google
Earth screenshot was provided by PWA.5 It separates the wells into 15 wells to be constructed in Stage 1
depicted in yellow, while the 14 wells, marked in green, are proposed for Stage 2. The PV areas to the
west of the cemetery are part of Stage 1. This explains that the implementation of Stage 1 of the recovery
scheme is a pre-condition for the PV system at that location.

2.6       Environmental Conditions and Resources

2.6.1     General Climate Conditions

Gaza Strip enjoys typical Mediterranean weather conditions with one wet and one dry season. The wet
season extends from October to April and the dry season extends from May to September. The average
rainfall varies from less than 200 mm in the south to nearly 500 mm in the north. Average rain intensity
is 45 mm/hr, but often exceeded in storm events (60 mm/hr). The average is 25°C (min 11.6 - max 31)
while average humidity is at 68%.

and climate.


2.6.2      Reference Irradiation and Temperature

The P50 and the P90 TMY provided with the Solar Atlas have been used for simulation of the PV system
and calculation of the energy production.

The TMY data set corresponding to the probability of exceedance of 50% (P50) for a representative site
in Gaza was used as meteorological input data. The data for this site was generated as part of the Solar
Atlas. The location has a distance of about 4 km to the NGEST site as shown in Figure 2-6. Based on
the previous research6, the data generated for this representative location can be used for the design
without significantly increasing the uncertainty.

3.        Analysis of Loads and Consumption

3.1       Design Loads

As outlined in the introduction, the capabilities of the wastewater processing and the volume of effluent
pumping will be scaled up during the project phases and extension stages. Likewise, energy consump-
tion increases proportionally and requires an upgrade of the capacities. This development of energy
demand, process loads and the subsequent requirement on increased generation capacity during the
project lifecycle is illustrated in Figure 3-1.


Figure 3-1:      Energy demand, process loads and power requirements over project lifecycle




During the planning and design of the WWTP and RS, the individual process components had been
selected in accordance with the estimated inflow volume. Based on the power consumption and opera-
tion time of each device the total design load of each phase was determined. As shown in Figure 3-2,
the total design loads will reach 9 MVA in Phase 1 (until 2018) and 15 MVA in Phase 2 (until 2025).

The details of the demand profiles of the two locations at each phase are discussed in the following
sections. This demand analysis forms the basis for the later energy balance described in section 7.2.



3.2                          Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP)

The file “Consumers rev.01.10” received from PWA lists the demand details of the water treatment pro-
cesses related consumers in the WWTP. For extracting the load profile of these consumers, some as-
sumptions are taken into consideration:

          The profile of the inflow from the TPS is the single driver for the flow pattern at the WWTP.
          The daily profile is developed using the given hours of and load factors listed in the file. Accord-
           ing to the discussion with PWA, the components of the WWTP which do not work continuously
           for 24 hours are estimated to form a peak load during the noon time. The starting time of each
           consumer was then set according to its daily operation hours, e.g. consumers with 8 hours of
           operation start at 08:00, consumers with 4 hours of operation start at 10:00 …etc.
          According to information provided by PWA, the inflow does not have any significant seasonality.
           The design of the WWTP does not show that greywater from street gullies and roofs will be
           treated at the WWTP. Consequently, the daily consumption profile of the WWTP is assumed to
           have similar characteristics throughout the whole year.
          Assumed power factor of 0.8 was applied to all design loads and power sources within NGEST 7.

The demand of the WWTP per day for Phase 1 has a daily peak load of 1.3 MW and a daily energy
consumption of 19.75 MWh. This process based demand was scaled from 1.3 MW to match the total
design load values, e.g. 2.5 (2015), 2.75 (2016) and 3 (2017), provided by PWA in Table 12-15 for each

7   Information and data on total design load [MVA] by PWA assumes the power factor 0.8 whereas the consumer data states
    demand of daily energy [kWh/d]

year (see also Figure 3-1). The scaling difference makes up the fixed consumption for lighting and se-
curity system, HVAC, control and general purpose sockets.

The daily profiles of the years 2018 and 2025 are shown in Figure 3-3. The resulting power consumption
in 2018 is 37.31 MWh (46.63 MVAh), while the consumption in 2025 is 62.18 MWh (77.72 MVAh).

3.3       Recovery and Reuse Scheme

Based on the data received from PWA (Table 12-15), the designed load for the recovery and reuse
scheme is 2 MVA for Stage 1, 4 MVA for Stage 2 and 4 MVA for the extension resulting in 10 MVA for
the whole scheme. The demand at the RS is made up of two functions, the strong booster pumps and
the recovery wells. The consumption of the wells is calculated directly from the provided data (55 kW/unit
working for 6 hours per day). The total consumption of the pumps has been scaled in such way that
consumption tops up the demand of the wells and thus reaches the designed load frame mentioned
before (10 MVA) while applying the different utilisation factors of the devices. The total of the daily load
profiles of the wells and pumps in the recovery and reuse scheme in Stages 1 and 2 expected for 2018
is plotted in Figure 3-4. The total energy consumption per day is 64.85 MWh (81.06 MVAh). After the
implementation of the Recovery Scheme extension in 2025, the resulting daily consumption is shown in
Figure 3-4 and totals to a daily energy consumption of 111.17 MWh (138.96 MVAh).

On the basis of the individual load profiles of each of the two locations, the total load profile for NGEST
has been derived by adding the loads and consumption at two locations. Figure 3-5 elaborates the total
daily demand of NGEST in 2018 and 2025. As shown in the figure Figure 3-5, daily peak load reaches
9 MVA in 2018 and power consumption is 102.15 MWh (127.69 MVAh), while in 2025, daily peak load
reaches 15 MVA and power consumption is 145.21 MWh (181.52 MVAh).

Since no seasonality is taken into consideration and a constant power factor of 0.8 is assumed, the
annual demand can be calculated as shown in Table 3-1. The total annual energy demand in 2018 is
37,286 MWh and in 2025 it is 63,271 MWh.




3.4       Annual Consumption

The annual energy consumption of the WWTP is 13.6 GWh and 23.7 GWh at the recovery scheme

totalling to 37.3 GWh in 2018. The consumption of the NGEST project reflects the expansion in the
planning horizon 2025, the consumption at the WWTP increases to 22.7 GWh per annum and the ex-
tension of the RS leads to 40.6 GWh annually resulting in a total demand of 63.3 GWh in 2025. The
project demand is summarised in table Table 3-1.

4.        Current Power Supply

4.1         Current Power Supply Concept and Design

The current power supply concept – as a result of the general concept and the Contractor’s design –
consists of the following components:

     1) External supply from the GEDCo grid via a 22 kV overhead feeder line (assessed in section 4.2)
     2) On-site generation from emergency diesel generators described and reviewed for their capabil-
        ity to support further diversification of the generation portfolio in section 4.3.1.
     3) On-site generation from biogas as by-product of the sludge treatment cycle described in section
        4.3.2.

After review of existing designs and related documents (design review report, engineer’s approval notes,
and data sheets) the design process for the above components can be described as follows:

        The design load was derived from the maximum consumption resulting from the total of the fixed
         consumption of the general operation and the variable demand arising from the treatment plant
         process components.
        The diesel generators were designed to cover the fixed and variable load under the assumption
         that not all components are operating at the same time and even consumption would follow
         different patterns throughout the day (e.g. no lighting during day time, less need for HVAC during
         night).
        The dimensions of the biogas engine and related components like gasholder and gas flare are
         derived from the estimated daily gas production from sludge processing.
        The grid supply was installed to meet the full design load at Phase 1.

This means that the current design assumes that:
     supply is largely dependent on the grid;
     maximum possible utilisation of the existing biogas .

In the next Section 5.1, the modification of this setup by adding a PV system as additional on-site gen-
eration option is briefly described.

The number of planned generation units and the individual power rating corresponding to each unit are
listed in Table 4-1. The illustration of the resulting on-site generation capacities in Figure 4-1 provides a
good overview of the power sources installed at NGEST.

4.2         External Supply: GEDCo Distribution Network

4.2.1      Brief Description of GEDCo

GEDCo is mandated to distribute electricity to all areas within the Gaza Strip under the control of the
Palestinian Authority. Its responsibilities reach from billing, technical supervision and maintenance
works, to improvement of the supplying system of the low voltage (0.4 kV) and the medium voltage
network (22 kV). GEDCo is the sole provider of electricity services in Gaza. 8. This means that based on
Palestinian Law, any new Power Purchase Agreements with Israel must be done by the Palestinian
National Authority (PA) with PETL9 in the West Bank. In Gaza, GEDCo is the PA’s partner. Conse-
quently, such initiatives are political and legal matter in the hands of the PA but surpass the scope of a
single project like NGEST.

GEDCo is a private limited company that is 50% owned by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and
the other 50% by local municipalities and councils. The corporation was established in 1998 by minis-
terial decree and all duties of electrical energy distribution were transferred from the different municipal-
ities in the Gaza Strip to GEDCo. Overall, the corporation delivers services through 5 branches in the
Northern district, Middle area, Khan Yunis, Rafah and Gaza city, distributing energy to 1.8 million Pal-
estinians.

GEDCo’s distribution system is supplied from the IEC, the GPP and a small portion of energy is pur-
chased from Egypt.10 Due to GEDCo’s control over the only three external power supply options in Gaza,
it also has a price monopoly. While the Palestinian Territories have a unified sales tariff, GEDCo sets its
own tariffs. As shown in Figure 4-2, these tariffs did not fluctuate over the last 3 years:

GEDCo's mark-up price and margin are particularly low when compared to the tariffs in the region,
mostly due to the daily electricity cuts of 6-12 hours. Moreover, political reasons also influence the low
retail price policy.

The tariff margin – the difference between the purchase and the sales price – in Gaza is currently at
16%11. This margin should allow the conclusion that the purchase prices over the last couple of years
looked as in Figure 4-3.

4.2.2       Power Purchase Sourcing



The Gaza strip has three different energy sources. The different share of these types on the total supply
is presented in Figure 4-4 for 2013.

There was unfortunately no information available on the sales tariff structures of GEDCo's three energy
sources. GEDCo only clusters its customers in three categories but does not indicate the different
source-purchase prices behind the overall tariffs as shown in Table 4-2.

Nonetheless, the following chapters 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.3 and 4.2.2.2 will highlight the most important influ-
encing factors of each source on NGEST's energy supply.


4.2.2.1    Domestic Production by Gaza Power Plant (GPP)

29 % of electrical energy used in the Gaza Strip is generated by the diesel fuel operated Gaza Power
Plant.15 The plant however, suffers from inadequate fuel supply due to sanctions from Israel on the
amount of fuel permitted to enter Gaza, and due to high taxes imposed on fuel imports. These obstacles
limit the overall electricity production of GPP to 50%. The power station requires a minimum of 400,000
litres of industrial fuel per day16 to produce 65 MW 17,18 while at least 450,000 litres per day are required
to produce at its full capacity of 80 MW 19 with the current status of the facility. Due to the lack of fuel,
there is a broad load shedding scheme, and severe continuous blackouts. Another source for the short-
fall in generation is the effectively availability capacity at the plant. According to PENRA, the original
capacity of the power plant is 130MW. After damages arising from bombardments the defective compo-
nents were replaced. The newly installed transformers had a smaller capacity and thus it was not pos-
sible to recover the full capacity of the plant 20. End of 2014 PEC reported to have repaired the plant

which now achieves a peak power of 92.40 MW 21.

Since GEDCo is incapable of guarantying constant power to consumers in Gaza, it also stated its ina-
bility to supply NGEST’s full demand for electricity, in its power supply agreement with PWA signed in
September 201322. Therefore, the grid will not be able to be used as the only power source for NGEST.


4.2.2.2     Sourcing from Egypt

A share of up to 8% of the electricity consumed in the Gaza Strip is imported from Egypt23. GEDCo
purchased 124,521 MWh from the neighbouring country in 2012 at the cost of 7,318,119 USD (purchase
price 0.05 USD/kWh).24

While power shortage remains a key predicament in Gaza, additional electricity imports from Egypt
seem highly unlikely in the next couple of years due to energy shortages in Egypt, and as the political
tensions persist between the administration in Gaza and the current Egyptian government.

4.2.2.3     Sourcing from Israel (IEC)

In addition to domestic power production, GEDCo is supplying NGEST with electricity imported from
Israel. The Palestinian territories are largely dependent on imported energy from neighbouring coun-
tries. Around 88% of the energy consumed in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip comes from Israel
through IEC.

Purchasing electricity from Israel has been challenging due to the issue of non-payment for electricity
services in the years from 2010-2013. Around 37% of the bills from IEC to electricity distributers in West
Bank were not paid in 2013. In Gaza, non-payment to the IEC is 100%. GEDCo was the largest non-
payer in the Palestinian territories from 2010 – 2013, accumulating a staggering debt of USD 471 mil-
lion.25

This non-payment or the so-called net lending has reduced the PA’s available revenues by an estimated
USD 280 million in 2012. In February 2014, the debt amounted to a total of USD 330 million. Even if this
debt were to be reduced or dropped by IEC through common agreement with the PA, new debt would
accumulate over the next couple of years.

Therefore, actions need to be taken to address and resolve the underlying problems of non-payment for
electricity services in the Palestinian Territory. In addition IEC supply is not sufficient to meet the demand
in GEDCo's grid and therefore it does not grant NGEST autonomy over its energy supply.

4.2.3         Economic Review

Based on the information gathered and presented above, an economic review of GEDCo’s tariff struc-
ture was conducted. The following inputs were considered:

Global data:

Assessment period:                        20 years
First year of assessment:                 2015

GEDCo tariff to NGEST:26

0.15 USD/kWh incl. VAT
0.13 USD/kWh excl. VAT

Specific financial parameters:

Discount rate:                            7%
VAT:                                      18%

The Levelized Cost of Electricity was obtained using this formula:




LCOE              Levelized cost of electricity in Euro/kWh
I0                Investment expenditures in Euro
At                Annual total costs in Euro in year t
Mt,el             Produced quantity of electricity in the respective year in kWh
i                 Real interest rate in %
n                 Economic operational lifetime in years
t                 Year of lifetime (1, 2, ...n)

Variation of LCOE:                        +/- 5% to +/- 10%

NGEST is currently paying 0.15 USD/kWh (0.6 ILS/kWh incl. VAT) as agreed upon in the power pur-
chase agreement between GEDCo and PWA. The NGEST tariff is the equivalent to GEDCo's category
3 sales tariff for "industrial users connected at low voltage level, industrial users connected at medium
level, water pumps, agricultural areas, street lights and temporary services".

The end user tariff of GEDCo has been analysed by a calculation of the economic Levelized costs of
Electricity (LCOE) over an assessment period of 20 years, starting in 2015 under consideration of GED-
Co's tariff excl. VAT of 0.13 USD/kWh offered to NGEST.27

This approach shows what the LCOE would look like if GEDCo had to supply the full energy demand of


26     Tariff according to Sept. 2013 Agreement between GEDCo and PWA
27   It should be noted that in absence of some relevant information, in particular the percentage of operation costs in relation to
       the costs of the energy purchased by GEDCo they were estimated at 20%

NGEST. The equivalent evaluation corresponding to the different supply options assessed can be found
under section 0 of this report.

For the LCOE the following variants were considered:

    -   Constant
    -   Increase (5 and 10%)
    -   Decrease (5 and 10%)

The fluctuations were put into place in order to show different price variables and give a better insight
into possible future developments, i. e. changes on the agreement between GEDCo and PWA for the
power supply of NGEST. Of course the variations in price levels cannot conclusively be assessed over
a period of 20 years but the levelization gives a comprehension of constant price, increased price and
decreased price. The differences of the LCOE's are shown in Figure 4-5 below.


Figure 4-5:      Levelized Costs of Electricity +/- 5 and 10% (prices indicated in USD/kWh excl.
                 VAT)




The constant economic price of 0.15 USD/kWh (excl. VAT) can be predicted for the energy tariff from
GEDCo if the price guarantee remains as is. In the variation "increase" it ranges between 0.24 USD/kWh
at 5% and 0.39 USD/kWh at 10%. In the variation "decrease" it ranges between 0.10 USD/kWh at 5%
and 0.07 USD/kWh at 10%.


4.2.4     Technical Capacity of the OHL Connection Line

As described under site conditions, in Section 2, the WWTP and RS are connected to GEDCo network
by one 22 kV OHL exclusively built for supplying the project. Based on information provided by PWA,
the network connection is exactly designed to provide the design load of 13 MVA targeted for Phase 2.
A brief check of the dimensioning of the conductor (3x150/25 mm² ACSR Conductor Type Rabbit) re-
veals that the line capacity would only be reached if very high ambient temperatures are observed or
additional power is routed through this line. Once NGEST is complete (including Phase 2), there will be
no room for feeding of excess energy, i. e. surplus PV power, from NGEST facilities back to the network
during the periods of high-energy demand at the site or during high temperatures. The solution proposed

4.2.5     Technical Availability of the Grid

Even though the capacity of the connection line is sufficient, the actual capability of the network to supply
the required power cannot be confirmed. As mentioned before the availability of electricity from GEDCo
is not guaranteed at all times due to political reasons. The distribution company therefore responded to
this constraint by implementing a rotational load shedding scheme throughout the Gaza Strip. GEDCo
network is subject to cuts and connects as follows:

    -   6 hrs ON and 12 hrs OFF or
    -   8 hrs ON and 8 hrs OFF (depending on fuel availability for the GPP)

All consumers are thus forced to either remain idle during the blackout times or to compensate for the
deficit of the grid by installing on-site generators. This pattern is used in the calculation of the energy
balance in section 7.2 to assess the extent to which the demand could be covered by the regular net-
work.

For the diesel fuel quality the following standards shall be respected:

       ASTM D7467
       EN 590

When assessing the igniting quality, the cetane index may serve as reference. In comparison to the
biogas engines the diesel engines can be easier to operate due to the quick response to an immediate
charging or discharging.

4.3.2     Biogas-based Generation

4.3.2.1   Biogas Engine and Sewage Gas

The biogas-based electricity production capacity was designed by the NGEST Contractor and was
based on data on the volume of waste water to be treated in NGEST (and hence resulting sludge).

A gas engine generator set with the key properties shown in Table 4-4, taken from the datasheet dated
16.04.2012, is currently installed. Another machine with the same characteristics is planned to be added
in the next phase.

The fuel for operation of the engine is the sewage gas produced by the water treatment process. In
order to allow a smooth operation of the generator, the gas has to adhere to certain properties. The
sewage gas shall be dry, when entering the storage tank. Furthermore the sulphur content has to be
eliminated by a special process-technology. Otherwise the “inside atmosphere” of the gas engine will
create sulphurous acid (H2S) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) which will cause extensive corrosion prob-
lems and shorten the life-cycle.

An important characterising figure is the Methane index. The methane index describes the ignition qual-
ity of a fuel gas. A methane value of 100 is presented by methane CH4, a gas with a very high ignition
quality resulting in smooth burning without any knocking. In this case it is not necessary to equip such
an engine with knocking sensors. A methane number of 0 is presented by hydrogen, which shows a
very poor combustion quality with precipitated uncontrolled ignitions.

In terms of ignition quality sewage gas is a very good and acceptable fuel gas. However the high CO 2
content makes the engine very slow in taking step charges. Thus, differing heating values have to be
considered. It needs to be mentioned that reciprocating gas engines tend to load fluctuations which are
difficult to be handled and eventually will cause vibrations.


4.3.2.2   Biogas Production

The average gas production is 6,576 m3/d, while the peak gas production is 7,307 m3/d based on the
scenario of 2018. In order to obtain the biogas production value for the 2025 scenario, the above values
are scaled based on the increased capacity of the WWTP in 2025 from 3 MVA to 5 MVA; resulting
average gas production is 10,960 m3/d while the peak gas production is estimated at 12,178 m3/d.

4.3.2.3   Electricity Generation from Biogas

According to the provided biogas generator catalogue, the electrical output capacity of the generator is
800 kW, with operating hours of 20 hours/day, resulting in an energy generation of 16,000 kWh. The
annual electricity production totals to 5,840 MWh/year. An additional biogas generator will be installed
by 2018 to be ready for operation in 2019 and onward, increasing the electrical output capacity to
1,600 kW and annual electricity production to 11,680 MWh/year, provided that the required gas amount
is available.


4.3.2.4   Gas Storage

With an electrical efficiency of around 43%, the input energy is 37,420 kWh. The amount of fuel supply
needed for satisfying the energy input can be calculated from the fuel specific energy content, which is
6.5 kWh/m3. Accordingly the amount of fuel required per day is 5,757 m3/d.

In 2018, the average annual storage amount of biogas is 819 m3/d, while in 2025, the average annual
storage is -600 m3/d, which leads to a lack of gas required to operate the generator at full load.

As a result, the potential of gas storage is low; the stored amount is less than 15% of the used amount
for fuel input. This amount is too small to justify the addition of an additional generator in Phase 1 or
even enlarging the storage. In 2025, gas storage potential is of a negative value. Both values lead to
the conclusion that biogas generation has been sized well to fit the estimated gas production.

5.         Photovoltaic System

5.1          Intended Modification by Adding a PV System

The existing power supply summarised in the previous sections shall be modified by installing a PV
system on suitable free areas of the project. The aim of the modification is to

        reduce the operation times and effective load of the emergency diesel generators in order to
         save fuel during load shedding hours;
        increase the share of energy from renewable energy sources and thereby to reduce GHG emis-
         sions.

Consequently, the proposal for modification of the existing design consists of:

     1) Installation of a PV system on the available areas within and around the NGEST site (as de-
        scribed and assessed in section 5.1);
     2) Analysis of the potential for an increase of the biogas holder in order to store the produced gas
        during times of high PV production and balancing of the variable PV output in times of low
        generation (e.g. evening hours, during cloud cover), described in section 7.2 and;
     3) Analysis and identification of adjustments in the energy management and control of the gener-
        ation systems for optimisation of the interplay of components, especially during times when the
        project is in off-grid (island) mode as evaluated in section 7.3.3

5.2          Approach for the PV Design

The design uses the results of previous assessments on solar energy and application of PV technology
in the Palestinian territories:

        A dedicated study on the general market potential of solar power in The Palestinian territories
         and strategies28 for its adoption.
        The solar resources and energy generation potential 29 have been analysed on country level in
         the Atlas of Solar Resources.
        The renewable energy generation including solar PV technologies were assessed for their con-
         tribution to energy supply in The Palestinian territories.30
        A draft renewable energy law has been formulated by the Government in 2015.31

The report on renewable energy sources30 provides a good introduction to the technologies, general
system set-ups and comparison of typical design variants. Thus, this section on PV design variants
presents possible solutions for the requirements of the NGEST project.

The PV plant design itself was developed in a two-step approach:

    2) Elaboration of concept design (Basic Design): a design as input to a functional specification for
       the most favourable variant.



5.3         Planning Target and Design Conditions

The design target for the PV system is to achieve maximum output though a cost-effective configuration,
while maximizing the use of the allocated areas.

More specifically, the PV plant will be designed to adhere to the following technical design conditions:

   The plant should be designed as grid-connected PV plant tied-in to the existing network and man-
    aged by the NGEST SCADA – meaning that the grid will be built and managed by another compo-
    nent and the PV system will synchronise thereon;
   It is critical to optimise the use of the designated and available areas for ground mounted generators
    and roofs of the major buildings as provided by PWA/NGEST and so the PV plant will encompass
    several sub-systems;
   It should employ only proven technology for the system components;
   It should have maximised yield using the available areas by the choice of:
          o appropriate technologies for key components;
          o a suitable connection to the LV and HV distribution panels;
          o an optimum plant geometry: tilt angle, and azimuth.
   The plant should be developed in a way that maintenance can be performed easily by trained and
    skilled local technicians and where the requirement for specialised spare parts is reduced as much
    as possible.
   It should allow for an uninterrupted operation of the treatment plant facilities itself and seamless co-
    operation of all components of the power supply system through tight integration with the existing
    electrical infrastructure of NGEST.



5.4         Design Variants

5.4.1     Technology Selection for Key Components

The technologies for the main components, modules and inverters, are pre-selected based on the fol-
lowing considerations. For instance, crystalline silicon (c-Si) technology is regarded as preferred cell
technology for the PV modules, based on (1) the track-record; (2) current market share of such modules;
and (3) the average rated power.

The higher rated capacity of the c-Si modules when compared to other technologies such as thin film
modules would also lead to a higher yield per available area. Nevertheless, the potential higher output
of c-Si based PV arrays is demonstrated by comparing simulation results of the c-Si variant with the
highest production against the results of an alternative configuration using thin-film modules.

Small and light but yet well performing de-central multi-string inverters are regarded as the most appro-
priate choice for NGEST. This type offers simple handling and thus allows for easier maintenance pro-
cedures. The resulting topology of the PV arrays would allow for a high level of flexibility in the design
and installation. Since the inverters are attached to the mounting structures or installed on the roof-top

space need for DC cabling over long distances is reduced and the outgoing AC cables could be con-
nected at any suitable location in the electrical infrastructure of the NGEST project (e.g. the LV panels
of buildings). The small multi-string units facilitate connecting lower (partially shaded rows) to a dedi-
cated MPPT input and therefore reduce impact of shading.

The use of smaller rated inverters, in comparison to one or two central inverters per each array, leads
to a quite significant number of inverters. They are managed by the PV monitoring system, which also
provides the necessary functions to identify and localise faulty equipment. The SCADA system concept
is described in section 5.5.4. The modularity of the configuration leads also to a higher redundancy. This
means that the impact of maintenance failures and shortcomings as well as external damages (e.g. by
vandalism or missiles) is reduced and replacement can be carried out easily. Central inverters require
highly skilled and specialised technicians. Such work is usually conducted by the staff of the manufac-
turer and would be affected by the issues that make trips to the project location difficult, e.g. because of
security concerns or closings of the crossings. Market trends have shown that the multi-string segment
has become more and more powerful in the recent years in both performance and power rating. Its
efficiency is more or less on par with the central inverter and the price difference between the two types
has decreased significantly.

The selected inverter type is suitable for outdoor installation because its housing is IP 65 protected. It
does not require to be placed in dedicated technical rooms. The inverters will be attached to the back
side of the mounting system. This makes a dedicated heat evacuation obsolete, as the units have on-
board ventilation and wind can circulate around. This is regarded as advantage in this project with its
scattered installation areas.

5.4.2        Description of Possible PV System Configuration Options

The basis for the development of the PV variants is the CAD drawing32 with the designed PV areas
defined by PWA.

With the key components defined (section 5.4.1), the possible PV design variants are mainly determined
by the adaptation of PV arrays and structures to the geometry of the designated areas and the different
mounting structures. They are distinguished by variations in the main configuration parameters of the
mounting system: the tilt angle and the azimuth.

The possible configuration options for the rooftop areas are:

       1) Fixed structures with optimum orientation at azimuth 0° – i.e. modules facing true south – and
          using the optimum tilt angle;
       2) Fixed structures with geometry adjusted orientation where modules are aligned to follow the
          geometry of the area (i.e. in parallel to the roof edges) and the tilt angle is modified in such a
          way as to maximise installation capacity, if appropriate;
       3) Fixed structures but with East-West orientation and a lower inclination angle.

For the brownfield areas, where ground-mounted structures will be used, more mounting options are
available:

       1) Fixed structures with optimum orientation at azimuth 0° – i.e. modules facing true south – and
          using the optimum tilt angle;
       2) Fixed structures with geometry adjusted orientation where modules are aligned to follow the

       geometry of the area (i.e. in parallel to the main area borders) and the tilt angle is modified in
       such a way as to maximise installation capacity, if appropriate;
    3) Fixed structures but with East-West orientation and a lower inclination angle;
    4) A series of 1-axis tracker arrays;
    5) Two-axis trackers, which can be installed on all available areas and additionally the banks be-
       tween the infiltrations basins.


5.4.3     Preliminary Qualitative Evaluation of PV System Configuration Options

After an initial qualitative evaluation of the above listed configuration options, the following set-ups and
areas can be discarded:

       The roof spaces on the silos and towers are not considered due to the circular geometry and
        small area.
       The East-West configuration, depicted in Figure 5-1, which became increasingly popular in the
        recent years, mainly for roof-top systems, offers the advantage of installing high module capac-
        ities by considerable saving on row-to-row space. Due to the lower tilt angle and orientation
        towards East-West, this configuration has a smother daily generation profile – both effects that
        are generally favourable for NGEST. This configuration was discarded from further detailed
        evaluation due to the following reasons:
             o High packing density leads to reduced space between the module rows. This makes it
                 more difficult to access to the modules and string cabling and requires profound expe-
                 rience in maintenance.
             o The same technicians who will be responsible for the PV plant maintenance will proba-
                 bly also be in charge other components at NGEST. Therefore, access to the compo-
                 nents for fault detection and defect remedy should be easy and all areas should have
                 similar configuration. This would not be possible with the East-West variant
             o Since the areas are not strictly oriented in East-West/North-South direction and do not
                 have a rectangular shape, the effect of higher capacity would not be leveraged on all
                 areas.
             o East-facing modules would potentially lead to glare and blending of the military border
                 installations of the Israeli military.
             o The variants in this feasibility study shall demonstrate the range of potentially feasible
                 solutions in order to select the degrees of freedom for technical requirements of the
                 bidding documents. E-W configuration is regarded as possible and can potentially be
                 allowed as possible solution in the bidding phase.
       One-axis trackers, similar to the two-axis trackers, enable to achieve higher yields by tracking
        the sun position in one or two dimensions throughout the day. Consequently, such configura-
        tions would theoretically increase the share of PV penetration in the power supply. But due to
        space requirements, trackers show their benefit only in larger multi-megawatt power plants,
        where the available area is not the limiting factor. In such projects and in contract to NGEST,
        investors aim to optimise the return on investment rather than the total system output. Apart
        from this general observation 1-axis trackers have minimum requirements on width of the in-
        stallation area because one or many module tables are connected to one or more central motors
        via a gear or lever arms. The geometry and size of the given areas hardly meet this requirement.
        However 1-axis trackers are included in the further analysis to demonstrate this effect and to
        support the evaluation of variants with actual results.
       The situation with the 2-axis trackers is slightly different. Similar to 1-axis trackers a considera-
        ble space is required around each tracker structure to avoid that shadow from one tracker is
        casted on other trackers installed around. Thus the distance between structures is higher than

            for the fixed structures. Since 2-axis trackers use single-pillar foundations instead of the multiple
            pole foundations aligned in longitudinal rows used by 1-axis trackers, this mounting option gives
            more flexibility in the placement of the units. The trackers could potentially be installed at loca-
            tions, where other mounting structures would not fit, i.e. the high slopes of the infiltration basin
            embankments or the dams between the basins.

Summarising, the two mounting types – 1-axis tracking and 2-axis tracking – are not regarded as suita-
ble for the design conditions. The E-W option as a variant of the fixed installations is regarded as feasible
but not assessed further based on the reasons provided above. The tracked variants are included in the
comparison of variants in order to substantiate the statements above. With this, the evaluation of vari-
ants includes the most promising configurations but also those variants that represent corner cases in
this particular project.

5.4.4        Definition of the Evaluated PV System Variants

The complete PV system variants have been formed by a combination of the corresponding roof-top
and ground-mounted configuration options explained in the previous sections. Based on the qualitative
evaluation in section 5.4.3 and taken into consideration the design conditions, the following variants
have been defined for further evaluation:

              a. Roof-top area: fixed structures with optimum orientation at azimuth 0° – i.e. modules
                  facing true south – and using the optimum tilt angle;

                 aligned to follow the geometry of the area (i.e. in parallel to the roof edges) and tilt angle
                 is modified in a way to maximise installation capacity, if appropriate;

5.4.5     Assessment and Ranking of Variants

Using the system parameters and results as input (see the details on the variants in the ANNEX, section
12.3.2), variants 1 to 5 were compared. The key characteristics of the configuration are summarized
again here to illustrate the differences in the configuration:

    1) Variant 1
           a. a polycrystalline 60 cell module with a 25 kVA 3 phase inverter.
           b. Modules orientated to true South (Azimuth 0).
    2) Variant 2
           a. a polycrystalline 60 cell module with a 25 kVA 3 phase inverter.
           b. Modules orientated to maximize space utilization instead of maximum yield.
    3) Variant 3
           a. a polycrystalline 60 cell module with a 25 kVA 3 phase inverter mounted on a single
               axis tracker (N-S axis) to achieve a higher output.
    4) Variant 4:
           a. a polycrystalline 60 cell module with a 12 kVA 3 phase inverter mounted on a double
               axis tracker to achieve the highest possible output by following the sun path.
    5) Variant 5:
           a. a CIS module with a 25 kVA 3 phase inverter mounted.

When comparing the space utilization, a significant difference between the fixed mounted systems and
the tracker installations is identified. The lower capacity of the tracker installation is a result of the re-
quirement for higher distances between the individual trackers needed to avoid shadows from one mov-
ing module area to the other in the morning/evening. Although the 2-axis tracker of Variant 4 can com-
pensate some of this capacity deficit by its flexibility in positioning – the device can also be installed
between the basins where all other kinds of PV lack ground area are to be mounted – it cannot even
catch up with the single axis tracker in terms of installed capacity.

The rooftops only contribute with 154 kWp (Variant 1) to maximum 172 kWp (Variant 2) to the installed
capacity. Due to this relatively small amount it might make sense to exclude them completely and con-
centrate on the ground mounted system. This would facilitate the execution of the project in several
ways: less variety of components, no need for working in heights, elimination of the existing but techni-
cally manageable risk of water leaking through the roof.

The installation of Variants 1, 2 and 5 is relatively easy as there are no moving parts and modules are
in comfortable working height. Variant 3 and 4 have motors so that the modules can follow the sun.
Installation of this structure is more sophisticated compared to fixed ones.

The maintenance of trackers requires more effort. Motors can fail and every moving part needs more
frequent inspection and maintenance. As a rule of thumb, maintenance of trackers can be regarded as
twice as cost intensive as maintenance of fixed PV arrays.

The tracker-based solutions show the highest specific yield. Due to the sun tracking, more energy can
be produced with the same amount of modules. Nevertheless, it is recommended to start with employing
fixed mounted systems in new upcoming PV markets. The lower specific investment and operational
costs are an advantage. Likewise the lack of understanding on how to install and maintain trackers can
lead to malfunction of trackers, which would then reduce the actual yield significantly.

When comparing the specific yield of the fixed solutions the improved performance of the CIS technology
based on thin film modules stands out clearly. Thin film modules in general are attributed to work better
with diffuse irradiation and under high temperatures. In comparison with other thin film technologies,
CIS modules show higher efficiency. But also this type of thin-film technology cannot be compared with
polycrystalline modules technology when it comes to specific yield. The higher output is due to the higher
conversion efficiency of c-Si modules. Consequently, the total energy output by polycrystalline modules
is still higher than of thin film modules because this technology achieves more capacity on the same
ground area.

Developed in the 1990s and in mass production since 10 years, CIS is a very promising but it is still
considered the youngest generation of PV module technologies 35. Critical effects like "light-soaking"
are rarely discovered but they are hardly tested on field. An available field test only covers a few years.

The polycrystalline module used in the other variants is one of the oldest PV technologies, installed and
approved in many GW of PV plants.

Finally, when comparing Variant 1 and Variant 2 it may be highlighted that by installing 7% of extra
power, 6% more energy can be produced, which is a good compromise if maximizing energy production
is the highest aim of this PV plant.

With the results from the preliminary design of the variants 1 and 2, the possible capacity and generation
by the E-W configuration can be roughly estimated. Assuming a module tilt angle of 10° and using the


35 Another thin-film module technology largely employed in   utility scale projects is CdTe. In such settings, the technology achieves
   very low LCOEs. In the context of this particular project the technology is not regarded as suitable due to the following
   reasons: (a)          The cadmium tellurite material is quite stable as long as the module is left intact. Concerns may arise that
   the toxic cadmium can be dissolved when the material is exposed to extreme heat (e.g. under a fire). Due to this reason the
   technology is less recommended for manned buildings and in areas with high risk of fire. (b) 2.             Limited number of sup-
   pliers may lead to reduced choices of/for bidders (c)            The comparison of variants aims to show the different configura-
   tions (fixed, orientation to follow area, tracked). The best configuration can equally be equipped with c-Si or thin-film. This
   depends on the specification and the contractor. And since the design target of the project is high energy output on the
   designated areas, higher installed power can be achieved with current silicon based module technologies. Even if the perfor-
   mance of (any) thin film is theoretically better than crystalline modules, this effect is outweighed by the higher area efficiency
   of c-Si modules

total net installation area of 75,68 m², the system capacity can potentially reach 8 MWp. This increase
of capacity leads also to higher CAPEX. Due to the higher capacity, the E-W variant would not reduce
the excess renewable energy generation observed during the peak hours (see section 7.2). This is
because although the daily profile is smoothened by the orientation towards morning and evening hours,
the additional capacity increases the daily peak leading to an increase of surplus energy at the WWTP
during these hours. The annual yield for an E-W configuration is estimated at 10,926 MWh by scaling
the specific generation for the exemplary area A7 with the potential capacity. Specifically on the largest
roof area A7, an estimated capacity of about 57.2 kWp would generate 93 MWh/year, which results in
a yield factor of 1638 kWh/kWp/year. The Variant 2 fits 43.7 kWp on the same roof but has a specific
production of 1714 kWh/kWp/year, which yields 74.86 MWh/year. This shows that the configuration of
Variant 2 is the most efficient in both – output, use of available space, and ultimately installation costs
per generated energy unit. The E-W configuration maximises the available space and therefore offers
the highest total annual output in absolute numbers. Since it still adheres to the design conditions it may
be allowed as a possible variant in the bidding documents.


5.4.6     Selection of Preferred PV Design Variant

As a result of the assessment of configuration options and the comparison of the variants, Variant 2 is
recommended as the preferred variant for the Concept Design. The advantages are summarized:

       highest installable capacity for the available area while maintaining quasi optimum configura-
        tion;
       Highest annual production;
       Moderate CAPEX;
       Relatively trouble-free operation due to absence of moving parts and facilitated maintenance
        with a fixed structure that can be repaired by local staff and contractors;
       Shows that in this case where absolute output is of more importance than financial return, fixed
        structures show clear advantages over trackers.



5.5         Conceptual Design for Preferred Variant

5.5.1     General Plant/Array Layout

The proposed 5.1 MWp design uses the concept of the selected Variant 2 and is mainly characterised
by the following components:

       Arrays composed of poly-crystalline modules offering high efficiency at low cost;
       The fixed 25-degree racking structure is easy to install and has lower maintenance cost com-
        pared to tracking systems. The azimuth of the PV arrays was adapted to the designated areas
        instead of aligning all modules straight to south. This allows for maximizing the installed capacity
        and by that also yielding per area, expressed in kwh/m². The resulting higher installation capac-
        ity (+7%) outweighs the losses (-1%) in comparison to an optimal alignment of the system to-
        wards South.
       A decentralized inverter with sizes between 15 and 25 kVA was chosen not only to avoid mis-
        matching losses between differently aligned areas, but also because of its simplicity in mainte-
        nance. These inverters can be exchanged by one single person, if necessary.

The 5,109 kWp PV plant can be divided into 2 different structure types. Free field - ground mounted

In the free field always 22 modules in series create a string and are mounted on one table (independent
mounting structure). For the rooftop in general also 22 modules make up one string but this rule is more
flexible and, in order to reach the highest utilization of the roof-top space, sometimes strings with fewer
modules are allowed. In any case the strings were designed in such a way as to never exceed the
limiting inverter parameters like maximum and minimum MPP voltages, max system voltage or currents,
considering local maximum and minimum temperatures.

Row spacing of 2.20 meters for free field and 1.10 meters for rooftop is necessary to avoid major shad-
owing from one row to the other. The above mentioned distances were defined to avoid row shading on
the shortest day in the year (21st of December) for at least 4 hours, assuming a PV plant aligned to the
South. Besides shadowing the row spacing is important to ensure good work flow in installation and
maintenance. Both values leave enough space for installers to move between rows and if necessary
even drive in vehicles.

The existing infrastructure at the NGEST facility can be used as temporary storages during the time of
the installation of the PV plant as in Drawing 001 and Drawing 002 which are mainly already prepared
and can be used.

There are three different types of connection for the separate PV areas to the electrical system of the
NGEST facility:

    1. The roof-tops sub-systems are connected on LV directly to the connection point of the building
       using the existing electrical infrastructure. This means no additional AC wiring is required to
       connect the roof-top to the electrical network. By choosing connection locations, the PV gener-
       ation will reduce the building consumption to a lower residual demand (net balance).
    2. The free field sub-systems are connected to the main switchgear of each location, i.e. the
       Blower and Energy Building of the WWTP and the Electrical Room at the RS:
           a. Using AC combiner boxes, the LV cables are guided to this panel.
           b. Due to the long distances between the areas A3 / A9 and the power house an extra
                transformer at A9 is included to elevate voltage allowing transferring the energy to the
                powerhouse at 22 KV, where it will also be connected in medium voltage. By using the
                higher voltages, the otherwise enormous cable losses could be avoided.

Since Gaza is located in a relatively humid area, all types of structures, racking, module frames, con-
nectors, etc. should be made out of aluminium or galvanized steel.


5.5.2      Electrical Design

5.5.2.1    DC Side

         Due to the decentralized inverter solution, DC circuits are very simple. Depending on the inverter
          size, between 3 and 5 strings lead to one inverter. A string holds between 14 and 20 modules.
          The standard cable is a 6 mm² copper solar cable. This is sufficient to keep energy losses on
          DC and AC cabling in STC conditions below the established limit of not more than 2%. In places
          with extremely long distances 2 x 6 mm² solar cable or 1 x 10 mm² can be used.
         The inverter serves, apart from its principle function of converter of DC power into AC power,
          as the control unit brain of the PV array. Most of the protection and monitoring tasks are exe-
          cuted by it. The design limits itself to three different inverter sizes, 15, 20 and 25 kVA, in order

Feasibility Study Report issued on 01.04.2016
                                                       - 67 -




          to keep complexity of the installation low.
         The inverter type used for all three sizes chosen in this conceptual design have an "All-pole
          sensitive residual-current monitoring unit" which substitutes the string fuse and a DC surge ar-
          restor type II to protect against electrical surges and spikes. With this solution there is no need
          for external DC boxes between modules and inverter which simplifies installation and mainte-
          nance as well as reduces costs. A less sophisticated inverter would need a string box with a DC
          surge arrestor and 12 A to 15 A DC string fuses to secure the string against over and reverse
          currents that might occur during installation by switching positive and negative pole of one string
          in the system.

5.5.2.2    AC Side

         AC cabling starts with 16 mm² cables at the inverter and goes to a local AC combiner box
          positioned in a short distance to the inverter. These local combiner boxes gather cabling of up
          to 5 inverters and transfer the energy to the connection point. In the case of the rooftop systems,
          the energy distribution box of the proper building serves as the connection point. In case of the
          free field areas, and due to longer distances, cabling diameters of 240 mm² copper will be
          needed and in some places two cabling systems will have to be installed in parallel.
         The long distance of 650 m from area A3 and A9 to the point of connection creates a challenge
          for the transmission of energy. Long low-voltage cables shall be avoided because of the high
          losses. The voltage drop along long cables can lead to a mal-function where the inverter is not
          capable of recognizing the low voltage as the grid voltage. If no alternative solution was chosen,
          every combiner box would need at minimum 3 cable systems in parallel with 300 mm² copper
          each cable to keep losses below 1%. For the 4 AC combiner boxes this configuration would
          result in ca. 30 km of single core 300 mm² copper cable, which needs an enormous cable trench.
          Although technically possible a more suitable solution was found in the implementation of a
          local transformer at area A9, which elevates the voltage to 22 kV and transfers the energy from
          A3 and A9 using a 35 mm² cable with only 0.03% of energy losses to the point of connection.
         The cable from the inverter to the local AC combiner box is relatively short. This setting allows
          for using only 50 A circuit breakers in the combiner box, which in its turn permits to spare another
          breaker at the AC side of the inverter. Indeed, this configuration implies proper signalling on the
          equipment. All other cables are protected at the beginning and at the end with circuit breakers
          that have an over current protection as well as the possibility to be turned off and on under load.
          This is well depicted in Drawing 019, where the 250 A circuit breakers can be found in the AC
          boxes and the medium voltage box to protect the cable from over-currents as well as for dis-
          connecting the cable section from both sides in case of maintenance.
         To ensure grounding of the PV plant, all rows are connected to each other by a Ø 10 mm gal-
          vanized round bar steel underground. Connections between the tables are made with a Ø 8 mm
          Aluminium grounding jumper over ground as shown in Drawing 011. To ground the PV module
          frame a special grounding clamp is used. The grounding system should also be connected to
          the already existing grounding system.
         Lightning protection as in Drawing 012 is foreseen to avoid strikes into the modules or DC ca-
          bling. Sufficient arrestors are distributed in the fields to cover all areas and with a height of 7 m
          these overtop even the highest rooftop by more than 3 m.



5.5.2.3    Connection to existing Electrical Infrastructure of the Facility

As shown in Drawing 017 and Drawing 018, the incoming AC cables from the free-field sub-systems
connected to the main switchgear are split among different bus bars and LV/MV transformers due to
capacity limits of the individual bus bars and transformers. Starting with Drawing 019, the set of SLDs



Palestine: Power Generation (Solar PV) for North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment Plant
Feasibility Study Report issued on 01.04.2016
                                                       - 68 -




shows at first the single-line-diagram of the PV sub-system. In the subsequent drawing, an SLD detailing
the connection of that very system part to the NGEST grid. Area 1 is connected to transformer EMT 11
of the Blower and Energy Building, Areas A2, A4 and A4' are connected to trans-former EMT 21. Areas
A3 and A9 are combined using an MV line, as described in section 5.6.2.2, which is connected to the
same bulbar as EMT 11 and EMT 21. Area 12 of the recovery scheme had to be split up because of its
size and is hence connected to the 3 transformers: TRF-06, TRF-07 and TRF-08.

The rooftop areas A5, A6, A7 and A8 of the WWTP have relatively small PV power and are connected
directly to the incoming bus bar of the LV panel of the particular building before the main circuit breaker,
as shown in Drawing 029 and Drawing 030. The Fuse of the panel board, which is connected to the PV
plant is usually defined by the size of the PV plant which is very small with 40 kWp (A7). The expected
maximum currents from the PV plant to the bus bar are around 58 A per phase on the 35 mm² cable.
This is why as the first suggestion 70 A was applied for a fuse. For the buildings at the RS hosting the
rooftop areas A13 and A14 no details on the LV system are available but the same concept applies.

All inverters have anti-islanding protection and are delivered with the corresponding country code. The
switch gears and all AC boxes are to be equipped with appropriate warning signals showing operating
and maximum voltages and currents as well as necessary instructions for installation and maintenance
teams.

To protect the PV plant from surges and spikes from the grid side AC surge arresters are implemented
in all main combiner boxes.



5.5.3     Mechanical and Civil Works

Drawing 001 and Drawing 002 show maintenance paths and exits. Due to the already existing structures
a lot of roads and access points can be utilized for the PV plant. Only for A12 and A1 a significant
amount of additional roads was planned due to the large size of these PV areas. All the rooftops are
easily accessible, for example by ladder or scaffolding and allow use of a standard forklift.

Ramming posts are foreseen as foundation at all the free fields (see Drawing 015). As for the rooftop
system, the appropriate solution to fix the system onto the roof is to cast concrete blocks as a foundation.
The rooftop structure can be mounted on these blocks using concrete anchors. The free mechanical
load of the rooftop should be checked prior to applying this solution.

Usually certain batches of delivered equipment like AC combiner boxes, modules or inverters accumu-
late during construction works. It is therefore recommended to guard the items in containers on the pre-
defined storage areas to ensure the well estate of these components. Some extra containers for the
installation crew, tools and toilets help to keep the site in order during installation.

Layout Drawing 13 shows typical cuts of cable trenches. Solar cable is usually protected by conduits,
thicker cable can, if authorized by the manufacturer, be buried directly in the ground. The width and
depth of cable trenches as well as conduit size are always a compromise between cost and installation
ease as well as electrical safety. Generally, cables can lie closer together in PV systems than in other
installations because PV systems do not deliver energy for 24 hours. Since there is no electricity pro-
duction at night cables can cool down. So heat conduction is not as big of an issue as in other systems,
where cables can conduit energy for 24 hours a day. The drawing also shows the grounding conductor
that is usually laid 10 cm below the power cables and the warning tapes, which are necessary to warn
against potential damage during future excavations.

As long as solar cables run parallel to the mounting structure ducts, plastic hooks or cable ties are the
preferable solution to fix the solar cable. Once the cable leaves the structures, trenches with conduits
are the more elegant solution to save space and leave the surface free for lawn mowing and other
maintenance labour.

Even though water does not affect cables and the modules directly because of the IP 67 protected
junction box, a surface drainage system is planned to avoid the accumulation of water, especially next
to the racking structure where water could influence the statics (see Figure 12-2). Critical paths are
expected to be next to the slopes near the basins and next to sealed areas (roads).

Fences are only foreseen for areas A12, A9 and A3, as they are outside of the main area which is
already fenced. Access to area A12 will be provided via two gates (see Drawing 002).



5.5.4     SCADA and Monitoring System

5.5.4.1   Basics of PV performance monitoring

Monitoring is crucial to utility scale sites with high performance requirements. It alerts the operator to
take action on underperforming areas of the solar facility. By comparing the output of different inverters
installed at the same site, underperforming parts can be identified. Monitoring can be configured up to
different levels of detail. The most comprehensive finest solution would be monitoring each module; the
most basic solution would only monitor the output of the whole plant. The chosen concept of monitoring
each inverter is the compromise between the two extremes and leverages the advantages of the dis-
tributed set-up representing cost benefit wise the adequate solution. Since some strings are combined
with DC combiner boxes, the acquired aggregated monitoring data represent at maximum units of
28.6 kWp. Since most inverters can provide data for each input connector and each MPPT, higher res-
olutions of data are even possible.



5.5.4.2   General Concept

Drawing 014 provides an overview of the topology of the proposed concept for the SCADA system. A
main cluster controller can communicate with a maximum number of 75 inverters and can be connected
to the local communication network, which could be connected to the extranet. This enables to integrate
the PV SCADA System into the already existing SCADA System. The whole system, PV plant and
sewage treatment can be monitored and controlled from one, or more, control rooms (NGEST admin-
istration and station building / remote O&M Contractor's control centre) and inverter power can be re-
duced or shut down, if necessary. Besides the data of the inverter, the cluster box can also read out
irradiation, wind and temperature sensors, which would act as an independent source to evaluate the
efficiency of the plant.



5.5.4.3   Failure Identification

The monitoring system comprises functionality to detect obvious failures on its own. For example, a non-
working inverter would trigger an immediate alert. Issues with system output and under-performance
can be identified by comparing output of different inverters with each other or with the irradiation sensor
over a certain time interval. Smaller errors like "dirt on modules" or "loose connections" can be identified

with this method. It is recommended to mount at least one array sensor for every area with a different
azimuth and module tilt allowing a comparison between similarly configured irradiation sensors and PV
arrays.

6.         O&M Requirements

6.1          O&M Strategy

During the lifetime of the PV system, maintenance is required to ensure reliable operation. Since PV is
foreseen to form an integral part of the power supply, a permanent monitoring of the operation and
performance is required. Local technical staff of the NGEST operations team should be able to take
action on underperforming parts of the plant according to alerts of the monitoring system. Moreover,
NGEST PV-plant – as part of the overall power supply – is exposed to high instability of grid supply.
This requires a qualified personnel that is able to coordinate well with GEDCo and to keep NGEST
operational under the variable GEDCo supply system. The main elements of NGEST PV-plant O&M
strategy are:

         Cost effective O&M deployed human resources (engineer, technician),
         Monitoring plan and data processing,
         Periodic and emergency maintenance,
         Safety instructions,
         Maintaining warrantee compliance,
         Budget needed for NGEST PV-plant’s successful O&M strategy.




6.2          Human Resources Needed for O&M Strategy

There are two categories of activities during operation:

         High-level supervision and general trouble-shooting to be conducted by a trained engineer;
         Lower level maintenance and repair tasks executed by technicians.

There are two options for the engineer's position. The operation of the PV system can be added to the
responsibilities of the existing electrical engineer position, or an additional electrical engineer could be
employed, who would oversee the power supply component of the facility. Given the small size of the
PV installation, there is no justification for a dedicated additional resource. The technical assistance can
be provided by the existing technicians within the team. Their effort would probably amount to a one day
per week for routine checks at the PV-plant. The technical staff involved in operation of the PV systems
is:

         One electrical engineer with essential knowledge in solar engineering - the engineer is PV-
          plant's operations manager, he/she monitors the performance and control measures as well as
          the meteorological station, follows up on periodic cleaning, determines maintenance require-
          ments and actions for emergency cases, evaluates the deviation levels of actual and planned
          energy generation, and reports to management level.
         One technician – for cost effective O&M strategy this technician is part of the general NGEST
          staff and possesses strong PV knowledge. The technician assists the engineer and maintains
          cleaning and maintenance.

Reporting to management level should include weather conditions, generation performance, analysis of

lost energy (kWhrs) and critical incidents as well as maintenance activities including spare parts inven-
tory.

The PV plant engineer is also responsible for data documentation, follow-up on the key performance
ratios (PR), PV plant availability, monitoring of energy losses particularly on the DC side, and unsched-
uled outages. In addition to that the engineer should maintain database of external experts and O&M
service providers working in the solar sector and possible involvement in specific cases. Database pre-
pared by the engineer should include spare parts requirements and manufactures in a clear spreadsheet
tables with listing of equipment and quantity.

For the NGEST PV plant, a division of responsibilities (DOR) should be developed. It can be included
as special sheets in the manual. DOR is needed to identify who is responsible for monitoring, reporting,
scheduled maintenance and corrective maintenance. These sheets show the responsibilities of the en-
gineer, technician, and management level, in addition to identifying cases when NGEST needs an ex-
ternal O&M provider.



6.3         Staff Training

In addition to basic solar knowledge, NGEST PV plant technical staff (mainly the engineer) is essentially
to be trained on:

      1. Large scale solar plants;
      2. Grid-connected systems; available systems for grid-connection, grid electrical indicators, syn-
         chronic electrical indicators between grid and PV plant,
      3. Use of monitoring system at the plant,
      4. Dynamic management of NGEST electrical loads under variable GEDCo supply,
      5. Preventive, breakdown and predictive maintenance, conditional wear monitoring,
      6. PV systems performance measurements and thermal analysis of the PV plant components.
      7. Knowledge in sizing of DC cables and the impact of under-sizing on plant performance during
         maintenance processes,
      8. Engineer reporting skills.




6.4         O&M Manual

An O&M Manual should be prepared to include the following:

    1. Use of the entire PV system and components description, this includes all guidelines for the
       operation of the PV plant.
    2. Use of the entire monitoring system
    3. NGEST PV plant preventative maintenance schedule to be maintained on periodic and dynamic
       basis, depending on changing weather conditions or prominence of any new polluting source
       around NGEST.
    4. Cases when NGEST needs external maintenance provider,
    5. Procedures to be taken when unscheduled incidents occur,
    6. Annexes containing electrical and mechanical drawings of the PV plant at NGEST.

    7. Special sheets describing the technical specifications of provided solar modules, inverters with
       a space to add changes in case of repairing with components having other specifications.
    8. PV plant's safety regulations.




6.5                Monitoring Plan and Data Processing

The Monitoring plan consists of:

    1. Reading and documenting the control appliances (voltmeters, ampere meters) installed for both
       DC generation side and AC consumption side.
    2. Daily readings of energy meters; special attention should be given to kWh meters as a main
       performance indicator of the plant.
    3. Monitoring the compliance of cleaning cycles as planned,
    4. Alerts of the monitoring equipment and documenting maintenance actions made,
    5. Data entry in a special software,
    6. Monitoring of the locally installed meteorological station,
    7. Documentation of new polluters around the plant, and measuring the level of added dust.
    8. Monthly reports to NGEST manager; each report records all important indicators from the above
       mentioned points. These indicators will be reflected in NGEST PV plant revenue enhancement.

The Monitoring plan should conserve the energy generation process of NGEST PV plant in a range of
95-99% of planned among the 4 seasons as described below in Figure 6-1. Deviation of PV plant's
generation from the mentioned levels indicates incompliance of the monitoring system. These levels
consider differences of shadow caused by dust particles during different seasons, in addition to equip-
ment obsolescence.

6.6          General Safety Regulations

Operating instructions contained in the manual lists are the most important instructions on how to oper-
ate the PV plant safely. Operating the NGEST treatment plant includes other non-electrical and non-
mechanical hazards in regard to liquids, pools, the use of chemicals in the work area. All these hazards
are indicated in the manual and staff should refer to all safety instructions in NGEST.

All safety operating instructions generally in NGEST and particularly in the PV plant must be always at
hand in the NGEST work area. The staff must be aware that the relevant Palestinian rules and regula-
tions for accident prevention shall be complied with the eventual NGEST internal regulations.

NGEST management level must allow to work within the facility only people,
    who are well acquainted with regulations concerning safety and accident prevention,
    who have the knowledge on how both NGEST and PV plant function,
    who have read and understood the operating instructions.

Safety warnings like slogans must be marked in red and large enough to be seen, with danger symbols
and placed on the sites and equipment containing dangers.

It is the responsibility of the management level to ensure that these cautions mottos always exist in a
place of danger. Any modification or addition of parts like NGEST phase II and phase III must be ac-
companied with addition and modification of danger cautions. These changes and additions must be
done by an external safety consulting provider.

Consequences of non-compliance with safety regulations may lead to serious hazards as follows:

         Danger for staff or visitors by mechanical or electrical influence,
         Failure of prescribed methods of maintenance and repair,
         Failure of the whole process of energy generation at the NGEST PV plant.




6.7          Maintenance and Repair

6.7.1      Procedures

PV plants have a reputation as low maintenance power plants, nevertheless some actions should be
considered to ensure the highest possible output of the system.

All inspection work and maintenance is to be carried out according to the instructions:

         Preventative maintenance: testing of equipment and systems based on a schedule or condi-
          tional wear monitoring.
         Breakdown maintenance: when maintenance is initiated on an as-needed basis with alerts from
          monitoring equipment.
         Predictive maintenance techniques: how to initiate a plan for lifecycle maintenance e.g. PV plant
          cleaning cycles depending on Gaza specific weather conditions/any other sources of modules
          pollution in the area and replacing of repair parts.

For all maintenance, repair and inspection work power supply of the PV plant or its parts and power
from the grid is to be turned off, and breakers of power supply are to be made secure against an un-
expected restart. In addition to that, a warning plate against restarting should be placed.


6.7.2     Module Cleaning

The tilt angle of 25 degrees already secures a very good self-cleaning effect. Most of the dirt or snow
will slip down the module and rain will wash down the rest. For very dry seasons there should be the
possibility to wash the modules using only water and soft brushes. To avoid power losses all cleaning
or maintenance actions should be scheduled for the early morning hours or late afternoon when the
system is producing on a low scale.

Depending on the site conditions module cleaning can be done in certain periods, like every month, or
can be established as the first measure when a significant power loss is recognized by the monitoring
system.



6.7.3     Site Maintenance

Typical maintenance work that should be done on a quarterly basis is cutting vegetation and inspection.
Bushes and high grass can cause shadowing and should be trimmed or cut completely in certain time
intervals. Also inspections of modules, inverters and AC combiner boxes are recommended to prevent
failures and keep the output of the PV plant constantly on a high level.



6.8       Protective Equipment

Before the PV-plant is operated, all protective equipment must be installed and prior to maintenance,
operations related protective equipment must also be checked. Manual switchgears must be kept in a
closed non-operational position, and access should only be granted to authorized persons. Power sup-
ply connections and breakers are to be kept secure against unexpected restart and a warning label must
be attached against restarting.

In addition to that, protective devices must be serviced regularly according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions.

Works on electrical instrumentation and protective equipment must be carried out only by a qualified
engineer and technician/s. Staff is not allowed to continue with maintenance unless the functional state
of protective equipment is ensured. Thus, the NGEST maintenance provisions will need to include the
required personnel protective equipment like electrically isolated rubber gloves and tin hat when working
with mechanical reconstructions as well as protective work clothing. The NGEST Administration Building
can accommodate potential additional staff during their duties and has a changing room.

Main NGEST PV plant protective equipment and systems are:

 DC and AC circuit breakers,
 Manual switchgears,
 Earth leakage and earthing system,

   Short circuit protection system,
   Lightning rod system,
   On-grid connected inverters and PV and grid frequency regulation,
   Switches and separating breakers.

This protective equipment can only be removed under the direct supervision of the PV plant engineer
and after they have been protected against switching on again.

In addition to the mentioned above, loose connections and scorched cables must be removed immedi-
ately.

The PV-plants control room must contain all safety measures as follows:

   firefighters,
   free of flammable materials,
   natural and artificial ventilation,
   under the eyes of NGEST safety guards,
   secured door/s against unintentional closing during inspection work and maintenance,
   emergency exit window.



6.9       Security

All PV areas will be fenced and integrated in the overall security concept with 24/7 presence of manned
guards.



6.10      Disposal of Parts

The PV plant can contain dangerous parts during disposal, like electrical dangers of charged batteries
and condensers, chemical dangers of acids, scrap metals and other mechanical dangers. Any sub-
stances and materials used are to be handled with and disposed of appropriately in accordance with the
existing rules. This concerns in particular all waste materials, such as waste of electrical appliances, oil,
acids and other chemical waste.



6.11      Spare Parts

The availability of spare parts is crucial for a swift remedy of defects and reliable operation. The spare
parts requirements can be estimated based on the quantity of the components and the procurement
strategy: In a commercial project at a very accessible site, minimum numbers of spare parts are required
to keep the major part system in operation.. After replacement of equipment, the spare part store would
be refilled with a brand new device purchased with the means set aside in the so-called maintenance
reserve account (MRA). Thus, the project can benefit from the technical innovation and potential price
decrease and this avoids having large unused spare parts at the end of the lifetime. Systems built and
operated by public entities (bound to rather long procurement procedures) or located in a difficult location
(remote access, import restrictions), more conservative numbers are used in order to prevent supply
issues and procurement constraints to block repair and thus operation. This applies especially to the

NGEST project, where security approvals with only 6 month validity are required for importing goods to
the site and a strict OPEX budget is established. The parts used by the free field and the rooftop systems
differ slightly (e.g. different inverter sizes). But when quantifying the spare parts, the PV sub-systems
can be regarded as one unit and therefore reductions on gross quantities can be applied. The assump-
tion made hereto is that a module clamp can be applied equally on either type of the system.

Table 6-1 lists the share of spare parts on the total number of units per each component that are as-
sumed in the CAPEX estimate of the PV system. The additional column shows the deviation of the
assumed quantities to a typical investor-driven or commercial project. Due to the location of the NGEST
site and the public procurement procedures PWA is subject to it is recommended to increase the spare
part share for crucial parts.

            o Soiling losses
       Losses due to modules characteristics:

            o Inverter Loss during operation
            o Inverter Power Limitation
            o AC LV losses
            o Transformer Loss
       Further losses:
            o Internal consumption / parasitic loads
            o AC circuit
       Operational losses:
            o Annual degradation,
            o Technical unavailability

It is assumed that soiling may have a considerable impact, as the location is dusty and prone to sand
storms.

Technical unavailability includes downtime of the plant during normal production hours for repair or
maintenance. It further includes times, when the plant is ready to produce electricity, but the national
grid is unable to accept the power.

7.1.4     Yield Prediction Methodology

The PVSyst software is a PV system modelling tool. It is based on many years of experience in PV
simulations and performance assessment and is commonly used worldwide to design and evaluate the
energy produced by PV grid-connected solar power plants.

The simulation software PVSyst (Version 6.31) was used to simulate the system behaviour and energy
production of areas with similar orientation and configuration separately.

Power factor adjustment or curtailment of the grid on evacuation were not considered here. The produc-
tion of the total PV plant was calculated by summing up the hourly results of the separately simulated
areas. From the output on the PVSyst model, further plant losses were deduced:

 Ohmic losses in the MV circuit between the outlet of the inverter-transformer stations at the individual
  blocks and the revenue meter;
 Parasitic loads and internal consumption.

The resulting value corresponds to the expected output at commissioning.

During continuous operation, further losses occur. This is mainly due to:

 technical unavailability;
 degradation of modules and system components.

These operational losses during the lifetime of the project are considered in the production calculation
over the lifetime of the project.


7.1.5     Long-Term Expected Energy Production

For prediction of electricity production from the PV power plant for a period of 20 years, degradation
(ageing) of nominal power (conversion efficiency) of PV modules has to be assumed. Since not only the
modules are subject to ageing, the overall performance of the power plant depends also on cabling and
performance of inverters during the lifetime. Another possible source of uncertainty is non-uniform deg-
radation of individual modules, which results in higher mismatch losses.

Table 7-5 shows the weighted long-term expected energy production as annual net energy output in
GWh per year. The calculation of P90 assumes the 19-years inter-annual variability of GHI and all com-
bined uncertainties as described above. In other terms it refers to the multi-year probability.

Specific yield values in kWh per kWp for P50 and P90 are further detailed in the Annex. PV production,
including degradation and further technical losses are used in the next section to build the energy bal-
ance for each project year as input to the economic and financial cash-flow calculations.

The project has good potential for solar energy utilisation with stable electricity production during the
year with only slightly seasonal weather changes. Therefore, stable electricity production is expected
throughout the year.

7.1.6         Sensitivity of Energy Production to Azimuth Angle

There are military border installations in the South and South-East of the site. According to information
by World Bank, COGAT36 expressed the concern that the PV modules might lead to glare on the watch-
towers of Israeli military. Since the requirements are stipulated explicitly thus a general sensitivity eval-
uation has been conducted to demonstrate the actual designed azimuth and the sensitivities of an ad-
justment of the azimuth angle on annual energy production.

As a general remark, some simulation tools, such as PVSyst express azimuth angles in degrees devia-
tion from the optimum with 0° for South on the northern hemisphere and with -90° for East and +90° for
West. In standard cartography and engineering, 0° refers to straight North and 180° to South as shown
in the reference compass rose in Figure 7-3.

During the analysis of the possible variants, refer to section 5.4, different orientations were assessed.
This may already give a good indication of the impact any change in orientation has on the design and
energy yield.

The concept design developed has azimuths of 192° to 222° meaning that PV panels are facing a range
between South-South-West and South-West (see Figure 7-2). These orientations already reduce the
glare. An analysis with the glare analysis tool by SANDIA 37 confirmed that there is no risk of glare for
two arbitrary locations at the border line.

When changing the azimuth angle there is a certain threshold after which the tilt angle also needs to be
adjusted. Since the intensity of solar irradiance depends on the azimuth angle and incidence angle the
inclination of the PV module is reduced for azimuth angles that go far beyond the optimum in order to
keep the irradiance high during most part of the day. This effect is shown in the two tables by the tilt
angle columns. Since the available installation space is constrained by well-defined areas, any turning
of the PV modules will have impact on the actual installable capacity as explained in section 5.4.

7.2       Energy Balance of the Energy Supply System

7.2.1     Annual Demand and Supply Balance

Chapter 3 discussed the energy demand of each component of NGEST; the annual demand summary
is calculated as shown in Table 3-1. The total annual energy demand in 2018 is 37,286 MWh and
63,271 MWh in 2025.

In the following sections, the energy balance is calculated between the calculated energy demand of
the WWTP and the RS (Stages 1 & 2) versus the external power supply and components installed on-
site. Based on the technical analysis of the current power supply in Chapter 4 and the potential electricity
generation with PV in Chapter 5, the energy balance of the WWTP in 2018 and 2025 is calculated
showing the amount of shortages that will be covered by the grid and diesel sets.

The drawing up of the energy balance follows the overall objectives defined for the power supply system
(independent, cost effective and sustainable), which defines the internal merit order of the supply options
for satisfying the demand leading to the following ranking:

    1. Cost effective sources increasing autonomy through renewable energy sources (biogas, PV)
    2. Cost effective sources with insecurity in supply (external network)
    3. Sources allowing higher level of autonomy safeguarding operation (diesel)

The aim for sustainable supply and reduced emissions (in the case of PV) or at least emission-neutral
(in the case of biogas) are not given direct preference in this study, but this aspect is considered indi-
rectly in criterion (1) above which aims to optimise the use of local renewable energy based generation
sources.

The balance presented in the following sections focuses primarily on the PV system’s contribution and
capacity to meet NGESt’s partial energy. This same balance also includes the contribution of other
energy sources needed to cover the residual demand first with the external supply from the network and
finally the remaining gap caused by the load shedding with the costlier diesel generation.

Based on the technical availability of the grid discussed in Section 4.2.5, it will be assumed that the two
grid scenarios occur for during a total duration of 6 months (half a year) for each one. This is either:

   6 hrs ON and 12 hrs OFF (for 4380 hours/year)
   8 hrs ON and 8 hrs OFF (for the other 4380 hours/year),

The the diesel generators will replace the GEDCo network during the off-grid hours. This scenario will
be called the average grid contribution.

The PV yield scenarios (section 7.1) are combined with the grid scenarios. So the P50 scenario for the
hybrid power supply will include the scenario of the average grid contribution described above, while the
P90 scenario will include the worst-case grid contribution.

The evaluation of the annual energy mix of the scenarios with and without PV shows that the PV-based
supply reduces mainly the power supply from the external network and then displaces the generation of
the emergency diesel (refer to Figure 7-2 for 2018 and Figure 7-13 for 2025). The reasons for limited
possibility to offset the diesel-based generation is the assumptions on the current load shedding scheme
and the continued high load at the facility during these off-grid periods. This limit of displacing the fossil
fuel consumption and indispensable role of the diesel gensets is emphasised by the P90 scenario (i.e.
worst case with low annual grid availability and low annual PV production) where a higher share of the
local generation during a network outage leads to an increase in the diesel contribution.

As concluded from the figures, electricity produced from the installed capacities of the PV and biogas
generators is not sufficient to cover the design demand. Hence, the supply gap needs to be met by the
grid and the diesel generators.

Under normal conditions the WWTP would be supplied from the GEDCo network via two transformers
that are of 1600 kVA each. The WWTP has load sharing governors and an auto synchronizing system,
which controls the three diesel and the gas generators.

In 2018 and 2025, the PV system capacity remains the same while its contribution to the energy balance
is reduced due to degradation. The contribution of the biogas generator is doubled in 2025 because the

processing volume of the WWTP increases and another generation will be added to utilise the additional
amount of gas. The share of the grid and diesel generated power is increased to satisfy the higher deficit
occurring in 2025 in comparison to 2018.

The resultant annual energy balance for 2018 and 2025 is elaborated in Figure 7-4 showing the P50

7.2.2.2   Selected Daily Profiles

On certain days excess power generation from the biogas and PV occurs at the WWTP. Since the main
target of the local energy supply is to cover NGEST's demand and not to export electricity to the grid,
the operation and interplay of components would need to be optimised for these situations. The absence
of regulations allowing net-metering in the Palestinian territories makes it even more necessary to find
a solution that does not interfere with the constraints of the GEDCo network.

According to the provided meteorological data and the selected design, the PV power generation
reaches for a typical meteorological year its peak of 2.5 MW on the 18th of March as shown in Figure
7-5.

7.2.2.3   Excess local Generation during peak times

In the off-grid situation, the diesel generators are used to build and stabilise the grid (voltage/frequency
control). Thus, at least one diesel generator from the gen-set will work at 30% of its rated full load
capacity, which is equals to 0.220 kW MW of the 730 kW. If the WWTP is run in isolation from the grid
(and the RS), it results in offsetting the biogas generator in these working hours. The gas holder is used
to temporarily store the gas produced during these hours for later biogas-based generation. The annual
amount of energy corresponding to the required minimum diesel operation is estimated at 472 MWh.
Two solutions were suggested to optimize the use of this excess:
1) Battery Storage;



Palestine: Power Generation (Solar PV) for North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment Plant
Feasibility Study Report issued on 01.04.2016
                                                       - 93 -




2) Connecting the WWTP to the recovery scheme.

The first alternative is not recommended since the consumption from newly added loads increases in
the following years. This reduces the potential of the storage in the future by project lifetime, which would
render the investment in storage banks less feasible. In addition, the amount of 10% of excess is not a
promising amount for storage given that yet another component would increase the complexity of and
the effort for maintenance.

Combining the two project locations as a second alternative has higher potential of implementation. The
rationale for this assumption will be further explained after the discussion of the loads and contributions
of power sources at the recovery scheme in the coming sections. On the day with the highest peak, the
excess power generation reaches 5.25 MWh. The annual excess during the peak hours in 2018 is 938
MWh. Accordingly, the total expected unused excess of power generation in 2018 is 1410 MWh, which
represents 10.35% of the total annual energy demand of the WWTP. In 2025, this excess will decrease
to 48 MWh due to the increase of the load of the WWTP; this value can be neglected with respect to the
total load (22696 MWh).

7.2.3.1   Typical Daily Profiles

The recovery scheme energy balance was calculated as a total of both Stages 1&2 and extension. The
same assumptions of the grid availability were also considered here. In the recovery scheme, there is
no biogas generator; hence the energy balance is calculated between the loads and the installed PV
system as shown in Figure 7-6.

The section 3.3 contains the analysis of the consumption that is the guiding condition for the energy
balance.

For a typical year and the expansion size from 2018 until 2015, the PV power generation reaches its
daily peak of 1.8 MW instantaneous power produced at the recovery scheme on the 18th of March, as
shown in Figure 7-9.

Figure 7-11:     Daily profile and energy balance at the RS on 18th of March




The shortage prevailing over the whole day, also called residual load, shown in Figure 7-9 explains that
the peak generation of the PV system does not result in excess as in the previous case in the WWTP.
Daily shortage in the RS in the peak day reaches 51 MWh, much higher than the daily excess in the
WWTP. The annual residual demand of 19,817 MWh would need to be covered by the external network
and the diesel gen-sets.

The configuration described above shows the potential for optimisation of the use of the power genera-
tion excess at the WWTP for further reducing the residual load at the RS. Combining both systems
together is discussed in the following section.

7.2.4     WWTP and RS Combined

The use of the otherwise unused excess power generated at the WWTP in 2018 can be optimised by
connecting the electrical systems at the WWTP and the RS together. The technical concept is described
in section 7.3.3. The effect of the joint electrical systems is that the overall load at the RS is reduced
during the hours, where an excess of local RE generation occurs at the WWTP. This transfer from
WWTP to RS leads to a reduction of the relatively high load at the RS and a lower so-called residual
load, i.e. the effective load after subtracting the transferred excess power from the total load. This effect
is independent of the status of the grid-based supply.

This impact of this combination is illustrated in Figure 7-10. The first bar shows the annual energy mix
at the WWTP and the second bar shows the corresponding energy mix at the RS. During the hours of
load shedding, the diesel generations are required to operate even during times of excess from RE
sources at the WWTP (refer to explanation in section 7.3.3). The corresponding share of diesel supply
is included in the sum of the annual balance of both locations for the separated scenario, which is de-
picted by the third bar. When both locations are connected together the diesel generators at the RS can
take over the role of the grid-building component. Consequently, the diesel consumption can be reduced
during the times of RE excess at the WWTP. The resulting energy mix displayed by bar 4 has a lower
total demand than observed for the separate scenario in bar 3. The difference between bar 3 and 4
represents the saved energy generation by the diesel gen-sets, which could potentially be realised in a
combined scenario.

In this context it shall be emphasised that this analysis and optimisation is based on assumptions and
conducted without any operational data of NGEST. During actual operation, there may be other condi-
tions that may impact the dispatch of the components. If the excess occurs only for a very short period,
e.g. one hour during a day, the diesel gen-sets of the WWTP may well be kept idle or not even be
reduced at all for performance reasons. Such situations can arise for instance due to the actual weather
forecast or information about a limited shortage in the GEDCo grid.

As expected from the integration of the WWTP and RS, the installed capacities of the PV and biogas
generators are not sufficient to cover the total project design demand. Hence, the additional supply from
the grid and the diesel generators is necessary.

The PV yield estimate scenarios discussed in Section 7.1 and the grid scenarios discussed in Section
7.2 will be put here into consideration. The P50 scenario used the assumed typical grid availability sce-
nario while the P90 scenario uses the worst-case assumptions for unavailability of the network.

In this configuration, the total amount of the unused generated power at the WWTP is all utilized to
contribute to the total demand of both WWTP and RS and no PV power curtailed or biogas flared.
Through this measure, the total annual shortage decreases by 171 MWh in 2018, while in 2025 the total

7.3       Hybrid Plant Operation

7.3.1     Possible Operation Modes

The analysis of the energy balance shows that there will be no or hardly any time when the PV system
alone can sustain the energy demand of the project. Since the plant power supply is provided by a
combination of fuel-based sources (diesel and biogas) as well as variable and intermittent sources (grid,
PV) the interaction needs to be evaluated.

It has to be ensured that the power supply can easily switch over from the on-grid supply into the off-
grid supply with the different sources. In case of the off-grid situation, the grid must be maintained (fre-
quency, operating voltage, power level). Since the power supply system as well as sewage treatment
plant are not yet commissioned many parts remain to be looked at from only a study perspective.

In order to assess the capability of the existing design to support the integration of the PV plant into the
power supply set-up, the different operational situations were evaluated under the following assumptions
for the combustion engines:

       1 gas engine set at max 800 kVA (COP) – power factor 1, as described in Chapter 4.3.1
       3 containerised diesel gen-sets at max. 800 kVA (Prime) each and 730 kVA (standby) – power
        factor 0.8, as described in Chapter 4.3.1.

On the basis of the designed power supply and its planned extension (refer to Chapter 5.1) the following
three operational situations are theoretically possible when operating in the off-grid mode:

    1. 100% supply by the photovoltaic system
    2. a hybrid system comprising the photovoltaic system and the gas engine
    3. a hybrid system comprising the photovoltaic system and the gas engine and/or the diesel gen-
       sets.

The overall objective is to achieve minimum generation by the diesel engines in order to reduce fuel
costs and to limit gas emissions – especially the burning of gas via the flare.

The operation modes can be split up into “island modes” and “Connected-to-the-grid modes”. Not all
conceivable island modes are feasible, due to the fact, that a compensation of the reactive component
cannot be realized by the PV-system. In addition, the gas-generator can only create cos φ = 1.

1) Island mode with the conceivable sub-modes:
   a) photovoltaic is running alone, 100% - not possible due to a non-existing compensation of the
       reactive component - Not acceptable!
   b) photovoltaic and the gas engine in parallel - not possible due to a non-existing compensation of
       the reactive component - Not acceptable
   c) photovoltaic, the gas engine and the diesel gen-sets are producing – only possible if a minimum
       power of diesel gen-sets is respected - Acceptable.
   d) gas-engine running alone - not possible due to a non-existing compensation of the reactive
       component - Not acceptable
   e) gas-engine and diesel engines running in parallel - only possible if a minimum power of diesel
       gen-sets is respected - Partially acceptable.
   f) diesel engines are running alone – this solution is of special interest for periods, when the gas
       engine is in maintenance - Partially Acceptable

The evaluation of these results shows that 3 of 6 modes are acceptable or partially acceptable. The only
real acceptable mode for longer application is 1c), because it allows for producing a large portion of
electricity with the solar panels and the biogas engine, while 1 or 2 diesel engines are turning near to
30% load for compensation of the reactive component.

2) Connected to the grid, e.g. Gaza Power plant, and the sub-modes:
   a) photovoltaic in parallel to the grid – Compensation of the reactive component only possible by
      the grid. An agreement with the electrical network operator is necessary – Partially acceptable.
   b) photovoltaic and the gas engine in parallel to the grid - Compensation of the reactive component
      is only possible by the grid. An agreement with the electrical network operator is necessary –
      Partially acceptable
   c) photovoltaic, the gas engine and/or the diesel gen-sets in parallel to the grid - possible if a
      minimum power of diesel gen-sets is respected – Acceptable – similar to mode 1c
   d) gas-engine running alone in parallel to the grid - Compensation of the reactive component only
      possible by the grid. An agreement with the electrical network operator is necessary – Partially
      acceptable
   e) gas-engine and diesel engines running in parallel to the grid. No compensation of the electric
      component by the grid is necessary – sewage gas will be burnt. An easy switch-over to mode
      2c is possible. Acceptable
   f) diesel generators are running in parallel to the grid. Compensation of the reactive component
      by the grid not necessary. Diesel oil is used as the only energy source and is expensive. –
      Partially acceptable
   g) Black start mode – The diesel generators will produce for a short period the electricity for a start-
      up of the plant - no connection to the grid.
   h) Emergency mode – similar to 1f and 2f - only diesel-engines are running for electricity supply –
      for example during fire.

All operation modes with grid-connection make an export and import of electricity possible as seen from
NGEST.

The only real acceptable mode for longer application is 2c) due to similar reasons mentioned already
for 1c).


7.3.2     Electrical Requirements and Grid Operation

7.3.2.1   Dispatchability

NGEST can support the national grid with its diesel engines in periods of mode 2c). NGEST needs the
support of the external grid in phases, when a compensation of the reactive component does not exist,
i.e. modes 2a, b and d.


7.3.2.2   Black Start Capability

The black start capability can only be guaranteed by diesel engines. The gas-engine is too slow in its
response. After a total plant shutdown, a signal will start 1 of the 3 engines as black start diesel. The
first task is energising the plant grid within a few seconds, followed by a period of sequential starting of
pumps and blowers. The plant status will go over in emergency status. After attaining a stable process
situation the emergency status is over. For the black start interval and the emergency period the gen-

set will run at maximum with stand-by power. The stand-by power will reduce to prime power after at-
taining normal situation.


7.3.2.3   Frequency/Voltage Regulation

The tolerated frequency range shall be + /- 2% giving an alarm when out of this zone. The generator
tension shall allow a deviation of +/- 5%.

The compensation of the reactive component seems to be an important issue at NGEST. In order to
gain some experience the plant shall be operated during commissioning at different power factors; from
0.8 lagging to 0.9 leading.


7.3.2.4   Ability to Run in Partial Load and Limitations on its Share for each Engine

The minimum load shall be at 30%. An operation below this value shall be prevented because of internal
soothing. The effect of soothing is stronger at diesel engines than at gas engines. The reduced 30%
load will be run by the diesel engines, when used for the compensation of the reactive component.

All 4 engines must be capable to run in parallel. A certain difference exists in power between the gas-
engine and the diesel engines.

In case a difference in power is present, the danger exists in one engine taking too much load and trips.
However, the installed load sharing could prevent this.


7.3.2.5   Start/stop Times of Engines

Different start and stop times have to be considered for diesel and gas engines. The gas engine has a
slower response and needs longer intervals. See estimated values below for 1500 rpm engines in sec-
onds.

7.3.2.6   Ability to Run the NGEST Autonomous of the Grid

The pre-condition is: at least 3 of 4 gen-sets are available. The situation of one gen-set is under repair
or at maintenance must be considered. The max electrical power demand shall be below this value.


7.3.2.7   Issues Related to grid Re-synchronisation

A synchroscope on each feeder line to and from the grid is necessary.

Energy meters for effective power and reactive power for imported and exported energy are needed.


7.3.3     Concept for Improved Local Supply

A hybrid power supply from different power sources requires a well-elaborated instrumentation and con-
trol concept to secure the operation of the varying loads. The conditions under which this can be realised
with the designed components are described in ANNEX section 12.4.

The analysis of the energy balance of the two project locations in section 7.2.4 shows that the combined
operation of WWTP and the RS brings advantages to the power supply and thus to the operation. This
applies especially in the off-grid periods with high production from the biogas and PV components oc-
curring during mid-day, when NGEST's operations have their daily peak.

On this basis it is recommended to optimise the use of the renewable energy generation at NGEST by
implementing a Point of Common Coupling (PoCC) in the 22 kV OHL to the GEDCo network ahead of
the RS switch gear. This PoCC can be established by installing an additional circuit breaker in the con-
nection line with an energy meter attached to it with signal cables connected to the switchgears at
WWTP and RS.

This concept is shown in the schematic diagram in Figure 7-16. It depicts the topology of the current of
the power system and then the modified system as after installation of the PV system and PoCC.

In the off-grid case, this measure CB has the following impact:

       The facilities can be completely islanded from the network during load shedding.
       This avoids any negative impact from and to the network including back-feeding.
       The higher loads are installed at the RS. Thus, at no time excess of power is expected at that
        location. Consequently, the generator gen-sets at the RS would be running constantly during
        load shedding.
       In the control sequence, these generators would be defined as the master devises, which start
        first after grid goes off. The master devices would also build the grid whereon the other compo-
        nents would synchronise on.
       With this setting, the diesel at the WWTP could then potentially be shut down.
       The signal cable would allow sending a stop signal to the commercial energy meters located at
        the low-voltage side (0.4 kV) of each transformer.
              o This is an important commercial aspect because if meters are not halted NGEST would
                  have to pay for any excess power which is transferred from the WWTP to RS.
              o Another option could be to allow the meter at WWTP to reverse and the meter at RS to
                  continue spinning forward. But due to the constant operation of the diesel at the RS
                  (load high and the requirement on the diesel as grid builder) a power flow from RS to
                  WWTP would occur during the very short synchronisation phase.
              o Thus, the metering and billing of energy produced local within the NGEST facilities can
                  only be avoided if meters are stopped during island operation.
       The arrangement shows that NGEST is actually supplied on LV and GEDCo bears the costs of
        the transformer losses. In case energy is transferred between the two locations, transfer losses
        occur at either side, e.g. when stepping up at the WWTP and then again when stepping down
        at the RS. These losses are regarded as minor – also because a connection of both locations
        on LV level is not viable.

In case the grid is operating during the period the excess at the WWTP occurs, the two facilities would

not be disconnected at the PoCC. A commercial solution has to be identified that allows NGEST to
export the excess from the WWTP to the RS without being double-charged. Possible solutions are:
     Stopping the energy meter at the WWTP, or
     Allowing the meter to reverse (bi-directional meter) and then subtract the recorded amount from
        the readings at the RS

This metering issue would be best solved by an agreement with GEDCo that allows NGEST to employ
net metering. As shown in the energy balance analysis, net metering in the case of NGEST, with its high
net demand, would have no effect for the commercial part of GEDCo, i.e. it would not require imple-
menting a credit system to account for annual import from and export to the network as it was the case
for a network-wide net-metering regulation for end-consumers.

With this proposed concept, complexity of the commercial part increases slightly. Grid availability needs
to be logged and verified by a proper documentation and verification of metering values in a frequency
higher than monthly values, i.e. at least hourly value. The SCADA system and monitoring devices will
be of additional help providing an indirect control function, e.g. by logging time the grid is not available
or providing the power output of the PV system and biogas engine.

Ideally and under a well-defined load shedding regime, the system could be prepared for non-interrupted
transition from grid to off-grid, e.g. the master diesel already synchronises to the grid a short time ahead
of the rolling blackout. Also, all consumers need to be protected from the few seconds of interruption in
case of sudden break or be able to withstand such short interruption.

The independent operation and metering of both locations would lead to a certain amount of excess,
especially until the processing volume at the WWTP is increased in 2025. This is shown in the evaluation
of the energy balance shows (compare section 7.2.2 and section 7.2.4). Through installation of battery
banks or an expansion of the biogas storage, this excess could be utilised locally at the WWTP. But
costs for these measures are expected to be higher than the benefit:

     1. The high excess is only observed during Phase 1, meaning that the payoff and utilisation of the
        measures would be less after 2015;
     2. Batteries would increase the total CAPEX of the power supply and add more complexity;
     3. Increase of the biogas holder would require a modification of the already installed biogas facil-
        ities, incur additional costs and reduce the installation area for PV A1. This option can be
        adopted if the net-metering for the combined scenario is not accepted by GEDCo.

As conclusion it can be stated, that the described concept would lead to the lowest modification of
existing structure and technical design in comparison with other measures (i.e. additional connection
line between the two locations or independent management of the two locations). Additionally, it would
carry a relatively low impact on GEDCo's network and come with minor commercial implications.

In this context, it shall be noted that it was not possible to obtain the Grid Code for GEDCo's network
from the utility nor was it provided by the stakeholders. Tight consultation and coordination with the utility
on the next step is recorded as a condition for the success of the project. The final solution can only be
identified and agreed upon together with GEDCo.

On the technical level, it is suggested to initiate a discussion with SIEMENS as the NGEST SCADA
supplier regarding integration of the control of the PV system into the overall facility administration.

7.3.4        Conclusion on the Need for local Storage

The Power supply systems that consist of several sources and run in either grid-connected or island
mode need to ensure that the supply is always met and that power is provided with the required quality.
In addition to these technical requirements, the operators may want to dispatch the primary sources
depending on their cost impact, i.e. utilise the least-cost source of electricity as much as possible and
so on.

High frequent changes in PV output can have an impact on the operation of diesel generators during
island mode. But given the design information available at the time of study, the volatility of PV output
is not regarded as an issue for the operation of the diesel generators because there is always a high
share of diesel power in the system. This means that at least parts of the diesel generators would be
always running during off-grid times. In the same way as the generator reacts to load changes, e.g.
when a pump is switched on or changes its speed the diesel engine reacts to frequency changes in the
power supply system and thereby balances the PV fluctuations38. Even through the co-operation of PV
and diesel may have an impact on the efficiency of the diesel, i.e. genset not running at full load or
changing load more often, it is still regarded as more cost-efficient to use the diesel generators to offset
any fluctuations of PV power than to use batteries. Batteries have higher investment costs and a shorter
life-time than diesel engines. So gensets are less costly than battery systems, especially if not used
regularly to their full like in the NGEST case. If evaluation of the final Contractor's design shows that the
ramp-rates are too high or the recovery scheme construction delays, a temporary buffer battery could
be installed. During the on-grid times, the underserved GEDCo network is always a better storage than
any battery installed at NGEST.

NGEST's operation profile leads to a clear day-time profile with peak towards early afternoon. This cycle
coincidences well with the PV production and together with short-term storage flexibility offered by the
biogas holder, installation of batteries are not needed to increase the share of renewable energy in the
whole power supply.




38   According to further information provided by the engine manufacturer Perkins, the engine recovers from a frequency change
      within 5 seconds.

8.        Preliminary Environmental and Social Im-
          pact Assessment

8.1       Objective of the Preliminary ESIA

The main objective of this preliminary environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) is to assess
both the negative and positive social and environmental consequences related to the construction and
operation of photovoltaic systems at the NGEST site. Moreover, it shall outline an implementation and
monitoring plan for mitigating the negative impacts and define the institutional responsibilities for the
implementation of the plan.

More specifically the ESIA will address the following main issues:

     1. Environmental and social impact of the project.
     2. Potential Land acquisition needed for temporary construction work or for permanent use by the
        project.
     3. Preparing an implementation plan for mitigating the negative impact (if needed).
     4. Assessment of the capacity of the implementing institution and recommendation on any capac-
        ity building needs (if needed).



8.2       Legal Basis and Reference Guidelines for the Assessment

8.2.1     Palestinian Legislation and Regulations

The relevant laws and policies that govern the conduct of environmental assessments in The Palestinian
territories can be summarized as follows:

  Palestinian Environmental Law # 7 issued 1999.
  The Palestinian Legislative Council approved the first Palestinian Environmental Law, which was
   signed by Chairman Arafat on 28 December 1999.
 The Palestinian Environmental Strategy (PES) which was published in October 1999 by MEnA. It
   covers the political and social context, the legal and institutional framework, the environmental driv-
   ing forces, the environmental themes and the strategy elements.
 MEnA (EQA) has issued an Environmental Assessment Policy which provides implementation pro-
   cedures. The Environmental Assessment Policy will assist in meeting, inter alia, the following goals:
  – to conserve the social, historical and cultural values of the Palestinian people and their commu-
      nities;
  – to ensure an adequate quality of life, health, safety and welfare for the Palestinian people;
  – to preserve natural processes;
  – to maintain the sustainable use and the long-term ability of natural resources to support human,
      plant and animal life;
  – to conserve bio-diversity and landscapes;
  – to avoid irreversible environmental damage from development activities; and
  – to ensure that the basic needs of the people affected or likely to be affected by a development
      activity are not jeopardized.

Within the terms of the draft policy, MEnA (EQA) is responsible for the implementation and for the ap-
proval and assessment of environmental considerations in relation to proposed developments. It is ex-
pected that the EQA will liaise with relevant institutions, such as the PWA, in relation to the proposed
developments.

The form of the policy is similar to that of the World Bank (see details below) and it specifies the require-
ment for comprehensive EIAs (necessary for projects likely to have significant impacts) and an Initial
Environmental Evaluation (IEE) for projects, where significant impacts are uncertain, or where compli-
ance with environmental regulations must be ensured. Completion of an IEE may necessitate the con-
duct of a comprehensive EIA.

The Palestinian Water Law # 14, 2014, and the Palestinian Energy Authority Establishment Law #12,
enacted in 1995, form part of the wider legal framework. The latter law sets the main responsibilities of
the PENRA and defines the various energy sources including renewable sources that the authority can
utilize for the generation of electricity.


8.2.2     WB Reference Criteria Catalogues

The key reference in this context is The World Bank’s Operational Policy/Bank Procedures/Good Prac-
tices (OP/BP/GP 4.01) and associated documents.

The purpose of undertaking an EIA is to improve decision-making and to ensure that the considered
project options are environmentally sound and sustainable. The EIA should identify ways of improving
the environmental compliance of projects by preventing, minimizing, mitigating or compensating for ad-
verse impacts. Accordingly WB OP 4.01 identifies that project-specific ElAs should normally cover the
following aspects:

       existing baseline environmental conditions;
       potential environmental impacts;
       systematic environmental comparison of alternative investments;
       systematic environmental comparison of alternative sites;
       systematic environmental comparison of alternative technologies and designs;
       preventive, mitigation or management plan;
       environmental management and training; and
       environmental monitoring.

The level of EIA performed should be based on the expected environmental impacts, as determined by
the type, location, sensitivity, and scale of the proposed project, as well as the nature and magnitude of
its likely potential impacts. Projects are grouped into categories characterising the potential impacts in
accordance with the OP.4.01:

       Category A (those that are likely causing significant impact) projects should be subjected to full
        environmental analysis through the planning and implementation phases.

       Category C: A proposed project is classified as Category C if it is likely to have minimal or no
        adverse environmental impacts. Beyond screening, no further EA action is required for a Cate-
        gory C project.

       Category B: A proposed project is classified as Category B if its potential adverse environmental
        impacts on human populations or environmentally important areas – including wetlands, forests,
        grasslands, and other natural habitats – are less adverse than those of Category A projects.

        These impacts are site-specific and few maybe irreversible. In most cases mitigation measures
        can be designed with less effort than for Category A projects. The scope of EA for a Category
        B project may vary from project to project, but it is narrower than the one of a Category A EA.
        Like EA for a Category A project, it examines the project's potential negative and positive envi-
        ronmental impacts and recommends any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or
        compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance. The findings and
        results of Category B EA are described in the project documentation (Project Appraisal Docu-
        ment and Project Information Document).

       Category FI: A proposed project is classified as Category FI if it involves investment of Bank
        funds through a financial intermediary, in subprojects that may result in adverse environmental
        impacts.

When looked at as a standalone project, the current project can be, according to the World Bank oper-
ational policies (OP 4.01), classified as category C project. The rationale is that the installed PV modules
do not produce any noise, toxic-gas emissions, nor greenhouse gases during their lifetime use of nearly
30 years. The local population is not adversely affected and no resettlement would be required. There-
fore, preliminary environmental assessment or environmental screening will be carried out for the project
component (PV solar panels) that will be installed at the NGEST location.

Nonetheless, if the project is looked at as a component of the overall wastewater treatment and reuse
project (NGEST), it is likely to be looked at in a similar way as the overall project and could be classified
under the same category as the main project which in this case is a category A. The preliminary assess-
ment in the next sections shows that the addition of a PV system to NGEST does not adversely impact
the overall EA rating of NGEST. The results of the previous assessment remain therefore valid.



8.3       Review of the ESIA Issued for the NGEST Project

8.3.1     Scope

A detailed Supplementary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Study (SESIA 2013) has been
prepared for the NGEST project (Waste Water Treatment Plant and Effluent Recovery Scheme) since
it was classified as Category A project, according to the World Bank operational policy, because it in-
volves wastewater production, treatment and reuse as well as recharge to the groundwater, which might
entail some environmental and social impact. The risks involved related to the possible groundwater
pollution, agricultural land contamination, land acquisition for the construction of the project (infiltration
ponds and the treatment plant, etc.). Accordingly, the scope of the ESIA includes the determination of
any expected environmental and social impacts and the preparation of an environmental management
plan for managing, mitigating and monitoring risks and negative impacts.

Moreover, the ESIA took into account the temporary and permanent land requirement for the project
and checked the type of land acquisition foreseen and prepared safeguard instruments in compliance
with World Bank OP 4.12 related to involuntary resettlements.

The preparation of the ESIA has taken into consideration the requirements of the EIA policy of the
Palestinian Environmental quality authority as well.

However, the ESIA does not address the impact of the surrounding environment on the PV plant.

8.3.2     Areas Covered

The ESIA for NGEST project covers the entire project location and the surrounding areas including the
areas currently proposed for the PV solar panels. The ESIA also covers the recovery field areas in the
analysis and potential impact. The analysis included potential public health impact and monitoring,
groundwater quality and pollution as well as capacity building needs to manage the recovery scheme.


8.3.3     Power Generation from Different Energy Sources

8.3.3.1   Diesel

The ESIA addresses the power generation issue under the section on "energy demand and response
plan of energy shortage from the grid".

8.3.3.2   Biogas including gas holder with flare

The generation of biogas is considered as a part of the energy sources envisaged to cover the demand
of the plant energy demand within the ESIA. It is assumed that up to 0.8 MVA (40%) of the energy
demand is secured from the biogas generation from the two sludge digesters.


8.3.3.3   GEDCo supply

The line route of GEDCo supply is not covered by the ESIA.


8.3.3.4   Power supply and diesel generators at recovery areas

The power supply for recovery and reuse during Phase 1 is assumed to be covered from the grid as
well as from the biogas generated in the plant. The two standby diesel generators of 500 kVA each are
also considered in case of electricity shortage or failure from the grid.


8.3.4     Gap analysis

The ESIA of the NGEST project has addressed most of the environmental aspects related to the
wastewater treatment plant, the infiltration basins and the recovery and reuse schemes. It developed
detailed environmental implementation and management plan to tackle potential environmental impacts
during construction and operation phases.

However, the ESIA did not anticipate the PV energy generation and therefore did not address the impact
of the PV on the environment nor did address the impact of the surrounding environmental conditions
as well human interventions on the PV plant proposed for the NGEST project. Accordingly, the main
areas that will be covered under this preliminary environmental assessment can be summarized as
follows:

    1. The environmental and social impact of the PV panels on the NGEST project area and the
       proposed Waqf land in the future stage. More specifically, the analysis will address the impact
       of the land use change, land acquisition for the new PV panels, the impact on flora and fauna,
       the impact on air and water, impact on the local community.
    2. The impact of natural conditions and human activities on the PV panels. Specifically, the solid

       waste collection vehicle movement around the site using dirt roads, the charcoal factory, the
       temperature and humidity and other climate conditions and their implications on local environ-
       ment.
    3. Impact of political conditions and wars on the PV plant.
    4. Development of an environment management plan to propose mitigation measures of negative
       impacts and possible costs associated with mitigation.



8.4       Preliminary Social and Environmental Impact of PV on Project
          Area

8.4.1     Terrain under Investigation

The scope of the current preliminary ESIA is limited to the location of the PV system that will be installed
within the fenced boundary of the NGEST project in addition to the proposed future expansion to the
Waqf land located to the west of the cemetery. Therefore, the space where the assessment will focus
on is very limited. The major part of it is already fenced for the WWTP and covered by the main ESIA
report that was developed for the NGEST project.

The use of space within the boundaries of the plant will vary according to the type of PV variant that will
be finally selected. However, the space needed for four of the proposed design variants is nearly the
same. Only the variant 4 with the two axis tracker differs slightly because it utilizes more space, but
places the structures in a less dense pattern as shown in Drawing 001 and Drawing 002.

The total area that will be covered by the PV systems ranges between 35,000 m² to 73,000 m² in the
case of the two axis tracker PV system on the NGEST project area. In addition, a free field system will
cover around 30,000 m² of the Waqf land.


8.4.2     Potential Impact

Figure 8-1:      Example of area within the WWTP




Due to the fact that the PV panels will mostly be installed within the WWTP terrain and that detailed
environmental assessment has been carried out for the location, it is logical to assume that installation
of additional equipment (PV Panels) that will neither occupy new land outside the location nor produce

any harmful emissions (gas and liquid) and will not produce greenhouse gas, will not create additional
potential negative impact on the local environment during its lifetime. However, by the end of the PV
panels life time they should normally be treated as WEEE (Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment)
and therefore should be either considered for recycling or reuse or safe disposal. In this context and
since the lifetime of the PV system is estimated at nearly 30 years, it is difficult to predict the situation in
Gaza then, what PWA’s will be like, and what development in the recycling and reuse technology will
take place. A good practice, however, is to consider additional costs for decommissioning. An estimate
for the dismantling is to be added to the budget of the project ensuring that by the end of the life time of
key components a proper budget for removal and recycling. These considerations relate mainly to the
main electrical equipment, the PV modules and inverters, which are expected to be replaced after their
life time. The other parts of the system remain functional – given that maintenance is executed correctly.

Although the typical lifetime of commercial PV projects is planned with 20-25 years, the components
may last longer while the performance degrades over time. Since NGEST is a facility providing public
services and as such planned to remain in place over a longer period it is unlikely that the whole system
will be decommissioned. A replacement or repowering of underperforming parts may be the more cost-
effective approach. The costs associated with this include the proper decommissioning of the modules
to be replaced, the purchase of new products and the labour required for installation and retrofitting. The
PV industry has established special networks responsible for the recycling of PV modules but they are
currently limited to a certain jurisdiction, e.g. EU as in the case of PV cycle 39. But some manufacturers
or distributors also maintain collection points outside the region. This strongly depends on future market
development but brings the decommissioning or replacements costs down to the export and shipping to
the collection points (i.e. labour and transport).

The installation area is already closed and reserved for the use by the NGEST facility. The flora on the
site is limited to species of local seasonal wild plants, which are commonly available in Gaza with no
record of endangered species on the site. The vegetation has filled the areas after covering up the
terrain at the end of the main construction activities for the WWTP.


Figure 8-2:           Example of area within WWTP on the East side




Moreover, no fauna is expected on the site except some birds and possibly insects and lizards, again
there is no record for any endangered species in the area. The impact of the PV installation might cause
some disturbance during the construction stage to these creatures but it will be limited and for a short
period of time.

The PV panels are free of hazardous materials (liquid, solid or gas) and therefore are not expected to
create any risk for the surrounding areas in terms of spillage or emission. The same would apply to the
workers' health during installation and operation.

The impact of the PV on the land use will also be limited. The areas inside the NGEST plant are already
artificial surfaces covered with roads and paved areas. Only limited areas of the WWTP terrain are
currently open space. The impact on the aesthetic view is therefore very limited with no major change
in the land use shape and no major excavation or change of morphology in the area. Similarly, the PV
installation will have no pollution threat to the air and local water resources in the area.

The expected social negative impact is also very minimal since there is no close community adjacent to
the plant. The nearest community is Jabalia at distance of around 5 km. Moreover, the land is not used
for any production purpose. However, it is likely that some positive impact can potentially be anticipated
during the construction stage and later on during the operation stage especially, when electricity gener-
ation from the PV panels will start and the surplus will be fed into the grid. Such surplus will benefit the
local communities and they will enjoy more frequent electricity or longer supply hours, which would most
likely improve their livelihoods. This effect can only be finally confirmed once a final and reliable energy
balance is generated as part of the feasibility study. Moreover, another positive impact during the con-
struction stage could probably arise from job creation for the technicians and local workers who will be
involved in the installation of the PV system. Although this impact is for limited period but under the
given hard economic situation of Gaza and high unemployment rate it creates a positive impact. Since
PV is a new technology in Gaza, workers would gain also from the knowledge transfer during the activ-
ities.

The investigated land is owned by the state and therefore, no acquisition procedure is required and no
impact on individual land ownership that would require a dedicated safeguard process.

The impact on safety of workers and operators during installation and operation will be low to moderate.
Only precautions are needed since work will be carried out mostly inside the plant and next to the steep
sides of the infiltration basins and roofs of buildings. Clear work procedures during the installation have
to be taken into account by local contractors to avoid any potential work incident.


8.4.3     PV System Impact Mitigation Measures

It is clear that no major mitigation measures are needed since the negative impact is low on various
social and environmental constituents of the project area. The only measure needed to ensure safety of
workers during installation and operation and to have clear working procedures and take safety
measures to avoid falling in the ponds or from the roofs of buildings. In addition, it is recommended to
limit the working time during construction to the day time and to consider using light machines to mini-
mize noise and vibration so that no disturbance to local fauna is secured.

To mitigate the impact of PV panels decommissioning at the end of their useful lifetime can be incorpo-
rated from the early beginning of the plant construction in a similar way of other electric or electronic
installations. Reported practice in this regard can be in the following forms:

 To absorb the decommissioning cost by the responsible utility or authority through the tariff they
  charge for the electricity produced and to be combined with the related services tariff, for example
  treating wastewater tariff or reuse of treated effluent tariff.
 To set aside an escrow fund at the system installation to consider using the service or logistic and
  recycling companies for decommissioning of the system and either recycle locally if the capacity is

   available or use the same channels of recycling with the PV manufacturers by shipping the disman-
   tled parts back to them.


8.4.4     Impact of Natural Conditions and Human Activities on the PV Systems

The potential impact of the local environment on the PV panels arises mainly from two sources:


8.4.4.1   Impact of Solid Waste Vehicle Movement on Dirt Roads

Figure 8-3:      Lorry carrying municipal waste to the landfill




It was observed that the NGEST plant is surrounded by two dirt roads that are used by solid waste
collection vehicles to transfer solid waste to the land fill used by Jabalia to the east of the plant as shown
in Figure 8-3. The dust created by vehicle movement will likely lower the efficiency of electricity gener-
ation from the PV panels and will require frequent cleaning (e.g. by using water).

8.4.4.2   Impact of the Charcoal Production Site

Figure 8-4:      Local charcoal production site




The existence of charcoal factory at nearly 300 m distance to the west of the plant has potential impact
on the efficiency of the PV plants. Smoke resulting from the charcoal production might cover the PV
panels and reduce the exposure to sunlight. This in turn will reduce the potential electricity production.


8.4.4.3   Mitigation Options for the External Impacts on PV System

The dust created by vehicle movement can be mitigated through the pavement of the roads around the
plant. Alternatively, frequent cleaning of the PV panels will be required using large quantities of fresh
water. Given that water is scarce in Gaza it might add additional pressure on the already strained water
resources and will require more analysis in terms of potential impact.


8.4.5     Impact of Political Conditions and War

The proximity of the plant to the border with Israel renders it vulnerable to any future armed conflict in
the area. In fact some fractures of weapons found already around the administrative building from the
war of 2014 as reported in the inception report of this project. This triggers the possibility of damaging
the PVs in any future armed conflict or war.


8.4.6     Water for Cleaning

The water needed for cleaning the PV panels from the dust will create an additional issue of concern
especially in the context of Gaza water crisis. Freshwater availability is already lacking for drinking and
domestic use. Therefore, any additional fresh water quantity will put more pressure on the already
scarce resources and depends on the quantity needed. This may escalate the demand and hence in-
crease the cost of water for domestic use inside Gaza.

Possible mitigation will only be possible in the case of ceasing the dust emission from the dirt roads or
using the water from the recovery wells of the NGEST plant for cleaning. The latter will be subject to the

9.1.1.1     CAPEX

The price schedules from the tender process for NGEST (file: “Priced B.O.Q final.xlsx” 40), conducted in
2010, were used as input for investment costs of the diesel gen-sets. The values quoted therein repre-
sent the actual amount spent on the generators. The additional electrical infrastructure contained in the
price schedule was not considered as part of the generator’s specific costs because it is also required
for the operation of the other parts of the WWTP. This price information obtained during the tender is
based on offers obtained in 2010 since the equipment installed was procured under the same process
as the WWTP. Using the numbers, capacity specific costs had been derived (220.82 USD/kW diesel
capacity) which were then applied to the installed and planned diesel capacities at the WWTP and the
recovery scheme (listed in Figure 9-1). This specific cost value includes material and works. This addi-
tional conversion was necessary because the future diesel engines planned for the recovery scheme
do not have the same capacity as the current units at the WWTP. This method still carries a minor
uncertainty because prices for diesel engines of different sizes do not scale proportionally. Additionally,
a price escalation may need to be considered for the future installed diesel capacities. For the feasibility
study, and especially this task, the approach is regarded as acceptable since the emphasis is put on the
comparison of different supply options. A potential replacement of the generators after about 15 years
was not taken into account.

influenced by fuel consumption.

The total annual maintenance costs for NGEST have been estimated in earlier assessments41. Using
typical assumptions for simple routine maintenance works, such as, filter changes, adjustment of valve-
tappet clearance, oil change and major overhauls, corresponding annual costs for the maintenance of
the diesels were estimated with 11,434 USD. The total fuel costs were calculated in the economic as-
sessment multiplying the estimated amount of annual fuel consumption obtained from the energy bal-
ance (see section 7.2) and the price for diesel per litre. At this stage, the reduced efficiency of the diesel
engine under 75% or 50% load was neglected. The average diesel price 2013-2015 was estimated at
1.51 USD/l.

The total annual OPEX spending mounts to the values shown in Table 9-2:

The values for the biogas engine investment were taken from the tender data sheet, similar to the diesel
investment costs (see section 9.1.1.1). Since the devices are all of the same rating and will all be in-
stalled at the WWTP, the unit rate of 872,076.51 USD was used for the installed device and the second
machines to be added within Phase 2.

9.1.2.2   OPEX

The maintenance costs for the biogas generation were estimated using the same method as employed
for the diesel generators in section 9.1.1.2). The annual value amounts to 3,811.35 USD for included
routine and overhaul works was estimated. The price of the electricity generated from biogas was taken
over from the aforementioned O&M cost assessment stating a value of 0.07 USD/kWh.

The estimated annual OPEX values are shown in Table 9-4:

Although NGEST processing volume is scaled up during Phase 1, the biogas generation does not in-
crease because it operates already from the start to its design load.


9.1.3     Solar PV Plant

9.1.3.1   CAPEX

The cost estimate for the conceptual design was derived by updating the preliminary cost evaluation
used for the evaluation of the variants (see section 12.3.1.3). Based on the actual quantities used in the
design and a revised breakdown, the total costs were estimated at 1,350 USD/kWp, which amounts to
a total value of 6,897,993 USD. This includes the main system and additional auxiliary facilities such as
the monitoring devices. While the PV plant can save costs due to the existing electrical infrastructure,
other parts such as SCADA integration to the facility control system were added to account for potential
interfacing efforts. This cost estimate assumes the implementation under a typical EPC turnkey contract.
Thus, a share for the installation works and transport was included. The second-level breakdown of the
costs is shown in Table 9-3 while Figure 9-1 provides an overview of the share of different major posi-
tions in the total costs.

9.1.3.2    OPEX

The estimated operational expenditures for the PV system are shown in Table 9-4. The cost has been
gathered based on a database with typical PV project operational and maintenance costs. In addition,
local labour and operations cost structures were considered. The OPEX does not yet consider the actual
synergies, which could be leveraged once the PV system is maintained by the same crew that maintains
the rest of the facility. Such savings can be accounted for once the contract is finally decided upon.

The considered power source options for NGEST are as follows:

     1. Off-site:
        - Electricity supply through GEDCO (Israel, GPP, Egypt)

     2. On-site:
        - Biogas
        - Diesel
        - Photovoltaic, with five possible technical variants that were also economically contem-
           plated.
                 o PV-Variant 1:    True South
                 o PV-Variant 2:    Geometric Adaption
                 o PV-Variant 3:    1-axis Tracker

9.2.1      Levelized Costs of Electricity (LCOE) of the Different Supply Options

An economic LCOE was calculated for all possible supply options including their variants. Calculating
LCOE makes it possible to compare technologies, different generation and cost. The basic step is to

42      Source: The data was compiled by the consultant through information and reports from the Palestinian Water
        Authority, the World Bank, and GEDCo. Also for some prices current tax rates, subsidies etc. were de-
        ducted/added.
                                                               - 131 -




form the sum of all accumulated costs for investing in and operating a plant/technology option and divide
this figure by the sum of the annual power generation. This then yields the so-called LCOE in USD/kWh.

The different supply options were analysed according to their proportional share in the annual electricity
supply to NGEST.

The highest LCOE has the electricity supply option with diesel at a price of 0.147 USD/kWh. This is
followed by the supply through GEDCo with 0.126 USD/kWh and biogas with 0.100 USD/kWh as the
cheapest option.

The highest LCOE has PV variant 5 "Thin Film" with 0.129 USD/kWh, followed by Variant 4 "2-axis
Trackers" and Variant 3 "1-axis Tracker" with 0.081 and 0.071 USD/kWh. The lowest LCOE have the
PV variant 2 "Geometric Adaption" and variant 1 "True South" with 0.068 and 0.061 USD/kWh.

For choosing the optimal PV option, it should be mentioned that each variant generates a different
amount of energy thus producing different costs of electricity, and of course different initial cost for the
different types of technology.

The sensitivities of the PV options shown in Table 9-8 strengthen the recommendation for the installation
of a PV power source as an on-site power supply solution for NGEST.

The sensitivities presented in the table above show that economically the prices for electricity generated
with a PV variant stay competitive with other supply options and are even less expensive with an in-
crease of 20% than other supply options like diesel at a price of 0.148 USD/kWh and GEDCo with 0.126
USD/kWh.

Looking at the LCOE of the different variants, economically the prices are comparatively low, as taxes
and financing costs were not considered. The variant that is best priced is PV Variant 2 "Geometric
Adaption". This variant has next to its relatively low USD price/kWh also the largest capacity (kWp)
which holds the largest benefit among the PV variants for NGEST, even if it is not the cheapest version.

Considering the different LCOEs (Table 9-6), with potential contributing factors including, inaccessibility
and shortfall of diesel and GEDCo energy supply (chapter 4.2) the installation of PV and particularly PV
Variation 2 "Geometric Adaption" is recommended. PV Variant 2 enables more power independence
from the grid, and has the most cost saving potential.

This recommendation is further supported by the sensitivities of the present value of energy (PV). It
shows that the largest kWh production can be reached with PV Variant 2. Additionally, Variant 2 is
competitive to the other variants - even if its production decreases.

9.2.3     Total Levelized Costs of Electricity (LCOE) as per Current Design / after
          Installation of PV

The resulting total economic LCOE as per current design without PV would look as follows:

Without PV the combined electricity costs would be at 0.131 USD/kWh. When including the PV variant
2 into the power supply, the overall LCOE would be at 0.121 USD/kWh. The LCOE includes the fuel
purchase costs which change with the different amount of the fuel consumed.

The comparison of the LCOEs without PV and with PV Variant 2 shows the total cost savings over
NGEST estimated life time of 20 years.

9.3       Financial Analysis

The financial analysis of the investment into a PV system is conducted for the integration of the PV
Variant 2 "Geometric Adaption" into the energy supply for NGEST. This financial analysis gives an in-
sight into the total investment costs and the financial levelized costs of electricity (LCOE). Furthermore,
three funding scenarios were calculated and elaborated on in chapter 9.3.2.

USD/kWh. This in turn, lowers the costs by 13% and allows for cost savings over a period of 20 years
on the present value of costs of 15,627,543 USD:

The cost savings make the project with a PV system financially more attractive and competitive with
other power supply options without PV. Power supply through PV is also accessible and it could poten-
tially grant NGEST independence over 16% of its annual overall electricity needs.

The total cost savings over 20 years of 15,627,543 USD represent cost savings of 2,119 USD per day,
64,519 USD per month and 774,228 USD per year.

The sensitivity analysis concluded for the different supply options (including PV Variant 2), shows that
even with a linear increase and decrease of costs between 5-20%, the LCOE stays in an adequate cost
frame.

The Base Case represents the actual financial calculation that was effectuated for the NGEST project
and uses the 2013-2015 average diesel price of 1.51 USD/litre incl. taxes. From this base case sensi-
tivities are shown in the calculation below. The calculation includes a reduction of 55% (representing an
exemption from Blue Tax) on the diesel price to show how this would affect the total savings in cost with
PV over a time period of 20 years, as well as the overall LCOE with PV and without PV.

The analysis shows, that the power supply with PV is the financially favourable option, even with the
deduction of the 55% tax, as it generates a lower LCOE with PV of 0.127 USD/kWh in comparison to
0.138 USD/kWh without PV. Total cost savings with PV options would be at USD 5.1 million over a
period of 20 years. Even though these savings are not as high as the Base Case scenario, it still favours
solar.

Additionally, the annual production from diesel generators at the WWTP alone in 2018 without a PV
system is calculated to be 5,522 MWh. With an assumed cost per kWh of 0.23 USD produced using
non-exempted diesel the total annual cost of Ø 5,732,054 USD will be reached. In case the diesel is
exempt from Blue Tax, the cost per kWh produced will be 0.13 USD and the total annual operational
cost will be Ø 3,427,141 USD.

On the opposite, increasing fuel prices make the PV option even more attractive and could raise the
cost savings over 20 years up to 19.4 million USD if the diesel price were to increase by 20%. Given the
fluctuations in diesel price in the last two years, this is not an all too unlikely scenario.

The impact of fluctuating prices for power supply through GEDCo's grid is trivial, representing the lower
percentage of power coverage through GEDCo. However, this could change significantly if the external
supply is improved. In this case the technical availability of the network in terms of supply capacity is
more important than actual costs.

The Base Case represents the purchase price from GEDCo of 0.150 USD/kWh and the sensitivity test-
ing shows that if this price is increased the investment in PV becomes yet more favourable. Nonetheless,
even if the price was to be decreased by 20%, the investment into PV would still generate cost savings
of 14.8 million USD over a period of 20 years.

Additional Scenarios:

Next to the two main scenarios with and without PV two more options were considered to show all
possibilities in terms of price development. It needs to be mentioned that these additional scenarios are
highly unrealistic due to the power shortages and the unavailability of supply through GEDCo.

    1. Option "GEDCo": Supply through biogas and GEDCo only
    2. Option "GEDCo + PV": Supply only with biogas, GEDCo and PV

As these two options do not include high diesel costs they are cheaper than the option with or without
PV – however, GEDCo cannot guarantee the supply which makes these options highly unstable - albeit
their favourably low prices. An additional supply line from Israel is highly unlikely to be developed over
the next couple of years. Therefore, a solution for the problem of low power supply through GEDCo is
not to be foreseen in the near future.

For better understanding of the complete overview it should be considered, that the load is already set
to the maximum peak hours of PV. Furthermore, 17% Biogas are fixed in price and quantity by the

operation concept of NGEST (LCOE 0,085 USD/kWh). The 16% PV is the maximum defined the cur-
rently available area (LCOE 0,081 USD/kWh). Moreover, also the grid price is fixed by an agreement
with GEDCo (0,150 USD/kWh). In the current operational concept diesel always covers all remaining
demand (LCOE 0,318 USD/kWh). Therefore, the following conclusions are important:

    1. Biogas as a by-product of the sewage treatment and therefore very economic and always
       available/set.
    2. The more PV, the cheaper the energy supply.
    3. The more grid supply, the cheaper the energy supply.
    4. No matter in which scenario PV is used it always results in a cheaper overall LCOE.

It should be noted that due to the unreliability of grid connection the two options were not further ana-
lysed and the financing if the following chapter was only considered for the chosen option "All supply
options with PV". The addition of PV to the supply options is considered as a stabilising factor that will
give NGEST more independence from diesel as well as the grid.

9.3.2     Different Financing Options and Sensitivities

Three different financing options were considered for the project:

    1. Commercial funding scenario
    2. 50% grant scenario
    3. Green funding scenarios

What should be understood concerning the calculation of the financing options is the fact that the power
supply options are interrelated and can only together generate enough electricity to meet the energy
demand of NGEST. Therefore, all financing scenarios were calculated for the total future investment
costs of 9.7 million USD. However, for the green funding scenario, the investment costs of PV and
biogas were used for the grant and the diesel costs are to be financed with a loan and thus separated
into renewable energy components (keeping it "green") and conventional energy component.

Figure 9-4:      Most favourable funding options




The four funding scenarios presented are the most favourable ones in terms of overall costs.

Scenario 1, commercial funding, represents a convincing approach with a 20% grant, 80% loan struc-
ture, a common way of funding. The addition of 20% grant allows costs of 8.9 million USD, fixing the
costs for the beneficiary below the overall investment costs of 9.7 million USD.

Scenario 2, 50% grant, is the cheapest option for the beneficiary as 50% of the costs are financed by a
grant. Even with an interest rate of 6%, which is most accurate for Palestine, the costs are low with 7
million USD. Even more favourable, yet less realistic with an interest rate of 3% is also scenario 2 with
costs of 6 million USD.

Scenario 3, Green Funding (only PV and Biogas), is also beneficial in terms of costs to be paid by the
beneficiary. The Green Funding allows a grant for the "green" components of the project, biogas and
PV and offers a loan for the conventional energy component diesel. Due to a marginal management fee
of 0.43% instead of an interest rate Green Funding allows costs of 8.5 million USD. These costs are
below the overall investment costs of 9.7 million USD. For 10 years loan tenor including the marginal
management fee Green Funding allows costs of 8,626,345 USD.

The "best" scenario is a different one for each donor, depending on their financing habits and abilities,
thus the consultant refrained from making any definite recommendation on one specific scenario. Nev-
ertheless, the scenarios presented represent a variety from which an option might be chosen. Of course
other financing options are possible but were not further highlighted in this report, as that would go
beyond the scope. An additional calculation including further contingencies of 10% is included in the
annex, section 12.8 to broaden the options and the perspective on the investment. These calculations
also highlight adequate project risks.

9.4        Summary Economic and Financial Assessment

An economic and financial analysis was conducted with the objective to identify the costs and benefits
of the installation of a Solar PV plant as a power supply option for NGEST. The financial analysis in
particular examines closely the investment's profitability and different financing scenarios.

The economic assessment was used to determine the relevant costs and benefits of the different energy
flows, excluding taxes to better represent the opportunity costs for the country. It assessed the costs of
electricity from biogas, diesel and the GEDCo grid connection as well as the addition of the PV option
into the power supply mix. For the PV options 5 technical variants were analysed and their energy gen-
eration costs quantified. The economic assessment closely examined the options available and gave
an insight into which variants are economically the most attractive.

For this purpose, two main scenarios were compared: NGEST with a PV option and NGEST without a
PV option. The comparison allowed to determine which scenario is economically the more cost effective
and favourable. The LCOE assessment provided the basis for the recommendation of thePV variant 2
"Geometric Adaption", which proved to be the most beneficial in terms of costs of electricity (USD/kWh)
and capacity output.49

From the results of the economic analysis, the financial analysis was conducted including the PV option
variant 2 "Geometric Adaption"50. A cost assessment and the calculation of the levelized costs of elec-
tricity were conducted in a cost based approach.

The financial assessment compared the two scenarios NGEST with the PV supply option and NGEST
without the PV supply option - over a period of 20 years (2016–2036), based on real prices including
taxes and subsidies. Two additional supply options were considered, option "GEDCo": Supply through
biogas and GEDCo only as well as option "GEDCo + PV": supply only with biogas, GEDCo and PV.

The two additional options, leaving out the expensive diesel, generated low LCOEs (0,139 USD/KWh
and 0,128 USD/ kWh), still favouring the PV option with 0,128 USD/kWh. However, these options are
not recommended as the supply via GEDCo / grid is very unstable and would not lead to a more reliable
supply of energy for NGEST. An additional supply line from Israel is highly unlikely and therefore also
currently not considered a sustainable option for the plants energy supply.

NGEST without PV and the current supply options (biogas, diesel, and GEDCo grid connection) lead to
an overall LCOE of 0.23 USD/kWh. NGEST with the PV option installed has an overall LCOE of 0.20
USD/kWh, making it 0.03 USD/kWh cheaper than the no PV option. Regarding the project lifetime of 20
years, these 0.03 USD/kWh generate a saving in the present value of costs of 15,627,543 USD.

Sensitivity testing of the different LCOEs of the supply options, the diesel prices as well as the price of
GEDCo's grid connection also favoured the installation of solar PV. Even if the diesel price were to be
exempt from the 55% Blue Tax, the PV solar option would still generate cost savings. 51

An overall investment sum of 9.7 million USD, including three funding scenarios (commercial funding,
50% grant and green funding), were calculated for NGEST. The investment was assessed as a whole

49 Variant 2, has an economic LCOE of 0.068 USD/kWh and an installed capacity of 5,109 (kWp). For further detail concerning
   this analysis please refer to chapter 9.2.2).

including the conservative power supply options and the solar option. This is owed to the fact that the
supply for NGEST can only be sufficiently guaranteed through a mix of all supply options. Sensitivities
such as different interest rates and grace periods were included. Depending on the type of financing, a
total costs/debt was established to be in the range of 6 million USD and 12.1 million USD52. A recom-
mendation for one specific scenario was not given as each donor/investor prefers and sets different
financing parameters.

As an overall conclusion, the cost savings as well as the sensitivities examined are proof for the com-
petitiveness of the PV option vs. the power supply without PV. It is highly beneficial that the power supply
through PV is secure and grants NGEST independence over 16% of its annual overall electricity need,
liberating it from additional power cuts and diesel shortages. Thus aiding to the relief of the water sector
and resolving some of its problems, such as overflow of sewage which severely affects life conditions
in Gaza. Therefore, due to the cost effectiveness, the savings and the heightened independence in
power supply, the investment is deemed favourable and recommendable.



9.5          Commercial Structure of Project Implementation

Given that the addition of a PV plant and the identified modifications of the power supply are finally
evaluated as feasible and the stakeholders take a positive decision towards implementation, the com-
mercial structure has to be defined. The commercial structure involves mainly the ownership and re-
sponsibility for operation of the PV systems. Depending on the general structure, connected aspects will
have to be specified involving mainly the procurement strategy and the financial setup as well as mainte-
nance and support.

The first decision is the question of ownership. The first option (1) is ownership by the NGEST project
and consequently PWA. In this case, procurement would be conducted on EPC turn-key basis (i.e.
design-build-transfer). The second option would be to keep the ownership with a private entity. In case
of private participation, the external participation could be achieved by (2) merely outsourcing installation
and operation (i.e. BOOT or alike), also called contracting, or (3) to lease the services from a completely
independent party by buying the actual end product under an IPP model.

The decision is mainly influenced by the following criteria: political preference (i.e. provision services by
public utilities), economic and financial attractiveness, which is not only determined by the direct (finan-
cial) benefits but also the indirect risks, such as, control of operation and stability of demand and power
sales.

From a political aspect, there are currently no direct partnerships on operating assets between the public
utilities of PA and the private sector. This is understandable given the constrained – island-like – condi-
tions of the economy of the Palestinian territories and the even more limited economic situation in
Gaza53. The PA may want to maintain direct control of the utilities in order to react to the political
changes, develop a coherent infrastructure, increase capacity employment and capacity of the local
workforce and to be able to achieve financing of these basic investments together with its partners.
Regardless of the political and institutional structures of the project, a financial calculation would need
to show if the project in itself is viable. If support by an external partner is searched for, the financials
must allow for the incentive that renders participation by a private entity attractive. During the commercial
assessment, the financial benefits and trade-offs would need to be evaluated. A state-financing of the

investment would benefit from the access to external capital at good conditions but is often constrained
by the lack of equity resources. Although a private investor may have easier access to equity, such
institutions would regard the venture as vehicle to realize a certain amount of profit – usually defined by
the requirements of the shareholders. Consequently, the financials must be able to provide room for
stable and reliable revenues, which allow for generating earnings with the targeted margin. But the solar
PV plant does not generate revenues or surplus of energy for feed-in purposes. Thus the private invest-
ment possibilities are very limited. If a private investment were to be considered, e.g. with a margin
imposed on the price/kWh through an investor, this would largely reduce the savings in costs. Addition-
ally, a management fee would be imposed by the investor, which would further lower the savings poten-
tial. For these reasons private investment options were not further exploited.

In addition, the private entities would scrutinize the risks associated with the undertaking. In the case of
NGEST, the main risks are the lack of control over the operation of the whole NGEST power system
driven by the needs of the treatment plant and recovery scheme loads, the general political situation
and its potential damaged, the influence of stakeholders (i.e. participants of local sewage system,
GEDCo and IEC, farmers) on operation as well as the general timeline of implementation. The single
biggest risk for an independent operator is the control of the power supply: The whole operation of
NGEST is not driven by the power availability but rather the demand required for the daily operation.
The operators of NGEST manage and supervise the electrical system depending on the primary pro-
cesses (i.e. the wastewater treatment) of the facility. While a typical operation pattern was developed in
this study, huge uncertainty yet remains on the actual operation pattern. This applies especially in the
years until 2025. During this period, NGEST would still be in expansion while the actual timeline remains
uncertain and the operation scheme may therefore be subject to change. Uncertainty arises once more
from the fact that NGEST has not started its operation yet, and thus no experience on its actual perfor-
mance is available.

The power supply is set up in a form of an integrated hybrid supply of the different sources mentioned
in this assessment. Thus, any contract with an external entity would also need to define the interfacing
and level of integration with the other power sources in order to deliver a combined product, i.e. the
electricity that NGEST requires. As explained above, it is rather impossible for an external party to con-
trol of utilization of power but also availability of the other components, e.g. the operation hours of the
biogas engine. But finally, all these day-to-day changes by NGEST to the operational pattern have an
impact on the energy price. The biomass is driven by the sludge and gas production, the grid is a source
with high uncertainty and the diesel depends on the import to the strip. Technical aspects of the local
supply such as changes in power factor or heat production in case of black start of the treatment plant
are additional commercial hurdles. Since NGEST controls the overall power infrastructure it is very dif-
ficult to define technical guarantees in such a transparent way that allows a fair evaluation of the perfor-
mance independent of external impacts.

The definition of performance requirements for an energy contractor is easier if the participation of the
private entity is limited to suppling power from the PV system. But within such set-up would the verifica-
tion suffer from the same constraints outlined above, i.e. power supply follows load requirements;
NGEST optimises its own operation. In this case, energy meters would need to be installed at all con-
nection points and not only at the switchgear.

The characteristics and conditions of the mentioned options are summarized in Table 9-22.

Under the described conditions, an ownership by NGEST/PWA and procurement via an EPC tender
would be recommended. Such tender would need to choose a sound middle course between a detailed
technical specification defining interfaces and requirements of NGEST and a functional minimum re-
quirement for the PV plant allowing a certain level of freedom for the contractor to bring in their own

innovation. Such contract could contain requirements for training of local craftsmen and technicians
during construction and operation in order to achieve replication of the project at other facilities, e.g. the

10. Potential Impact on the Local Political
    Economy

10.1       Impact on GEDCo Network

GEDCo as the supplying utility is directly affected by the planned modifications to the NGEST power
supply options. The first and direct impact arises from potential feed-back of excess power to GEDCo’s
network. As explained in section 7.2, there are periods when excess energy from RE generation occurs.
The concept for an optimised utilisation of this energy is laid out in section 7.3.3. It foresees to keep
impact on the planned network connection and to operations of GEDCo as low as possible. Since the
NGEST facilities remain at any time a net-consumer of energy, no export to the wider network is ex-
pected under normal operations of NGEST, e.g. when the WWTP or the pumps and wells are not in
maintenance.

Consequently, PWA and GEDCo would need to append the existing network connection agreement
with details on the proposed concept for coupling of the two project locations. This includes finding
consent on metering issues and isolation of the facility via the proposed breaker at the point of common
coupling.

The reduction of net energy drawn from the grid is an indirect impact. In the constrained distribution
network with limited capacity this will relieve the pressure on GEDCo’s network , especially for the sup-
pressed demand. Thus, the electricity supply and service hours to the local communities in Gaza espe-
cially the adjacent Jabalia community can be increased. The increase in service hours will allow for more
productive use and will therefore, improve overall livelihood and economy in Gaza.



10.2       Options for Fostering Local Content

Requirements of project financing institutions providing capitals to infrastructure projects in the Pales-
tinian territories require typically that a tender with volume of 5 Mil. USD and above must be published
as an international tender request. But during procurement (supply), installation and O&M phase support
of local companies from Gaza will be needed.

Based on the CAPEX estimate for the PV system, the amount of goods and works procured in the
Palestinian territories could approximately be valued at 2 Million. USD. This estimate includes supplies
for mechanical structures, civil works and labour. The final value depends on the actual sourcing of the
selected contractor. It may be considered to require a certain minimum portion in the tender documents.

Such procurement volume would first increase the technical capabilities of the local companies and
therewith it could potentially encourage local companies to start or develop their business in the direction
to supply and support facility power systems.

10.3       Competences and Capacity of the Local Economy

The project will use local technicians for the installation of the PV arrays from local PV firms and com-
panies specialised in electro-technical installations. This will ensure building the capacity of those tech-
nicians and qualify them to implement similar projects. Based on the available information there are 25-
30 technicians and engineers who are already working in this issue in Gaza. It is likely that they will be
the ones benefiting from this project in terms of implementation and capacity development. In addition,
the capacity of the three small companies in Gaza to deliver and deal with such large projects in this
field will be upgraded and will potentially qualify them for other similar contracts. All these will ensure
business development and boosting of economy in Gaza.

Today there are three main local firms that work in renewable energy in Gaza, shown in Table 10-1:

Name                                       Size                          Comment

                                                                         neers
Tic Land                                   Small                         6 employees of which 3 engi-
                                                                         neers
Annid (Al nid)                             Small                         5 employees of which 2 engi-
                                                                         neers


In addition, there is a number of smaller companies who work as subcontractor for these three main
ones in Gaza.

Moreover, the project itself may encourage adopting solar energy at a wider scale by the government
to produce clean energy and reduce the dependence on the external energy sources, even those pro-
duced locally since they depend on imported fossil fuel.



10.4       Potential for Replication

Although there are smaller scale PV plants in Gaza, the scale of this plant will be definitely seen as a
case model to be replicated not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank, should it prove feasible and
successful. Moreover, the project is in line with the national strategic objective to ensure the generation
of electricity from renewable sources. In this line, PENRA has signed a new agreement with an Interna-
tional firm to generate electricity from PV in Gaza. This project will definitely be a guide for the develop-
ment of similar initiatives in the future.

Similar projects with integrated power supply are already in planning:
    the Gaza Central Desalination Plant, and
    the Gaza Central Wastewater Project

For both projects the use of solar power is planned right from the beginning as part of the system. Again,
what makes NGEST a special case is actually the fact that it is already (partially) implemented. By this,
a reference case is generated for the refurbishment and upgrade of existing government and public
facilities, especially those with constant and high energy demand. With NGEST being ahead in time on

the other projects, all stakeholders can gain valuable experience with implementation and operation. If
being implemented by the responsible institutions, the transfer of acquired knowledge to other projects
can be facilitated.

11. Conclusions and Recommendations

11.1       Feasibility of the PV System

On the technical side, the study confirmed the adequacy of the planning and current design of the power
supply system of the facility. This conclusion was reached under the assumptions that water intake and
energy consumption data for the NGEST facility are correct. The quality of workmanship at the treatment
plant is a very positive indicator. It proves that it is possible to implement a complex project in the adverse
conditions of the area and the capability of PWA to supervise large construction activities. This is re-
garded as a solid basis for potential modifications to the initial design and the inclusion of additional
components such as the PV system – although medium-size PV systems do not yet exist in Gaza. The
circumstances allow for recommending the NGEST project as the first pilot project for innovative use of
PV as power saver for the power supply of a public service facility with high energy demand.

The conditions at the site and the selected areas allow for the installation of several PV systems of
different sizes. Altogether they result in a medium sized PV installation, which contributes considerably
to the annual energy supply of the project. Together with the biogas generator, the other renewable
energy source, PV generation even leads to an excess of energy at the WWTP site during certain hours.
A technical solution was identified that optimises the use of this excess in such a way that additional
expenses and impact to the network is minimised.

The preliminary environmental and social impact assessment had shown no blockers regarding external
stakeholders but rather effects of the environment on the system itself. A set of preliminary mitigation
measures was identified which help to address the associated sources of impact.

The use of PV at NGEST offers energy cost savings. Using PV on a public facility does not only in-
creases the technical independence from the constrained network but also enhances the economic
security of supply. The PV system can also alleviate the budget by reducing the annual energy supply
costs. This set-up is also called auto-consumption or captive generation. The financial analysis has also
shown that an investment into the planned system can be recommended and financing through different
arrangements is possible.

It can be expected that a PV system would generate a positive impact on the local economy through
participation during construction or operation. A more indirect effect is attributed to the chance to gain
real local experience with net-metering and power-saving systems on a larger scale. This would benefit
integrated energy planning of other facilities as well as GEDCo in their efforts to improve the general
supply situation.



11.2       Recommendations for Implementation

Based on the findings of the assessment, the following principal recommendations can be provided:

11.2.1 General Technical Recommendations

The following recommendations shall be considered when defining the minimum technical requirements

for the bidding documents of the PV system:

        A standard fixed mounted system with distributed inverter configuration shall be used to reduce
         the complexity to a minimum.
        The orientation can be either geometry adapted as in the presented conceptual design, True
         South or even E-W. This may include:

              o    Variant 1: Azimuth 0° – True South with optimum tilt angle
              o    Variant 2: geometry adapted with optimum tilt angle
              o    East-West orientation with lower tilt

        Configurations that achieve higher installation capacity and higher annual energy generation
         than the conceptual design may be attributed with higher points in the technical evaluation.
         Since this will have an impact on the bid price and required investment budget, a suitable trade-
         off mechanism has to be considered when defining the evaluation criteria. This is best illustrated
         to the stakeholders and financing partners by example calculations.
        Any orientation proposed by the bidder shall achieve an annual energy generation equal or
         higher than the total annual energy yield estimated for the conceptual design using Variant 2.
        Within these limits, effort could be undertaken to raise efficiency and optimise performance. But
         the final objective of the design shall be a reliable and trouble-free operation. This would exclude
         experiments, such as using trackers or similar components requiring higher attention during
         maintenance. This means in other words: the simpler the design the better – NGEST is not a
         power generation facility since its core business activity is the water treatment and sanitation.
        The system shall be specified to use qualitative and durable components adequate to the local
         environment.
        Each inverter unit should
              o be certified for outdoor use;
              o have rating as high as possible;
              o be a multi-string inverter above a minimum power rating, e.g. 30 kVA, or
        Optionally, modular central inverters (i.e. with individual modules mounted in racks) can be used
         for the ground-mounted areas.
        The integration into the facility control system should be given high importance because this
         interface guarantees a seamless operation of all power system components.
        A simple but functional solution for the safe isolation during load shedding and the connection
         of the electricity systems of the two locations will allow to leverage further energy saving and
         more reliable operation. But this aspect shall be verified and agreed upon with GEDCo.
        For the elaboration of bidding documents, a review of the supply market situation shall be con-
         ducted to ensure that only reliable components are procured and that bidders have a sufficient
         range of products to select from. Marked checks shall be conducted anyway during the following
         two tasks in the course of documents preparation:
              o A market screening during definition of minimum requirements to suppliers of key com-
                   ponents, which will provide input to the formulation of the qualification criteria.
              o An update of the typical module characteristics but also a brief review of the technology
                   roadmap shall ensure that only standard market product may be used and the market
                   trends are considered. Taking modules as an example, this means that increase of
                   rated capacity of the average module should be factored in the bid conditions – either
                   by contract assurance to supply higher rated panels or a price index that allows increas-
                   ing the module rating and contract amount based on the technology trends. Since it is
                   expected that the period between preparation of bidding documents and actual pur-
                   chase may take a year or even more, such arrangement ensures that NGEST benefits
                   from technical advances.

11.2.2 Financial and Commercial Recommendations

The key recommendations for the financial and commercial aspects during implementation are:

        Looking at the results of the economic evaluation and financial analysis, the choice of adding a
         PV system is recommended for the economy of the Palestinian territories and the budget of
         NGEST as the figures show positive impacts in both cases.
        Given the control and risk structures of the project, the implementation via an EPC-turnkey con-
         tract under management of PWA is preferred. This is also based on the observation that the
         function of the facility as public service for the civil society does not provide much room for
         involvement of private sector players through other contract forms such as commodity contract-
         ing or even purchase of the PV-generated energy from an IPP tasked to operate the PV system.
        The possibility of subcontracting the PV system to the main NGEST contract, maybe worth a
         closer look. Such configuration would offer the advantage of merging all technical guarantees
         into one contract and reducing interface coordination tremendously.
        In the short-term, GEDCo's consent on the proposed power share solution should be sought
         out, as the utility must give consent to the proposed new point of common coupling. In the mid-
         term, a regulatory solution via a net-metering scheme is regarded as more suitable. It can be
         expected that all parties will grow confidence in auto-consumer solutions once having gained
         experience with the operation and performance of the PV/biogas system at NGEST and its
         impact on the network.
        During the selection of a financing scenario, a sufficient level of contingency may be included
         to cover for unforeseen impacts from both the complexity of the project itself, the lack of expe-
         rience of PV installations of such magnitude in Gaza and the actual location in a constrained
         area.

11.3       Potential Timeline for Implementation

A tentative time schedule has been developed and discussed with the stakeholders. The set of mile-
stones listed in Table 11-1 and outlined in Figure 11-1 may guide the stakeholders through the next
steps of decision making and implementation. As emphasised, the tight coordination of the remaining
NGEST construction activities and external approval procedures will be crucial.

NOTE:
 PV Systems according to the conceptual design are installed in a maximum of 3-4 months.
 This depends strongly on the availability of tools and skilled work force.
 Clearance, importing and transport of components to Gaza may pose a constraint.
 An additional quarter was considered as contingency on the timeline for this issue.
 The timeline may be affected by external influences such as regulations or the security situation.
 The timeline for the implementation of Phase 2, foreseen for the years between 2018 and 2024, is
  still uncertain. Currently, the funding for Stage 1 of Phase 1 is being applied for and arranged.

12. ANNEX

12.1       Detailed Site Description

12.1.1 Areas Designated for PV Systems

12.1.1.1 Areas within Treatment Plant Boundary

The largest area is A1 in the South of the facility. It is currently unused and covered with grass and small
shrub. A slight slope of about 2-3° towards the inner area of the plant is observed (Figure 12-1 and
Figure 12-2).




Figure 12-1:        A1 viewing towards West                    Figure 12-2:   A1 viewing towards East/A10


Since the project was initially planned to be supplied only by the feeder line and on-site biogas with
additional support by the emergency diesel when needed, cable trenches are reported to be full and
without room for additional cables. Cables for connecting the PV plant to the electrical infrastructure
would need to be run down at the outer side of the building, e. g. as seen in Figure 12-3. It is proposed
to connect the PV sub-systems of the smaller roof-top sub-systems directly to the LV panels of the
respective building to avoid the otherwise long cabling for the connection to the power house. In this
case, the PV system would represent a negative load on top of the building’s load reducing its net draw
of energy from NGEST’s total power supply.

The plant still has many but small open areas between the single sewage processing steps as shown
in Figure 12-4. These areas could be used to install two axis trackers, if such technology is opted for.

The roofs of all buildings have been used to place typical facilities such as air-condition outlets and
water tanks. These are present on all buildings as shown in Figure 12-6 and Figure 12-7. The PV design
has to deduct these areas from the total available area and consider some buffer space for maintenance
access to this equipment.

There is a second large brown-field area (A2) located close to the road on the West of the plant pictured
in Figure 12-7 and Figure 12-8. Its rectangular shape and size makes it a perfect place for a larger and
well performing ground-mounted array. This is the sub-system which would be affected mostly by the
dust emitted from the refuse collection lorries passing on the road outside the fence. Fortunately, mainte-
nance access for cleaning will be easy at this place.

12.1.1.2 Areas at recovery scheme

The second location with designated PV areas is the effluent recovery scheme behind the cemetery as
shown in Figure 12-12. It can be reached either via a untarred road from Jibaliya or by following the road
along the plant’s fence and then branching left at the Northern site corne r as illustrated in Figure 12-9.

Since the recovery scheme is scheduled to be constructed after commissioning of the WWTP in stage
1 and stage 2 of phase 1 and then expanded in phase 2, no structures can be currently found on these
areas. The view from the corner close to the cemetery towards the town and the view toward the treat-
ment plant are shown in Figure 12-10 and Figure 12-11.

Apart from the mechanical and electrical buildings, PWA also selected a larger area of about 32,000 m²
on top of the recovery fields for a PV system. The land is currently leased to local farmers on seasonal
basis and covered with grass or other crops as depicted in Figure 12-12 and Figure 12-13. A challenge
for these areas will be to plan and coordinate the installation of a potential ground-mounted PV system
in such a way that the construction of the facilities for the recovery scheme is not hindered.

12.1.1.3 External Obstacles

Since the NGEST project is located close to the border, the land around it is used for agricultural pur-
poses. This includes mainly the cultivation of seasonal crops or forage as seen in Figure 12-16. Such
land use is generally of advantage because it prevents development of dust which would in return lead
to soiling losses during operation.

A few activities around the area are potential sources of dust and dirt, such as the landfill site in the
North-East of the treatment plant site and the dust-carts which regularly pass the site on the untarred
road as shown in Figure 12-14..

Figure 12-14: Refuse collection vehicle using dirt road at NW




Further, low-intensive human activity which are probably always present in the densely populated Gaza
strip, may have an impact on the operation and performance like the charcoal production closed to the
cemetery shown in Figure 12-15.


Figure 12-15: Charcoal production close to Northern site corner




Another external source of potential high impact which affects the whole region is the proximity to the
border with Israel. Fractures from the armed conflict in 2014 have been observed at the NGEST admin-
istration building. Ricochets or other similar objects would obviously also affect PV arrays and may lead
to glass breakage on a large scale.

12.1.2 Electrical Infrastructure

12.1.2.1 Network Power Supply

The treatment plant is currently serviced by an over-head feeder line branched off from the main network
in Jibaliya and then guided along the secondary road towards the site (see Figure 12-17 and
Figure 12-18). The supply voltage is 22 kV which is usually considered as medium voltage but due to
lack of higher voltage levels in Gaza also referred to as high voltage.




Figure 12-17: OHL feeder from Jibaliya                         Figure 12-18: OHL towards the plant


The cable is then received by a steel tower with a CB at the Western border of the plant next to PV area
A2, shown in Figure 12-19. This tower is currently equipped with a temporary transformer used by the
Contractor of the facility. Within the treatment plant, underground cables are used to guide the power to
the energy building pictured in Figure 12-20. The localisation of these cables will be important during
the potential construction of the PV system on A2 in order to avoid damage of the main power cables.

The effluent recovery scheme is not yet connected to the MV network because these facilities are sched-
uled to be constructed later in phase 1 of the NGEST project. In case that the PV system is installed
before the recovery scheme in order to supply the treatment plant, the contractor of the PV systems
would also need to set-up at least a temporary grid connection in the absence of the main electrical
infrastructure and additional generators at that location. Such situation may happen if the PV systems
are planned to be procured altogether as one lot. Since the PV systems will be planned as grid-con-
nected plants, either a stable network connection or local generator is required to build the grid.

A spark ignited gas generator set is installed with a capacity of 830 kVA produced by the manufacturer
MWM, Germany (refer to Figure 12-22 and Figure 12-23). The cooling water piping of this generator is
not yet finished.

12.1.2.2.2     LV and HV Electrical Installations

The energy building has separate rooms for HV connection and LV connection. These were inspected
in order to determine the possibility for the connection of the PV systems, especially the larger sub-
systems.

The existent energy Siemens Ring-Main-Feeder switchgear (see Figure 12-26) is planned to control the
connection to the grid and to the on-site diesel and biogas generators. Currently, the installed switch
gear is only connected to public grid.

Both rooms are equipped with sufficient spare space for the installation of additional feeders and switch-
boards for both feeding high voltage from the larger ground-mounted field PV sub-systems to the HV
room and feeding low voltage from the rooftop PV systems directly to the LV system in the LV room.

The rooms have clean cable routing provided by the large underground distribution chambers beneath
the floor (Figure 12-30).

The building also accomodates the fire protection system which control unit is shown in Figure 12-29.

12.1.2.3 Main Consumers of the Treatment Plant

Within the sewage processing chain different energy consuming equipment is installed. It was looked at
during the site walk-through in order to be able to relate its status and construction to the process de-
scription and drawings. The selected steps of the process are briefly described.

For the digester zone, there are no special remarks related to the electrical infrastructure. The digesters
are important for the production of the biogas.

The civil works of the gas holder (Figure 12-31) and gas torch (Figure 12-32) seem not to be totally
accomplished. Before start of operation a membrane system with a steel plate protection must be
mounted. Purpose of the membrane is to keep the gas-pressure constant.

tem, the sludge activating basins (Figure 12-36, Figure 12-37), the sand washing zone (Figure 12-38,
Figure 12-39) and the final clarifiers (Figure 12-40, Figure 12-41), no specific observations were made

The electrical power demand of the plant together with the application of a factor for simultaneous run-
ning of electrical consumers under several power conditions will be assessed. The blowers (Figure
12-42, Figure 12-43) are one of main consumers running rather continuously.

On the generation site, the biogas production and its differing for the LHV will need to be analysed.


12.1.3 Additional Site Infrastructure

The design of the treatment plant contains all necessary infrastructure required for the operation. A few
aspects may be mentioned here which are important for the PV system and the power supply as a
whole.

A meteorological station operated as part of the regional measurement network has been installed (refer
to Figure 12-44). The equipment could be easily complemented by radiation measurement sensors for
the reference monitoring of the PV system.


Figure 12-44: On-site meteorological station (no radiation measured)




The road network, as shown in Figure 12-45, is well established which facilitates installation and mainte-
nance. The PV installation company will have to consider the normal operation of the treatment plant

and ensure that these existing structures are not damaged.

12.1.4 External Interfaces

Any further expansion of the electrical infrastructure or change in power supply will share the interfaces
with the NGEST locations themselves. They are:

        The treatment plant receives external power supply from GEDCo via a 22 KV MV OHL feeder;

        Telecommunication is provided by the DSL line for the NGEST SCADA, no information is cur-
         rently available on bandwidth and availability of this line;

12.2       Detailed Description of Environmental Conditions

12.2.1 General Climate Conditions

12.2.1.1 Rainfall

Rainfall occurs during winter between the months October - April each year. The annual average rainfall
in the project location (Northern Part of Gaza) is nearly 390 mm / year according to Qahman, et al
(2011). In addition, the average recorded rainfall intensity over 30 years of record in Gaza was 45.1
mm/hr while this average is exceeded often in storm events such as the case of 2003 as shown in figure
below where the intensity was close to 60 mm/hour, Exact (2006).

12.2.1.2 Temperatures

The project sites have a typical semi-arid Mediterranean climate with long hot and dry summer (from
25oC in summer and 13oC in winter; the maximum daily temperature can reach 31 oC and the minimum
temperature is around 11.6oC). The proximity of the Mediterranean Sea has a moderating effect on
temperatures and promotes high humidity throughout the year.

(MPP) can have attenuation of about 5% in form of voltage drop in the mid-day time only when temper-
ature reaches its maximum value in summer. In the early hours of summer day as well as in late hours
MPP is minimally affected. The last minimal effect of temperature is correct too for winter, spring and
autumn seasons.

Air should be allowed to circulate behind the back of each PV-module, so the temperature does not rise.
This is an essential procedure to conserve the electrical output of the modules. For the detailed design
of NGEST PV-plant the influence of temperature should be considered. Related data can be found54.


12.2.1.3 Relative Humidity

Gaza is a humid area with average monthly relative humidity of nearly 68%. Particles of water vapour
are highly concentrated in the lower layers of the coastal atmosphere of Gaza. In the same time the
concentration of vapour had no permanent character, it changes by time and air spot. Mediterranean
Sea west to Gaza is the huge water surface increasing the humidity. Wind directions limit the concen-
tration of vapours in Gaza atmosphere. Table 12-2 below shows some available measurements of evap-
oration from Gaza metrological station55:

mm/year



12.2.1.4 Wind

Gaza is the windiest area in The Palestinian territories. The prevailing wind direction is South West with
an average speed of 11 km/hour (winter) and from North West (summer) and sometimes from the East.
Depending on wind direction, when it blows from the south or west it carries light solid particles from the
sandy beach in the west as well as from dry fields in eastern areas of the strip to the atmosphere. Mixing
with air the solid particles become as a fixed component of the atmosphere "aerosols". Diffuse of radia-
tion by aerosols occurs in the visible region in addition to ultraviolet region of the solar spectrum. Under
high aerosols concentrations the normal blue colour of the sky changes into white and in few cases in
Gaza the sky has a colour closer to yellow when southern winds and air temperatures are too high in
summer.


12.2.1.5 Storms and Lightning Risk

Storm occurrence has no fixed return period but generally follows the general cycle of nearly 10 years
for extreme wet events or storms. However, lightning and thunder occurs during normal rainy days not

only during the extreme storms. Therefore, it is important to consider protective measures through thun-
der / lightning protectors in the plant to ensure safety.


12.2.2 Soil Conditions

12.2.2.1 Subsoil

The soil cover of the NGEST site is dark brown loamy clay of 7-23 m depth with a well-developed struc-
ture laying over marine Kurkar Formation (Calcareous sandstone).


12.2.2.2 Vegetation and Land Cover

The areas surrounding the NGEST site are nearly empty and not cultivated. The nearest tree lines to
the site are at 3000 m toward the west. The site is encircled with dirt roads which are heavily used by
solid waste collection trucks and therefore are likely to create dust and affect the PV plant.


12.2.3 Geotechnical Data and Foundation Considerations

The typical surface and subsurface geological setting of Gaza strip is composed of mainly Kurkar group
with a thickness of 200 m and composed of marine and Aeolian calcareous sandstone, silty reddish
sandstone and silt inter layers. There is no major structural or faults presence in the area and the foun-
dation is therefore considered stable in a sense that all designs for any overland structure should be
based on loose soil foundation criteria.


12.2.4 Seismological Risk

Palestine in general has medium to low seismicity with recorded earthquake of 6 degree of magnitude
near Jerusalem early 2000. In addition, for costal area there are no major structural features or faults
that may create some potential seismic activity and is classified as inactive seismic area as shown in
Figure 12-46, the design factor considered for the NGEST plant was 0.075 as reported in the ESIA
(2006).

12.2.5 Solar Resource and Meteorological Input

Solar radiation data and the amount of solar energy in Gaza area are collected and analysed here. This
is an essential step for modelling the NGEST PV-plant. Precise knowledge of available historical solar
radiation in Gaza is assessed to determine the technical parameters of the NGEST.

Analysed data was acquired from:

    1.   PENRA issues including Solar Atlas, 2014,
    2.   Palestinian Bureau of Statistics,
    3.   Scientific papers,
    4.   Reports on measured data from the nearest to Gaza Israeli meteorological station.

The PENRA data were taken in 1998, International Journal data are from 2013, Bet Dajan measure-
ments were published in 2010. The period of measurements and data coverage is not clear for all data
sources.

No measured solar irradiation data was available from the PA central meteorological department in
Ramallah. Due to wars Gaza local meteorological stations were destroyed or not functional, we found
no access even to old locally measured irradiation data.

A comparative study of the existing solar irradiation data sources is shown in Table 12-3. These sources
show an irradiation daily rate of 5.25 kWh/m 2.

When comparing the data from the Solar Atlas with the local measurement sources and evaluation
efforts presented above no significant deviations are found. This conclusion confirms that the Solar Atlas
can be regarded as a reliable long-term data source for the PV system design.

The factors influencing irradiation values in Gaza are clouds, water vapour and aerosols. Particles of
water vapour are invisible, and absorption of solar radiation occurs in the invisible infrared region of the
solar spectrum.

Diffuse radiation is intensive under high concentrated aerosols. Radiation attenuates by aerosols de-
pending on the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). There are no measurements in Gaza for the AOD. It can
be only estimated together with other factors in the Strip increasing the diffuse radiation such as water
vapour, industrial dust, pollution caused by burning of agricultural waste and any other air polluting
factor.

The data assessment criteria are application-specific and are selected here according to the planned
use of the data for NGEST. Data of Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI) in Gaza has a major importance for
the NGEST PV-plant. Data of Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) is valuable for the tracking part of NGEST
PV-plant. The NGEST solar power plant uses no concentrated solar technologies (CSP) and therefore
the diffuse radiation caused by aerosols and water vapour has no considerable effect on plant's perfor-
mance. The main radiation indicator for the NGEST plant remains GTI.

The influence of air temperature on irradiation is analysed from collected data in Table 12-5 below.
Average of air temperature on 2m height shows two important indicators:
    1. The average temperature all over the year is below 40°C. Performance of PV arrays is in the
       safe range and nominal capacity of PV plant in general can be ensured.
    2. The general tendency of temperature increase from January to August is in accompany with the
       GTI increase. Only DNI indicates little declination after June, this has a little effect on the track-
       ing part of the NGEST PV plant as this tracking part is small.

well as to assess plant production and system costs.

   The Solar Atlas of Palestine provides
        o general resources information
        o indication on tilt angle
        o data sets as input for the simulation
   NGEST project documents
        o Contractor’s design (nearly as-built)

        o Analysis of system costs for The Palestinian territories including fees and levies for Gaza


12.3.1.2 Approach and Assumption for Design and Modelling

The actual configuration for each variant was defined using the CAD software for measuring the dimen-
sions and geometry of the areas as well as the simulation tool PVSyst for simulating the performance
and output of the PV generator. P50 TMY dataset described in section 2.6.2 was used as meteorological
input data.

In the next step, the orientation was added to the configuration. The geometrical parameters were meas-
ured out of the correspondent CAD designs. Exemplar values for Variant 1 are shown in Table 12-6.

The spacing between rows was defined in such a way that the yield is maximised while a good acces-
sibility is still maintained. As a general rule the spacing was designed to keep the module tables free of
shadow for at least 4 hours on the shortest day of the year (21 st of December) corresponding to a
shading angle of 27°. A module tilt of 25° is considered as the optimum between yield, racking costs
and row spacing.

Any obstacles such as roof-top facilities (e.g. water tanks, HVAC outlets) were excluded from the design.

In some cases shorter strings had to be added in order to fill the complete area with PV panels. Smaller
inverters down to the size of 25 kVA were used in this case in order to ensure efficient conversion
performance.

For the performance calculations the system losses shown in Table 12-8 were estimated and applied.
The Perez-Model was used to transpose the GHI values to the tilted module surface.

An initial light-induced degradation (LID) of 2% and an annual degradation of 0.72% corresponding to
typical manufacturer performance guarantees in the market were assumed for the calculation of the
average production over 25 years of the project lifetime. In order to simplify the calculation, the different
areas with similar characteristics were grouped together. This reduced the need to run many simulations
with just minor variations in the input and output values.


12.3.1.3 Cost Estimation for Potentially Feasible Variants

A preliminary cost estimate was developed breaking the total system costs down to the second level.
The CAPEX are split in 15 sub-groups whereas the OPEX were separated in 4 categories. These sub-
groups represent the major cost factors of the PV system. All sub-groups were priced separately.

For materials and equipment quotations and databases of similar projects were used, e.g. in case of the
PV modules standard pricing of an international Tier 1 manufacturer provided a good basis. The values
were then adapted for import duties and local fees. Information from existing solar PV projects in The
Palestinian territories was used as input for the local portion of the costing. Since the most systems are
rather smaller systems, the quotations were adjusted for economies of scale effects that are expected
to be leveraged when procuring a larger system like the planned for NGEST. Examples for such systems
are a few relatively small 2-5 kWp grid connected PV systems and the medium-sized PV plant in Jericho
(300 kWp). These sources have been supplemented by quotations from local and regional suppliers like
Brothers Engineering Co., Bethlehem. Further fees (i.e. importing to Gaza) and local labour costs have
been considered.

For items with a higher share of labour like installation or maintenance the necessary man-hours were
estimated and then multiplied with the cost of the corresponding local man-hour depending on the re-
quired skill level. In certain topics safety margins were applied due to the fact that PV is a new technology
in the region and delays and costs will occur because of local staff being unfamiliar with larger commer-
cial scale PV systems.

There are a few places where the costs differ in respect to other recent estimates, such as the reports
cited at the beginning of this section on PV or recent similar feasibility studies 60. This applies especially
for modules prices – PV panels are still the largest cost portion – which had been adjusted to reflect the
current world market prices. The operation is supposed to be executed by a skilled technician only. A
dedicated engineer is not regarded as necessary and will be available for general supervision as part of
NGEST operations. The resulting values seem reasonable also accounting for the fact that transformer
and switchgear as well as a large part of the electrical infrastructure already exist in the case of the
treatment plant, or will be installed as part of the recovery scheme. Cost differences between the fixed
mounting and the tracked mounted variants is in line what is usually observed at other projects.


12.3.2 Configuration and Analysis for Potentially Feasible Variants

12.3.2.1 Variant 1 – Fixed Structures with Orientation true South

Variant 1 is a PV system with a fixed 25° racking structure orientated towards South. A typical string has
22 modules of 260 Wp. In general 5 strings are connected to one decentralized 25 kVA inverter. The
total rated DC power of the plant is 4821.44 kWp.

An overview of the preliminary array layout for the designated areas within the WWTP site is shown in
Figure 12-48, likewise are the arrays for the areas at the recovery scheme shown in Figure 12-49 while
Figure 12-50 illustrates an exemplary roof-top space.

The key parameters of the system configuration and obtained results are summarised in Table 12-9.

12.3.2.3 Variant 3 – One-axis Tracker

In Variant 3 East-West tracking PV arrays have been placed on the free-field areas. The trackers per-
form an elevation angle of movement with the range of -45 to 45°. One string has 22 modules of 260 Wp
and 5 strings are connected to one decentralized 25 kVA inverter. Since the idea of the tracker config-
uration seeks to optimize the output, the same approach was taken for the roof-top spaces by directing
the modules towards South with a fixed racking structure of 25° tilt. There one array has 22 modules of
260 Wp and 5 strings are connected to one decentralized 25 kVA inverter. The rated DC power of this
variant totals to 2058.68 kWp.

An overview of the preliminary array layout for the designated areas within the WWTP site is shown in
Figure 12-54, likewise are the arrays for the areas at the recovery scheme shown in Figure 12-55 while

12.3.2.4 Variant 4 – Two-axis Tracker

Variant 4 uses a 2-axis tracker instead of the 1-axis tracker on the open space areas. As shown in Figure
12-57, the embankment and dams have also been considered as installation area because the one pole
foundations of the 2-axis tracker allow a very flexible installation while the areas underneath remain still
accessible for the WWTP staff. The tracker has a 2-dimensional movement with an azimuth angle range
of -120 to 120° and a tilt angle movement of 0 to 80°. One string has 21 modules of 260Wp. In general
2 strings are connected to one decentralized 12 kVA inverter. The same configuration as in Variant 1
and Variant 3 was chosen for the roof-top areas in order to achieve maximized performance of the
overall plant. Thus fixed structures with 25° tilt angle have been put on the roof-top areas. One array
has 22 modules of 260 Wp and 5 strings are connected to one decentralized 25 kVA inverter. The DC
power of the plant sums up to 1868.36 kWp.

An overview on the preliminary array layout for the designated areas within the WWTP site is shown in
Figure 12-57, likewise are the arrays for the areas at the recovery scheme shown in Figure 12-58 while
Figure 12-59 illustrates an exemplary roof-top space.

The key parameters of the system configuration and obtained results are summarised in Table 12-12.

12.3.2.5 Variant 5 – Fixed Structures with Geometric Adaptation Using Thin-film Modules

Variant 5 is a modification of Variant 1. The geometrically adapted PV arrays are fitted with thin-film
solar modules instead of the previously used c-Si panels. Likewise, a fixed 25°-tilted racking structure
is used. Due to different dimensions and electrical characteristics of these modules the string configu-
ration was adapted too. One string consists of 8 modules of 160 Wp and 18 strings are connected to
one decentralized 25 kVA inverter. The resulting rated DC power sums up to 4148 kWp.

An overview of the preliminary array layout for the designated areas within the WWTP site is shown in
Figure 12-60, likewise are the arrays for the areas at the recovery scheme shown in Figure 12-61 while
Figure 12-62 illustrates an exemplary roof-top space.

The key parameters of the system configuration and obtained results are summarised in Table 12-13.
