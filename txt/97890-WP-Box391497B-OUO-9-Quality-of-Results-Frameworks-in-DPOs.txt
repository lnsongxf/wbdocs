Overview
This review on the Results Frameworks (RFs) of development policy operations (DPOs) is part of a
series of assessments to gain new insight into the factors that influence the design, implementation,
and performance of policy lending of the World Bank. The review aims to help fill gaps in the
Bank’s knowledge about the results orientation of DPOs and implications for achieving institutional
change that improves a borrower’s sustained growth and poverty reduction outlook. It synthesizes
and reexamines existing evidence on the quality of RFs and its contribution to the success of lending
programs. It also derives lessons from the recent use of DPOs by focusing on the identification of
successful operational arrangements that may improve a program’s overall outcomes. In addition, it
aims to strengthen learning in the Bank and the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and to
influence debate on the design and use of DPOs, especially as the Bank prepares the next DPO
retrospective.

1. Introduction
1.1    The objective of this review is to synthesize existing evaluative evidence and
generate new evidence on the quality of the Results Frameworks (RFs)1 of
development policy operations (DPOs). The study is organized around a number of
evaluative questions on various aspects of DPO design, implementation, reporting, and
evaluation. Its focus is on the quality of RF, taking objectives and coverage for granted.
The study does not cover the scope and coverage of reform programs underpinning
DPOs, including the relevance of objectives, or the choice of policy areas and the links
between DPOs and country assistance strategies. It generally does not look at program
achievements and outcomes, except in cases when it is required for assessing the quality
of prior actions (PAs).

1.2    The RF articulates how the reforms and policy actions supported by the World
Bank will contribute to and influence country development outcomes2. In DPOs, the
RF is presented in the policy matrix and should include a clear statement of the
objectives, outcomes, and outcomes indicators to be achieved through policy and
institutional changes triggered by PAs. As part of the overall drive for results, the Bank
has strengthened its focus on the quality of RFs because it considers them critical to the
outcomes of DPOs.

1.3    The design of DPOs’ RFs and their evaluation remain challenging3. It is
difficult to assess both the extent of policy and institutional change as well as the
attribution of outcomes to the Bank’s intervention through DPOs. The main metric used
for assessing DPOs’ effectiveness in promoting desirable country outcomes is the
outcome rating assigned to the series of DPOs or stand-alone operations series at
completion, which is validated by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). DPOs do
reasonably well on that account (with around three-quarters of DPOs closed in FY10–13
assessed positively), but there is mixed evidence on the overall performance of the
Bank’s clients with respect to policy and institutional change for poverty reduction and
growth. Evidence remains mixed on the key formula of the Bank’s’ DPOs—external
financing for policy and institutional change (see appendix A).

1.4  The RFs for DPOs is subject to various corporate level assessments. In the 2012
DPO Retrospective, OPCS assessed the quality of RFs through assessment of PAs and

their contribution to the results chain for DPOs closed in 2009–20114. According to that
review, 80 percent of DPOs had satisfactory RFs, which was an improvement over the
previous Retrospective periods5.

1.5    IEG’s validation and evaluation largely draws on the quality of the RF for its
assessment of relevance of design of DPOs. Other aspects of the RF are captured
through assessment of the quality of the M&E framework in IEG’s Implementation
Completion and Results Report Reviews (ICRRs). Figure 1.1 shows the ratio of DPOs
with satisfactory relevance of design ratings (substantial and above), which is one input
in defining the overall IEG outcome rating. In addition to assessing the RFs for ICRRs,
IEG has looked at various aspects of RFs for DPOs as part of the 2010 evaluation of
Poverty Reduction Support Credits. This review aims to contribute to the Bank’s
knowledge of the RFs for DPOs.

2. Methodology
2.1   This assessment builds on evaluative findings from previous work by the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), including Implementation Completion and
Results Report Reviews, Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) and crisis response
thematic evaluations, and Project Performance Assessment Reports of long-term
programmatic series (Tanzania and Vietnam PRSCs). The review also draws on 14 desk
reviews of development policy operations (DPOs) conducted specifically for the series.
Additionally, the assessment draws on a review of randomly selected program
documents and Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) for more
information on various aspects of Results Frameworks (RFs).

2.2   Table 2.1 presents the coverage and methodology used in addressing these
evaluative questions:

          Do RFs present a clear statement of program objectives and outcomes? Do the
           prior actions have sufficient institutional depth and criticality to achieve the
           targeted results?
          What are the implications of the programmatic approach for RFs?
          Does the monitoring and evaluation framework capture the impact of the DPO
           on country outcomes?
          Do ICRs provide a comprehensive account of attribution of the Bank’s inputs to
           programs results?

2.3    This review also documents recent changes in the Bank’s approach to RFs of
DPOs, examines their impact on the quality of the instrument, and aims to derive
lessons for IEG in improving validation and evaluation of DPOs.

2.4     The framework for assessing prior actions (PAs) was based on: (i) the quality
criteria for policy actions identified in the guidance note from Operations Policy and
Country Services on results in DPOs7; and (ii) strengths and weaknesses observed in
various IEG evaluative exercises. The review evaluates the robustness of RFs based on
how each PA meets five criteria: (i) relevance, (ii) criticality, (iii) measurability, (iv)
additionality, and (v) efficacy8 (see chapter 4 for more information).

3. Presentation of Results Frameworks
3.1    The Results Frameworks (RFs) for a development policy operation (DPO) is
presented in its policy matrix. The matrix should include the objectives, critical actions
supported by the Bank, and outcomes and indicators (with baseline and target values)
to measure program objectives. The 2011 guidance note from Operations Policy and
Country Services (OPCS) presents two models for policy matrices—for stand-alone
operations and for a programmatic series (World Bank 2011). Since FY14, OPCS has
promoted a new model of policy matrix that has increasingly applied to newly adopted
DPOs. This chapter is based on analysis of recent changes in OPCS guidelines, a review
of program documents of 60 relatively new DPOs approved in FY12–14 (20 DPOs
randomly selected for each year, covering more than 50 percent of all operations), and
evidence from previous IEG evaluations.


Overview of Recent Changes in OPCS Guidelines
3.2   In 2009 and 2011, OPCS’s good practice guidance notes introduced some
changes in the presentation of DPO RFs. DPOs approved since then have over time
followed these guidelines. Since FY14, operations are increasingly reflecting the new,
more simplified OPCS template for policy matrices.

3.3     Elimination of nonprior action policy actions (“benchmarks”) from the policy
matrix is the main change. The use of benchmarks dates back to adjustment lending
operations when the key distinction between benchmarks and prior actions (PAs) was
their timing—PAs were implemented before programs went to the Board while
benchmarks were expected to be implemented before completion. Benchmarks lost their
importance as a performance monitoring tool in the mid-2000s with the introduction of
explicit programmatic series and indicative triggers and more systematic use of
quantitative monitoring and evaluation (M&E) indicators that transformed the
benchmarks into nonbinding policy actions. The use of the term benchmark to describe
these nonbinding actions became controversial. This review examined 60 DPOs
approved in FY12–14 (more than 50 percent of all new DPOs approved). Only five
included benchmarks, and DPOs approved in FY14 did not include any.

3.4    According to OPCS, the rationale for not including benchmarks in the policy
matrix is to avoid the impression of disguised conditionality9 (World Bank 2011, 1).
IEG’s review of evidence indicates that the use of benchmarks has been inconsistent in
recent years. While their inclusion often augmented the policy content of DPOs at least
in appearance, most of the program documents and the Implementation Completion

3. PRESENTATION OF RESULTS FRAMEWORK


and Results Reports (ICRs) provided only selective information by reporting good cases
of implementation and neglecting cases of poor performance. To enhance
accountability, it was appropriate to drop actions from the policy matrix that were not
monitored by the Bank and had uncertain attribution to Bank’s interventions.

3.5    Presentation of indicative triggers in the policy matrix also has changed. Prior
to 2011, a typical program document of the first operation in a series of three or more
DPOs presented indicative targets only for the next operation. The reform program for
outer operations was presented vaguely, usually without a distinction between
benchmarks and triggers. Now the policy matrix of the first operation is required to
present the reform program covering all proposed operations in the series. All reviewed
programmatic series approved in FY12–14 followed this approach. The approach of
presenting a complete program at the onset, with indicative triggers covering all
proposed operations (that can still be flexible) is associated with stronger RFs. There is
evidence that the series with vague presentation of triggers for outer operations were
compromised be excessive flexibility (see chapter 5).

3.6    Presentation of RFs in the policy matrix was simplified. The new OPCS policy
matrix template introduced in FY14 (but not incorporated in the good practice guidance
note as of preparation of this report) only contains PAs and outcome indicators. (The
strengths and weaknesses of this approach are discussed in following sections.)

3.7     Other changes in DPOs include: (i) most of the DPOs no longer use
intermediate outcome indicators; (ii) there is no longer a distinction between results
indicators and Program Development Objective indicators; (iii) the M&E framework is
no longer presented separately from the policy matrix; (iv) the number of DPOs in one
series is now capped at three in most cases (series of four to five operations were not
uncommon in the mid- to late 2000s); and (v) the time allocated to ICR preparation was
changed from six months to 12 months in FY15. The report discusses most of these
changes in light of evidence in respective chapters.


Issues with the Results Framework Presentation
3.8    Recent changes have helped to enhance the clarity of RFs presentation, but
there are shortcomings. The statement of objectives remains a challenge in DPOs. In
many reviewed, the objective was stated differently in the program summaries and
policy matrices. Financing agreements of DPOs, which do not include a statement of
objectives, may also contribute to the problem. Many programs approved before FY14
had different statements of objectives in the program summary and policy matrix as the
2011 OPCS template allowed multiple objectives per policy area. The new template in
use since FY14 addresses this issue to some extent. However, several recently approved

DPOs indicate confusion between objectives, pillars, and policy areas10. As shown in
figure 3.1, the statement of objectives continues to remain a problem.

3.9    Clarity of statements of objectives is very important for IEG evaluation. ICRs
and ICR Reviews (ICRRs) tend to stick to broader definitions of objectives usually from
the “program summary” section of program documents, rendering the statement of
subobjectives in a policy matrix useless in most cases. This would be less of a problem
for most DPOs approved in FY14 and after, as the new template addresses this issue.
However, this review finds that identifying objectives in some programs based on the
new template is difficult as some of them no longer provide statements of objectives in
the policy matrix, and in many cases concepts such as “objectives, “pillars” and “policy
areas” are used interchangeably.

3.10 Many DPOs do not contain a statement of outcomes. According to the OPCS
guidelines, DPO policy matrices should include outcomes. Outcomes are an important
part of the results chain in DPOs linking the PAs supported by the Bank to DPOs’
objectives. In many cases, however, instead of an explicit statement of outcome, policy
matrix contains only result indicators. RFs suffer from this simplification in cases when

10   See, for example, Kiribati 2014, Nigeria 2014
11A clear statement of objectives means that the objectives are stated the same in different parts
of the report, and the policy matrix includes a clear statement of objectives. The statement of
outcomes would be unclear if for more than two prior actions there is no explicit statement of
outcome while results indicator is output oriented. Clear presentation of results indicators means
that the results indicators presented in the program summary and policy matrix are the same.
Randomly selected DPO’s includes programs that were part of the programmatic series only if
they were the first in the series.


                                                                                                                     7
3. PRESENTATION OF RESULTS FRAMEWORK


these indicators are output rather than outcome oriented. This effectively leads to a
disappearance of the outcome from the results framework thus affecting the robustness
of RF and its evaluability (see box 3.1 for examples). In 60 new DPOs approved in FY12–
14 this review found problems with statement of outcomes in 22 of them12. However
there were also good examples of clear distinction between outcomes and result
indicators that contributes to the quality of RF13 (see appendix B).

    Results Framework

                in Naftogaz         Based on the program document, the implicit outcome is to eliminate tariff setting below
     matrix
     sales of gas to residential    cost-recovery levels, which will contribute to the program’s objective of improved public
     consumers:                     sector governance. The outcome indicator (revenues of utility company to increase from 6.9
     Baseline (2013): 6.9 billion   billion units to 10.4 billion units of national currency in one year) potentially can measure the
     Target (2014): 10.4 billion    extent of achievement of expected outcome. In that respect, the choice of outcome indicator
                                    may be appropriate. But this indicator cannot fill the gap of a missing explicit statement of
                                    outcome (improved tariff setting). The reason is, at completion and reporting, this indicator
                                    may not be considered still relevant, and more evidence may need to be found. This may
                                    happen if, for example, there is a significant price change from an exogenous shock (e.g.
                                    exchange rate depreciation). This may lead to an increase in the utility’s revenues that is
                                    neutral for its financial health, because of lack of progress with tariff setting mechanisms.
                                    Stating a clear strategic outcome, in this case “eliminating tariff setting below cost-recovery
                                    levels,” would allow for comprehensive assessment of achievement of outcomes, including
                                    using the proposed outcome indicator and other evidence, if needed.
     Outcome Indicator: Total       This outcome indicator is a good choice for monitoring and evaluation of an implicit program
     budget assigned to             outcome (under the objective of gender equity), which is the provision of publicly funded
     finance provision of           services to victims of gender violence (based on the program document). This outcome
     specific measures to           indicator cannot fully fill the gap of a missing explicit statement of outcome as it may not be
     protect women who are          still relevant at completion. This could happen if the funding is made available (target met),
     victims of gender violence,    but delivery was hampered by inefficiencies, and no service is actually delivered to the
     as percent of total budget     victims. By establishing a separate explicit outcome in the policy matrix, it would become
     expenditure:                   possible to evaluate achievement of outcomes using alternative evidence, if needed

3.11 Lack of an explicit statement of outcomes creates several issues. First, the lack
of an explicit statement of outcome creates a situation in which program outcomes have
to be derived from results indicators instead of the other way around. Second, in a
programmatic series, results indicators may change, be dropped, or added, which

12Defined as two or more outcomes not stated explicitly and clearly in the RF (mostly cases
when no distinction is made between outcome indicators and outcomes, while the indicators
are output oriented and cannot substitute outcomes).

examples.

would technically change the program’s expected outcome—a situation to avoid. In
cases reviewed by IEG, one-third of results indicators were dropped at some point,
effectively leading to the disappearance of many expected outcomes. Third, program
outcomes are part of the results chain, and their adequacy is evaluated as part of
relevance of design. Choice of the outcome indicators and their target values are issues
belonging to the relevance of M&E. Not stating the implicit outcome in the policy
matrix of DPOs in cases when it is necessary affects IEG’s evaluation of those DPOs.

 Box 3.2. A Model of Best Practice Results Framework Presentation in the Policy Matrix of
 Development Policy Operations
 Many DPOs reviewed provide good examples of Results Framework presentation.
 They share similar characteristics such as clear statements of objectives (in both the
 program summary and policy matrix) and outcomes. For illustration purposes, the
 figure below shows a summary model of a policy matrix that best describes the result

3.12 Presentation of medium term policies and expected outcomes of the
government program in policy matrices of stand-alone operations might be
ineffective. To address the problem of short time horizons of stand-alone operations,
the 2011 OPCS guidance note recommended incorporating information on a
government’s medium term program, noting however that this is not part of the DPO
supported program (World Bank 2011). The latest template of the policy matrix
promoted by OPCS no longer uses this approach for stand-alone operations. This
review finds that this approach did not add to the robustness of RFs, especially in light
of recent changes in the timing of the ICRs of DPOs that was extended to 12 months.
This option can be inappropriately used to mask output rather than outcome
orientation in some DPOs. As a general note, this review finds that, in many cases,
citing relatively short time horizon of stand-alone DPOs is an inadequate explanation

for not pursuing tangible policy change. Even stand-alone DPOs can span up to two
years (from the Project Information Document to the ICR) allowing for the
incorporation of meaningful medium term policy targets as part of DPOs.


Presentation in Legal Documents Underpinning DPOs
3.13 Legal underpinning of DPOs and RFs is different from investment lending.
Legal agreements of Bank DPOs do not include a statement of objectives, which
differentiates it from investment lending. PAs are the only element of RFs included in
the legal agreement, which is also different from the investment lending approach in
which forward looking elements of policy components are included in the legal
agreement. This study could not find evaluative evidence on the implications of this
approach for incentives and results orientation in DPOs since there was no previous
study covering this aspect. Because some stakeholders felt strongly that this feature of
DPOs may weaken programs, this may merit further scrutiny.

4. Quality of Prior Actions
4.1    Prior actions (PAs) are the key elements of the Results Frameworks (RFs) for
development policy operations (DPOs). They are the only elements of RF reflected in
the legal agreement between the World Bank and borrowers. They are expected to
trigger policy and institutional change to an extent that contributes to the country’s
potential for equitable growth. PAs are expected to draw from the government
program, but also reflect the Bank’s contribution to the reform agenda through policy
dialogue and technical assistance to ensure added value. All components of results
chains are strongly linked to the PAs, allowing them to serve as a stepping stone for
assessing the overall RF.

4.2   Assessment of prior actions is challenging and context specific. The
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reflects on the quality of prior action in its
evaluation and validation work to various extents. As part of this review, evidence on
the quality of PAs from Implementation Completion and Results Report Reviews
(ICRRs), Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs), and case studies was
systematically identified, synthesized, and categorized based on these characteristics: (i)
relevance, (ii) criticality, (iii) additionality or value added, (iv) measurability or
monitorability, and (v) efficacy (table 4.1).

Table 4-1. IEG Criteria for Assessing the Prior Actions of Development Policy Operations
 Criteria                    What Does IEG Look for?
 Relevance                  The extent to which PAs are relevant to objectives/outcomes, and whether there
                            are links with actions from both previous and subsequent operations in case of
                            programmatic series.
 Criticality                The extent to which PAs have sufficient institutional depth to trigger
                            policy/institutional change. Policy actions that are excessively process-oriented,
                            easily reversible or only indicate intentions should be avoided.
 Additionality              The extent to which PAs reflect the World Bank’s value added with respect to the
                            borrower’s reform agenda. This is assessed based on factors such as the timing of
                            the action, cross-conditionality with IMF, and Bank engagement in reform areas.
 Measurability              The extent to which the expected impact of PAs is measurable. This largely
                            depends on the quality of the M&E framework and the links between results
                            indicators and PAs.
                            The extent to which PAs become completed as an output for the results chain
 Efficacy                   (different from “efficacy” used in ICRR which refers to achievement of outcomes).
 (completeness)             This refers mostly to prior actions such as draft laws, decrees, and strategies that
                            require follow-up steps to be completed.

4. QUALITY OF PRIOR ACTIONS


4.3    The Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) Good Practice Note
provides guidance on prior actions (World Bank 2011). Relevance, criticality, and
monitorability are the key characteristics explicitly discussed in the note, and they are
used for assessment of PAs for the retrospective by OPCS. IEG’s approach extends this
method further based on availability of project-based evidence as part of its evaluations.
However, unlike OPCS’s assessment for its retrospective, this review does not provide
assessment of all PAs. It only reflects on the evaluative evidence of the quality of PAs
from various IEG products.


Relevance
4.4    Prior actions should necessarily be relevant with respect to both program level
objectives and to specific results and outcomes defined in the policy matrix. In cases
of a programmatic series, the relevance of PAs should also be viewed in light of the
links with actions from previous and subsequent operations.

4.5      Very few programs had prior actions that were not relevant to objectives;
however, the relevance with respect to the results appears to be more challenging. For
example, a prior action on adopting the law on HIV/AIDS under the objective of
improving health care may be quite relevant, while the links to the identified results
(i.e., child malnutrition, poor people with free health insurance, and use of modern
health care facilities by the poor) is less obvious in a country with a very low prevalence
of HIV/AIDS. This inconsistency was present especially in some Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) type, multi-sectoral operations.

4.6    Shortcomings in presentation of RFs may affect relevance. The confusion of
outcomes with results indicators (discussed in section 3) — dropping a result indicator
or replacing it by another—may change the statements of results affecting the relevance
of PAs with respect to results or outcomes. This can be fixed by improving the
presentation of RFs to clearly distinguish outcomes from results indicators.

4.7    In some multi-sectoral operations, the links between prior actions in the same
policy areas of individual DPOs in the series may be weak. This occurred mostly in
cases where the reform agenda was not fully defined at the onset and presented in the
program document of the first operation14.


Criticality
4.8    Criticality of prior actions is important for triggering lasting policy and
institutional change. Criticality is well defined in the OPCS guidance note: policy

actions that are excessively process-oriented, easily reversible, or only indicate
intentions of the government as opposed to actual substantive changes should be
avoided. OPCS uses an implicitly normative classification of PAs for its retrospective to
capture the extent of criticality (see box 4.1).


 Box 4.1. Operations Policy and Country Services’ Classification of Prior Actions
 Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) distinguishes between three types of prior
 actions (PAs): (i) policy and institutional reform focused actions; (ii) process-focused actions;
 and (iii) implementation-focused actions (World Bank 2013a). Recognizing that different
 context requires different actions, OPCS’s approach implicitly suggests that policy and
 institutional actions are more critical than process and implementation actions. According to
 this classification, the ratio of policy and institutional actions covered by the 2012
 retrospective varied from 40 percent to 60 percent of all actions across Regions. According to
 the approach used in this review, some policy and institutional actions may be noncritical if
 they do not represent sufficient institutional depth (for example, draft policy documents not
 vetted and not approved by the government).
 Source: World Bank (2013a).


4.9    IEG’s experience with DPOs indicates that, for prior actions to be critical, there
should be sufficient institutional depth and a certain degree of consensus among
various stakeholders to avoid policy reversals. However, criticality can mean different
things in different contexts. In some cases, a law may be necessary for an institutional
change while, in other cases, government decrees and even lower level actions that
complete a reform process can be critical for a program. IEG’s review of criticality of
PAs has some advantages because its project level evaluations allow judgments based
on specific context.

4.10 Existing evaluative evidence suggest that many DPOs include policy actions
that are not critical in the given context. In 14 desk reviews and IEG PPARs, the
number of noncritical actions and their share in total PAs varied substantially—from 3
out of 31 PAs (Peru) to 8 out of 51 (Vietnam PRSC) for a programmatic series, and from
0 out of 7 (Albania) to 3 out of 8 (Côte d’Ivoire) in stand-alone operations. Interpretation
of these numbers, however, is not straightforward. In some cases, DPO policy matrices
may include a number of transformative actions (that can ensure a satisfactory
outcome) along with a few actions, which lack criticality. This is observed in cases of
sector-specific operations (e.g. Latvia). Based on this, one may suggest that the quality
of policy matrices should be defined by the presence of necessary and critical actions
rather than by the fact that policy matrices include some noncritical actions. However,
the use of less critical PAs in otherwise effective interventions may create a precedent
for PAs of lower quality.

4. QUALITY OF PRIOR ACTIONS


4.11 The key challenge to criticality is the level of institutional depth. In many
cases, the PAs are for actions undertaken at the agency level or below and lack
institutional depth. Examples of such PAs are assessments, evaluations, and reports
prepared by various agencies and shared with the World Bank that do not have
important regulatory or operational implications. Although such actions may address
important issues, they don’t necessarily reflect actual commitment or intention at the
sufficiently high level necessary for implementing reforms. Some Implementation
Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) do not provide full account of such actions. In
most cases, it remains unclear what exactly was accomplished through these actions.

4.12 Incorporation of draft laws as PAs before government approval is
controversial. This review found that, in 2009–2013, 15 operations dealt with submitting
a draft law by government agencies (ministries or below) for review by the cabinet. Box
4.2 provides more information on PAs on laws. The rationale of this approach is
questionable as governments should be able to adopt draft laws and submit them to the
parliament if there is strong reform momentum. The review additionally identified 17
programs that dealt with approving draft laws by the government without submitting
to parliament (see more information in the Efficacy section of this chapter). In some
cases the ICRs or subsequent program documents did not provide a status report on
those actions.


 Box 4.2. Use of Prior Actions on Laws
 Cases of draft laws used as prior actions (PAs) may be of special evaluative importance. First, laws are considered
 critical policy actions that can trigger policy and institutional change. Second, most Implementation Completion
 and Results Reports (ICRs) report on the status of actions on law, while ICR follow-up on other actions is less
 systematic.
 According to World Bank guidelines, submission of draft laws to nations’ parliaments is an adequate PA.
 Adoption of laws as a PA is not encouraged as it is considered beyond the government’s power. The table below
 shows that in fact the Bank uses various types of actions on laws as PAs. In 11 programs, the Bank used adoption
 of laws by parliaments as PAs, while in 32 cases the Bank used draft laws before submission to the parliament as
 PAs. The highest number of PAs is on submission of the draft laws to parliament. There is evidence that the use of
 draft laws at an early stage is controversial (see section in this chapter on Efficacy).

4.13 Adopting various draft documents that are under government authority is also
controversial. If reform momentum is present, governments should be able to adopt
required regulations that are under their authority, such as decrees, decisions, master
plans, strategies, and policy frameworks. This review identified 26 programs for the
period 2009–2013 that included PAs on preparing such draft documents at the level of
ministries and below (e.g., draft action plans, draft decrees, draft policy papers, trials, or
below levels). This suggests that the consensus within respective governments might
have been lacking because these documents could have been approved to enhance the
institutional content of PAs supported by DPOs. In most cases reviewed, no strong
evidence was found in program documents or ICRs on follow-up on these actions,
including their final adoption.

4.14 Despite OPCS’s explicit recommendation in the practice note, statements of
intentions are still used as PAs. In three out of 14 case studies there were statements
about reform intentions made mostly at the ministerial level used as PAs. Those include
letters issued specifically to the Bank or other international organizations stating
government commitment to reforms. Another set of noncritical PAs refer to actions on
the publication of certain documents and strategies in an environment where
transparency does not seem to be an issue. Many process oriented PAs, such as
implementation of an ongoing strategy or annual budget, were, in most of the cases,
found lacking criticality unless they added certain important dimensions to
implementation.


Additionality
4.15 The concept of additionality, or the value added of PAs, covers several aspects.
First, it assesses the extent to which actions added value as the result of the Bank’s
engagement in a given reform area. The OPCS guidance note on designing DPOs
suggests “what would be discouraged is a policy matrix which simply documents
government reforms15 without any inputs from Bank staff, for instance in order to give
credit to the government for carrying out certain reforms” (World Bank 2011, 4). When
PAs were implemented before the Bank’s engagement through DPOs, and there is no
evidence of a Bank-client cooperation in respective specific reform area, it is clear the
action would have taken place without the Bank’s support. In this case DPOs lack value
added in terms of their contribution to policy and institutional change. Policy actions
implemented before the Bank’s decision to do a DPO and without the Bank’s

4. QUALITY OF PRIOR ACTIONS


contribution are seen mostly in crisis or emergency support and in stand-alone
operations. The Bank can use other simplified options of budget support for such cases.

4.16 Other situations of additionality clearly emerging as an issue includes cases of
cross-conditionality with the International Monetary Fund, and cases when the same
prior action is used a number of times for recurrent events. IEG has identified cases
when the PAs of DPOs are the same as the IMF’s structural benchmarks (e.g.,
Honduras, Latvia). PAs of various budgetary functions of a recurrent character, such as
submission of a draft budget law to the parliament every year, approval of annual
budget execution reports can be used a number of times in subsequent operations (Côte
d’Ivoire, Indonesia). DPOs should in fact aim for institutionalization of government
functions, and incorporation of those actions in DPOs is more controversial in countries
with relatively high policy and implementation capacity. If actions of this type are
critical for continuing engagement through DPOs in particular cases, the Bank can
monitor these developments as part of ongoing policy dialogue and monitoring of risks.


Measurability

4.17 Measurability or monitorability is an important feature in a results-focused
framework. This is highlighted as one of the key concepts in OPCS’s good practice note
on DPO design. A good framework should be able to assess the scope of change as a
result of Bank supported policy actions. Key challenges of measurability of PAs include
lack of results indicators in M&E frameworks that are linked to the prior action, failure
to report data on result indicators, and the dropping of result indicators altogether. In
some cases, the expected results go beyond the timeline of the DPO and, therefore, are
not reported in the ICR. For example, an adopted law may be designed to actually enter
into force in a number of years after adoption; thus, despite the importance of such an
action, the M&E framework would not be able to capture the results (e.g., Latvia). In
some situations the result indicator and the PAs could be the same, which is strongly
discouraged by OPCS (e.g., Côte d’Ivoire). Most issues related to measurability of PAs
are discussed in Section 6 on M&E.


Efficacy
4.18 IEG has introduced the concept of efficacy of prior action for this study. It is
different from IEG’s assessment of a project’s efficacy that is used in project validation
and evaluation, which refers to the final outcome of intervention. In this context,
efficacy refers to the degree to which PAs become completed as an output for the results
chain. For example, a law that is to be passed by parliament as a prior action needs to be
enacted, and, if it does not happen, the prior action does not constitute a completed


16
                                                                    4. QUALITY OF PRIOR ACTIONS


output. Another example would be a draft national strategy as a prior action that is
expected to become operational and lead to desired policy changes. Underperformance
of a results indicator would not necessarily indicate lack of efficacy of respective prior
action since other factors may be involved. However, large deviation from targets or a
reversal in direction of expected changes might be a signal of possible problems in the
quality of PAs.

4.19 IEG’s review of evaluative evidence indicates that most PAs that lack
criticality did not lead to the change necessary for achieving outcomes. For example,
the Mid-Term Expenditure Framework developed as a ministry-level exercise and not
embedded in formal budgetary processes did not help with the introduction of medium
term budgeting in Côte d’Ivoire. At the same time, some critical actions may lack
efficacy because the environment may change, and assumptions may turn out to be
wrong. For example, adoption of a law on the re-introduction of the second pillar of a
pension system was, by all accounts, a critical action requiring national consensus
building; however, this lacked efficacy because its enacting was delayed after the
closing of the DPO as a result of unexpectedly poor fiscal conditions16.

4.20 Many PAs dealing with the submission of draft legislation by governments to
parliaments lack efficacy. Delays in adoption by the parliament are widespread. An
example is the Law on Competition in Ghana that was submitted to the parliament in
2009 as a prior action but was approved in February 2015. The use of such PAs may be
especially problematic in countries where the transaction and political costs of
submitting draft legislation to the legislature is relatively low. This allows authorities to
submit nonviable drafts as an implementation of PAs under DPOs.

4.21 The efficacy of PAs on draft documents prepared at the government level and
not submitted to parliament is largely lacking. Table 4.1 provides information on PAs
for draft laws before submission to the parliaments (approved by the government but
not submitted, or a draft prepared by a ministry or lower level agency and submitted to
the government). Out of around 25 programs with such PAs, evidence was available
through ICRs for nine of them, of which seven reported no progress at completion.

4.22 PAs that cover a relatively small subset of agencies where a change should
take place often lack efficacy. This is especially the case of PAs on pilot initiatives. For
example, PAs such as the introduction of a new public financial management model in
three out of 61 provinces, in some cases would lack efficacy if there is no clearly defined
scaling-up strategy and commitment.

Other Considerations in Quality of Prior Actions

4.23 This review has also looked at the issues of missed actions, which is different
from the question of the scope of the program. In this particular context it refers to
actions in areas that are explicitly or implicitly presented in the program document as
critical for achieving the program’s objectives but not incorporated in the policy matrix.
An example is the Nigeria Financial Sector DPO where the focus of PAs is on banking
sector liquidity but actions on solvency (a major challenge identified in the program
document) were missing. The program document implicitly suggests that progress in
this area would be impossible without addressing structural issues in the banking
sector raising concerns of the RF and program efficiency. Another example is the
Thailand Public Sector Development Loan, which focuses on public financial
management and service delivery but fails to address public investment management,
an area identified in the program document as one of most challenging areas in need of
reform in the public sector.

4.24 The quality of PAs in multi-sectoral operations is very critical for a program’s
results orientation. Both multi-sectoral and sector specific DPOs can only have a certain
number of PAs (about 10). In some multi-sectoral, programmatic series, not all policy
areas get to have a prior action in each operation. This puts a high premium on the
quality of PAs of multi-sectoral programs. In a typical multi-sectoral program with
three to four mostly unrelated policy areas, the PAs should be carefully selected and
promoted by the Bank to ensure that they truly contribute to the desired institutional
change. Interestingly, this review does not find that PAs in multi-sectoral operations are
more critical than those of sector programs if viewed in isolation. In fact, PAs in sector
specific operations benefit from better alignment with the results and better
complementarity with other PAs. This issue relates somewhat to the issue of depth
versus breadth of DPOs. IEG’s evaluative evidence indicates that programs with
emphasis on breadth achieve major results only with the support of transformative

policy actions (e.g., Vietnam’s first series of PRSCs implemented in 2001–2006 versus
the second series implemented in 2007–2012).


Summary on Quality of Prior Actions

Key points on the quality of PAs are the following:

       PAs are drawn from government programs and, in that respect, they reflect the
        depth and ambitions of the borrowers’ reform agendas. To improve the results
        of the reforms through DPOs, the Bank should raise the bar on the quality of
        policy actions that DPOs support.
       There is evidence that the Bank’s approach to PAs has been improving.
        Although this review does not provide an assessment of the quality of PAs
        across time, it notes that, in a number of aspects, the frequency of noted
        problems appears to be less with more recent operations, especially in the area
        of monitorability of PAs.
       Further increasing corporate standards on the quality of PAs, possibly through
        more explicit guidance to discourage DPO teams from using PAs of certain
        types that lack functionality, will empower Bank teams to identify and negotiate
        more critical policy actions with the borrowers.

5. Results Frameworks in Programmatic DPOs
5.1    The programmatic approach to development policy lending is the Bank’s
preferred option when possible17. Programmatic development policy operations
(DPOs) are typically implemented in countries with well-defined, medium term reform
programs, including many Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) countries that
have sufficient institutional capacity to develop and commit to a longer term reform
program. Out of about 300 DPOs that closed in FY09–13, about half belonged to 65
different programmatic series (2.5 operations per series on average).

5.2     The programmatic approach allows the Bank to extend its interventions up to
five or six years. It also allows for sequencing of the reform program and greater
flexibility through the use of the triggers. As the triggers are only indicative, this
approach is different from the multi-tranche approach used by the Bank where tranches
were established at the preparation stage and were rigid. This review by the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) draws on project-level evaluations and special
desk reviews of several programmatic series (Benin, Indonesia, Latvia, Peru, Tanzania,
and Vietnam) as well as evaluative evidence available from IEG validation of
Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs).

5.3    The Bank’s approach to the presentation of the Results Frameworks (RFs) in a
programmatic series has changed. There is more clarity with respect to the indicative
triggers (discussed in chapter 2). All series approved in FY12 or beyond have triggers
presented for all operations at the outset of the series, whereas in older programs the
triggers were fully specified in the program documents only for the next operation in
the series. IEG’s evaluative evidence suggests that this approach improves the
robustness of the results chain while also allowing the flexibility necessary for program
implementation. The current model of presentation of the RFs allows for the
incorporation of medium term results indicators if necessary.

5.4    Programmatic series allow flexibility in a number of ways. Flexibility normally
means adjusting the ambition, directions, and emphasis of reforms throughout the
progression of the series and allowing incorporation of reforms that might not have
been envisioned at the preparation stage. In some rare cases, the RFs may be modified
to accommodate an additional operation that was not planned at the preparation stage
(Indonesia). The RFs absorbs the changes by modifying the triggers that become PAs,
dropping the triggers for subsequent operations (they don’t become PAs), adopting


17According to the OPCS guidance note, “Under normal circumstances, a standalone single
tranche operation would not be considered the most appropriate structure given that most
policy and institutional reforms are medium- to long-term processes of multiple sequential
actions” (World Bank 2011, 12).


                                                                                             20
                                                     5. RESULTS FRAMEWORK IN PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH


partially met triggers as PAs, and introducing new PAs outside the pool of the triggers.
The programmatic approach also allows revisions in the results and results indicators
based on program performance, including changes in target values and dropping or
adding results indicators.
5.5      This study collected evidence on the use of the programmatic approach and its
implications for robustness of the RFs of DPOs. The programmatic approach may be
used for raising the ambitions of the reforms as series progresses. Among the series that
were reviewed for this study, only in one case did the actual reform program go
somewhat beyond the initial plan in terms of the program’s depth by adopting more
ambitious reforms (i.e., Peru). In most cases, the programmatic approach helps to adjust
the reform program to make it more feasible to implement given various constraints,
which effectively means using the triggers initially set up in RFs as an “upper bound”
for reforms. In cases when DPOs serve as a platform for donor coordination for
predictable transfer of donor resources on regular basis, flexibility is used to ensure
timely disbursements (i.e., Tanzania and Vietnam PRSCs). In those cases, typically the
rigor of the agenda would be adjusted to make DPOs implementable within a certain
period of time. In other cases when there is a high premium on timely disbursement
(e.g., crisis support), the RFs may undergo changes to ensure such timely disbursement
(i.e., Vietnam Public Investment Reform DPOs [PIR]). In some cases flexibility would be
required to keep the program going even though the reform momentum is weaker than
expected. This may also happen in contexts where series are important for maintaining
the dialogue between the Bank and the client.


 Box 5.1. An Example of a Partially Met Trigger without Institutional Depth
 A prior action—“Ministry of Health has issued a regulation to establish a centralized
 database as a step toward unifying the national licensing system of healthcare
 professionals”—was approved as a partial implementation of the trigger on “adopting
 national standards and establishing a unified licensing system for health care practitioners”
 in a programmatic series. A project-level evaluation by the Independent Evaluation Group
 found that these two actions are at different levels of institutional depth and criticality. The
 prior action was weak, and it should have not been accepted as partial implementation of
 the trigger.

5.6    Flexibility in the programmatic approach can sometimes be excessive. In some
programmatic series the quality of RFs suffered substantially due to adjustments in the
program (Tanzania PRSC and Vietnam PRSC, PIR). PAs might become weaker, and
some key actions may be dropped from the policy matrix, thus undermining the
relevance of continued intervention (Box 5.2). The cost of terminating a programmatic
series pre-maturely as a result of weaker-than-expected reform momentum can be high
for the Bank, as it may undermine relationships and the dialogue with the client. This


                                                                                                    21
5. RESULTS FRAMEWORK IN PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH


may result in weakening the RFs of the series. IEG evidence suggests that this might be
an exaggerated concern. If the reform momentum supported by a series is already weak
it would be hard to maintain genuine dialogue with the client, assuming that the DPOs
addresses the key challenges countries are facing. A DPO series may weaken also in
cases when timely disbursements are a priority. Although predictability can be
important in certain contexts, in cases where DPO financing is not a significant part of
the budget, the rationale for greater flexibility from the Bank’s side is less clear.


 Box 5.2. Example of Weakening of Design in Programmatic Series
 Vietnam PRSC Second Series is an example of gradually weakening quality of PAs. The
 shift from “policy” to “implementation” and “process” PAs is not a result of sequencing
 of borrowers’ actions. The key reason is that many expected policy actions were dropped
 and were substituted by actions of less criticality.

Special attention must be paid to so-called “partially met” triggers. Often, triggers are
only partially met. The Guidance Note requires that changes in triggers should be fully
justified and reported. It is up to the Bank to decide if changed triggers are sufficient for
the reform program, and this is a context specific process. IEG’s evaluative approach in
project level evaluations and case studies allow one to assess (also with the benefits of
hindsight) if partially met triggers that became PAs can be considered as a step forward
toward a program’s results. There are good examples of partially met triggers that
helped to push the program forward without compromising the program’s objectives.
In some cases, however, partially met triggers were clearly not sufficient for reform
implementation but were accepted as PAs by the Bank (box 5.1). Some partially met
triggers that became PAs would have hardly been proposed as PAs at the onset of
operations because of insufficient institutional depth.

6. Lessons for DPO Monitoring Frameworks
6.1    The monitoring framework is an integral part of the Results Frameworks (RFs)
for development policy operations (DPOs). Because of inherent attribution problems
in DPO RFs, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) has been a challenge with many Bank
DPOs and with policy lending operations of other International Financial Institutions.
On one hand, broad indicators of country outcomes, such as growth and poverty
reduction, are controversial because of attribution. On the other hand, choosing
indicators that are too output oriented (identical to or similar to the prior actions [PAs])
also would be problematic. Creating a set of relevant indicators in many cases is
hampered by weaknesses in country data, while arrangements to generate or collect
data specifically for the M&E framework of DPOs may not always work.

6.2     M&E frameworks for DPOs underwent changes in recent years. Substantial
efforts have been made to improve M&E frameworks in the Bank. The review of
Implementation Completion and Results Report Reviews (ICRRs) and project level
evaluations, including the review of a random set of DPOs still under implementation
(approved in FY13–14), indicate that there may be an improvement in the M&E
framework of DPOs. In particular, the link between PAs and results indicators seems to
have strengthened to an extent that, in most DPOs, each results indicator is specifically
associated with a prior action. This approach is not directly recommended by
Operations Policy and Country Services, but this review finds it a good step forward
given the increased importance of PAs in DPO RFs. In addition, among newer DPOs
there are fewer indicators with attribution problem than there are among older DPOs.

6.3    Reporting on results indicators appears to be improving as well. Among nine
available Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) for DPOs closed in
FY14, none reported missing values on results indicators while five out of 20 ICRs
prepared for DPOs closed in FY13, and 10 out of 35 ICRs for DPOs closed in FY12 had
missing values. Problems with the reporting of results indicators at completion is less of
a concern than in DPOs implemented in the late 2000s and early 2010s (especially
Poverty Reduction Support Credits), some of which had as many as 50 percent of
results indicators without values at completion. However, as the result of relatively
small number of DPOs closed in FY13–14 that were validated by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) as of April 2015, it is not clear the extent to which these
improvements affected IEG’s rating of the quality of M&E in DPOs18.


18The ratio of DPOs closed in FY07–12 with “high” or “substantial” M&E rating was relatively
stable at around 40 percent.


                                                                                           23
6. LESSONS FOR DPOS MONITORING FRAMEWORK


6.4     The presentation of M&E frameworks was simplified. In recent DPOs, M&E
frameworks are fully merged with the programs’ policy matrices, with few exceptions.
The use of intermediate indicators has been declining in general. An interesting
example is the contrast between Malawi 2012 and Malawi 2013. There were
intermediate results indicators in the Malawi 2012 stand-alone operation, while the
Malawi 2013 operation, a programmatic series, had none. The old approach of
presenting some of the indicators as Program Development Objective indicators,
effectively creating a “two-tier” M&E framework, has been largely phased out. With
few exceptions (e.g., Malawi, Côte d’Ivoire), the programs approved recently (FY13–14)
do not make distinctions in M&E. In general, changes toward simplification have
contributed the clarity and consistency of the M&E. But the ultimate quality of M&E
depends on whether the choice of M&E indicators is strategic.

6.5    Notwithstanding positive changes, weaknesses in the model of presenting the
RFs discussed earlier can affect the M&E framework. Presentation of DPO RFs should
follow a simple logic that links the policy actions to the outcomes and then to the
program objective, while the outcome indicators should measure the extent to which
this casual chain materializes. The choice of result indicators for policy and intuitional
reforms can be challenging, and some trade-offs will be inevitable, such as outcome-
versus output-oriented indicators. A program’s M&E will benefit greatly from more
strategic choice of indicators that are outcome oriented but at the same time are not too
broad to undermine attribution of the results to DPOs. Output-oriented indicators, if
there is no practical alternative, may still help to capture the extent of desired change if
additional supporting information is provided at completion in ICRs. However, use of
such indicators creates problems beyond M&E, in cases when there is no clear
statement of outcome in the policy matrix, and the burden of presentation of the result
chain shifts to output oriented results indicators, which undermines the quality of RFs.

7. Quality of Reporting at Completion and
Implications for Validation and Evaluation
Lessons from ICRs
7.1    Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) are important
elements in the project cycle with great potential to enhance the World Bank’s focus
on results. ICR preparation is of essential importance for development policy
operations (DPOs). The time between approval of the program and completion of the
ICR is a critical period where expected changes should materialize. In fact, many
important policy actions that follow prior actions (PAs) take place after the formal
closing of the program. Policy dialogue in many cases goes beyond program closing.

7.2     The experience of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) with validation of
ICRs indicates that there are gaps in reporting on DPO results at completion.
Although DPOs and their Results Frameworks (RFs) have come to be centered on PAs,
the ICRs in general have not followed this pattern. Shortcomings in the ICRs include
insufficient information on the nature of the actions (e.g., dates of implementation not
provided in program documents) and lack of a comprehensive account of follow-up
actions to PAs during implementation that leads to the achievement of outcomes.
Unfortunately, many ICRs are missing a detailed storyline on PAs even though they are
the key element of the DPOs’ conditionality framework. For example, it is typical for
ICRs not to mention the status of draft documents prepared as PAs or not to reflect on
agency level actions selected as a prior action for DPOs. In many cases, the reason why
this information is not presented in the ICR is not because of slow implementation or
policy reversal but because of lack of understanding of the value of reporting on PAs
and on what happened after these actions.

7.3    Strengthened ICR standards should enhance DPO design. Increased emphasis
on reporting on PAs should over time enhance the Bank’s corporate standards for
identifying PAs, further strengthening the Bank’s focus on results through more
relevant and critical PAs. It would also likely be beneficial if PAs could be followed up
with in the reporting framework of the country assistance strategy to ensure continuity
in the monitoring of institutional development in areas supported by DPOs.

7.4   Change in the timing of ICR preparation for DPOs was an important
improvement. IEG’s experience indicates that six months for preparing ICRs for DPOs
was insufficient in many cases for capturing the extent and sustainability of the impact
from policy changes supported by DPOs. This was an impediment especially for stand-


                                                                                        25
                           7. LESSONS FROM REPORTING RESULTS AND FOR VALIDATION AND EVALUATION


alone operations. This short time-frame affected the ability of ICRs to capture cases of
policy reversal or reform slowdown and also affected data collection for monitoring
results. The Bank’s move to a 12-month ICR preparation timeline (since FY15) is
effectively an extension of the DPO’s life cycle and addresses some of the issues related
to the timing of the instrument. With this change, the cycle of stand-alone operations
could reach 2.5-3 years, which provides sufficient time to carry out many reform
initiatives.


Implications for IEGs Validation and Evaluation Methodology
7.5    Certain aspects of IEG’s validation approach should be modified. Better
alignment with recent changes in the instrument, such as increased emphasis on PAs
and simplification of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework is needed. To
avoid possible misinterpretations IEG reviews should take into account that DPOs no
longer use “benchmarks” or intermediate indicators.

7.6    Proper presentation of PAs in ICRRs is important. Not all ICRRs mention the
PAs. Based on synthesis of all ICRRs of DPOs prepared in 2011–2014, this review finds
that the informative and evaluative value of ICRRs that provide detailed description of
PAs is higher than those that do not. Because of IEG’s approach that ICRRs should be
self-explanatory documents, a summary presentation of prior action (preferably in the
section on policy areas) would improve the informative value of ICRRs.

7.7    IEG validation should focus more on the analysis of PAs for an outcome
rating. Analysis of PAs and their relevance and criticality for the outcomes should be
one of the key elements for assessing the relevance of design. With respect to
assessment of achievement of objectives, ICRRs should focus on attribution of outcomes
to the PAs and the Bank’s other inputs, such as policy dialogue. Reconstruction of the
chain of events that follow the implementation of PAs leading to the expected results is
important for a comprehensive assessment of a program’s efficacy. The analytical
framework used for this study to assess the quality of PAs that captures their various
qualities may be explicitly or implicitly used in the ICRRs.

7.8    The IEG’s ICR validation of DPOs will benefit greatly from changes in the
corporate approach to RFs’ presentation and to the reporting of outcomes at
completion. Improving statements of objectives is important for consistency of IEG
validation. Additionally, evaluators often have difficulties in separating various aspects
of the RFs to be covered under the relevance of design and quality of M&E. ICRR
guidelines suggest that the results indicators should be reviewed in M&E while
relevance of design should review relevance of stated outcomes. This becomes a



26
7. LESSONS FOR REPORTING RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR VALIDATION AND EVALUATION


problematic issue because of weaknesses in the current model that often confuses the
outcomes and results indicators. Improving the policy matrix along the lines presented
in chapter 2 would improve the process of validation and ensure consistency in the
approach. With respect to the quality of ICRs, coordination between Operations Policy
and Country Services and IEG is important to ensure sound and comprehensive
reporting and validation of DPOs.

Operations
1.     There is mixed evidence on the overall effectiveness of the Bank’s development
policy operations (DPOs) partly because of the difficulties in measuring the impact on
country outcomes. By one measure, DPOs appear to perform relatively well. At least
three-fourths of all DPOs that closed in FY06–13 were assessed as moderately
satisfactory or above by the Independent Evaluation Group in achieving their intended
outcomes (outcome rating). The share of DPOs with satisfactory and highly satisfactory
outcome ratings has been around one-third of all DPOs in recent years.

2.     There is a tradition in the World Bank of linking Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) ratings to DPOs for research and evaluation purposes since CPIA
ratings are convenient for capturing the quality of institutions required for achieving
the Bank’s twin goals. In general, the results in policy and institutional change across
the International Development Association’s eligible countries is mixed19. Figure A.1
shows that 52 out of 105 countries that had CPIA ratings below 4 in 2006 have
experienced a decline in CPIA ratings since 2006. Countries that had relatively high
CPIA ranking in 2006 were more likely to regress in subsequent years. There are
possible explanations for this including difficulty in achieving more positive changes at
relatively high level of institutional development and reform fatigue.

3.     There is mixed evidence on the contribution of DPOs to changes in CPIA ratings.
Attempts to statistically measure the impact of DPOs on CPIA scores have produced
inconclusive results for the subset of countries that are International Development
Association recipients. As a simple illustration, figure A.2 shows that better CPIA
outcomes are not necessarily associated with DPO operations, judged by both the
presence of DPOs and the number of operations. Although in countries with low CPIA
ratings (< 3.2) the presence of DPOs is associated with better performance in terms of
CPIA change, this association disappears and even reverses in IDA-eligible countries
that have aggregate CPIA ratings above 3.2. In other words, the Bank’s DPOs do not
seem to be associated with positive change in countries with CPIA rating above 3.2,
suggesting that the question of DPOs’ results orientation and the quality of their Results
Framework is still valid20.




20More analysis is needed to assess the links between Bank’s policy lending and the quality of
policy institutions.
