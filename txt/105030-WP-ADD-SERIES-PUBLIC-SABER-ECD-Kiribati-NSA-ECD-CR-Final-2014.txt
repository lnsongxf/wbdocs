      Policy Goals                                                                                          Status
        1. Establishing an Enabling Environment
           While an ECCE policy exists in Kiribati, the overall ECD system in Kiribati is poorly
           defined in legislation, with minimal funding investment and no coordinated
           multisectoral collaboration. The system must be strengthened to ensure
           implementation of policy and efficient provision of services at the local level.


        2. Implementing Widely
           Health and birth registration tracking demonstrate good implementation. However,
           coverage levels for other ECCE services (education, nutrition, etc.) are either
           inadequate or not tracked, particularly for children from the poorest families and
           those living in rural areas. Service delivery in all sectors should be expanded to ensure
           all children are provided the opportunity for optimal development.


        3. Monitoring and Ensuring Quality
           Data collection within all relevant sectors needs to be improved to monitor access and
           quality of all ECD services. In education, minimum quality service standards for ECD
           services with a clear monitoring system should be developed. Mechanisms must be
           put in place in local communities to ensure that service providers coordinate efforts
           and meet quality standards.

    collaborative effort between UNICEF and the World Bank Group;                  endorsed by Cabinet in 2010. The ECCE policy, targeting ages
    it combines the World Bank Group’s SABER-ECD framework, 1                      three to five, calls ECCE a “national responsibility” with a mission

each policy goal, a series of policy levers are identified

and goals.

        Dear Ms Abrishamian


        Re: Endorsement of the ECE SITAN Report for Kiribati
        The following Early Childhood Education Situation Analysis (ECE SITAN) report for Kiribati is a step
        forward for our country in providing a research-based exploration of the current ECE situation. It is
        intended that the analysis will determine how best to move forward as we plan to improve ECE services
        in our country for the benefits of our youngest citizens. As previously stated in MOE’s “Kiribati Early
        Childhood Care and Education Policy” (2010),

                “Since ECCE policy is a national responsibility…. Set of standards for the kind of preschool
                learning environment (both indoor and outdoor) which is safe, hygienic, and enjoyable for ALL
                young learners of 3 to 5 years of age.”

        This ECE SITAN identifies what areas we can still improve on and ensure our ECE programs are of
        quality. It looks at the systems for early childhood holistically for young children five years of age and
        younger, in health, nutrition, education and development, and child protection, and serves as a tool for
        advocacy on the need to increase investment and attention to the needs of our youngest children in Kiribati.

        During 2014, MOE and other government institutions, with support from UNICEF Pacific, collected the
        data and contributed to the analysis. The partnership with World Bank led to using their Systems Approach
        for Better Education Results – ECD (SABER-ECD) tool, which looked at the policy environment, and
        developed a supplemental tool to conduct a national assessment for quality implementation on issues of
        policy, human resources, curriculum/child outcomes/environment, monitoring, and parent/community
        partnerships.

        In combination, these two tools have provided us with a comprehensive picture of what is currently
        happening for young children in our country, and potential recommendations on how to strengthen our
        early childhood systems.
        The support provided by UNICEF Pacific will now allow us to move towards evidence-based decision
        making. We would also thank World Bank for their partnership with UNICEF to use their SABER tool
        for our country ECE SITAN.
        We look forward to using these results as we prepare future ECE legislation, strategic planning, and
        implementation to strengthen the ECE sub-sector within MOE and the Government of Kiribati.
        Thank you very much.
        Yours sincerely,

 SYSTEMS APPROACH FOR BETTER EDUCATION RESULTS
 NSA-ECD: National Situation Analysis – Early Childhood Development                                                            35

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on education
       policies and institutions, with the aim of helping countries
       systematically strengthen their education systems. SABER
       evaluates the quality of education policies against evidence-based
       global standards, using new diagnostic tools and detailed policy
       data. The SABER country reports give all parties with a stake in
       educational results—from administrators, teachers, and parents to
       policy makers and business people—an accessible, objective
       snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
       system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth
       learn.

       The     National    Situation   Analysis–Early Childhood
       Development (NSA-ECD), developed by UNICEF Pacific, is a tool
       complementary to the SABER, which provides the situational
       analysis of ECD implementation.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Early
       Childhood Development.
