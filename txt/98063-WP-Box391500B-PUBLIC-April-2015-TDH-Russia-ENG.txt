WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS
A MUCH HARSHER CLIMATE
In a sobering assessment Turn Down the Heat:
Confronting the New Climate Normal documents that
if no further action is taken, there is a 40% chance to
exceed 4 degrees Celsius (ºC) warming before 2100—
within our children’s and grandchildren’s lifetime.

It paints a grim picture of what that world will look
like. As weather extremes become the new normal
and risks to food, water and energy security increase,
everyone will feel the impact—particularly the poor.

Prepared in collaboration with the Potsdam Institute
for Climate Impact Research and launched by the
World Bank Group in November 2014, the report
reviews the latest scientific evidence on climate
change risks to development.

The third in the Turn Down the Heat series, this report
examines climate scenarios in three regions, Latin
America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and
North Africa and Europe and Central Asia, including
the prospects and implications for the forests of the
Russian Federation in that challenging climate regime.

But the good news is that this future does not have to
be our destiny. Solutions exist. First we have to accept
the reality of what scientists are telling us and to truly
understand that we are the last generation that can
save the planet. It will require a concerted effort and
change in every aspect of human life—substantial
technological, economic, institutional and behavioral
change. And most of all, it will require leadership at
every level of society.
