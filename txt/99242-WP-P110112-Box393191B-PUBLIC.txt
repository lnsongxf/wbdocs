                                                        July - Dec 2014

1.0 Summary
The Project’s Development Objective ( PDO)and Global Environmental Objective ( GEO) of the project is to ensure effective
management of the Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve through a sustainable management model focusing on its Bua watershed area
The expected outcomes include improvement in management systems of the reserve, recovery of degraded biodiversity and
increased revenue generation. Enhancement of staff capacities in terms of numbers and skills; infrastructure and field equipment
were identified as core areas of focus in order to achieve the outcomes. The three year project was started in September 2012 and
the closing date was 30th November 2015. But no cost extension was sought due to delayed disbursement of funds and slow
absorption of the funds by the implementing agency – WESM.

Substantial achievement of project activities has been done. However, in view of the few outstanding activities yet to be done, it
became evident by July that we request for a no cost extension of the project so that we thoroughly accomplish all the desired
outcomes of the project objectives. This request was made in August 2014. The World Bank accepted the request in a letter dated
18 November 2015 to extend the project to 31 st May 2015 and accordingly reallocating the proceeds of the Grant allocated to the
project, and established May 31, 2015 as the later date for purposes of Section 3.03 of article III of the Agreement between the
Wildlife and Environmental Society of Malawi and the World Bank dated May 10, 2012 (as amended). Pursuant to this extension
WESM in a letter dated 28th December 2015, further requested the Director of Parks and Wildlife for an amendment of their MOU
with DNPW to be extended to 30th June 2015 a month later after closure of the project for smooth handing over of the project.

2.0 Background

The Wildlife and Environmental Society of Malawi (WESM) received a Grant from Global Environment Facility - GEF, towards the cost
of effective management of Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve (NWR) under a Project which is implemented by WESM in conjunction with
the Department of National Parks and Wildlife (DNPW) during the period 2012 - 2014.
        MALAWI: EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF NKHOTAKOTA WR PROJECT - BIANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT (July – December 2014



Focusing on the targeted area, the Project intends to improve the effectiveness of Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve (1,800 sq KM)
through the improvement of the management capacity of the reserve, offering a unique opportunity to reach both valuable
conservation goals and benefits to local populations.

The project was appraised in May 2010 and became effective (delayed) in September 2012. The total cost of the project is estimated
at US $ 845,000 which is provided as grant by GEF/World Bank. The project was to be implemented over a period of two years from
2012 to 30th November 2014, but an extension of six months was sought and granted in a letter dated 18th November 2015 by the
Bank extending the closing date to May 31, 2015.

Component 1: Reserve Management

The objective of this component is to support planning and management capacity and structures for sustainable conservation
management in NWR focusing on the Bua watershed area.

Key activities under this component during the period under review include:

   i.   Procurement of a Tractor and five Motor cycles.

        The process of procurement of both the Tractor and the Motor Cycle was quite quick. The preferred Tractor was 4 x 4 Massey
        Ferguson MF400 model. The reason for this choice was through considering the rugged terrain of Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve.
        This type of Tractor is only sourced from Farmers and Engineering Services (FES). We therefore sought a no objection from World
        Bank to purchase the tractor from FES. After reviewing the request WB granted WESM a no objection to procure the tractor from
        FES. The tractor was procured and delivered.

        The procurement process of the five motor cycles was done following Request for Quotations (RFQ). Three quotations were
        obtained. Trail motor bikes were identified to be ideal for field work in Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve. The supplier of these motor
        cycles was Stansfield Motors. Theses motor cycles were delivered and are awaiting completion of insurance processes to be
        deployed to field staff.


  ii.   Training of Resource protection staff (APWOs)

    The training of 40 Parks and Wildlife Assistants (PWAs) as resource protection staff was followed by promotion of other 40 PWAs to
    become Assistant Parks and Wildlife Officers (APWOs). This is a supervisory position for PWAs. The Department of National Parks
    and Wildlife identified supervisory skills gaps in the new supervisors. Therefore, the next phase of resource protection training
    involved orientation of these officers through a five days training to prepare them become effective wildlife managers. The
    objectives of the training were:
         To share knowledge and experiences on wildlife management.

           To provide baseline information and tips to newly promoted APWOs so that they are able to undertake
            management decision and actions.
            MALAWI: EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF NKHOTAKOTA WR PROJECT - BIANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT (July – December 2014




          To narrow the gap in competences among officers of the same grade given the varied background.


   These officers received training in the following areas:

          Policy and legislative framework for wildlife conservation in Malawi
          Performance management
          Discipline and grievance handling procedures
          Pertinent Government administrative
          Aspects of financial management.
          DNPW Institutional set up and the Function Review
          Global and local status of wildlife crime
          Roles and responsibilities in law enforcement
          Collaborative wildlife management
          Malawi Growth and Development Strategy – excerpts
          DNPW Strategic Plan- outcomes, objectives and outputs

   The training was very successful as all the planned programmes were accomplished. The trainees were awarded certificates of
   attendance for successfully completing the training. Resource persons came from the department of National Parks and Wildlife and
   the Wildlife and Environmental Society of Malawi.


iii.   Maintenance of road network in the reserve

   Having maintained access roads to vintage points of the reserve, a big challenge remained with an access road to Tongole tourist
   Lodge, where a bridge at Livezi River within the reserve was badly damaged and vehicle could not cross to go to Tongole Lodge in
   the reserve. The bridge was repaired using local labourers, and building materials were sourced locally in Nkhotakota district. The
   bridge was repaired within two weeks and it is being used by both tourists and reserve management staff.

iv.   Procurement and provision of Patrol Rations to field staff

  Provision of patrol rations was not an initial plan. Department of National Parks and Wildlife (DNPW) as part of their contribution are
  committed to pay field allowances to their field staff. This field allowance helps the scouts to buy food for their patrols.
  Unfortunately towards the end of 2013 DNPW was not able to pay field allowances to their scouts because government could not
  afford it. As a result of this scouts were not able to proceed on patrols. Hence poaching was increasing. This scenario was in contrary
  to the objectives of the project of ensuring effective management. Therefore, with consultation with the TTL it was decided that
  field staff should be provided with patrol rations to enable them go on patrol. Although scouts started receiving field allowances it
  was considered a good incentive to continue with the provision of patrol rations. So until now the scouts are being provided with
  patrol rations. This arrangement has proved to be effective since patrol coverage and number of patrol days has increased.

v.    Provision resources (fuel) for law enforcement support

  DNPW was also not able to provide other support such as fuel and travel allowances for law enforcement activities. For this reason
  the project also started providing funds for law enforcement support. This arrangement coupled with the patrol rations in (V) above
  has made thing to work well.

vi.   Construction of six scout houses at Bua Scout Camp

  Four scout houses and a fly camp were planned and budgeted for. But during implementation it was observed that the Fly camp may
  not be very useful. Therefore, it was agreed upon to abandon the Fly camp and instead build six houses instead of four. The six
  houses have been built at Bua Scout Camp and completed. The Contractor was FRASHO BUILDING CONTRACTORS. This contractor
  was procured through single sourcing. The reasons for this were that the company has a very good track record. They had
  constructed other six houses for the DNPW next to the site four years ago. They gave a quotation similar to the one they gave DNPW
  four years ago, and that their time frame was less than six months which was viewed as conforming to the project time frame. It was
  decided that this would be the best option as the desire was to complete the construction before 30 th November 2014 which was
  the close date of the project.

  The six houses have been handed over to the DNPW and scouts have already occupied them.

 vii.   Procurement of meteorological equipment

    Two sets of meteorological equipment have been procured. Each set is composed of a Stevenson Screen with its appropriate
    thermometers in it, one set of cup anemometer, a wind vane and an evaporation pan. The equipment is meanwhile kept at WESM
    office in Blantyre awaiting delivery to NWR. One set will be installed at Bua camp and the other one will be installed at Mbobo camp
    on the western side of the reserve. Installation will be done before April 2015.

viii.   Conduct prosecutor / Judicial training (Participatory Law Enforcement Meeting)

    The prosecutor / judicial training now known as Participatory Law Enforcement Meeting was done in Kasungu. Having identified gaps
    during a similar meeting in November 2013 in Nkhotakota, it was decided that this meeting should take place in Kasungu to cut costs
    for participants from Lilongwe and Kasungu. Besides the police and magistrates from Nkhotakota, the meeting included officers
    from Anti-Corruption Bureau, from Police Intelligence Unit, Regional prosecution and DNPW HQ. Also attending the meeting were
    Police and magistrate from Kasungu, Ntchisi and Malomo – the districts that surround NWR, and officers from Kasungu National
    Park. Senior officers and ten scouts representing all the patrol camps participated in this meeting. Some of the issues discussed
    included aspects of corrupt practices by law enforcers, money laundering, crime investigations, steps to follow to secure successful
    prosecution etc. The Principal Secretary for the Ministry of Tourism and Culture Ms. Elsie Tembo attended the meeting. It was a
    successful meeting as it was very educative especially on the part of the law enforcement staff.




Component 2: Revenues Instruments for improved Reserve Support

The objective is to increase in revenue generating activities for NWR strengthening reserve maintenance.

The activities under this component include:
    Development of Tourism Plan;
    Training of Tourism Rangers/Parks and Wildlife Assistants
               MALAWI: EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF NKHOTAKOTA WR PROJECT - BIANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT (July – December 2014



Activities under this component were not implemented because it was expected that APN were going to take over the management of
the Reserve. But things took a new turn. Government is currently processing procurement of a new manager. This process is near
completion.

Component 3: Project Management

Activities under this component are being implemented to achieve satisfactory delivery of the project.

The activities include:

   i. Project management and administration;

     The project is being implemented by the Wildlife and Environmental Society of Malawi (WESM) through its head office in Blantyre and overseen
     by WESM Board and WESM Chairperson. The management function is being carried out by WESM funded project manager who is also Director
     of WESM Secretariat. The manager travels to NWR on regular basis, to monitor project implementation progress and coordinates with the
     Deputy Director of Parks, the Reserve manager and other stakeholders involved.

     During the supervision mission in November 2014, refer Aide memoire, the TTL observed that a number of activities were still outstanding such
     as meeting with Total Land Care in order to understand their position on the project commitment, and adequate coverage of the progress
     report. The TTL emphasized that this must be addressed by WESM and ensure that the part of indicators is properly done.


  ii. Procurements

    All procurements for the project followed procurement procedures as stipulated in the PIM. Every time a procurement plan is reviewed it is sent
    to the Bank for further review before granting a No Objection. A minimum of three quotations are obtained by the procurement officer placed at
    WESM’s financial office “DMA”. The procurement committee is composed of WESM SD (Gervaz Thamala), WESM Financial Manager (Nick Hall)
    and Deputy Director of DNPW (Chiza Manda)

 iii. Project Financial Management

     Financial management for the project is done by WESM’s Financial Manager – DMA. Although WESM is stationed in Blantyre while DMA is in
     Lilongwe (300 km apart), there is very good coordination of financial transactions between the two.

iv. Engagement of an auditor to audit project accounts
    An Audit firm Graham carrh was identified and engaged. The firm was sourced through a normal process of procurement. There was an advert
    to request Expression of Interest (EIO). The Audit Report was done and completed early December 2015. The outcome of the audit was
    unqualified. The audit report was submitted on December 31, 2014. The next audit is expected to be done in June 2015.


v. Stakeholder consultations.
   Stakeholder consultations are done through the Project Advisory Committee (PAC). Three meetings have been done since the start of the
   project. Another meeting took place on 20th November 2014 at Bua camp. The meeting took place at Bua Wildlife Lodge. Members present were
   the Director of Planning and Development for Nkhotakota district, District Forestry Officer, District Fisheries Officer, Water development officer
   for the district, all parks senior officers from Nkhotakota WR and the Director of WESM. The Director of Bua lodge excused himself as he was not
   well. It was a successful meeting. Nevertheless, participants wanted to know the outcome of the response for the extension of the project, since
   there were still few outstanding things to be do ne. After receiving the communication from the Bank about the extension we passed on the
   information to them.

Status of the Work Plan

Actually more than 62% of the work plan has been achieved. However, the score remains low because of the following reasons:

   1. The development of the GMP was suspended awaiting APN
   2. Recruitment of field staff could not be done due to inadequate government funding
   3. Some activities were removed from the work plan to be done by APN

The operational manual says that this will be measured from count report and patrol data sheets
There was no indication of how a composite score would be produced
Therefore a score has been derived with the following data:

                                                                   At December

The inventory reduction since the baseline in 2011 may be due to illegal activity, but also may be as a result
of other factors, such as inventory methodology, season, etc. So data not included in
score.

Convictions                                            2                 6             200%
The subtantial increase in convictions since 2011. This is likely to be as a result of judiciary training, rather than poaching activity
increase. So data not included in score.

Illegal incidences                                  Baseline       At Dec. 2014
Wire snares                                           190                67            -65%

This is the only area with a relevant score, so is presented as the overall outcome.             No data available
