                Grenada’s Rules-Based Fiscal Policy Framework



                Grenada’s fiscal responsibility law set an important step in the transition to a rules-based fiscal
                framework in the OECS region. In June 2015 Grenada’s Parliament was the first in the OECS to approve
                a landmark fiscal responsibility law. The new legal framework establishes a 2 percent cap on real expen-
                diture growth and a debt ceiling of 55 percent of GDP to be achieved by 2022. The framework includes
                escape clauses in the event of unpredictable shocks such as natural disasters, public health epidemics, and
                economic and financial crises.

                The rule-based fiscal framework will be implemented in three phases.

                Phase 1. Under the Government’s homegrown program, a primary balance of 3.5 percent of GDP should be
                achieved by 2016, aiming to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio and restore debt sustainability.
                Phase 2. During Phase 1, the primary balance is maintained at 3.5 percent of GDP on average until public
                debt is lowered to 55 percent of GDP.
                Phase 3. Once the debt target has been achieved, the debt is maintained at this level, while the primary
                balance is maintained at its debt-stabilizing level, currently estimated around 1 percent of GDP.

                In addition, the rules-based fiscal framework contains guidelines on public sector wage negotiations,
                a ceiling on PPP-related contingent liabilities, and the use of CBI receipts. The law also sets a public
                wage-bill target of 9 percent of GDP, establishes a cap on PPP related contingent liabilities at 5 percent of
                GDP, and provides for a share of monthly Citizenship by Investment (CBI) inflows to be saved and used to
                finance future budgetary contingencies or natural-disaster and response efforts.

                This framework is expected to provide a strong basis for counter-cyclical fiscal policy and enduring
                medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability. It is more binding than previous fiscal targets used by OECS
42              member countries, which lacked clear operational guidelines and were not fully adhered to.

     APPENDIX

     Methodological Approach Used to Investigate the Determinants of Fiscal Policy Cyclicality

     We begin by estimating equation (1) below (using a country panel fixed effects specification) linking the cyclical
     component of real government expenditures ( g ci,t ) to the cyclical component of real GDP ( y ci,t ) and a proxy for insti-
     tutional quality (IQi,t) where we denote a given country by “i” in a given year “t”. The interaction variable is meant to
     show how institutional quality increases (a positive sign for α3, in the event of α2>0) or decreases (α3<0, in the event
     of α2>0) fiscal pro-cyclicality.

     (1)	

     We then expand the analysis by including the role of initial institutional quality (IQ initiali,t ) and changes of the variable
     (Δ IQi,t) in equation (2). One expects both signs of the parameters of the interaction terms included in the equation,
     α3 and α4, to be negative and significant in explaining the relationships between cyclical components of real govern-
     ment expenditures and real GDP (in the event of α2>0).
     	
     (2)

     As a next step, we added to this panel equation a vector Z of “q” additional controls to look for possible omitted vari-
     able bias problems. One expects to observe significant values for the institutional quality variable after controlling
     for the variables included in Zq vector.

     (3)

44
     Finally, we tried a different approach with equation (4) by switching to a cross section specification where the de-
     pendent variable (ρiavg) is the correlation coefficient of real government expenditures and real GDP for a given time
     period. The specification is first computed including the average value of the institutional quality variable (IQiavg) for
     the same period as sole control, and then adding additional explanatory variables (vector Z). Again, the value for a2
     is expected to be negative and statistically significant.

     (4)

     In all cases, we used alternative definitions of fiscal cyclicality, namely by applying different filters to smooth the
     series including the Hodrick-Prescott, Baxter-King, Christiano-Fitzgerald and Butterworth filters. The specifications
     were applied for the following periods and samples:

     i)	 First, for the period 1984-2009, using the Frankel, Vegh, & Vuletin (2014) sample of real government expenditures
          and real GDP, as well as the set of controls identified by these authors, including the institutional quality proxy,
          based on the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) data.10
     ii)	 Next, for the period 1990-2011, using a sample of 180 countries and including the same controls defined by Fran-
          kel, Vegh, & Vuletin (2014). A problem we found was that of availability of data for the ICRG variable. In particular,
          the source includes information for 138 countries up to 2010 only. To get around this limitation, we considered an
          alternative proxy for IQ based on Kunčič (2013), which is available for 193 economies for the period 1990-2011.
          This is also motivated out of our interest to test whether results found by Frankel, Vegh, & Vuletin (2014) are
          robust to the choice of IQ variable and hold for a different (larger) country sample.11


     10  While the data on real government expenditures and real GDP was kindly provided by Frankel, Vegh, & Vuletin (2013), we compiled
     the remaining information from the original sources.
     11  An additional reason for using the Kunčič (2013) dataset is that it includes data on the IQ proxy for 14 out of 15 Caribbean countries
     that are of special interest in this research, whereas ICRG data only covers 6 of those countries.
                                                  Taming Volatility



iii)	 Third, we generated results for additional specifications, not included in Frankel, Vegh, & Vuletin (2014), and in-
      troduced additional controls.

Tables A3.1 and A3.2 show the results of econometric estimations that confirm the relevance of institutional quality
as an important determinant of fiscal policy cyclicality. The full set of results can be found in Carneiro and Garrido
(2015) and will not be repeated here. Our results show that IQ is strongly significant as an explanatory variable of
movements away from cyclicality for all specifications using ICRG as a proxy for IQ and for all but one specification
that rely on the Kunčič (2013) dataset, following Equation 1. When we separate the effects of initial IQ from changes
in IQ (Equation 2) we observe that the former variable is strongly significant under all filtering methods when using
ICRG as proxy for IQ, but less so in the specifications using Kunčič (2013) data. On the other hand, the latter spec-
ifications show higher statistical significance for the changes in IQ compared to the former. When the same panel
specification was expanded to account for the role of additional controls (Equation 3), one can observe how robust
the significance of IQ is when ICRG is used as a proxy under all filtering methods. The cross-country regression
results for the period 1990-2011 through the estimation of equation (4) considers the correlation between cyclical
components of real government expenditures and real GDP as a function of average IQ and average values for other
controls, as in Frankel, Vegh, & Vuletin (2013). This specification also shows robust results for institutional quality
under all filtering methods and for alternative IQ definitions.
