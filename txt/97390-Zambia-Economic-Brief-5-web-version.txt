 Box    A partial resolution to VAT refunds
 1        In an effort to combat fraudulent claims for VAT refunds, in 2013 the government tightened documentation requirements for
          exporters seeking refund of input VAT. Although some companies complied with new requirements, most exporters protested that
          meeting the additional requirements applied in 2013 was impractical. Some mounted legal challenges. Refunds fell to 26 percent
          of gross collections in 2014 from 50 percent during 2012–13, as shown in the figure below.

               In February 2015, ZRA revised the rules to allow documents from transit countries to serve as proof of export, after con-
          siderable discussion with stakeholders. The amended rules address the complaints made by mining companies about the difficul-
          ties arising when metals shipments change hands several times before arriving in the final country of consumption.
               Two concerns remain. The revised requirements remain more stringent than standard practice for VAT around the world,
          which discourages expansion of Zambia’s non-traditional exports.1 Smaller firms lack the capacity to obtain documentation from
          foreign governments that international mining companies possess. High costs of receiving refunds on input VAT makes it difficult
          for Zambian companies to enter export markets and expand their foreign sales over time.
               A second concern is how to resolve the disputed claims submitted through February 2015. The stock of these refund claims
          was K5.76 billion as of end-February according to ZRA data. They cast a shadow over the country’s business climate. And they
          represent a large potential financial liability to the government—equal to 3.5 percent of 2014 GDP. This liability could be
          realized if, for example, firms were to resubmit their claims with the required documentation, if new court decisions were to
          be handed down, or if the authorities were to agree to settle some or all of the disputed claims.
               Prudence dictates that the Zambia should consider disputed claims as contingent liabilities in annual budget documents. It
          should implement any agreement to repay claims transparently and fairly. If the government agrees to honor claims but cannot
          repay them, it should convert these either into non-transferrable debt, which firms could carry on their balance sheets as assets,
          or into sovereign debt with a standard amortization allowing refunds to the firms.
       1. A survey of selected exporters in the region and around the world finds that no country has such stringent requirements. See Zambia Economic Brief 4 for
       details.

                          Box    The return of fuel subsidies
                          2        Even though the government abandoned the formal policy of subsidizing fuel prices in 2013, fuel subsidies have returned and
                                   have thus strained the budget. How does this happen?
                                        The Energy Regulation Board (ERB) sets wholesale and retail fuel prices according to a formula that marks up the landed
                                   price of each shipment of oil as it arrives in Dar es Salaam by the cost of transporting, refining, and distributing fuel in Zambia.
                                   The stated objective of ERB’s cost-plus pricing model is to ensure that all costs relevant to procurement are recovered through
                                   sales of petroleum products. On January 15, 2015, the ERB reduced pump prices of petrol and diesel fuel by 23 and 28 percent,
                                   respectively, in response to falling world oil prices. This followed more modest reductions announced in November and December
                                   2014.

                                   Notes: Prices are expressed as kwacha per liter.


                                        Because fuel is sold in kwacha while imports are purchased in dollars, depreciation of the kwacha during the time that a
                                   cargo of fuel is being sold on the local market means that fewer dollars accrue from each liter of fuel marketed. This in turn
                                   creates a risk that the government will not have sufficient dollars to repay the import bill.
                                        This risk materialized after the ERB reduced pump prices in January 2015. ERB’s announcement on the price change noted
                                   that the exchange rate had been holding steady at around K6.50 per dollar. Within two months the kwacha had depreciated
                                   to K7.34, however, and domestic sales did not generate sufficient dollars to repay the import bill. The PTA Bank (which finances
                                   the government’s imports of crude oil) claimed in a February 2015 letter to the Ministry of Finance that the government has
                                   accumulated arrears of US$257 million. By May, the ERB projected that the extent of under-recovery during 2015 would become
                                   much higher.
                                        The ERB raised prices on May 12, citing rising world oil prices and the need for full cost recovery. In terms of U.S. dol-
                                   lars—the currency needed to repay the import bill—pump prices are essentially the same as in January, however. The dollar
                                   price of diesel rose by 2 percent while the price of petrol is 2 percent lower than the January 15 price, even though world
                                   spot prices for crude oil have increased by 30 percent during this time.
                                        More than two dozen countries have eliminated fuel subsidies during the past two years. Can Zambia join their ranks?
                                   Zambia’s policy of full cost recovery is already in place. Implementation of this policy has fallen short, especially in providing
                                   for currency depreciation. Stronger mechanisms for monitoring cost recovery, institutional coordination, and adjusting prices
                                   between shipments are necessary. A stabilization fund that houses over-recovery during kwacha appreciation and applies savings
                                   during depreciation may be necessary. Zambia could consider an alternative adjustment model used by Namibia and South
                                   Africa. That model adjusts prices monthly in response to changing world market prices rather than only when new imports are
                                   received. This added adjustment provides greater predictability for consumers and reduces the strain on government budgets.

                          Box    The New Copperbelt investment boom
                          3        It is helpful to classify Zambia’s copper mining sector into two distinct sectors: a new set of operations in the Northwestern
                                   Province (the “New Copperbelt,” as the public sometimes refers to it), and the aging mining operations in the existing
                                   Copperbelt Province, which are the source of much economic activity and provide significant employment opportunities in the
                                   province.
                                        Largely the result of the most recent commodities boom and equitable two-tier fiscal regime, the operations in the New
                                   Copperbelt are generally open pit and use newer, less labor-intensive technologies. Because these operations were constructed
                                   more recently, they still have large capital balances to offset profits taxes, but once these balances depreciate, the potential high
                                   profitability of these operations, in particular Kansanshi, have the potential to generate significant revenue from profits-based
                                   taxes.
                                        The older mines of the existing Copperbelt Province tend to be underground mines or dump retreatment operations. They
                                   face high production costs and are generally labor intensive. They require capital on an ongoing basis to develop new openings
                                   to sustain production, and the profitability of operations is highly sensitive to changes in costs and prices. Because these mines
                                   are marginal, they sometimes accrue operating (accounting) losses that accumulate and carry forward. Because they face higher
                                   production costs and use more inputs in production, they generate less tax revenue but offer more opportunities to stimulate
                                   backward linkages.
