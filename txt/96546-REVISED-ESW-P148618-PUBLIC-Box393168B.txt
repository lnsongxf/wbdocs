                                                       Mongolia: Report on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)



SUMMARY ASSESSMENT
1.	 This Public Financial Management Performance Report (PFM-PR) is the first assessment of Mongolia’s
    PFM system using the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework.1 The report aims
    principally to establish an objective baseline measure of current PFM performance, highlighting areas of
    absolute and relative strength and weakness, thereby enabling a stock-taking of over a decade of PFM
    reforms in Mongolia and guiding the Government in its reform priorities.

2.	 The assessment covers public financial management at the budgetary central government level2. The PEFA
    is an evidence-based methodology that measures the performance of a country’s PFM system at a particular
    point in time using a set of standardized indicators. The assessment is done on six dimensions of an open
    and orderly PFM system identified by the Framework, which are:

    1.	 Credibility of the budget: The budget is realistic and is implemented as intended
    2.	 Comprehensiveness and transparency: The budget and the fiscal risk oversight are comprehensive and
        fiscal and budget information is accessible to the public.
    3.	 Policy-based budgeting: The budget is prepared with due regard to government policy.
    4.	 Predictability and control in budget execution: The budget is implemented in an orderly and predictable
        manner and there are arrangements for the exercise of control and stewardship in the use of public
        funds.
    5.	 Accounting, recording and reporting: Adequate records and information are produced, maintained and
        disseminated to meet decision-making control, management and reporting purposes.
    6.	 External scrutiny and audit: Arrangements for scrutiny of public finances and follow up by the executive
        are operating.

3.	 Against these six core dimensions of PFM performance, the set of 28 high-level indicators measure the
    operational performance of the key elements of Mongolia’s PFM systems, processes and institutions of
    the budgetary central government. In addition, the PFM-Performance Report (PR) uses the indicator-based
    analysis to develop an integrated assessment of the PFM system against the six critical dimensions of PFM
    performance and evaluate the likely impact of PFM weaknesses on the three main budgetary outcomes of
    aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic resource allocation, and efficient service delivery.

Integrated assessment of PFM performance

Credibility of the Budget

4.	 The Budget of the Government of Mongolia (“the State Budget”) has low credibility as evidenced by
    deviations of over 15 percent in each of the past three years (2011-2013) between planned expenditures in
    the originally approved budget by the State Great Khural (Mongolia’s parliament) and actual expenditures
    at the end of the budget year; and deviations of over 20 percent in two of the past three years between
    planned and actual revenues. This lack of credibility has required mid-year amendments to the budget by
    the parliament in each of the three years in order to meet the targeted fiscal aggregates.

5.	 The reasons for low budget credibility are twofold. First, given the budget’s high mineral resource dependency,
    there is a structural volatility in the economy, which creates difficulties in budget planning, particularly
    revenue forecasting. The Ministry of Finance (MoF), and the other agencies that provide MoF with relevant

         source data, are in the process of developing the technical capacity to address this structural constraint
         effectively and produce good forecasts. Second, and more importantly, there is a political imperative to
         expand budget spending, which has resulted in overly optimistic forecasts of the key macroeconomic
         parameters (e.g. GDP growth, imports, and mineral production) and therefore unrealistically high revenue
         projections.

     6.	 Lack of budget credibility has downstream implications for the entire budget cycle, as detailed below. It has
         also resulted in an accumulation of arrears of 4 percent of total expenditures in 2013, a significant increase
         over the previous fiscal year, almost entirely due to arrears from capital projects.

     Budget transparency and comprehensiveness

     7.	 Mongolia has made good progress in increasing the comprehensiveness of information included in the budget,
         as measured by the types of documents that are submitted to the parliament for deliberation and approval,
         in the public disclosure of this information, and in setting transparent criteria for inter-governmental fiscal
         relations. These achievements are largely the result of a set of reforms that were enshrined in the integrated
         Budget Law (IBL) adopted in 2011. The annual budget package meets 8 of the 9 documentary requirements.
         Public disclosure of fiscal information has been steadily increasing since 2006 and now includes the annual
         budget documentation at the time of submission to parliament, in-year budget execution reports, year-end
         financial statements, external audit reports, contract awards, and Information on resources available to
         primary service units. The IBL initiated significant fiscal decentralization in Mongolia and instituted rule-
         based intergovernmental fiscal transfers which, combined with the rapid increases in government revenues,
         provide sub-national governments with generally predictable additional funds to deliver services.

     8.	 The rapid growth in unreported extra-budgetary financing of government capital projects however, greatly
         compromises the accuracy of the information in the annual budgetary documentation, and reduces fiscal
         transparency. These government operations are financed by loans from the Development Bank of Mongolia
         (DBM), which in 2013 was equivalent to 28 percent of total central government expenditures (including
         the Human Development Fund and Social Insurance Fund) and was roughly equivalent to on-budget capital
         projects. Neither the medium term fiscal framework nor the annual budget provides information on the
         extra-budgetary operations, thereby greatly compromising their realism; financing sources of these extra-
         budgetary activities are however, included in the calculation of the debt stock that is presented as part of
         the budget documentation. In addition, inconsistencies in the chart of accounts used for budget planning
         and for budget execution also reduces the quality of fiscal information as some expenditure items, such as
         programs, cannot be reported and others require some estimation in order to be reported.

     9.	 A related weakness is the limited oversight of fiscal risks of state-owned enterprises, including but not
         limited to the DBM. While state-owned enterprises are required by law to produce, and do produce, annual
         audited financial statements which are incorporated into the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements of
         the Government that are approved by the parliament, these statements run into several hundred pages
         and are not accompanied by an overall report that provides an overview of the fiscal risks stemming from
         state-owned enterprises.

     Policy-based budgeting

     10.	 The annual budgeting exercise is undertaken in a generally well-regulated and orderly manner. The IBL
          specifies the budget calendar in great detail, and this calendar is adhered to and provides line ministries
          with sufficient time (approximately 5 weeks) to prepare their annual budgets. The budget circular is a clear
          and comprehensive document consistent with the MTFF which on paper provides sufficient guidance to
          ministries. Ministries however, do not use this guidance effectively and in general do not abide by the ceilings
          in preparing their budget estimates which reduces the utility of the ceilings in encouraging prioritization.

    The parliament approves the budget in a timely manner and in adherence to the budget calendar.

11.	 A multi-year perspective on budgeting is however, lacking. While de jure the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) and
     the IBL specify the preparation of an MTFF with multi-year fiscal forecasts, the coverage of the MTFF is
     limited and does not include off-budget expenditures, the forecasting of the main fiscal aggregates is
     poor, and the links between subsequent MTFFs and between the MTFF and the annual budget are weak.
     The MTFF is therefore not achieving its objective of providing a hard budget constraint. The Government
     produces a number of national and sectoral planning documents, but these are not reconciled with the
     MTFF (or formulated within a realistic fiscal envelope) and generally do not have a reasonable costing of
     investments and recurrent expenditures. Budgeting for investment and recurrent expenditure are two
     separate processes with the former the responsibility of the Ministry of Economic Development (MED)
     and the latter the responsibility of the MoF, with little or no coordination between them. While the IBL
     mandates that recurrent cost estimates of capital projects be prepared and included in the budget, this is
     being done only sporadically.

Predictability and control of budget execution

12.	 Mongolia’s PFM system has mixed performance in the predictability and control of budget execution. Good
     progress has been made in tax administration, particularly with regards to the transparency in taxpayer
     obligations; tax collections; in the functioning of the Treasury Single Account (TSA); and the expenditure
     limits exercised through the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS, Mongolia’s
     treasury system), with the notable exception of payroll controls which are weak. The excessive use of
     extra-budgetary funds also compromises procurement, as the bulk of the procurement done from these
     funds uses non-competitive procedures. The non-credibility of the budget, with overly optimistic revenue
     forecasts, hurts the predictability in the availability of funds to line ministries given that cash management
     is weak and largely based on expenditure controls and cash rationing with MoF changing monthly budget
     allotments regularly and with little advance notice. It has also resulted in increased use of discretionary
     audits by the General Department of Taxation (GDT) to meet the high revenue collection targets, which
     hurts the business climate.

13.	 To briefly elaborate:

    Tax administration: Mongolia is a self-assessment based system and tax obligations are clear for most laws,
    and taxpayers have good access to information. There are weaknesses in taxpayer registration arising from
    the multiple systems currently in use that are not well integrated, increasing use of ad hoc audits, and a
    weak regulatory framework for dispute resolutions. The tax collection system is generally efficient, and
    funds are transferred daily to the TSA.

    Cash and debt management: Cash management is weak and largely based on expenditure controls and
    cash rationing. Debt recording is complete, although only reconciled quarterly, but a major weakness is
    that the government’s incurrence of debt and issuance of guarantees are approved by the MED and MoF
    respectively without a unified overview mechanism. The cash balances in the TSA, which accounts for all
    government transactions except extra-budgetary funds, are reconciled daily.

    Payroll controls: Personnel records and payroll are decentralized in each of the over 5000 budgetary
    organizations. Payroll is on the basis of budgeted positions and not actual positions, resulting in inconsistencies
    between the payroll and the personnel records. Personnel records are updated only annually but there are
    significant irregularities in the data reported to the different central agencies. Payroll audits only take place
    infrequently.



                                                                                                                          11
Mongolia: Report on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)


         Procurement: The regulatory framework for budget procurement is generally comprehensive and transparent,
         makes open competitive procurement the default method of procurement, and provides adequate public
         disclosure. This framework however, does not apply to projects financed by the DBM which undermines
         the comprehensiveness and transparency of the procurement system, particularly given the scale of direct
         contracting of projects financed by DBM loans and with limited public disclosure. Another area of weakness
         is the lack of representation from the private sector and civil society on the two complaints bodies.

         Internal control: There are no expenditure commitment controls. Instead, the budget is executed based on
         a monthly budget allotment schedule that establishes expenditure limits, which are revised and adjusted
         every month. Other internal rules and procedures incorporate a comprehensive set of controls, which are
         excessive for the capital budget. Compliance with the rules is high.

         Internal audit: The internal audit function only began in 2012 when authorized under the IBL and has
         been progressing well with most ministries having full time auditors. The weaknesses largely relate to the
         newness of the internal audit function as many of the newly created audit units do not yet consistently meet
         professional standards, and the reporting schedule to MoF and the Mongolia National Audit Office is not
         fixed. There are some delays in the follow-up actions to the internal audit reports.

     Accounting, recording and reporting

     14.	 The accounting, recording and reporting practices are generally strong. Confirmation of the consolidated
          balance of the TSA is done daily between the Bank of Mongolia (the central bank) and the Treasury
          Department. Information is received monthly on the budget allocations and expenditures of service delivery
          units (primary schools and basic health facilities), which are used to produce monthly budget execution
          reports. These reports reveal that front-line service delivery units receive resources without delay and
          spend most of their budgets. The inconsistencies in the chart of accounts used for budget planning and for
          budget execution however, compromise the quality of these reports. The accounting basis is consistently
          disclosed. However, reporting is not in full compliance with the International Public Sector Accounting
          Standards (IPSAS). The GFMIS is not used to prepare financial reports, which are instead prepared using
          desktop systems, resulting in task duplication and inefficiencies.

     External scrutiny and audit

     15.	 The State Great Khural (the national parliament of Mongolia) exercises considerable authority over fiscal
          matters and the budget. It approves the MTFF, the annual development vision, the annual budget, and
          supplementary budgets, and its procedures for review, involving internal organizational arrangements,
          are firmly established by Law, provide the parliament with sufficient time for deliberation, and are strictly
          abided by. Clear rules are specified for in-year amendments in the IBL and they put strict limits on in-year
          budget amendments by the executive.

     16.	 The parliament pays less attention to external audit reports which weakens the accountability of Government.
          All entities of central government are audited annually, either by the MNAO or by auditing firms. A full range
          of financial audits and some aspects of performance audit are performed and generally adhere to auditing
          standards, focusing on significant and systemic issues, and audit reports are submitted to legislature in a
          timely manner, with clear evidence of follow up on MNAO’s audit recommendations. Parliament however,
          only does a cursory review of these audit reports and approves the reports with no recommendations.

Evaluation of the impact of PFM weaknesses on budgetary outcomes

     performance in the three overarching areas of fiscal discipline, the strategic allocation of resources, and
     service delivery.

     Fiscal discipline

     18.	 Despite significant regulatory fiscal and budget reforms over the past five years fiscal discipline is weak
          in Mongolia due to poor budget credibility and limited budget comprehensiveness and transparency. The
          overly optimistic macroeconomic assumptions and revenue forecasts used in the preparation of the MTFF
          and the annual budget, and the government’s incurrence of debt and issuance of guarantees to finance
          extra-budgetary spending with limited coordination between the MED and MoF, weaken the fiscal rules
          enshrined in the FSL. As a result the fiscal deficit is over 10 percent of GDP with negative impacts on inflation
          and current account balances. These fiscal risks are also not being consolidated and systematically analyzed
          by the Government, or adequately publically disclosed.

     Strategic allocation of resources

     19.	 Annual budgeting in Mongolia is well regulated and orderly which, combined with the considerable scrutiny
          that parliament exercises over the executive’s budget proposal, allows for the Government’s strategic
          priorities to be reflected in the budget. However, the absence of a medium term perspective in budgeting,
          particularly with regards to the rapidly increasing capital spending (both on- and off-budget), and the
          weak coordination between the MoF and the MED in the preparation of the recurrent and capital budgets
          respectively compromises the strategic allocation of resources, as exemplified by the absence of costing of
          future recurrent expenditures for capital projects. Lack of budget credibility, which creates unpredictability
          in budget execution due to unplanned reallocations and regular in-year budget amendments, also hurts
          allocative efficiency. The negative impact is most clearly seen in the capital budget which is significantly
          under-executed and leads to the accumulation of arrears.

     Efficient service delivery

     20.	 Thanks to the regularity of the annual budget process, and the functional TSA and GFMIS, schools and
          basic health units receive resources on time and as per the budget plan, and this information is accurately
          accounted for and audited, and made publically available, representing a significant achievement of
          Mongolia’s PFM reforms over the past decade. The weak predictability and control in budget execution of
          capital projects however, in particular the absence of competition and transparency in the procurement
          procedures used for off-budget capital spending, combined with the limited review of external audit by the
          parliament, reduces the value for money of the largest share of public spending (equal to 30 percent of total
          expenditures).

     Planning and reform perspectives

     21.	 The Government of Mongolia has undertaken significant PFM reforms of the past decade. In many ways
          these reforms have followed the textbook “basics first” sequencing, with an emphasis in the period 2003-
          2008 on strengthening internal controls, cash management, and accounting and reporting, followed by the
          a focus since 2008, roughly coinciding with the mineral resource boom, on improving fiscal policy, budget
          planning, and greater decentralization of expenditure responsibilities to local governments.

     22.	 The medium-term reform program is well understood by the MoF and is essentially the effective
          implementation of the FSL, IBL, and PPLM, and this reform program is being supported by Mongolia’s
          development partners. There are three major institutional factors however, that comprise the effective
          planning and implementation of these reforms. First, the MoF’s reform priorities are not shared by all
          concerned parties, in particular the MED, which weakens the overall coordination and coherence of the
          PFM system. Second, an underlying constraint has been the implementation gap between the laws and
          the capacity of the key agencies to implement these laws. Third and most importantly, is the significant

    politicization of public financial management and these informal political economy institutions serve to
    weaken the formal PFM institutions.

23.	 The great strength of Mongolia’s government system, and society, is openness, not just of fiscal and
     budget transparency, but of the broader political process, with active citizen engagement in a variety of
     dimensions. The Government has also undertaken a number of regulatory measures over the past five
     years to institutionalize citizen participation, which include becoming a member of the international Open
     Government Partnership, passing a Right to Information Act (2012), formalizing participatory budgeting
     in the IBL, and formalizing citizen monitoring of procurement in the PPLM. Transparency and citizen
     engagement can help align the informal institutions with the formal PFM institutions to better achieve fiscal
     sustainability, strategic allocation of resources and efficient service deliver so that Mongolia’s vast mineral
     resources can be used to better the lives of its citizens.

     Section 1: Introduction
     Objective

     1.	 This is the first PEFA assessment for Mongolia and it comes at an important juncture as the country has been
         undergoing rapid, mineral resource fueled economic growth and fiscal expansion over the past decade.
         Overall government expenditure has increased from 34 percent of GDP in 2003 to 45 percent in 2013,
         with spending expanding 2.6 fold in nominal terms between 2010 and 2013. As public expenditures are
         increasingly playing an important role in economic growth and social development, an open and orderly
         PFM system — which results in fiscal discipline, the strategic allocation of budget resources, and efficient
         service delivery — is essential to translate the narrow and enclave mining-led growth into broader and
         sustainable improvements in the welfare of citizens.

     2.	 This report has three main objectives:

         •	 To provide a rigorous stock-taking of Mongolia’s PFM system using a standardized, widely accepted
            methodology which will establish a baseline measurement of the PFM system;
         •	 To help underline the main strengths and weaknesses in the PFM system and identify priority areas of
            reform for the Government;
         •	 To enable the Government, in particular the Ministry of Finance, to institutionalize the key PFM
            performance indicators in its own monitoring and evaluation framework to track progress with these
            reforms.
     3.	 Mongolia has been undertaking public financial management reforms over the past decade, with significant
         support from the World Bank, IMF, ADB, and other development partners. This PEFA assessment will
         complement the considerable work that has already taken place on public expenditure management,
         which includes regular economic updates, public investment reviews, procurement reviews, analytic work
         conducted and supported by the World Bank funded technical assistance projects, as well as technical
         assistance mission reports of the IMF.4

     PEFA report preparation process

     4.	 The assessment was done by a World Bank team in close collaboration with the Government, in particular
         the main counterparts — the Ministry of Finance (MoF), Ministry of Economic Development (MED), the
         Mongolia National Audit Office (MNAO), the General Department of Taxation (GDT), the Government
         Procurement Agency (GPA), select line ministries and relevant Standing Committees of the Parliament
         including Economic Policy and Budget. The World Bank team carried out assessment missions to the
         country between March and July 2014 to: (i) hold discussions and consultations for the PEFA indicators;
         and (ii) present preliminary results to the Government and other stakeholders, including briefings to
         development partners. An orientation seminar was held in March 2014 for stakeholders and donors to
         explain the objectives, concepts and methodology underlying the PEFA framework. Stakeholders outside
         the Government were also extensively consulted to ensure the credibility and quality of the assessment. In
         particular, the views of the civil society and private sector (e.g., Chamber of Commerce, Association of Audit
         Companies) were taken into account to triangulate the information from government sources, including
         perceptions of the efficiency of government services.

Report preparation methodology

5.	 The assessment was conducted following the PEFA methodology as elaborated in the PEFA Fieldguide of
    May 3, 2012.5 Two training workshops were conducted in Ulaanbaatar by the PEFA Secretariat at the start
    of the assessment mission — one for the task team and the other for the key Government stakeholders.
    The assessment was done through interviews of the above-mentioned stakeholders, review of the relevant
    laws and regulations, and analysis of relevant fiscal data. It also drew, as necessary, on the significant body
    of existing technical assistance reports and analytical work noted above. The PEFA Check requirements
    (quality assurance by at least 4 PFM institutions) were followed and the Concept note, the draft and final
    report were subject to quality assurance and peer review by the Government, the WB, the IMF and the PEFA
    Secretariat.

Scope of evaluation as established in the report

6.	 The report assesses the performance of Mongolia’s PFM system of the budgetary central government for
    2011-2013. According to the 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual, the budgetary central government
    is defined as the central government units covered by the central government budget. As of end-2013, the
    budgetary central government consisted of sixteen line ministries and other budget entities including the
    Office of the President, the Office of the Prime Minister and the parliament. The assessment excludes the
    other entities that constitute the general government —autonomous agencies (the Human Development
    Fund (HDF) and the Social Insurance Fund (SIF), local governments, and the Development Bank of Mongolia
    (DBM) which carries out budgetary activities outside the scope of the official central government budget.

7.	 Table 2 shows the composition of general government expenditures. In 2013, the budgetary central
    government expenditures accounted for 60.9 percent of total public expenditures including all transfers
    provided to local governments, HDF and SIF. The two autonomous agencies (HDF and SIF) carry out budgetary
    operations separately from the central government budget relying on their own revenue sources specified
    by the respective laws and financial support from the central government. In 2013, the expenditures of
    the two funds excluding financial support from central government budget accounted for 11 percent
    of total public expenditures. Expenditures of local governments──21 aimags and the Ulaanbaatar City
    government──excluding the revenue transfers from the central government accounted for 8.6 percent of
    total public expenditures. However, if the central government transfers are included, total spending at the
    local government level reaches 23 percent of total public expenditures as the central government transfers
    provide significant financial support to service deliveries and development projects of the local government.
    The extra-budgetary spending of the DBM accounted for 19.7 percent of total general government
    expenditure.

     Section 2: Background Information about the Country

     Subsection 2.1: Description of the country’s economic situation

     Country Context

     8.	 Mongolia over the past decade has been undergoing a major transition from a largely livestock-based
         economy to a minerals-based one. Real economic growth has averaged 9 percent since 2003 when the
         mining boom began to emerge. Economic growth further accelerated into double-digits between 2011 and
         2013 thanks to a surge in largely mining-related foreign direct investment and continued economic stimulus
         policy measures from fiscal and monetary policies. While economic growth will likely soften in 2014 from its
         peak of 17.5 percent in 2011, continued development of massive mineral resources of the country, largely
         from the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine and the Tavan Tolgoi coal mine, will likely provide momentum for
         relatively strong economic growth in the medium and long term.

     9.	 This rapid economic growth has brought welfare improvements to Mongolia’s people, with the poverty
         headcount declining from 39.2 percent in 2010 to 27.4 percent in 2012. Substantial progress has also been
         made in regard to several Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) at the national level, though significant
         regional disparities remain.

     10.	 Mongolia however, faces risks that resource wealth may not be used for sustained broad-based economic
          growth and welfare improvements. Mining production is an enclave activity with few linkages to other
          sectors of the economy and with limited direct employment creation. While the mining sector in Mongolia
          accounts for around 20 percent of GDP and 85 percent of exports, it only employs 4 percent of the labor
          force. Resource rich countries also have to deal with significant challenges of mineral market volatility and
          real-exchange rate appreciation due to the well-known “Dutch Disease” symptoms. Mongolia witnessed
          first-hand the problems posed by minerals market volatility in 2008-09 when mineral prices collapsed
          and resulted in an economic crisis. Economic vulnerabilities have substantially increased again in recent
          years as macroeconomic policies have been overly loose in Mongolia over the past two years with public
          expenditures growing over twofold in real terms between 2010 and 2013, the fiscal deficit reaching over
          10 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2013 (including extra-budgetary funds). The combination of deteriorating
          external environment and the continuation of artificial economic stimulus has led to persistent pressure
          on the balance of payments and high inflation. And, mineral resource rents also significantly increased
          opportunities for rent seeking behaviors, a risk that is particularly acute in Mongolia given the scale of the
          national resources, and the small size of the economic and political elite that are closed connected with
          each other.

     11.	 Mongolia's key development challenge is therefore, to ensure that the mineral resources are successfully
          translated into a solid foundation for the sustainable improvement in the lives of current and future
          generations of its citizens through effective and efficient use of mineral revenues. This underlines the
          centrality of a sound public financial management (PFM) system that will support aggregate fiscal disciple to
          ensure macroeconomic sustainability, the strategic allocation of resources in line with national and sectoral
          priorities set by the government, and efficient service delivery.

     12.	 Mongolia’s PFM system has evolved rapidly over the past decade, both in terms of the regulatory and
          institutional architecture and the capacity of central finance authorities and other key stakeholders. A host
          of regulatory and institutional changes have taken place, the most significant of which are:

    •	 The passage of fiscal responsibility legislation — the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL, 2010) — to reduce the
       risks of macroeconomic instability stemming from volatile minerals market fluctuations through the
       requirement that the annual budget should abide by fiscal rules to reduce expenditure volatility, limit
       the growth of government expenditures, and restrict public debt level for long term fiscal sustainability;
    •	 The passage of an integrated Budget Law (IBL, 2011) which impact all aspects of budgeting, and
       significantly decentralizes expenditure responsibilities to sub-national governments;
    •	 A revised Public Procurement Law of Mongolia (PPLM, 2011) which changes the organizational
       arrangements for public procurement, and enhances transparency, including through citizen oversight;

13.	 At the same time there are significant gaps in the implementation of these laws. For example, there are
     several provisions of these laws that need to be clearly spelled out in their implementing regulations in order
     to ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the new modalities. Other laws, such as the
     Law on the Development Bank of Mongolia, will likely undermine these legislative reforms, particularly in
     light of the countervailing pressures for significant off-budget financing of infrastructure projects. Large off-
     budget spending through the DBM has rendered the Fiscal Stability Law ineffective. Corruption is a significant
     concern, particularly because of the close relationships between political, mining, and construction industry
     circles which reformers have also been trying to address through the recent passage of the Law on Conflict
     of Interest (2012) and the Right to Information Law (2011). Coordination has been weak between the key
     agencies involved in public expenditure framework, especially between the Ministry of Finance in charge
     of overall budget plan and the Ministry of Economic Development that controls the capital budget, which
     compromised the effectiveness of the IBL.

Subsection 2.2: Description of Budgetary Outcomes

Fiscal Performance

14.	 The central government budget has been in deficit over the last three years. Table 3 shows that the overall
     budget deficit reached 5.4 percent of GDP in 2011 and slightly declined to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013. The
     improvement of budget deficit was due to the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) that came into effect in 2013. The
     Fiscal Stability Law requires that the structural deficit of the general government budget be kept within two
     percent of GDP from 2013 and the official budget spending was controlled to meet the deficit ceiling of the
     FSL by the budgetary authorities. Total central budget revenue displayed strong performance reaching 25.4
     percent of GDP in 2013 amidst strong minerals market and surging FDI inflow. In 2012 and 2013, the budget
     revenue to GDP ratio dropped to around 21 percent as the minerals market weakened and the FDI inflow
     declined. Total expenditure remained around 25 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2013 and interest payments
     rose from 0.3 percent of GDP in 2011 to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2013 due to increasing debt service for the
     sovereign bond (Chinggis bond) that was issued in 2012. Current expenditure remained around 18 percent
     of GDP while capital expenditure to GDP ratio declined to 6.3 percent in 2013, down from 12 percent in
     2011.

15.	 However, the central budget data needs to be interpreted with caution as there have been significant extra-
     budgetary activities in 2012 and 2013. Table 4 shows the fiscal trend of the general government budget.
     The general government budget deficit reached 10 percent of GDP in 2012 and narrowed to 8.9 percent
     of GDP in 2013 due to the substantial amount of extra-budgetary activities was carried out through the
     DBM. The DBM financed a signification portion of capital spending using the proceeds of the DBM bond of
     US$580 million that was issued under the direct guarantee of the government in 2012 and the sovereign
     bond (known as Chinggis bond) of US$1.5 billion that was issued in 2013 by the Government of Mongolia.
     The large increase in interest payment of the budget in 2013 reflects growing debt service amount for these
     bonds. The proceeds of these bonds were used to finance large infrastructure projects many of which were
     implemented by the line ministries of the government, outside the control of the official budget and the
     Fiscal Stability Law. The extra-budgetary spending of the DBM reached 3.7 percent of GDP in 2012 and
     mounted to 8 percent of GDP in 2013.

     Resource Allocation

     16.	 Mongolia’s budget execution report does not include sectoral allocation of budget expenditures. The World
          Bank team estimated sectoral budget allocation based on administrative classification by budgetary heads of
          the budget execution report. Further work is required for more accurate sectoral composition of the budget.
          Table 5 shows that education has been taking the largest sectoral allocation of the central government
          budget, followed by health, construction and health sectors. Table 6 shows the central government budget
          allocation by economic classification. The recurrent expenditure accounts for close to 80 percent of total
          expenditures of the central government and the interest payment accounted for 4.5 percent of total central
          government spending in 2013, up from 0.8 percent in 2011. Expenditure share of subsidies and transfers
          also significantly increased over the last three years from 13% to 32% as the amount of inter-government
          transfers was raised to finance local development and delivery of services delegated to local governments
          under the Integrated Budget Law. Expenditure share of wages and salaries and purchase of goods and
          service have on a rising trend until 2012 but their expenditure shares dropped to 13 percent and 10 percent
          respectively in 2013, reflecting downward adjustment of recurrent budget in 2013 amidst weak revenue
          outturn.

Mongolia: Report on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)


     Subsection 2.3: Description of the Legal and Institutional Framework for PFM

     Legal and regulatory Framework for PFM

     17.	 The current legal framework for PFM in Mongolia is set out in the following box:
     Box 1: Legal framework for public financial management in Mongolia
     The Fiscal Stability law (FSL, 2010): The Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) introduces four fiscal rules to deal with mineral price volatility and Dutch disease
     effects. First, it mandates that structural or long term mineral prices be used to calculate structural budget revenues. Second, the annual structural
     budget deficit (expenditure minus structural revenues) should be below 2 percent of GDP. Third, the annual growth of government expenditure shall
     not exceed non-mineral GDP growth as another safeguard measure to curb excessive spending growth. Fourth, to maintain long-term fiscal solvency,
     the public debt-to-GDP ratio will be maintained at below 40 percent from 2014. All revenues in excess of structural revenues are saved in the Fiscal
     Stability Fund, which shall be not less than 5 percent of GDP in any given year. The law went into effect January 2013.
     The Budget Law (IBL, 2011): The integrated Budget Law of Mongolia (IBL), which went into effect in January 2012, is the primary budget legislation
     for the country that replaced the Public Sector Management and Finance Law (PSMFL) and the General Budget Law of 1992. The main objectives of
     the IBL are to: (i) strengthen the medium term fiscal framework (MTFF) and ensure fiscal stability; (ii) improve the comprehensiveness of the budget;
     (iii) strengthen the public investment planning and capital budgeting process; (iv) ensure efficient financial management; (v) significantly increase the
     authorities and financial resources of local governments; and (vi) strengthen accountability through participatory budgeting.
     The law states that the budget consists of the state (central government) budget, local government budget, the Human Development Fund, and the So-
     cial Insurance Fund. The budget should list projects to be executed through concessions contracts and includes information on government guarantees
     and contingent liabilities, thereby improving the budget’s comprehensiveness. The budget calendar is laid out in detail with the process commencing
     with the approval of the MTFF by the Parliament by June 1, together with the Socio-economic Guidelines, which forms the basis for the budget ceilings
     of line ministries. Budget proposals from line ministries and the National Development and Innovation Committee (NDIC, currently the Ministry of
     Economic Development) for large projects, as discussed below, are meant to comply within the limits imposed by these ceilings. This provision should
     significantly improve the credibility of the budget process.
     The IBL envisioned to significantly strengthen public investment planning and capital budgeting process, thereby redressing a major weakness in the
     PSMFL. It mandates that only projects that have gone through a proper appraisal process will be considered for financing from the budget. The IBL also
     introduces the concept of a four-year rolling Public Investment Program (PIP) for large projects and mandates that the recurrent cost implications of
     capital projects be included in budget proposals.
     The authorities of local governments have been significantly enhanced, with the capital city and aimag governments responsible for basic education,
     primary healthcare, urban planning and construction, social welfare services, water supply and sewerage, public transport, urban roads and bridges,
     and municipal services such as street lighting and garbage removal. These functions will be financed through local taxes and fiscal transfers (an equali-
     zation grant) from shared taxes from the central government, with the transfer formula based on the size of population, population density, remoteness
     and the size of the local government, and the level of local development. There is also a conditional performance element to the transfers that are
     linked to local tax effort. Only the capital city government is allowed, with the approval of the MoF, to borrow from capital markets to finance public
     investment projects, with their debt size limited to the previous year’s revenue and debt service limited to 15% of the previous year’s revenue.
      The Public Procurement Law of Mongolia (PPLM, 2011): The PPLM went into effect in January 2013. The law introduced radical changes in the system
     for public procurement in Mongolia. It brought the procurement responsibility from line ministries and to a new Government Procurement Agency
     (GPA) for national level projects and to local governments for local level projects. The GPA became responsible for all procurements of large projects
     — such as inter-regional roads and power plants — as well as for establishing framework agreements for common use items (such as office supplies)
     that will be purchased by line ministries. Local governments will be responsible for all procurements of works, goods, and services to be financed from
     the local budget, as well as for local projects (e.g. schools and hospitals) financed from the national budget. One of the most important aspects of
     the revised law is the new role for civil society organizations in both bid evaluation and contract monitoring. Monitoring of contracts by civil society
     organizations potentially covers both monitoring of the implementation of on-going contracts as well as gauging end-users’ satisfaction with completed
     contracts.
     General Taxation Law (2008): establishes the legal basis for creation of new taxes, tax imposition, reporting, payment, inspection and collection, de-
     fines rights, responsibilities and functions of the tax administration and regulates their relations with around 18 other tax laws. More specifically, the
     General Taxation Law is the umbrella law which regulates the types of taxes, taxable items, rate, tax holidays and exemptions, rights and responsibilities
     of tax inspectors and taxpayers, tax administration units’ services to the taxpayers, structure and functions of the tax authority and tax inspectors, sta-
     tus and operation of the general database for tax information and recording, tax inspection process and dispute resolution mechanisms.
     Any changes to the tax legislation are initiated by a relevant government organization in charge of tax policy and associated formal decisions are en-
     dorsed by parliament. The Government submits to the Parliament any amendments of the general tax law and other tax regulations together with
     annual budget proposal. According to the tax legislation, Mongolia has flat 10% tax regime for major income taxes such as PIT and VAT and two-stage
     tariff for CIT: 10% for up to 3 billion tugrugs of income and 20% for above than 3 billion tugrugs.
     The Law on State Audit (LSA, 2003 with latest amendments made in 2013): Following the decentralization of budget accountability to the local munic-
     ipal authorities, as introduced by the IBL, the LSA of Mongolia was amended in 2013 to shift the country’s Supreme Audit Institution – the Mongolian
     National Audit Office (MNAO) – to a vertical organizational structure, which requires local state audit branches to report to the Auditor-General of
     Mongolia instead of reporting to the local municipal authorities as previously mandated. By amending the LSA, state auditors are now responsible for
     reviewing not only the budget execution but also compliance with Parliament-approved legislation and implementation of recommendations provided
     by Standing Committees and other institutions in the Parliament structure. The vertical organizational structure will also allow the government auditors
     at all levels to receive their operational direction and guidance from the Auditor-General and report back to a central organization. The law and the
     latest amendments to it have been in effect since January 3, 2003 and November 7, 2013, respectively.

The institutional features for PFM

18.	 The main institutions for PFM, with their roles and responsibilities, are set out in the above-mentioned laws
     and include: the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Economic Development (MED), the Mongolia
     National Audit Office, the Mongolian Tax Authority, the Mongolian Customs Authority and the State Great
     Khural (Parliament).

The State Great Khural (Parliament): The parliament is responsible for approving all legislative acts and laws
including the MTFF (medium term fiscal framework), the medium-term and annual strategic plans, the annual
budget, the audited budget execution reports, tax laws, and to oversee the spending and results from public
funds. The parliament has the authority to amend the approved annual budget law, endorse any tax rate related
changes.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF): The MOF is the main central government agency in charge of formulating fiscal
policy, preparing, implementing, and reporting on the annual budget, ensuring timely financing of public funds
and the revenue generation process. Its organizational chart is provided in Figure 1 below. The Fiscal Policy and
Planning department is responsible for the drafting annual budget, preparing medium term fiscal framework
and implementing the annual budget law while department of Financial Policy and Debt Management is in
charge of management and reporting of the state debt. In terms of the fiscal revenue, the MOF is the institution
that proposes any changes in tax rates, exemptions and tax holidays on behalf of the government. Tax revenue is
collected through two main separate agencies – the General Department of Taxation and the General Department
of Customs – under the MoF. Through its Treasury Department, the MOF handles expenditure transactions for
the other central government line ministries, agencies, local governments and special government funds such as
Social Insurance Fund and the Human Development Fund. Until September 2012, MoF was also responsible for
public investment planning and the preparation of the capital budget; this function then shifted to the Ministry
of Economic development (MED). The MOF continues to be responsible for capital expenditure transactions.

The Ministry of Economic Development (MED): The MED is a central government body that defines annual
and medium term socio-economic policy, excercises government’s external borrowing authority and develops
planning of large scale investment projects. The MED plays an important role in overall public finance practice
due to its external borrowing function and supervision of the Development Bank of Mongolia which has been
the largest off-budget vehicle for investment financing since 2012. The MED is in charge of negotiating and
signing in international borrowing agreements on behalf of the government while the MOF takes care of the
actual financing of the lending projects.

General Department of Taxation (GDT): Mongolian taxation authority is the government execution agency in
charge of tax revenue collection and it directly reports to the Ministry of Finance according to the IBL and
General Taxation Law. The GDNT has vertical structure and therefore consists of the district and local tax offices
according to the General Taxation Law. Tax revenues transferred to the GDNT account are reconciled on daily
basis and transferred to the Treasury Single Account at the MOF.

The Mongolian Customs Authority: The Customs Authority is another government executing agency in charge of
trade facilitation and collecting customs tax and duties for imports and exports. The customs tax rates and fees
are regulated by the relevant tax laws. The customs authority reports to the ministry of finance.

The Mongolia National Audit Office (MNAO): The state audit board is the supreme audit institution that conducts
audits for public financial operations including annual budget, government financial statement, effectiveness
and efficiency of using public funds for various stated purposes. According to the IBL, the annual government
financial statement has to be audited and the audited statement has to be approved by parliament.

     Section 3: Evaluation of PFM systems, processes and institutions
     Subsection 3.1: Budget Credibility
     19.	 A credible budget — one where actual budget outturns are in line with the fiscal planning envisioned at the
          budget preparation stage — is necessary for sound fiscal management and to provide a stable environment
          for the delivery of services and public goods by line ministries and implementing agencies. This section
          measures the credibility of the budget of the budgetary central government using four indicators (from
          PI-1 to PI-4) comprising key budget execution parameters: (a) deviations in aggregate expenditure, (b)
          deviations in expenditure composition, (c) deviations in total budget revenue, and (d) stock and monitoring
          of expenditure payment arrears. Budgetary central government excludes the Human Development Fund
          (HDF), Social Insurance Fund (SIF), the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM), and the Local Government
          Budget as per the PEFA guidelines. Primary budgetary central government expenditure data have been used
          for PI-1 and PI-2 which measure expenditure outturns6. PI-3, the revenue indicator, excludes grants and
          loans. All the data are from audited government financial statements and the accounting is on a cash basis.

     PI-1 Aggregate actual expenditures compared to the original approved budget

     20.	 Table 7 shows the outturn of the aggregate primary expenditure in 2011-2013 compared to the original
          approved budget during the same period. Deviations of the actual primary expenditure from the original
          budget were 28.8 percent, -18.1 percent, and -19.2 percent in the last three years respectively.

     6	 Primary expenditures include both recurrent and capital expenditures. They exclude debt service charges and donor-financed
        project expenditure (loans and grants).

21.	 These relatively large deviations in budget execution were mainly due to inaccurate revenue forecasts,
     as detailed under PI-3. As a result the budgets were amended mid-year in each of the year to make the
     necessary adjustments to spending to abide by fiscal rules in the FSL. In 2011 the original budget reflected
     conservative mineral revenue projections; as actual revenue outturn came higher the budget was amended
     mid-year to increase expenditures on wages, subsidies, and social transfers (in particular adding MNT 21,000
     cash transfer to every citizen out of human development fund (HDF) and tuition fee support to students).
     In 2012 and 2013, the original budget was based on overly optimistic revenue forecasts, which led to an
     unrealistically ambitious expenditure plan particularly with regards to the capital budget. The adjustments
     in the amended budgets were primarily through reductions in capital spending. For example, in 2013 the
     amended budget passed by the Parliament in November reduced expenditures by 10.9 percent (MNT 814
     billion) to adjust to the revenue shortfall, with current and capital spending cut by MNT 234 billion and MNT
     620 billion respectively. However, a bulk of capital expenditure – which was carried out through the DBM –
     remained outside the official budget.

PI-2 Composition of actual expenditures compared to the original approved budget

22.	 This indicator compares primary expenditure, budgeted and actual, at a sub-aggregate level across the
     main administrative headings. The first dimension measures the extent to which reallocations between
     budget heads during execution have contributed to variance in expenditure composition without taking the
     contingency vote into consideration.7 The use of a contingency vote is considered in the second dimension.
	 As per the PEFA guidelines, adjusted expenditures for individual budget heads were calculated based on the percentage share of
7

  aggregate actual expenditure to aggregate budgeted expenditure and the differences (deviations) between actual expenditure and

                                                                                                                                     25

     23.	 Table 8 provides details of the variation in the composition of expenditures for the 20 largest budget heads
          of the budgetary central government, with the remaining budget heads consolidated into a single “others”
          category. The aggregate deviations were 14.3 percent, 13.2 percent, and 25.8 percent respectively in the
          last three years. These results indicate that the large variation in aggregate expenditure outturn is translated
          into the weak and unpredictable delivery of services in individual budget heads.

(ii) Average amount of expenditures actually charged to the contingency reserve over the last three

24.	 The MoF maintains two types of contingency funds: the Government Reserve Fund and the Contingency
     Fund. The Law on Government Special Fund specifies the purpose of these two funds. The Government
     Reserve Fund is to be used for relief expenditures due to natural or man-made disasters, implementation
     of new legislation, government expenses in international dispute resolution, and expenditures related
     with international treaties. The Contingency Fund is to be used for unexpected large revenue shortfalls,
     disruption in domestic production and services including agricultural production due to unforeseeable
     events or natural disasters, abrupt fluctuation in exchange rates, and abrupt price increases of flour, wheat
     and petroleum products in domestic markets. The actual use of these contingency funds was 1.3 percent,
     0.7 percent, and 0.4 percent in of the total budgeted primary expenditures in the last three years (Table 9).

PI-3 Total actual revenue compared to the original approved budget

25.	 Accurate revenue forecast is a key input to the preparation of a credible budget as the budget expenditure
     will likely be largely affected by especially under-realization of revenue. This indicator measures actual
     domestic revenue (which includes foreign grant) collected compared to the revenue projections in the
     original approved budget.

Mongolia: Report on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)


     26.	 Table 10 shows that there were significant deviations in actual outturns as compared to the originally
          approved budget. In the three years under review (2011-2013), domestic revenue outturn for the budgetary
          central government was 125.6%, 69.8% and 88.1% of the domestic budget revenue originally approved by
          Parliament, respectively.

     27.	 There are technical and political reasons for the inaccurate revenue forecasts. Mineral prices had been
          consistently under-estimated during the global commodity boom over the past decade. In 2011 for example,
          total annual revenues were 25.6 percent higher in nominal terms, driven mainly by unexpected increase in
          receipts from royalties and dividends reflecting the inherent difficulty of making projections for such volatile
          mineral prices. The revenue projection function lies in the Tax Revenue Division of the MoF, and the MoF
          bases its projections from revenue estimates of line ministries (e.g., Ministry of Mining for mineral revenue
          projection), local governments, the General Department of Taxation, and the Customs Authority. There are
          inaccuracies in the source data from these agencies, but also weaknesses in the process of consolidation
          in MoF, and in the macroeconomic assumptions prepared by the Ministry of Economic Development that
          underpin additional forecasts.

     28.	 Political factors have played a bigger role since 2012 as the Government overestimated revenues despite
          the weakening minerals market. Overestimation of revenues came largely to meet increasing demands to
          finance its rapidly expanding capital expenditure plans (funded by the budget and extra-budgetary funds).
          The budgets were prepared with overly optimistic assumptions of GDP growth, inflation, import growth,
          privatization revenues, tax prepayments etc., which did not sufficiently take into account the vulnerable
          global economic environment with slowing growth in China (Mongolia’s main market for mineral exports)
          and weaker global commodity prices. As a result, mining sector receipts (CIT, dividends, VAT on imported
          equipment) had been much weaker than anticipated in 2012 and 2013.

PI-4 Stock and monitoring of expenditure payment arrears

(i) Stock of expenditure payment arrears

29.	 Arrears have not been an issue for recurrent spending as the MoF exercises strong control on the monthly
     allotment of the budget and payments through the GFMIS. The stock of payment arrears has however,
     increased for capital expenditures with the growth of government spending and the shortfall in government
     revenue collections as compared to the original budget. This problem was particularly evident in 2013 due
     to the revenue shortfall and the capital budget was significantly under-executed (65% actual spending as
     compared to the budget), in part due to the deferment of payment of 183 billion MNT to contractors. By
     contrast, capital arrears for 2012 were negligible.

30.	 As Table 11 details, the total stock of expenditure arrears at the end of 2013 was 3.9 percent of total
     expenditures, a significant increase from 0.001 percent in 2012. It therefore constitutes between 2-10%
     of total expenditures, and has not been reduced over the last two years, resulting in a score of C for this
     dimension.

(ii)	   Availability of data to monitor the stock of expenditure payment arrears

31.	 The reporting requirement for arrears varies for recurrent and capital expenditures. For the former, all
     budget entities are required to produce monthly reports on arrears to the Treasury Department. At the
     end of the fiscal year a consolidated report is produced by the Treasury Department with the data broken
     down by economic classification and the duration of the arrears (less than two months overdue, up to 4
     months, and more than 3 months). For the latter, the reporting is handled by the Fiscal Policy and Planning
     Department, with only the level of arrears calculated and no age profile information. The assessment team
     received copies of the 2012 and 2013 reports, which was used to prepare Table 11 above.

     PI-5	   Classification of the Budget

     i) The classification system used to formulate, execute and report on the central government budget.

     32.	 According to the IBL, budget planning, budget execution and budget reporting should be classified by:

         a) Budget level8;
         b) Budget governors9;
         c) Economic classification;
         d) Programs;
         e) Activities;
         f) Financing sources.

     33.	 For the last completed fiscal year (2013), budget planning (preparation) was classified by administrative,
          functional (10 functions as per the UN-supported Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG)),
          program, and economic classification (broadly compliant with Government Finance Statistics (GFS) 86).
          Budget execution and budget reporting however, were carried out only according to administrative and
          economic classification and based on a chart of accounts that is not fully consistent with GFS and is different
          from the classification used for budget preparation. The execution chart of accounts includes administrative
          and economic classification, but at a very detailed classification level so that the GFMIS system cannot be
          used to produce budget execution reports. As a result, the reports which are generated from the system
          need to be re-arranged using bridging tables to prepare monthly budget execution reports for the purposes
          of budget management. This manual data conversion results in additional work and potential data entry
          errors. There are procedures in place to ensure that the reports are generally accurate.

     34.	 The IMF and WB are currently assisting the Ministry of Finance to harmonize the chart of accounts so that
          budget planning, execution, and reporting can be based on the same standard.

     PI-7 Extent of unreported government operations

     (i) The level of extra-budgetary expenditure (other than donor funded projects) which is unreported i.e.
         not included in fiscal reports

     36.	 The scale of extra-budgetary financing of government capital expenditures has increased rapidly since 2012
          and consists primarily of capital projects financed by the DBM and quasi-fiscal operations of the Bank of
          Mongolia. This section analyzes only the extra-budgetary expenditures financed by the DBM for which
          accurate data is available, which are significant but underestimate the actual off-budget spending.

     37.	 The DBM, which is regulated by the Law on Development Bank of Mongolia, has been financing projects out
          of three sources: own capital, a US$ 580 million midterm euro bond, and a US$ 1.5 billion sovereign bond
          (the Chinggis bond), all of which are 100% guaranteed by the Government. In addition to these funding
          sources, the DBM issued a samurai bond with a 10 year maturity at 1.52% coupon rate in late 2013. The
          DBM loans are classified into two types of operations: (i) loans to be repaid by the state budget and (ii) loans
          that are supposed to be repaid by the revenue stream of projects that are financed by the DBM. Projects
          of the first type that are financed are regarded as “social projects” that include construction of roads,
          street renovation, power station and railway projects. These are government budget operations and are
          implemented by the responsible line ministries. DBM will almost certainly call the government guarantee
          when the debt repayments are due. Projects of the second type include loans that were issued mostly to
          private sector recipients including transportation, mining and housing construction sectors. These projects
          are deemed bankable by the government as recipients of these loans are supposed to be able to generate
          sufficient financial revenue streams.

     38.	 At the end of 2013, over 60 percent of total outstanding loans from the DBM were issued to social projects
          implemented by line ministries and constitute extra-budgetary funding of central government operations.
          These social projects amounted to 1.5 trillion MNT, or 8 percent of GDP and 28 percent of total central
          government expenditures (and 19.7 percent of general government expenditures) and were roughly
          equivalent to official budget capital expenditures. This capital expenditure financed by the DBM is not
          included in the medium-term fiscal framework, budget estimates or the in-year budget execution reports.
          As a 100 percent state-owned entity, and as required by its own law, the DBM does get its annual financial
          statements audited and consolidated at the end of the fiscal year together with the financial reports of
          other public enterprises, and these consolidated financial statements are then presented to parliament.

     (ii) Income/expenditure information on donor-financed projects which is included in fiscal reports

     39.	 The Government has comprehensive information on loan-financed projects and this information is included
          in the budget documentation; however, it has limited information on grant-financed projects and most of
          these projects are not included in fiscal reports.

40.	 Information about donor-funded projects is handled by two ministries: Ministry of Economic Development
     (MED) and Ministry of Finance (MoF). MED is mandated to sign and approve loans and grants; MoF is
     responsible for processing the expenditures of loans and grant funds, recording the information, and
     including the information in the budget. Recording of loan-funded projects is comprehensive, with income
     and expenditure information included in the annual budget and government financial statements, as
     required by the Law on Coordination and Management of Foreign Aid. Grants from larger donors such as
     WB, ADB, UN, USAID, JICA and KOICA are approved by the MED; however these grants are not recorded
     in the budget. The MED and MoF also have no information about the grants from other smaller bilateral
     agencies, international NGOs and religious organizations.

PI-8 Transparency of inter-governmental fiscal relations

41.	 Mongolia undertook major fiscal decentralization reforms under the IBL. The country has three levels of
     sub-national government — aimags (provincial level government) and the capital city (Ulaanbaatar) which
     has the status of a province, soums (or Districts in Ulaanbaatar) which are sub-units of aimags, and baghs
     which are sub-units of soums. Aimags and soums have democratically elected parliaments which approve
     their budgets. Expenditure functions, revenue sources, and inter-governmental transfers are specified by
     the IBL. The revenue sources of local governments are composed of own source revenue (see table 13 for
     more details) and inter-governmental transfers. Inter-governmental transfers are provided by the central
     government budget to local governments in order to finance base budget deficit, to support provision of
     necessary basic services (e.g., primary health and education), and to support local development.

     (i) Transparent and rules based systems in the horizontal allocation among sub-national governments
     of unconditional and conditional transfers from central government

     42.	 Article 56 of the IBL describes three types of inter-governmental transfers: i) state budget financial support
          to the local governments; ii) special purpose transfers to the local governments for functions that are
          delegated from the central government to local governments; and iii) state budget transfers to the Local
          Development Fund (LDF), which is an equalization block grant. Of these three types of transfers, the
          LDF transfers and special purpose transfers for education and health involved formula-based horizontal
          allocation mechanisms.

     43.	 State budget financial support is provided to cover the budget deficit of local governments arising from
          shortfalls in base revenues vis-à-vis base expenditures. Base revenues are defined as the tax and non-
          tax own-source revenues of local governments. Article 56.4 of the IBL stipulates that estimating base
          expenditure of each local government shall be decided based on a methodology determined by the central
          government. This methodology is defined by Government Resolution #30 of 2012, and specifies that base
          expenditures include fixed costs such as wage and social insurance bills, rent, and cost of electricity and
          heating, variable costs such as fuel, and certain capital expenditures. The MoF has discretion on how these
          costs are estimated and financial support cannot be considered formula based.

     44.	 Special purpose transfers to local governments provide earmarked transfer for specific central government
          services delegated to local governments. Article 61 specifies services to be financed by special purpose
          transfers as: (i) pre-school and general education services; (ii) cultural services; (iii) primary health care
          services; (iv) land relations and cadaster services; (v) child development and protection services; (vi) public
          fitness services. The aimag and soum governors prepare a proposal on the budget for each of the delegated
          services and submit the proposal to the local parliament of respective levels (the Citizen’s Representative
          Khural). Transfers to education and primary health services are the only special purpose transfers that are
          based on a formula. The education transfers are a function of number of students, and a unit cost per
          students which accounts for a variety of factors including the number of teachers per student and operating
          expenses. The health transfer formula is based on population and a financing tariff of health care centers,
          which is based on the age distribution of the population and other factors. A new updated formula for
          horizontal allocation of health transfers is currently being developed jointly by the MoF and the MoH, which
          is planned to be put into use in 2015.

45.	 The LDF transfers fund local investment projects and programs, identified through participatory procedures
     in consultation with citizens through a survey. The LDF vertical and horizontal transfer formula is as follows:

    •	 The vertical allocation is done into the General Local Development Fund (GLDF), an account within the
       Treasury Single Account, receives revenues from the common taxes specified by the IBL (Article 59) and
       additional sources, specifically: (i) 25 percent of VAT receipts, (ii) 5 percent of mineral royalty receipts,
       (iii) grants and donations from domestic NGOs and official foreign aid given for local development fund,
       (iv) surpluses of local government’s basic budget balance (i.e., the difference between base revenue and
       base expenditure) exceeding the size of base expenditures.
    •	 The revenues collected to the GLDF are then horizontally allocated between aimag and soum
       governments based on a formula. The Government Resolution #30 issued in September, 2012 approved
       the methodology to be used in “Transferring revenue from Local Development Single Fund (LDSF) to
       Local Development Funds (LDF)”. The formula consists of 4 variables with equal weights (25 percent):
       (i) the level of development of aimags as determined by an official Development Index; (ii) the size of
       population; (iii) population density, remoteness from Ulaanbaatar, and the size of aimag; and (iv) local
       tax effort based on four sub-indicators related to local revenue initiative. At least 60 percent of transfers
       allocated from the GLDF to aimags and the capital city should be allocated to lower level governments
       (soum and district level) based on a formula based on the abovementioned four criteria.
46.	 Table 14 shows the breakdown of all transfers to local governments for the three types of transfers for 2013.
     In 2013, total amount of transfers granted to local governments amounted to MNT 1.1 trillion. Of these,
     81.2 percent of the transfers are based on transparent and rule-based mechanism, which consists of the LDF
     transfer (16.7%), and special purpose transfers to education (57%) and health (7.5%).

(ii) Timeliness of reliable information to SN governments on their allocations from central government
for the coming year

47.	 Sub-national governments are classified as “budget governors” in the IBL (like line ministries and agencies)
     and follow the budget calendar specified under the law and as discussed in detail under PI-11. For 2013,
     the MoF issued the budget circular on July 9th, which included the ceilings for the LDF and special purpose
     transfers to local governments. These estimates were provided well in advance of the local governments’
     budget deliberations as the aimags submitted their budgets to their local councils (Citizens Representative
     Khurals) on November 25.

48.	 Local governments do have sufficient time to be informed on their allocations from central government
     for the coming year and to develop their annual budget proposal based on reliable information before
     the start of the budget process. During the Parliament discussion, horizontal allocation of special purpose
     transfers and LDF transfers are unlikely to be subject to significant changes as these transfers are based

                                                                                                                        35
Mongolia: Report on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)


         on pre-determined formula, unless the Parliament decides to adjust vertical allocation of these transfers.
         Financial support to local governments is subject to some changes during the Parliament discussion. In
         the 2013 budget discussion in parliament, the horizontal allocation of special purpose transfer was largely
         unchanged. Total size of LDF transfers was increased by 0.8 percent during the Parliament discussion and
         the increased LDF transfers were proportionally distributed across aimags. Financial support to cover the
         basic deficit of local governments was reduced by 2.1 percent along with reductions in base expenditures,
         and this reduction was unevenly distributed across aimags.

     (iii) Extent to which consolidated fiscal data (at least on revenue and expenditure) is collected and
     reported for general government according to sectoral allocations.

     49.	 Local budget revenue and expenditure data is collected and reported for general government on a monthly
          basis. The data on approved annual local budget, monthly plan and actual execution are consolidated
          according to the same format as the general government budget, which consists of administrative and
          economic classification (see the detailed discussion under PI-24). As stated under the 8.9.1 of the IBL, general
          budget governors (including aimag and the capital city governors) should submit monthly budget execution
          reports to the MoF by the sixth day of each month and the consolidated monthly budget execution report
          of the general government should be publicly released by the 15th day of each month. The IBL also stipulates
          that aimag and capital city governors submit their annual budget execution reports and financial statement
          by the 20th of April to the MoF. The actual dates for the 2013 budget year were as follows: the consolidated
          budget reports were prepared on a monthly and quarterly basis and were published on the MoF website
          (www.iltod.gov.mn) on the 8th of each month. The annual budget execution reports and financial statement
          were submitted on the 10th of April.

PI-9 Oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from other public sector entities

(i) Extent of central government monitoring of AGAs and PEs

50.	 The two autonomous agencies, the Human Development Fund and the Social Insurance Fund, are part
     of the general government budget. The IBL requires that these two funds should submit their monthly
     execution reports and annual budget execution reports as well as annual financial statements together with
     the state budget and the local government budget. The quarterly and annual execution reports and financial
     statements include the financial status of the two funds and outturns of revenues and expenditures, as part
     of the general government budget.

51.	 As for the public enterprises, the IBL and Law on Audit require fully (100 percent) state-owned enterprises,
     and enterprises fully owned by the local governments to have their audited financial statements consolidated
     into the annual Government financial statements, which is reviewed by the MoF and the Government, and
     then presented to parliament for discussion and approval. The 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements of
     the Government covered financial statements of 127 state-owned entities and 164 entities owned by local
     governments.

52.	 There is however, no regular monitoring of fiscal risks of state-owned enterprises by the MoF, and no overall
     fiscal risk assessment is produced based on these consolidated financial statements. There is currently on-
     going technical assistance from the WB and the IMF to build this capacity for fiscal risks assessments in MoF.

(ii) Extent of central government monitoring of sub-national governments’ fiscal position

53.	 Local governments’ fiscal position is regulated under chapter 9 of the IBL. Article 57 mandates that local
     governments cannot run a fiscal deficit (they can request financing from MoF to meet short-term revenue
     shortfalls) and are prohibited from incurring debts, or issuing guarantees. The notable exception to this rule
     is the Ulaanbaatar capital city which is allowed to finance investment projects by issuing debt in the capital
     markets, but under strict conditions specified in Article 62. These are that: the principle does not exceed the
     previous years “base revenue”; debt servicing does not exceed 15 percent of base revenue; there are strict
     limits on what can be used as collateral; the debt can only be issued with the explicit authorization of the
     MoF; and is publically disclosed.

54.	 The MoF strictly monitors sub-national governments’ fiscal position as part of the budget execution reports.
     The Ulaanbaatar city government should obtain permission from the MoF and needs to be approved by
     the national Parliament. To date no debt has been issued by the Ulaanbaatar capital city, and therefore the
     consolidated overview of the fiscal position consists of the consolidated budget exaction statements that
     are produced monthly, quarterly and annually. These budget execution reports cover both levels of local
     governments (aimags and soums).

     PI-10	 Public access to key fiscal information

     55.	 The disclosure of fiscal information is mandated by a number of laws and regulations. Fiscal transparency
          and participatory budgeting are key principles in the Budget Law (Articles 5 and 6) which requires the
          disclosure of information on the budget plan, execution, and reporting, and the use of citizen surveys for the
          participatory preparation of local government capital budgets. The Public Procurement Law of Mongolia
          similarly mandates the disclosure of procurement information. A law on information transparency and
          access to information (2011) defines obligations of the state with respect to transparency in three key areas:
          human resource management (e.g. the requiring the state to announce vacancies in an easily accessible
          manner); budgeting and accounting (e.g. guidelines and timelines for the publishing of the budget, financial
          reports, audits, etc.) and the procurement of goods and services (e.g. making bid invitations and documents
          available in an easily accessible manner, as well as providing information on the selection of the winning
          bidder). The law also defines what information the state can legitimately request from a citizen, and the
          rights of the individual in obtaining access to information, along with specific time periods within which the
          state must respond.

     56.	 As per the budget transparency criteria set by the International Budget Partnership (a non-governmental
          organization), the Government of Mongolia publishes 6 of 8 key budget documents: (i) the pre-budget
          statement; (ii) executive budget proposal; (iii) the approved budget; (iv) monthly budget execution reports;
          (v) end of fiscal year report; and (vi) report of the auditor general. The reports it does not produce or publish
          are the citizen’s budget (not produced) and the mid-year report (produced but not published). Mongolia’s
          score in the International Budget Partnership’s Open Budget Index (OBI) improved steadily from 18 in 2006
          to 60 in 2010, but has declined to 51 in the 2012 survey on account of less information being disclosed in
          the above 6 budget reports. This score is still higher than the average score of 43 for all the 100 countries
          surveyed.

          follows:

      June 20th, 2013
                                presented to Government (Cabinet). The date was respected.
                                The annual draft budget ceilings were discussed and approved by Government and approved
                                on June 26th, 2013

58.	 The calendar is enforced giving budget governors (the IBL’s terminology for ministries, departments,
     agencies, and local governments) about five (5) weeks to meaningfully complete their budget estimates
     (from July 9th through August 15th in 2013). It should be noted that six weeks are foreseen in the official
     calendar for preparing the estimates (July 5th through August 15th)

(ii) Guidance on the preparation of budget submissions

59.	 There is one circular prepared for both recurrent and capital budget, which includes expenditure ceilings
     approved by the Government (prior to the circular’s distribution to MDA), with separate ceilings for
     the capital and recurrent budget. The Ministry of Finance has the lead in this process but the Ministry
     of Economic Development participates in the elaboration of the guidelines for the capital budget. It is a
     clear and comprehensive document consistent with the MTFF which on paper provides sufficient guidance
     to budget governors. Budget governors however, do not use this guidance effectively and in general do
     not abide by the ceilings in preparing their budget estimates which reduces the utility of the ceilings in
     encouraging prioritization.
   	
(iii) Timely approval of the budget by the Legislature
	
60.	 For the last 3 budgets (2012, 2013 & 2014) the budget was approved by the State Great Khural (Legislature)
     before the beginning of the fiscal year. The exact dates are presented below.

     PI-12	 Multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting

     (i) Preparation of fiscal forecasts and multi-annual functional allocations

     61.	 The medium term fiscal framework (MTFF) is a legal requirement established by the FSL and the IBL. The
          former specifies the three fiscal rules that underpin the MTFF — a structural deficit (based on long term
          mineral prices) of less than 2 percent of GDP, limits to expenditure growth, and a debt ceiling of 40 percent
          of GDP. The latter specifies the process and calendar for the MTFF and its links to the annual budget. The
          MTFF is prepared (updated) annually on a rolling basis, and presented to Parliament for approval in April
          of the year (n) preceding the upcoming fiscal year (n+1). It includes detailed forecasts of fiscal aggregates
          (revenues and expenditures) on the basis of the main categories of economic classification for the years
          n+1, n+2 and n+3. It also includes detailed forecasts on the financing of the budget deficit.

     62.	 The MTFF in Mongolia however, is currently more of a routine documentary exercise that is not achieving
          its objective of providing a hard budget constraint. First, the coverage of the MTFF is limited and does not
          include off-budget expenditures. As elaborated in PI-7 one of the perverse effects of the FSL has been to
          encourage the significant growth of off-budget spending which is not subject to the limits of the MTFF.
          Second, the forecasting of the main fiscal aggregates is weak, in part due to the technical challenges of
          forecasting volatile mineral revenues, in part due to poor coordination between MoF and MED (which has
          responsibility for macroeconomic forecasting), and in part due to political pressure to increase expenditures.
          In particular, the parliament can, and does, increase the revenue forecasts in the MTFF through overly
          optimistic economic assumptions. Third, the links between subsequent MTFFs and between the MTFF and
          the annual budget are weak. As Table 18 shows, the second year of a particular MTFF is very different from
          the estimate used for the first year of a subsequent MTFF. Line ministries consistently ignore their ceilings
          in the preparation of their budget proposals for year n+1. It is not uncommon for the MTFF aggregates to
          be revised upwards during the annual parliamentary budget discussions to be in line with an expansionary
          budget.

     (ii) Scope and frequency of debt sustainability analyses

     63.	 During the three-year period 2011-2013, public (external and domestic) debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
          was carried out yearly by the IMF, using data provided by the authorities. The results of the exercises were
          accepted by the Government of Mongolia.

(iii) Existence of sectoral strategies with multi-annual determination of current expenditure and 	
      investment costs

64.	 The Government has a number of national and sectoral planning documents. The national planning
     documents include National Development Strategy (2007-2015) which sets priorities at a very high level
     of generalization; the Government Action Plan (2012-2016) which is formulated at the start of a new
     government’s term in office and which has a more detailed formulation of priorities; and the annual Socio-
     economic Guidelines which are meant to specify the priorities for the year. The IBL also mandates a rolling
     four year Public Investment Program (PIP), the project version of the action plan. Sector strategies have been
     prepared by the ministry of roads and transportation, the ministry of health and the ministry of education.
	
65.	 The national and sectoral strategies are not reconciled with the MTFF (or formulated within a realistic fiscal
     envelope) and generally do not have a reasonable costing of investments and recurrent expenditures. The
     2014 PIP prepared by MED listed over 12,000 projects at an estimated cost of 50 trillion MNT (or over 300
     percent of GDP), and was rejected by the cabinet. The Ministry of Roads and Transportation has prepared
     strategies for road, marine transport, and auto transport for 2011-2016 that have capital costs but not
     recurrent costs. Information on costing for these three areas is not detailed. The ministry of health has
     elaborated a strategic plan for 2012-2016 that is not costed (activities of the plan are costed every year).
     The ministry of education strategy includes an action plan where the cost of the activities (for each objective
     is costed). Aggregate cost figures are provided in the action plan without being broken down by year or by
     sub-activities.

(iv) Links between the investments budget and forward expenditure estimates

66.	 Budgeting for investment and recurrent expenditure are two separate processes with the former the
     responsibility of the MED and the latter the responsibility of the MoF. Recurrent cost estimates of capital
     projects are prepared only sporadically — there are some cases where a line ministry informally interacts
     with MoF to estimate and include recurrent cost implications of investments. In part due to this budgeting
     weakness, and in part a result of several years of underfunding maintenance, the state of disrepair of public
     infrastructure is considerable and noted in assessments by the infrastructure related ministries. The growth
     in nominal capital repair expenditures (twelve-fold increase since 2003), which includes both periodic
     maintenance and rehabilitation, has been significantly below the trend in the growth in new investments
     (thirty-five-fold increase), with the result that the ratio of capital repairs to new investment have, for the
     most part, been declining since 2007.

67.	 These actual budgeting practices are a significant departure from the IBL. The IBL requires a unified budget
     process under the authority of the MoF, albeit with a significant role for MED on the planning and appraisal
     of large projects (above 30 billion MNT), in recognition of the MoF’s lack of capacity to perform this planning
     function. The IBL also mandates that the future maintenance needs of new capital projects be explicitly
     included in the project proposals if they are to be considered for financing (Article 29). The MoF has also
     prepared draft guidelines on how calculate recurrent expenditures for different sectors.

Subsection 3.4: Predictability and Control in Budget Execution
PI-13 Transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities
i) Clarity and comprehensiveness of tax liabilities

68.	 The adoption of Corporate Income and Personal Income Tax Laws in 1991 and General Law of Taxation
     in 1993 laid the legal foundation for the establishment of a taxation system in Mongolia. Mongolia has
     currently 18 taxation laws (including General Law of Taxation) and there are 23 types of taxes and of which
     21 taxes are actually being collected. The 21 taxes are regulated by the 18 laws which include the Law on
     Customs Tariff and Duties that separately regulates customs tax. In addition to the 21 taxes, royalties are
     imposed on mining sector according to the Minerals Law.

69.	 The General Taxation Law lays out provisions on types of taxes, taxable incomes, principles on tax discounts
     and exemptions, taxpayer registration, rights and duties of taxpayers, procedures and requirements for
     tax administration and tax inspectors, and the processes for tax complaints and appeal mechanisms. The
     law also provides the structure and functions of the General Department of Taxation (GDT, the revenue
     authority). Individual laws on domestic taxes further specify tax bases, tax rates, tax liabilities, exemptions or
     deductions. The GDT collects domestic tax revenues except for customs tax through its vertically structured
     local and capital city tax offices. The Law on Customs Tariff and Duties provides separate regulation on
     declaration on customs duties, procedures, responsibilities of state customs inspector, as well as the
     establishment of Customs Authority (CA) of Mongolia. The CA collects customs tax revenues through border
     customs offices, capital city, airport and inland customs offices and transfers the revenue directly to the
     central treasury account at the MOF. The Tax Revenue Division at the MoF is responsible for formulating tax
     policies and making revenue forecasts while revenue collection is the responsibility of the GDT and the CA.

70.	 While Mongolia’s tax laws provide comprehensive provisions on tax liabilities and procedures, there are
     areas where the legal provisions are not clear. The definition of taxpayers and taxable income, for example
     the definition of foreign entities and taxable income for CIT, and definitions on asset classes and transactions
     in relation to property tax. Lack of detailed and clear definitions of tax bases are likely subject to the
     discretion of tax inspectors.

71.	 Mongolia’s tax system is based on self-assessment, which applies to Personal Income Tax, Corporate Income
     Tax, Value-added Tax (VAT), and other minor taxes. Given the self-assessment based system, problems with
     discretion relate largely to tax audits. As detailed in PI-14, about 25 percent of the annual audits conduced
     are based on ad hoc criteria where discretion is exercised by the tax authority. Discretionary audits, together
     with the weaknesses in the dispute resolution system discussed below, is a common complaint from the
     business community. Ad hoc audits to raise tax revenues were viewed to have increased in 2012 and 2013
     as the Government faced a revenue shortfall and pressured the revenue authority to raise collections.

(ii) Taxpayer access to information on tax liabilities and administrative procedures

72.	 Information with respect to all major tax legislation, related changes, decisions and procedure is publicly
     available on the websites of the tax authority (www.mta.mn), CA (www.ecustoms.mn) and the Ministry
     of Finance (www.mof.gov.mn) and is also distributed to the taxpayers through newspapers, and official
     government publications such as “State Information” brochure. The on-line information system of the
     GDT and CA websites provide comprehensive information on tax laws including customs regulations,
     mobile applications and on-line instruction on tax filing process. The CA does have integrated customs
     database which is linked not only to the border customs offices but also to the regional tax offices which
     delivers updated information on any changes to customs and tax regulations. The customs authority has
     introduced customs filing and declaration systems at the cross-border customs offices which simplified the
     time-consuming administrative process for customs declaration. In addition, other information needed by

                                                                                                                          45

         taxpayers including templates, forms and detailed procedures are also available on the website. However,
         taxpayer education through TV or radios is yet to be used broadly. Since the GDT has detailed information
         on taxpayer registration, the agency uses cell phone numbers and email addresses of taxpayers to disseminate
         new information on changes to tax legislation and to remind them about the legal deadline for paying and
         declaring their taxes. The tax authority also has taxpayer service desks in its headquarters and in the district
         tax offices, as well as hotline services.

     (iii) Existence and functioning of a tax appeals mechanism

     73.	 The tax complaint mechanism is specified in Article 19.3 of the General Taxation Law, and consists of two
          levels of Dispute Resolution Councils (DRCs). The first point of complaint is the DRC at the aimag level; if
          disputes are not resolved at this level then the taxpayer can take the case to the DRC at the GDT. If complaints
          are not resolved in the DRCs then the taxpayer has the option to take the case to the administrative courts.

     74.	 There are three main weaknesses in the regulatory framework for tax dispute resolution. First, the DRC is
          not an independent body but reports to the commissioner of the GDT, who has the authority to override
          the council’s decisions. Second, the membership of the council is heavily skewed to government officials.
          The GDT DRC is chaired by the Director General of the Fiscal Policy Department of the MoF, and includes
          representative from the Revenue Division of the MoF, the GDT, the Ministry of Justice, and one civil society
          organization to represent the citizen. It is unclear what criteria are used to select the CSO. Third, the experts
          in charge of making and presenting the case to the DRC are all officers from the GDT, which creates a conflict
          of interest.

     75.	 Given these weakness, the MoF, supported by the World Bank’s on-going TA project, has proposed
          amendments to the General Taxation Law to create an independent dispute resolution body that
          organizationally does not reside within the GDT. This amendment is currently under discussion.

PI-14 Effectiveness of measures of taxpayer registration and tax assessment

i) Controls in the taxpayer registration system

76.	 The MTA uses multiple registration systems for the different taxes, these systems are not well integrated
     either with each other or with other government systems, have problems of data quality, all of which reduce
     efficiency and transparency of tax administration.

77.	 There are separate taxpayer registration systems for the different taxes, and in the different tax offices (e.g.
     desktop systems in the local tax offices). Registries for land, individuals, and businesses are maintained
     by the General Department for State Registration (GDSR), and GDSR issues an identification number to
     businesses, which serves as their tax identification number (TIN). Individuals’ national identification number
     serves as their TIN. The tax databases interfaces with these different registries maintained in the GDSR, as
     well as other databases such as the vehicle registration database at the Ministry of Road and Transportation.
     The quality of the data in the tax registration systems however is poor, due to non-uniqueness of the TIN
     (e.g. a business can have multiple TINs), errors in the data in GDSR databases, weaknesses in the interfaces
     between the tax registration systems and these registries, and excessive use of manual data entry with weak
     controls.

78.	 The GDT is currently in the process of developing an integrated Tax Administration Information System (TAIS)
     that would combine core parts of the tax cycle (registration, returns processing, accounting, payments,
     refunds, collections, and compliance) for all taxes in a single database and with a new unique TIN. The TAIS is
     expected to go live in early 2015. A major effort is underway to clean the tax registration data as part of the
     data migration from these multiple databases to the single database in TAIS. The TAIS should significantly
     improve the controls in the taxpayer registration system.

ii) Effectiveness of penalties for non-compliance with registration and declaration obligations

79.	 Penalties for non-compliance with registration and tax declaration are specified in detail in the General
     Taxation Law (Articles 74 and 75). The administrative sanctions are set in terms of multiples of the monthly
     minimum wage (currently set at 280,000 togrogs). The schedule of fines is long, given the nature of the tax
     violation and the type of taxpayer. For example:

    •	 For non-registration by the specified deadline, the fines are the monthly minimum wage for individuals,
       and 2 to 3 times the minimum wage for a legal entity (e.g. businesses) depending on the size of the
       entity;
    •	 For non-filing of taxes by the deadline, the fines are between 2 and 3 times the monthly minimum wage
       for individuals (depending on the number of violations) and 3 to 4 times the minimum wage for legal
       entities.
80.	 There is also a schedule of fines for inaccurate tax declarations and fines for non-payment of arrears. The
     Tax Law (chapter 8) specifies the measures to be taken to collect arrears, as well as the penalties that can be
     imposed in case of non-payment of arrears, which include the imposition of a fine equivalent to 30 percent
     of the tax debt, and seizures of assets.

81.	 In summary, the administrative sanctions are clearly specified in the primary legislation but given that they
     are calibrated in terms of the minimum wage they are considered by the GDT to be too severe for individuals
     and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and insufficient to deter non-registration and non-filing by large
     enterprises.

Mongolia: Report on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)


     iii) Planning and monitoring of tax audit and fraud investigation programs

     82.	 In Mongolia personal income tax, corporate income tax, and value-added tax (VAT) are self-assessed by
          the taxpayers and therefore a well-functioning audit function is of very important for enforcing compliance
          in a transparent manner. The GDT’s audit function is specified in an administrative procedure, with the
          methodology for conducting audits determined by the Tax Audit Methodology Department of the GDT.
          Audits apply to all the self-assessed taxes and are conducted by the various district tax offices and the Large
          Taxpayer Unit based on this methodology. In total there are roughly 300 tax inspectors who are charged
          with conducting audits.

     83.	 The GDT conducts two types of audits: audits conducted based on an annual Audit Plan that uses a risk
          management system; and ad hoc audits based on complaints received from various parties (government
          organizations, citizens) as well as on GDT’s own initiative. The total number of audits conducted in the last
          4 years by each of these two types is given in Table 19.

     84.	 The risk management system that forms the basis of the annual audit plan uses tax data, administrative
          and financial data on taxpayers from other sources and a software program based on 120 parameters to
          determine the risk ratings of taxpayers, ranging from a “High” to a “Low”. High risk taxpayers are required to
          be audited once every two years, while low risk taxpayers are required to be audited once every five years,
          and the duration from the last audit forms one of the 120 criteria used in the risk management system.
          While the criteria for the risk-based audit are clear, problems in the quality of the taxpayer data identified
          above compromise the effectiveness of the audit, as does the limited number of tax inspectors to conduct
          the audit.

     85.	 The number of ad hoc audits has increased rapidly over the past two years, and in 2013 constituted 40%
          of all audits (Table 19), and these apply to all the self-assessed taxes. Interviews with the chambers of
          commerce suggested that this increase resulted from the revenue shortfalls of the past two years and the
          pressure to collect additional taxes to meet the monthly revenue collection targets from the MoF and GDT.
          These ad hoc tax audits have generated numerous complaints of harassment from the business community.

     86.	 Overall, therefore the coverage of the risk-based audits is only partial for the self-assessed taxes.

PI-15 Effectiveness in the collection of tax payments

i) Collection ratio for gross tax arrears

87.	Tax arrears are high, amounting to 570 billion togrogs in 2013, or approximately 10 percent of gross
    tax revenues (Table 20). Arrears are classified as two types: those that are based according to the self-
    assessment by the taxpayers (i.e. difference between the assessed tax liabilities and those that were actually
    paid) and those resulting from tax audits. GDT has debt collection targets of 90 percent for the self-assessed
    arrears, and 85 percent from the arrears from audits. The actual collections have been 70 percent over the
    past two years.

     PI-16	 Predictability in availability of funds for commitment of expenditures

     i) Degree to which cash-flow forecasts and monitoring are carried out

     90.	 The Treasury Department prepares a cash flow forecast at the beginning of the fiscal year. The forecast of
          revenue for the year is generally completed by February 1, and is based on historical revenue flows over
          the previous five years and data collected from revenue agencies. By early February, the annual forecast
          of expenditures is completed based on monthly budget allocations made by the Fiscal Policy and Planning
          Department and by fixed obligations such as debt service. Revenues are monitored on a daily basis through
          generation of a daily revenue statement, and forecasts for the remainder of the year are updated at least
          weekly and sometimes daily. Expenditures are reviewed monthly based on the execution reports, and
          forecasts are adjusted for succeeding months.

     91.	 The quality of these cash forecasts is generally poor. The quality of the revenue forecasts is compromised
          by missing data from certain agencies (especially the General Department of Taxation, the Customs
          Administration, and the Oil and Petroleum Agency) because of difficulties in consolidating information
          from remote offices across the country. The quality of the expenditure forecasts is also poor because they

                                             Mongolia: Report on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)


   are based on historical approved monthly budget allocations, which are frequently revised based on cash
   availability and requests for the line ministries, as discussed below. Capital expenditures are particularly
   volatile because they bear the brunt of the expenditure cuts and therefore the historical data cannot do not
   accurately estimate the cash needs of spending agencies.

ii) Reliability and time horizon of the information on maximum limits and payment commitments 	
    provided to the MDA during the year

92.	 The IBL requires that Parliament adopt the next year’s budget by November 15th. After the budget’s
     adoption, the Ministry of Finance sends letters to budget governors (MDAs) notifying them of their total
     budgeted expenditures and requesting preferred monthly budget expenditure allocations by December
     15th. The Ministry reviews requests, clarifies them with MDAs by December 20th and issues monthly
     budget expenditure allocations by February 1. Monthly allocations are broken down by use (salaries and
     wages, supplies, investment projects) and are cumulative; allocations that are not used in one month in
     theory carry over to the next.

93.	 MDAs can request changes to their monthly budget allocations over the course of the year (for example,
     to accelerate an expenditure or change uses within a monthly allocation), and receive two weeks’ notice
     of any requested changes that have been granted. Five or six times each year, the Ministry of Finance
     makes changes in monthly allocations for the balance of the year based on updated revenue collection and
     forecasts. Decisions regarding the changes, including amounts and uses, are made within the Ministry and
     communicated to MDAs with two weeks’ notice prior to the start of a month. Procedures for allocation and
     reallocation are laid out in the IBL and implementing regulations.

94.	 Even if budget allocations have not been changed, the Ministry often uses non-transparent cash control
     mechanisms at the end of the year (such as delaying printing of checks) in response to cash flow deficit
     problems. No limits are placed on commitments. Commitments are not recorded in GFMIS.

iii) Frequency and transparency of adjustments to budgetary allocations at a level higher than MDA 	
     administrations.

95.	Parliament amends the annual budget once or twice a year, based on updated revenue collections
    and expenditures. Amendments are undertaken pursuant to the rules set out in the Integrated Budget
    Law (Articles 34 and 42) as detailed in PI-27, and these rules are respected, but no adjustment
    mechanism exists that relates adjustment to the budget priorities in a systematic and transparent
    manner. There is also no predictable timing for these supplementary budgets, and often they are
    delayed resulting in the need for in-year monthly expenditure limits by the MoF. The 2013 budget
    amendment, which cut revenues and expenditures by 13 percent and 11 percent respectively, was
    only approved in end October (Table 21).

     PI-17. Recording of management of cash balances, debt and guarantees

     i) Quality of debt data recording and reporting

     96.	 Most debt data are recorded in the Ministry of Finance’s Debt Management Division (DMD), and debt
          data cover both external and domestic debt. MED enters into concessional loans, but control and record
          of disbursements and repayment are the responsibility of MoF. However, DMD does not record any
          guaranteed debt, including the 2012 and 2013 government-guaranteed debt issues of the Development
          Bank of Mongolia. DMD did not record debt notes that were issued to contractors at the end of 2013 to pay
          invoices for which there was not enough spending authority.

     97.	 DMD’s debt database uses UNCTAD’s DMFAS 6.0 to record most external (i.e. excluding government
          guaranteed) and some domestic debt. Domestic debt auctioned weekly by MongolBank (the central bank)
          since December 2012 is maintained in an Excel spreadsheet rather than in DMFAS. Data on the recorded
          external and domestic debt were complete and accurate as of yearend 2013. Due to some technical bugs in
          the system, DMFA has not been used to record domestic debt in 2014.

     98.	 Debt repayment and disbursement data are updated on a monthly basis and reconciled semi-annually against
          creditor statements. Before 2012, there were many differences between creditor and DMD outstanding
          balances, but DMD balances were adjusted by the beginning of 2013. DMD issues monthly internal reports
          on debt payments and disbursements, quarterly public debt bulletins and an annual debt report. Reports
          were formerly posted on MoF’s website, but none have been posted since transition to a new website.

ii) Degree of consolidation of the government’s cash balance

99.	 The Treasury Department has been using a Treasury Single Account (TSA) for eight years. The TSA’s coverage
     is quite comprehensive and encompasses the cash holdings/balances of budgetary central government and
     local governments. Excluded, either fully or partially, are the extra-budgetary funds (DBM, HDF, and SIF), the
     Fiscal Stability Fund, credits at commercial banks, and donor funded project accounts.

100.	 The TSA is kept in the central bank. Various revenue-collecting agencies (customs, tax, registration) maintain
      collection accounts with commercial banks, but these accounts are swept daily to show zero balances and
      commercial banks submit reports on this activity to MongolBank. Cash balances in most accounts are
      calculated and consolidated daily.

iii) Systems for contracting loans and issuance of guarantees

101.	 Debt is incurred and guarantees issued according to the provisions of the Integrated Budget Law and specific
      authorization by Parliament. The Securities Market Law (effective 1/1/2014) contains provisions related to
      the issuance of government debt, but these provisions have not yet been enforced and may be superseded
      by a proposed Debt Management Law. MoF and MED incur debt (issue securities and contract loans) on
      behalf of the government, but only MoF guarantees the issuance of debt by other governmental agencies
      such as the Development Bank of Mongolia. Decisions concerning the incurrence of debt are taken on an
      ad hoc basis, particularly by MED, without clear guidelines and transparent criteria and without regard to
      fiscal targets or medium-term debt management strategies.

     102.	 Personnel records of government employees are separately maintained in each of the more than 5000
           budgetary organizations (MDAs, schools, hospitals, primary health centres, etc.) in Mongolia. Payroll
           is similarly decentralized. Each of these budgetary organizations has an administration and accounting
           department (or two separate departments in the larger organizations) that maintains the organization’s
           accounts and personnel records, and which prepares the monthly payroll. Each budgetary organization is
           in charge of collecting and managing this information.

     103.	 The lack of central control or oversight compromises the degree of reconciliation between personnel records
           and payroll data. The MoF exercise control only at the aggregate level for each budgetary organization. The
           monthly payroll has to be within the monthly budget allocations for the budget organization; the treasury
           system will not make payments if the payroll exceeds these ceilings. However, these ceilings are prepared
           on the basis of budgeted positions at the beginning of the fiscal year and are only updated annually with
           the budget. The ceilings are not adjusted to take into account staff changes during the course of the year
           (e.g. vacancies, retirements, new recruitments) with the result that there can be, and often is, a mismatch
           in the aggregate wage bill being transferred from the TSA into the accounts of the budget organizations
           for onward payment (in the case of lower level budgetary organizations like schools and primary health
           centres; for MDAs the transfers take place directly from the TSA into the individual bank accounts of staff)
           and the actual number of staff working in the organization, and/or a mismatch between the authorized
           positions against which the budget is allocated and the actual staff filling those positions (i.e. in terms of
           staff qualifications and rank). Some preliminary research by the Ministry of Education, which is currently
           developing a human resource management information system, has revealed a problem of ghost teachers.

     104.	 Each budgetary organization sends its personnel records once a year to the separate oversight agencies,
           namely the MoF, the Civil Service Council, and the Ministry of Social Welfare. There are significant
           differences in the personnel data in these three organizations, which is symptomatic of the weaknesses in
           the payroll controls described above. There is no follow up and the data is not checked.

(ii) Timeliness in the introduction of changes to the personnel records and payroll

105.	 The changes to personnel records and the payroll are at the discretion of each budgetary organization.
      In ministries and central agencies these changes take place frequently and the payroll is reconciled with
      the personnel records, particularly given that payments are made directly into the bank accounts of the
      employees. However, in the lower level budgetary organizations like schools and primary health centres
      — which employ the majority of Mongolia’s civil servants — there are few checks and controls to ensure
      consistency (apart from aggregate spending limits). The personnel records are only updated annually at
      the central government level when the budgetary organizations report to MoF, CSC, and MoSWL, but the
      data is of poor quality as noted above.
  	
(iii) Internal control over changes to personnel records and payrolls data

106.	 The authority and basis for changes to personnel records and the payroll are clear. Any amendment to
      the personnel record is carried out by the authorized person in the administration department of the
      budgetary organization and changes in the payroll database by the authorized person of the accounting
      department of the organization.
 	
(iv) Existence of payroll audits to check for oversight errors and/or ghost workers

107.	 No comprehensive (covering all central government entities) payroll audit has been conducted in the
      last three years. Instead partial audits and staff surveys were undertaken. Every year when the Mongolia
      National Audit Office carries out the audit of the financial statements, payroll is implicitly and partially
      looked at. This is also the case for the various audits that are carried out yearly (35 in 2012) at the level
      of the entities of central government. Moreover the Social Insurance Authority, an agency under the
      Ministry of Social Welfare undertakes systematically partial random staff surveys at various institutions
      of central government (and schools and hospitals) to ensure the status of the individuals being paid and
      whether or not social insurance is being honored. The tax office carries out the same kind of random
      surveys but this is less systematic than the Social Insurance Authority.

(ii) Use of competitive procurement methods
	
109.	 Conditions and thresholds for the use of methods other than open competition are clearly stipulated in
      the PPLM and in the regulations. Even under limited bidding the procuring entity is required to advertise
      the opportunity in the event other qualified bidders not known to the procuring entity are interested. In
      the case of direct contracting, the procuring entity is required to deposit a copy of the contract and the
      justification with the LPPPD/MOF whose inspectors are required to audit such contracts ex-post. However
      reliable data on the value of such contracts which are legally justified is not available. Furthermore there
      are no established procedures for procurement of social projects that are financed by loans from DBM
      (i.e. those executed by ministries, as elaborated under PI-7). The majority of these projects were done
      through direct contracting, with no justification or public disclosure of the procurement method used. The
      magnitude of the procurement financed by loans from the DBM is roughly equivalent to that financed from
      the budget.

(iii) Public access to complete, reliable and timely procurement information

      1. Procurement plans: YES for budget funded procurement, and NO for DBM funded.
      2. Bidding opportunities: YES for budget funded procurement, and NO for DBM funded.
      3. Award of contract: YES for both budget and DBM funded procurement
      4. Resolution of procurement complaints: NO. Data on resolution of complaints is not made available to
     the public.

110.	 Procurement plans, bidding opportunities and award of contracts are published for contracts under funded
      under the Government budget, which account for 50% of central government procurement by value, the
      rest being financed by the DBM. According to the LPPPD/MOF contracts awarded under the state budget
      in 2013 using the PPLM amounted to MNT 1,089,677 million. According to the 2013 Audit Report of DBM,
      loans amounting to MNT 1,018,242 million approx. were granted in 2013 for projects to be repaid from the
      state budget.

(iv) Existence of an adequate administrative procurement complaints system

111.	 Complaints sent to the LPPPD/MOF are handled by government officials. Similarly complaints on anti-
      competition provisions in bidding documents referred to the Chairman of the AFCCP are handled by
      inspectors who are government officials.

     PI-20	 Effectiveness of internal controls on non-salary expenditure

     (i) Effectiveness of expenditure commitment controls
     	
     112.	 There is no formal system of commitment controls and commitments are not recorded in the GFMIS.
           Instead, the budget is executed based on a monthly budget allotment schedule that establishes
           expenditure limits, which is revised and adjusted every month. Budget entities cannot make payments
           above the expenditure limits programmed for the month. For the capital budget, contracts cannot be
           signed for works, equipment, and services above the amount that is authorized in the budget.
     	
     (ii)	      Scope, relevance and understanding of other internal control regulations and procedures

      113.	 The Budget Law (2011) includes various provisions on internal control regulations and procedures
            (Articles 35 to 47). These internal control regulations and procedures are comprehensive and they are
            enforced. They cover the organization of the budget and the oversight of budget implementation, the
            coverage of the TSA, the issuance of authorization to finance and spend to budget entities' accounts
            (based on the monthly budget allotment schedule), the process of daily transactions of budget revenues
            and expenditures, the order for budget expenditure payment, the processing and control of budget

       transactions, and recording activities. These internal control rules and procedures are well understood
       and implemented.

114.	 For capital projects rules and procedures are often excessive leading to unnecessary delays (for example,
      payments to suppliers require up to 11 signatures depending on the case). In particular, every payment
      for each project needs to be first authorized by the Fiscal Policy Department (MoF) before the payment
      can be made by the Treasury Department. Given that there are annually well over a thousand projects,
      each with between one and twelve payments annually (depending on the size of the project), and limited
      numbers of staff in MoF, this duplication of procedures results in unnecessary delays in payments.

(iii) Degree of compliance with regulations on the processing and registration of transactions

115.	 The degree of compliance with rules for processing and recording transactions is high. Treasury has
      indicated that at the level of their institution the processing of payment documentation has a relatively
      low rejection rate (5%). Comparable rejection rates are to be found for other transactions. Simplified
      procedures are not contemplated in the law. In addition no misuse of emergency procedures has been
      identified.

PI-21 Effectiveness of internal audit

116.	 The IBL created the legal framework for establishing an internal audit function in public sector entities in
      Mongolia. This new internal audit function, created in 2012, supplements the Monitoring and Evaluation
      (M&E) function that was created in 2004 and has been functional since 2006. Many of the new internal
      auditors have moved over from the M&E function and some continue to perform both functions.

117.	 By March 2014, an internal audit function had been established in all line ministries and 46 ministries and
      agencies in total. Additionally, an internal audit committee had been established at each line ministry.

118.	 The Ministry of Finance is legally responsible for providing methodologies and guidelines for the public


                                                                                                                     59

            internal auditor. This function, as well as the execution of internal audits of MOF, is executed by the
            Internal Auditing, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IAMED) which reports to Budget Control and Risk
            Management Department (BCRMD) of the Ministry of Finance. The Internal Audit Charter establishes
            that internal audit units in ministries and agencies will report to the Budget Governor of the institution or
            the Internal Audit Committee, if there is one. Thus, the internal audit function was established conscious
            of the principle of independence.

     119.	 The Ministry of Finance represents Mongolia as a corporate member of the International Internal Audit
           Associations (IIA). An Internal Audit Charter and Medium-term Strategy have been approved by the
           Government.

     (i) Coverage and quality of the internal audit function

     120.	 Throughout 2013, a total of 144 internal audits were conducted by the internal audit units; 61 for the
           line ministries and 83 for their agencies. More than 50% of these audits were reported as systemic audits
           with preliminary agreed plans, thus more than 72 audits were systemic audits which were conducted
           based on the guidelines with systemic approaches to review and improve the effectiveness of public
           sector entity risk management and control processes. The remaining percentage of internal audit work
           involved specific purpose reviews. It is the clear intention of internal audit management to avoid pre-
           control activities.

     121.	 MOF internal auditors have provided on-site training during internal audits carried out at the line
           ministries and jointly conducted internal audits at the Custom Authority and Tax Authority. Thus, MOF
           internal auditors were involved in 32 internal audit engagements for the line ministries and 33 for the
           government agencies, namely in the areas of tax and customs administration.

     122.	 While Mongolia’s auditing standards comply with international standards a consistent understanding and
           application of these standards and audit guidelines across the many new public sector internal audit units
           and individual internal auditors is still lacking. The International Standards for the Professional Practice of
           Internal Auditing (IIA standards) were fully translated into the Mongolian language. Public sector internal
           audit guidelines that comply with the IIA standards were published and distributed to public sector
           internal auditors. A number of internal audit training workshops were subsequently delivered based on
           these documents. However, a number of the mandatory IIA standards have not been fully met at this
           early stage in the establishment of public sector internal audit. These include:

                1110 Organization Independence, in respect to the relationship between IAMED and BCRMD,
                1130 Impairment to Independence or Objectivity, in respect to resource limitations, such as funding,
                1210 Proficiency, in respect to the demonstration of competencies through professional certifications
                such as the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA)
                1310/1311 Quality Assurance and Internal Assessments, in respect to the ongoing monitoring of IA
                performance and periodic self-assessments
                2030 Resource Management, in respect to appropriate and sufficient resources
                2050 Coordination, in respect to not distributing audit reports to the SAI
                2120.C3 Risk Management, in respect to the relationship with BCRMD
                2430 Conformance with International Standards, in respect to the lack of quality assurance
                assessments to confirm conformance
                2500 Monitoring Progress, in respect to the lack of a monitoring system established by the Chief
                Audit Executive to monitor and ensure that actions have been effectively implemented.

     123.	 Public sector internal auditing however is still relatively in its infancy in Mongolia. Much remains to be
           done to ensure that the function continues to grow and obtains a reputation for delivering consistently

60
                                                  Mongolia: Report on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)


      high auditing and advisory services, government-wide, to officials responsible for government programs
      and are reflected in more effective, efficient and economic services delivered to the public. More auditors
      need to be trained to achieve better audit coverage and high quality audits. A significant percentage
      of internal auditors and audit reports are in just three ministries. Many other internal audit units are
      recently established and therefore have only one or two auditors. Steps need to be taken to be able to
      confirm that internal audit is in compliance with international standards.

(ii) Frequency and distribution of reports

124.	 Internal audit reports were issued for the 72 systemic internal audit engagements mentioned above,
      and limited reports were issued for specific purpose audits. All reports are distributed to the respective
      Internal Audit Committee and audited entities/departments but only some of them are submitted to
      MOF. During 2013, the MOF collected 14 internal audit reports prepared by line ministries’ internal audit
      units and 32 from government agencies. Upon the receipts of the reports, the MOF has often taken the
      reports as experience sharing examples; however, there have not been consistent review procedures
      implemented. Internal audit reports are also not distributed to the Mongolia National Audit Office
      (MNAO, Mongolia’s supreme audit institution) upon their completion. MNAO auditors however obtain
      and review the internal audit reports at the planning stage of their annual audits.

(iii) Extent of management response to internal audit findings

125.	 Public entities maintain their own “non-obligatory” databases for their internal audit engagements that
      allow the entity to facilitate tracking IA findings, do follow-up, calculate implementation percentages,
      and prepare action plans. The quality of actions, however are not well analyzed. On average it takes four
      months for the ministries to take action on the audit findings after the delivery of the reports. Therefore,
      follow-up mechanisms for audit findings and recommendations are still not well systematized with
      appropriate templates that enable monitoring the quality and responsiveness of implementation actions.

     Subsection 3.5: Accounting, recording and reporting

     PI-22	 Timeliness and regularity of accounts reconciliation

     127.	 As noted under PI 17, the TSA, maintained in the central bank, is used for almost all budgetary transactions,
           with the separate accounts of the various revenue-collecting agencies (customs, tax, registration) maintain
           collection accounts swept daily to show zero balances with commercial banks submit reporting on this
           activity to central bank. The GFMIS is used to process, record and report transactions. All transactions paid
           through the TSA are recorded separately for each entity against the approved economic classifications for
           the purpose of monitoring budget execution.

     128.	 Mongolia has been working towards implementing accrual based IPSAS. In addition to recording cash
           payments in GFMIS, all entities record their cash and non-cash transactions on an accrual basis in locally
           procured accounting software packages such as ACULOUS and others for financial reporting purposes that
           are not integrated with GFMIS. Advance accounts for travel, to contractors and other similar advances
           are therefore recorded and controlled in the entity accounting and financial reporting systems. MOF
           consolidates the Government financial statements twice yearly through a consolidation software package
           called PLASTIC. MOF therefore has no drill-down capability into entities’ balance sheet accounts.

     i) Regularity of bank account reconciliations

     129.	 Confirmation of the consolidated balance of the TSA is done daily between the Bank of Mongolia and
           the Treasury Department on the next working day. For the accounts maintained outside of the TSA
           in commercial banks by the revenue generating agencies on their activities the account balances are
           zeroed and cleared on a daily basis to the state revenue account in the TSA held in the central bank. Cash
           transactions that do not clear are returned to the sender’s bank but are tightly controlled by Treasury.

     (ii)	   Regularity of reconciliation and clearance of suspense accounts and advances
     	
     130.	 MOF has a policy of not allowing suspense accounts and reviews budget entities’ chart of accounts
           to enforce this policy. Unexplained or unusual transactions are therefore persistently cleared and not
           accumulated in suspense accounts. For cash receipts, unidentified cash is returned to the remittent bank
           and closely controlled. MNAO confirmed the effective application of this policy.

     131.	 Advance accounts are used to record advances for travel, mobilization advances to contractors as required
           by contract, and for other similar purposes. These advances are to be documented and eliminated a
           reasonable time after travel or as stipulated by contract. During the semi-annual consolidation process,
           account analysis is done of advance accounts to ensure compliance with policy and contract requirements.
           A low level of advances, typically around 2% of total asset, is carried on the Balance Sheet at year-end.
           The audit review of advance accounts transactions and balances helps to ensure the proper enforcement
           of Government advance policy and contract advance clauses.

     132.	 Additionally, budget entities are able to track transactions and balances accurateness through an online
           portal and confirm GFMIS budget execution report accuracy versus the entity’s own records. These
           reconciliations are required to be done monthly within 4 working days of the GFMIS monthly closing.
           While GFMIS is not integrated with financial reporting packages that control advance accounts, this
           monthly reconciliation process helps to maintain the integrity and reliability of budget entity financial
           information and detect errors on a timely basis.

                                      reasonable.

PI-23	 Availability of information on resources received by service delivery units

i) Compilation and processing of information to show the resources effectively received (in money or
   in kind) by the majority of front-line service delivery units (with particular focus on primary schools
   and primary health care clinics) in relation to the resources made available by the relevant sector
   or sectors, regardless of the level of government responsible for the functioning and funding of
   these units.

133.	 In Mongolia, primary service delivery units like elementary schools and primary health care clinics are
      independent budget entities (Direct Budget Governors, as per the terminology in the Budget Law) with
      an annual budget allocation and a monthly budget allotment that determines how much they can spend
      per month. As per the Budget Law (Articles 58 and 61), basic education and health are functions that are
      delegated from the central government to sub-national governments, which implies that the budgeting for
      service delivery units is a dual responsibility of the central and sub-national governments. The budgeting
      process works as follows: The Ministries of Education and Health prepare the annual budgets based on,
      for the most part, capitation financing formulae that determines the allocation for each service-delivery
      unit based on school enrollment and population coverage. These budgets are then aggregated up to the
      aimag level, and the aimag governor is then given authority to distribute this aggregate budget between
      the soums and front-line service delivery units to take into account particular local needs. The annual
      budget, approved by the parliament on November 15th of each year then authorizes this allocation.

134.	 Once the budget is approved and the monthly allotment determined by the MoF, the budget is entered
      into the GFMIS (the Treasury system). Each school and primary health centre has an administrative code in
      the GFMIS and, as Direct Budget Governors, school principals and primary clinic directors are authorized
      to spend the budget allocated as per the Government rules and regulations (in other words, just like any
      other spending entity). Every month the accounting departments of these schools and clinics prepare
      bills that are submitted to the local Treasury offices which are checked for compliance following which
      the requisite payments are made from the Treasury Single Account. There is no involvement of the sub-
      national governments in these payments, and no separate sub-national accounts into which funds may
      be transferred.

                                                                                                                     63

     135.	 There are some small delays in the budget allotment and in the payments from the TSA to the service
           delivery units. While the annual budget is approved by November 15th of each year, the monthly allotment
           (laying out the monthly schedule of the budget) is usually not approved until the end of January. It usually
           takes on average between 10 days and two weeks after the submission of the monthly invoice for the
           Treasury to make payments to the school and health center accounts (schools and health facilities are
           akin to vendors) for onward payment of salaries and other expenses.

     136.	 Data on budget allotments and execution are prepared on a monthly basis (as per the Government’s
           regular reporting requirements) by the front-line delivery units and are sent to the aimag and to the
           respective ministries. These are then consolidated into monthly budget execution reports by the MoF.
           These reports reveal that front-line service delivery units spend most of their budgets. The Treasury
           department can also query the GFMIS to generate real-time reports on budget execution for the service
           delivery units.

     137.	 There are no significant in-kind transfers from the central government and the service delivery unit
           budgets, described above, provide a comprehensive picture of the resources available to these units.

     PI-24	 Quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports

     (i) Scope of the reports in terms of coverage and compatibility with budget estimates
     	
     138.	 In-year budget execution reports are legal requirements (Budget Law, 2011, Art. 54.5). Budget execution
           reports are prepared on a monthly and quarterly basis and show actual expenditures and revenues
           compared with the approved budget. These reports follow the budget classification and consist of
           administrative and economic classification and are based on payments but not on commitments. The
           reports are produced by the budget entities using a locally developed accounting software (Accolous)
           that is maintained in desktop systems in each of the budget entities. The data is reconciled monthly with
           the Government’s Treasury system (GFMIS).

     139.	 This manual reporting leads to task duplication and inefficiencies. Ideally the GFMIS should be used
           to automatically generate execution reports but this is not being done because of the inconsistencies
           between the CoA used for the budget and for treasury discussed earlier. The flash reports that are
           generated with the GFMIS (Crystal reports) are at a very detailed level of classification and cannot be
           used for reporting on budget execution.

(ii) Timeliness of report presentation

140.	 In-year budget reports are prepared on a monthly and quarterly basis and are issued within ten days after
      the end of the month and within two weeks after the end of the quarter respectively. The reports for
      FY2013 are available on the MoF website with their issuance dates.

(iii) Quality of information

141.	 The manual data entry and use of desktop based accounting software, and the different reporting
      structures of the GFMIS and the budget can result in errors in the budget execution reports. Due to the
      monthly reconciliation with the GFMIS the magnitude of these errors are considered to be small by the
      Treasury Department but are not fully known nor stated in the reports. These problems however, do
      not compromise the overall usefulness of the reports which are used by the MoF to track revenues and
      expenditures, revise the monthly budget allotments and to prepare supplementary budget proposals for
      parliamentary approval.

PI-25	 Quality and timeliness of annual financial statements

142.	 The IBL (Article 26) requires budget entities in Mongolia to prepare financial statements on the full accrual
      basis of accounting. The Accounting Law of Mongolia (Article 10) also mandates that all budget entities
      shall prepare their financial statements in line with International Public Sector Accounting Standards
      (IPSAS). The Government has adopted the 2003 version of IPSAS and has initiated a process of adopting
      IPSAS (accruals).

143.	 Both MOF and MonICPA, the Mongolia Institute of Certified Public Accountants, support the wide
      adoption of IPSAS within the Mongolian public sector through participating in translation, development
      of a manual based on IPSAS and conducting training for public sector accountants. MOF, with the support
      of MonICPA, completed translation of the most recent suite of IPSAS in 2012. The Ministry of Finance and


                                                                                                                      65
Mongolia: Report on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)


           the Mongolian Institute cooperate to provide public sector entities with the current IPSASB handbook of
           pronouncements.

     144.	 Despite a supportive legal framework and the activities noted above, implementation of accrual
           accounting in the public sector is not yet complete. Not all IPSAS standards have been issued and some of
           those that have been issued only partially comply with the IPSAS accrual standards. There is no progress
           report showing the level of IPSAS implementation.

     145.	 PI-25 dimensions (i) and (ii) were assessed based on the last financial statement submitted for audit,
           which was 2012. Dimension (iii) was assessed on the last three years’ financial statements for the periods
           ending December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

     (i) Comprehensiveness of financial statements

     146.	 Consolidated financial statements for the Government of Mongolia are prepared two times each year.
           The consolidated financial statements include both central and subnational entities. The consolidation
           includes wholly-owned entities and those in which the government’s participation in ownership is 90%
           or greater, as well as project/programs and funds implemented/managed by Government ministries and
           agencies. As such, the 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Government covered the financial
           statements of 127 state-owned entities, 164 entities owned by local governments, and 93 projects and
           funds. Both DBM and the State Bank are included in the consolidation. However, some of the largest
           SOE’s in which the government’s ownership is less than 90% are not included in the financial statements
           as required by IPSAS.

     147.	 The accounting framework for presentation of the financial statements is accrual based IPSAS, as
           required by law. The financial statements therefore present information on revenues, expenditures,
           assets, liabilities and equity accounts. The information on assets includes cash, short-term investments,
           receivables, advances, inventory, reserves, long-term assets and other fixed assets. Liabilities include
           short-term liabilities, securities, loans, payables, unearned revenues, long-term securities and long-term
           loans. The net assets consist of government contributions.

     148.	 Pension liabilities are not accrued on an actuarial basis as required by IPSAS. These liabilities can be
           material to the financial statements taken as a whole. In many countries this is the largest liability on the
           financial statements. The actuarial liability has not been calculated in Mongolia.

     (ii) Timeliness in the presentation of financial statements

     149.	 Consolidated financial statements are prepared two times per year. The annual consolidated financial
           statements are required to be submitted to the MNAO for audit by May 10th of the year following the
           end of the financial statement reporting period (December 31). The consolidated financial statements for
           the year-ended December 31, 2012 were submitted to MNAO on May 10, 2013.

     (iii) Accounting standards used

     150.	 The Government has been engaged in a gradual process since 2003 of implementing accrual based IPSAS,
           as required by law, but the standards are not yet fully implemented. The financial statements for 2010,
           2011 and 2012 have been prepared in a consistent format.

Subsection 3.6: External Scrutiny and Audit

PI-26 Scope, nature and follow-up of external audit

151.	 The Mongolian Law on State Audit of 2003, with the latest amendments made in 2013, establishes the
      Mongolian National Audit Office (MNAO) as the country’s Supreme Audit Institution (SAI). As such, MNAO
      is mandated to perform audits of activities of state entities, except for the Parliament, irrespective of the
      source of their funding. Only the financial statement audit of the Parliament is conducted and an audit of
      its other activities may be carried out by MNAO, if the Parliament requests so. In parallel, the IBL requires
      state entities at the various levels of budget holders to have their financial statements audited annually
      within the timeframe specified in the law.

152.	 MNAO has auditors in its Financial Audit Department who conduct audits of portfolio ministers’ financial
      statements and the consolidated year-end financial statements of the Government. When deemed
      appropriate, MNAO outsources state entities’ audits to private audit firms while maintaining the quality
      assurance function for those outsourced audits.

153.	 MNAO is a member of INTOSAI (International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions) and ASOSAI
      (Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions). MNAO auditors follow the International Standards on
      Auditing (ISAs) as promulgated by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the
      International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) when conducting audits of state entities. The International
      Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) have not yet been translated into Mongolian.

154.	 All three dimensions of the external audit function were assessed based on the last fiscal year audited,
      which was 2012.

(i) Scope/nature of the audit carried out (including compliance with auditing standards)

155.	 As the external auditor of the government, MNAO conducts both systems audits and transaction
      reviews and is organized into three core audit departments in addition to administrative and strategic
      management departments: financial audit, performance audit and compliance audits. As indicated in the
      MNAO’s annual report to the Budget Standing Committee in year 2013, it conducted 311 performance
      audits, 4099 financial statement audits and 196 compliance audits; thus performing a total of 4606 audit

                                                                                                                      67
Mongolia: Report on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)


           engagements. The number of staff, inclusive of those at the subnational level, as approved by the decree
           of the Budget Standing Committee of the Parliament for MNAO is 389.

     156.	 Funds, projects and programs implemented and/or managed by Government ministries and agencies,
           fully (100 percent) state-owned enterprises, and enterprises fully owned by the local governments are
           all required by the IBL (Article 54) to get their financial statements consolidated into the Government
           financial statements. As such, the 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Government covered
           financial statements of 127 state-owned entities, 164 entities owned by local governments, and 93
           projects and funds. As a 100 percent state-owned entity, and as required by its own law (Article 2 of the
           Law on the Development Bank of Mongolia), the Development Bank of Mongolia also gets its annual
           financial statements audited and consolidated to the Government’s consolidated financial statements.

     157.	 As required by law, all central government entities’ financial audits are carried out annually within the
           timeframe set forth by the law. In addition to auditing budget execution reports covering revenues and
           expenditures, financial statements covering assets and liabilities are audited. In year 2013, out of the 459
           financial statements consolidated in the 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Government,
           199 (43.3%) were audited by MNAO and the remaining 260 (56.7%) were audited by private audit firms.
           2012 financial audit reports of all 35 general budget governors (inclusive of the agencies belonging to the
           various portfolio ministries) representing the central government were produced and made available to
           the public on the MNAO website.

     158.	 The MNAO audit opinion on the 2012 Consolidated Financial Statement of the Government made a
           reference to the IFAC-issued International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and the MNAO Financial Audit
           Manual that is in compliance with the ISAs as the standards it followed when conducting the audit. The
           audit opinion of the external auditors on the 2012 Consolidated Financial Statement of the Government
           was qualified due to issues such as inaccurate reporting of the cash balance, insufficient documentation
           of expenditures incurred for issuing sovereign bonds, inability to verify the balance of on-lending
           receivables, duplicate reporting of interest expenses, etc.

     159.	 The IBL (Article 8) sets forth the following schedule, as it pertains to the central government entities, for
           the annual audited financial reports submission at the various levels of budget governors:

              •	 Direct budget governors shall submit annual budget execution reports and financial statements by
                 the 25th of January of the following year to state audit bodies and audited financial statements to
                 the respective upper level budget governors by the 25th of February.

              statements to the state audit body no later than the 5th of March and submit audited reports to the
              general budget governor no later than the 25th of March of every year.
         •	 General budget governors shall submit annual budget execution reports and consolidated financial
            statements by the 5th of April of the following year, and submit audited annual statements by the
            25th of April of the following year to the Ministry of Finance for consolidation.
         •	 The Ministry of Finance shall submit the unified budget execution report and Government’s
            consolidated financial statement to MNAO by the 10th of May of every year.
         •	 MNAO shall conduct audits of the unified budget execution report and Government’s consolidated
            financial statement within one month (by the 10th of June) and submit its audit opinion to the
            Government and the Parliament.

160.	 As indicated in the schedule, although the annual budget execution reports and financial statements
      of central government entities at the portfolio minister’s (general budget governor’s) level are audited
      within the first 4 months of the following year, until consolidated into the unified budget execution report
      and the consolidated financial statement of the Government they are not required for submission to the
      legislature by law. A sample review of the individual ministries’ 2012 audit reports yielded the following
      results:

         •	    Cabinet Secretariat: 2012 audit report was issued by MNAO on April 24, 2013
         •	    Ministry of Foreign Affairs: 2012 audit report was issued by MNAO on April 24, 2013
         •	    National Statistics Office: 2012 audit report was issued by MNAO on April 24, 2013
         •	    Social Insurance Fund: 2012 audit report was issued by MNAO on April 25, 2013

161.	 Based on the sample review, it was concluded that the annual audit reports of individual central
      government entities were prepared timely within the legal deadline of April 25.

162.	 The 2012 year-end consolidated financial statement of the Government was audited by MNAO and the
      audit report was issued and submitted to the Parliament on June 7, 2013, slightly over five months after
      the end of the period covered.

(iii)	   Evidence of follow up on audit recommendations

163.	 As part of an individual ministry’s or agency’s annual audit report a Management Letter detailing the
      auditor’s main findings is provided. In the Management Letter, auditors rank the findings by priority and
      provide space for the management of the audited government entity to formally make a response to the
      specific findings in writing and provide signature.

164.	 Based on a sample review of Management Letters provided to Government entities as part of their
      2012 audit reports, it was found that where applicable the external auditors had provided time-bound
      recommendations, documented the management responses in writing, analyzed the recommendations
      provided (e.g. out of the 106 recommendations provided to general budget governors during their
      2012 audit, 28.3% were for enhancing responsibilities, 23.6% were for improving management, 15%
      for increasing effectiveness, 12.3% were for increasing service quality and provision, 11.3% were for
      increasing efficiency and 9.5% were for improving accounting practices and increasing budget revenues)
      and provided a summary on the status of implementation of the previous year’s audit recommendations
      in an Annex to the Audit Report on the Consolidated Financial Statement of the Government that is
      submitted to the legislature.

     165.	 There was also clear evidence in the audit reports that the external auditors had followed up on the
           previous year audit recommendations. For instance, the 2012 audit report on the Consolidated Financial
           Statements of the Government describes that out of the 75 recommendations provided to general budget
           governors in the previous year (2011), 80% were fully implemented, 5.3% were overdue and 14.7% were
           in progress for implementation.

     PI-27	 Legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law

     i)	 Scope of examination by the Legislature

     166.	 The State Great Khural (the national parliament of Mongolia) exercises considerable authority over the
           budget, as specified in the Budget Law (Article 9). It approves the Government’s Medium Term Fiscal
           Framework (MTFF), the annual development vision (called Guidelines for Socio-economic Development),
           the annual budget, and supplementary budgets.

     167.	 As per the calendar specified in Article 8 (and which is strictly adhered to), the MTFF is presented by the
           Government to parliament on May 1st of each year, with parliamentary approval by June 1st. The MTFF
           has to abide by the fiscal rules specified under the Fiscal Stability Law, but there is considerable debate
           during the parliamentary discussions on the macroeconomic assumptions and revenue forecasts that
           underpin the rules and therefore the MTFF. It is common for the parliament to change these assumptions,
           almost always with the goal of increasing spending. De jure and De facto therefore, parliament exercises
           considerable power in setting the revenue and expenditure aggregates used to prepare the budget.

     168.	 The annual budget has to be presented to the parliament by October 1st with approval by November
           15th. These dates have always been abided by. The only limitation is that the budget has to abide by
           the fiscal rules specified in the FSL; other than this restriction the parliament can, and does, review all
           details of revenues and expenditures. During the parliamentary debate there are many changes made
           to the budget, particularly the capital budget through the inclusion of new projects, and expenditure
           reallocations. One of the main weaknesses in the budgeting process is that the MTFF is often revised
           during the parliamentary session to accommodate an expansion in the budget. The table below gives the
           indication of the changes that are made during the parliamentary sessions.

ii)	 Degree to which legislative procedures are recognized and respected

169.	 The legislature’s procedures for budgetary review are established in the Law on the Parliamentary Session
      Procedures (2007 Articles 25.9.1-25.9.4) which are abided by. The budget has to go through 4 hearings at
      the parliament: i) the prime minister has to present the annual budget proposal at the plenary session of
      the parliament; ii) during the second hearing, all parliamentary standing committees, party and coalition
      caucuses, and the budget expenditure oversight sub-committee discuss the budget proposal with respect
      to their associated mandate, compile feedback and comments and submit them to the Budget Standing
      Committee. The Budget Standing Committee discusses all the comments and suggestions respectively,
      votes and submits its opinion to the plenary session of the parliament which in turn conducts open
      voting for each of the Standing Committee suggestions; iii) during the third hearing, the Budget Standing
      Committee revises the annual budget proposal by reflecting the comments and suggestions that got the
      majority votes during the second hearing of the plenary session, and prepares the final version of the
      annual budget proposal and submits it to the plenary session; iv) at the fourth hearing, the parliament
      speaker reads every article and provision of the budget, conducts a vote for each of them and gets the
      budget approved as a Law.

iii)	 Adequacy of the time for the Legislature to provide a response to budget proposals

170.	 As per the IBL (Article 8) the Government has to submit the budget to the parliament by October 1st and
      the parliament has to approve it by November 15th. For the 2013 and 2014 budgets, the Government
      submitted the budget on September 30th and October 1st respectively. Overall therefore, the parliament
      has approximately 6 weeks to approve the budget.

171.	 It should be noted that in the old budget legislation, namely the Public Sector Management and Finance
      Law of 2003, which was replaced by the IBL in 2011, the parliament had 2 months to debate the budget.
      This period was reduced in the IBL in order to give more time for the preparation of the detailed budget
      allotments after the budget’s approval, and for the preparation of procurement plans given the need to
      contract projects in time for the start of the construction season.

iv)	 Rules for in-year amendments to the budget without ex-ante approval by the legislature

172.	 The rules governing budget amendments are clearly specified in detail in the IBL (Articles 34 and 42).
      Any increase in government expenditures or reallocations between ministries (general budget governors)
      requires the government to submit a request for a supplementary budget to parliament. Specifically,
      Article 34 stipulates that a supplementary budget has to be approved by the legislatures if: (i) there is a
      suspension of the fiscal rules set in the FSL; (ii) revenue shortfalls result in an increase in the fiscal deficit
      of 3 percent of GDP; (iii) if there needs to be a reallocation of funds between general budget governors;
      and (iv) if capital expenditures increase due to a doubling of the cost of building materials as compared to
      the costs used in the original budget. Article 42 provides the authorities for in-year amendments by the
      executive. Line ministries can make adjustments between programs within their portfolio, and between
      the budgetary organizations that fall within their administrative jurisdiction (e.g. schools and hospitals
      in the case of the ministries of education and health respectively), but there can be no reallocations
      between capital and recurrent expenditures, nor can new programs and activities be financed.

     PI-28	 Legislative scrutiny of external audit reports

     173.	 As indicated in PI-26, although the annual budget execution reports and financial statements of central
           government entities at the portfolio ministers’ (general budget governors’) level are audited individually,
           until consolidated into the unified budget execution report and the consolidated financial statement of
           the Government, they are not required for submission to the legislature by law. Currently, Article 8.10.4
           of the Integrated Budget Law of Mongolia mandates the Parliament to discuss the audited unified budget
           execution report in its spring session and then to approve the state budget execution. The amended Law
           on State Audit of 2013 (Article 16.3) also mandates the Budget Standing Committee of parliament to hold
           hearings on the results of audits conducted by MNAO that were proposed and ordered by the Parliament
           and make relevant decisions.

     (i) Timeliness in examination of the audit reports by the Legislature (reports received within the past
         three years).

     174.	 The key dates for the examination of reports received within the past three years were as follows:

         •	 2012 audited unified budget execution report: the report was submitted to parliament by the
            Government on June 7, 2013. The Parliament carried out the first hearing in its Plenary Session on June
            27, 2013. After completing the first hearing, the Parliament requested the Standing Committees to carry
            out second hearings and report back in writing to the Sub-Committee on Budget Expenditure on any
            major issues for consideration and on whether or not the standing committee agrees to endorse the
            draft Parliament Decree on approving the budget execution. This decree was issued on July 4, 2013, less
            than 1 month after receipt of the audit reports.
         •	 2011 report: the report was received on June 8, 2012 and the decree was issued on October 24, 2012 or
            within 5 months of the receipt of the report. The reason for the delay was that 2012 was an election year
            (elections took place on June 28, 2012) and the decree was issued once the unified budget execution
            and the consolidated financial statements were discussed at the new Parliament.
         •	 2010 report: the report was received on April 20, 2011 and the decree was issued on July 9, 2011 or
            within 3 months of the receipt of the report.

(ii) Extent of hearings on the main findings undertaken by the legislature

175.	 As part of approving the 2012 budget execution per its mandate by the IBL (Article 8.10.4), the Parliament
      discussed the unified budget execution report, the consolidated financial statement of the Government
      and the relevant audit matters for the fiscal year. There were three hearings that took place in order for
      the Parliament to approve the budget execution. The first hearing took place on June 27, 2013 during
      a plenary session of the Parliament where both the Minister of Finance and the Auditor-General made
      relevant presentations followed by a question and answer session. Then the second round of hearings
      took place at the individual Parliamentary Standing Committee meetings on June 27-28, 2013. As the
      standing committee meetings were scheduled consecutively, the Minister of Finance and the Auditor-
      General were present at those meetings to present and respond to any questions. Some officials from
      Government ministries and agencies were also present at the relevant standing committee meetings to
      attend to any questions or comments. As a result of the second round of hearings, written responses and
      comments on the draft proposal of the Parliamentary decree to approve the budget execution were sent
      from the standing committees to the Sub-Committee on Budget Expenditure. As a result of a third hearing
      in a plenary session on July 3, 2013, the 2012 budget execution was approved and the Parliamentary
      decree was issued.

176.	 To conclude, in-depth hearings do take place on a routine-basis to the extent that Parliament is in its
      spring session. However, parliament has insufficient time to thoroughly review all audit findings and
      recommendations.

(iii) Issuance of recommendations by the Legislature and their implementation by the Executive

177.	 The MNAO sends to the Prime Minister the annual audit report containing the audited budget execution
      report, the audited consolidated financial statements of the Government and the audit findings and
      recommendations. The audit report is then reviewed by the cabinet ministers and discussed at a Cabinet
      meeting prior to being submitted to the Parliament. As required by Article 8.10.4 of the IBL, the Parliament
      reviews, discusses and approves the audit reports but there is no legal requirement for it to issue any
      recommendations based on its review. The 2013 audit report was approved by the parliament with no
      recommendations.

178.	 Despite this lack of direction from the Parliament, the MNAO does follow-up on its audit findings and
      has a sanctioning power of issuing fines and acts that obligate the relevant audited entities to comply
      in order to rectify the situation (LSA, Article 15.1.12). Evidence obtained shows most of MNAO’s
      audit recommendations were implemented by the executive branch (e.g. 80% of the FY11 audit
      recommendations were fully implemented) and MNAO documents management responses to the
      findings in writing, analyzes the recommendations provided and keeps a record on the implementation
      progress of the recommendations.

           projects from various financing sources, including through donor financing. It also requires that the annual
           budget provides information on donor financed projects. In practice however, comprehensive and timely

           of these projects is available to the Government. Disbursement information from loan financed projects
           from the largest donors (World Bank and Asian Development Bank) is made available within two months
           of the end of the quarter, but does not follow the budget classification system and is therefore not

     Section 4: Government reform Process

     Subsection 4.1: Description of Major PFM Reforms

     183.	 The Government of Mongolia has undertaken significant PFM reforms of the past decade. In many ways
           these reforms have followed the textbook “basics first” sequencing, with an emphasis in the period 2003-
           2008 on strengthening internal controls, cash management, and accounting and reporting, followed
           by the a focus since 2008 on improving fiscal policy, budget planning, and greater decentralization of
           expenditure responsibilities to local governments, as enshrined in the FSL and IBL detailed in Box 1 earlier.

     184.	 Prior to 2003, the Mongolian public finance management system was fragmented and lacked operational
           fiduciary controls in budget execution.11 There were more than two thousand bank accounts, operated
           by different agencies, and it was not possible to determine the Government’s consolidated cash position
           at any point. The Government was borrowing overnight to meet expenditure needs as there was no
           consolidated single account, arrears were high, the accounting and reporting structure was fragmented
           across budget entities, and budget reports were consolidated with a lag of more than 3 months.

     185.	 By 2007 significant improvements in budget execution, internal controls, and accounting and reporting
           had been accomplished. All accounts were consolidated in the TSA under the authority of the MoF, an
           operational treasury information system (the GFMIS) was in place with a country-wide electronic payment
           settlement system at the Bank of Mongolia, and budget reporting and accounting were harmonized using
           GFS 86 standards. These were remarkable achievements achieved in a relatively short period of time, and
           laid the PFM foundations for improved service delivery.

     186.	 The second phase of PFM reforms also roughly coincided with Mongolia’s resource boom with the
           discovery of large copper and coal deposits and the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement
           in 2009. The 2008-2009 global financial crisis, and the resultant collapse of global mineral prices, hit
           Mongolia hard (and required an IMF program) and underlined the importance of a robust framework for
           fiscal policy and budget planning to avoid the well-known problems of the Dutch Disease. The FSL and IBL
           were landmark legislative achievements to address these weaknesses. The regulatory reforms, including
           greater transparency and accountability of public procurement laid out in the PPLM, the strengthening
           of the internal audit function, and greater fiscal decentralization also aimed at improving the quality
           of public spending and on ensuring that the benefits of the mining wealth were spread broadly across
           Mongolia.

     187.	 Significant progress has also taken place in tax administration reforms since 2008. The General Taxation Law
           of 2008 provided the legal basis for tax administration operations and clarified rights and responsibilities
           of taxpayers and tax inspectors. The law reoriented tax administration from a framework based on
           enforcement to one centered on facilitating and promoting voluntary tax compliance through a tax self-
           assessment regime. The GDT was reorganized along functional lines, and a major effort is underway to
           develop an integrated tax administration information system to improve the efficiency and transparency
           of the entire tax administration cycle.

     188.	 The period since 2012 has been turbulent, with reform reversals, and which underline the challenges
           inherent in a mineral resource dependent economy. The biggest step backwards has been the exponential
           increase in extra-budgetary financing of government spending through the DBM. This extra-budgetary
           spending — amounting to approximately 10 percent of GDP in 2013 — weakens the FSL and has created
           large macroeconomic vulnerabilities. It also hurts the quality of public spending as the expenditures are
           not reported in the budget, and do not follow competitive procurement procedures.

Subsection 4.2: Institutional Factors Supporting the Planning and Implementation of Reforms

189.	 The medium-term reform program is well understood by the MoF and is essentially the effective
      implementation of the FSL, IBL, and PPLM. The World Bank, IMF, ADB, the Swiss Agency for Development
      and Cooperation (SDC), the US Treasury Oversea Technical Assistance office, and Ministry of Finance of
      the Government of Korea have been providing technical assistance to the Government, especially the
      MoF, to this effect. The Bank has been engaged through two on-going technical assistance projects, grants
      from the Governance Partnership Facility, and analytical and advisory services. As a result of this support,
      a number of implementing regulations and procedures to support these laws have been developed,
      information systems for budget, tax, procurement, and debt management have been developed, and
      staff have been trained.

190.	 There are three major institutional factors however, that comprise the effective planning and
      implementation of these reforms.

191.	 First, the MoF’s reform priorities are not shared by all concerned parties, in particular the MED. The MED,
      which was created in 2012, is politically the most powerful spending agency with responsibilities for both
      on-budget and off budget (the DBM reports to the MED) capital expenditures. There are fundamental
      disagreements between the MoF and MED on fiscal issues and weak coordination in budget preparation.

192.	 Second, an underlying constraint has been the implementation gap between the laws and the capacity of
      the key agencies to implement these laws. The MoF is small, with a staff of approximately 150, and while
      the technical abilities of this staff has been steadily improving there are significant staff shortages in a
      number of areas such as estimation of fiscal risks, revenue forecasting, intergovernmental fiscal relations,
      oversight of the financial sector, procurement policy, and internal audit. Similarly while the legal structure
      for external audit is strong, the MNAO is also understaffed and lacks the capacity to effectively conduct
      performance audits. Most significantly, the rapid expansion in capital spending has greatly stretched the
      limited capacity of the MED to effectively plan and appraise projects, and of the Government Procurement
      Agency, which was only formed in 2012, to efficiently procure these contracts, which risks to value for
      money.

193.	 Third and most importantly, are the underlying political economy factors that have weakened the formal
      PFM system. The parliament of Mongolia is very powerful and exercise considerable authority over fiscal
      policy and budgeting, as measured in the high score for PI-27. All too often however, this formal authority
      has been exercised in ways that undermine fiscal sustainability (through overly optimistic revenue
      forecasts), allocative efficiency (through budgetary amendments that introduce new spending items that
      have not gone through the normal budgetary procedures), and efficient service delivery (through the
      excessive use of direct contracting for capital projects).

194.	 The strength of Mongolia’s political system, and society, is openness, not just of fiscal and budget
      transparency, but of the broader political process, with active citizen engagement in a variety of dimensions.
      The Government has undertaken a number of measures to institutionalize citizen participation, which
      include becoming a member of the international Open Government Partnership, passing a Right to
      Information Act (2012), formalizing participatory budgeting in the IBL, and formalizing citizen monitoring
      of procurement in the PPLM. Transparency and citizen engagement can gradually help to align the informal
      institutions with the formal PFM institutions to better achieve fiscal sustainability, strategic allocation of
      resources, and efficient service deliver so that Mongolia’s vast mineral resources can be used to better
      the lives of its citizens.
