                                                       Executive Summary


Madagascar’s economic growth has been slow at 1 percent annually in the last five years and far inferior to sub-Saharan
region’s average. Income per capita in 2014 fell to around USD 400 (2005 constant USD), losing about 20 percent from
1970 when per capita income reached the highest point since independence. The economic and social effects of the 2009
political crisis were intensified by the suspension of many donor activities which, in a country where international aid
represented 40 percent of the government budget, led to significant cuts in investments and a sharp decline in the delivery
of services. Macroeconomic stability was maintained during the crisis, as both fiscal and monetary authorities maintained
prudent policies. A low public debt to GDP ratio (37.3 percent in 2014) and a low tax revenue (9.7 percent of GDP in 2014)
contributed to hindering public investments necessary for development and adequate provision of public services.

Madagascar’s failure to sustain robust income growth has translated into high poverty rates. Extreme poverty (per capita
consumption under $1.25 2005 PPP per day) rose from an estimated 77.5 percent in 2001 to 80.7 percent in 2005 and
over 79 percent in 2010, but then dropped slightly to 78.2 percent in 2012. Over the same timeframe, absolute poverty
($2.00 PPP per capital per day) rose from an estimated 88.9 in 2001 to 90.8 percent of the population in 2010, and then
stayed flat at 90.6 in 2012. Inequality in Madagascar is similar to that of other low income countries, with the Gini coefficient
ranging between 0.39 and 0.47 over the period 2001-2012 and most recently at 0.41 in 2012. About a third of the
population in Madagascar is deprived on multiple dimensions, including consumption, access to education, usage of electricity,
and possession of basic household assets.

In a context of high poverty rates, low overall public resources to finance public services delivery, and continuous fragility,
economic and political instability, how can public spending promote better outcomes in education and health? How can the
Government of Madagascar and its partners support better access to improved quality of services, in particular for the most
vulnerable? The Review of Public Spending in Social Sectors in Madagascar systematically analyses how education, health
and nutrition have been financed over the past five years. It examines the amounts, distribution and impact of public spending,
and formulates recommendations on how best to allocate future public spending with a focus on incremental resources.

EDUCATION AND HEALTH SERVICES HAVE BEEN SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE 2009 CRISIS

    Key findings: By 2008, Madagascar made considerable progress on the social MDGs. Enrolments in primary education
    steadily grew between 2000 and 2008, while the primary completion rate increased substantially. Similarly, under-five
    mortality had declined from 94 in 2002 to 71 in 2008, making it likely that the fourth MDG would be achieved by
    2015. In addition, the country was starting to tackle some persistent challenges, such as improving maternal health and
    reducing stunting among children caused by chronic malnutrition. These positive trends were entirely reversed after the
    2009 crisis. Today, Madagascar’s education system exhibits severe weaknesses that leave a large number of children
    without the basic skills required to function on the labor market. Progress made on key health indicators has stagnated
    or is being reversed with Madagascar falling off track to achieve the MDGs. There is therefore an urgent need to improve
    the accessibility of health services, especially for the poorest, and to support improvement in education quality, while at
    the same time catering to the specific needs of children who are out of schools.

Primary School Enrollments have decreased since 2009 as a result of increased dropouts, mainly related to financial
constraints. According to the Household Surveys, the attendance rate of children aged 6 to 14 years has receded strongly
over the 2005-12 period, from 77 percent to 74 percent in 2010 and 69 percent in 2012. The drop in attendance rates
has been unequal, especially affecting rural zones and the southern regions. The most recent estimates indicate that 1.4
million children aged 6-10 (25 percent of the age group) are likely out of school. Financial problems are the key drivers of
dropout for more than one third of households.

Learning outcomes have considerably worsened over the past fifteen years. Prior to the 2009 crisis, Madagascar
experienced an upward trend in primary completion rates. Since then, however, the primary completion rate has declined
from 74 percent to 70 percent. Moreover, comparison of data across three rounds of learning assessments indicates a sharp
downward trend in all three subject areas. Overall, between 1998 and 2012, the national average in French has dropped
by 16 percentage points and the math score by 19 percentage points.

        Distribution of teachers by category              The rapid increase in community teachers whose skills are low has been a
                                                          key contributor to reducing the quality of teaching, especially in vulnerable

  80%                                                     years, and community teachers now make up 80 percent of the total. These
  60%
                                                          teachers are unequally distributed across regions, with higher concentration in
                                                          poor and vulnerable areas. Community teachers are generally underqualified,
  40%                                                     with more than 80 percent of them having no form of teaching qualification, which
  20%                                                     has important negative consequences on education outcomes. The 2012 learning

         2006-07      2008-09      2011-12      2013-14   community teachers and low learning outcomes.


Coverage of essential health services especially key maternal and child health services is very low. Access to quality
prenatal and antenatal care remains a persistent challenge with only 38 percent of births taking place in a health center
and of those less than half (44%) are attended by skilled personnel. This is       Immunization Coverage for children
lower than the average in the developing world, where about 58% of all                  under one, Routine Data
deliveries are reported as attended by skilled health providers and over       90    83.8

percent in just four years. Routine data collected from health facilities also
confirms the drop.

Since 2009, the some declining trends in key indicators of health system performance have also been observed. For
example, the prescription satisfaction rate, a key indicator for drug availability, has sharply declined from 69 percent to 59
percent at facility level and utilization rates at primary care health facilities has decreased by at least 20 percent.

                                                                           2
Madagascar’s epidemiological profile remains comparable to many low-income countries with a high communicable
disease burden. Almost 30 percent of all deaths in Madagascar are still attributable to preventable and infectious and
parasitic diseases, with the burden of disease falling disproportionately on the poor. Over the past decade, non-
communicable diseases are increasing in the population, resulting in a dual burden of disease which will tax and already
fragile health system.

EDUCATION AND HEALTH SERVICES ARE UNDER SEVERE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS

    Key findings: Madagascar’s education and health sectors appear to be largely underfinanced with differing degrees of
    priority in the overall Government budget. Reduced domestic public spending is complemented by large amounts of
    external aid in health, and substantial contributions from households in both education and health. Existing resources are
    not sufficient to support improvements in access and quality of education and health services, and deprives public systems
    from meeting the basic needs of the population. Various issues complicate the preparation and execution of the budget
    which prevent ministries from using budgeted funds, including tight and fluctuating execution rates imposed by the
    Ministry of Finance. This creates substantial difficulties for the health and education systems, including delays in disbursing
    subsidies to community teachers and full implementation of key public health programs. Moreover, frequent and
    substantial re-allocations within and across programs, and the incomplete recording of external funds into Government
    accounts (SIGFP/AMP) reduce the budget credibility and usefulness as a strategic tool to support the implementation of
    sectors strategies.

Madagascar allocates a low share of its GDP to education, although the sector is well prioritized within overall public
spending. Total public spending on education decreased substantially to 3.1 percent in 2013, a percentage much lower than
the average for low-income country. This low investment in education reflects the overall contraction of public spending rather
than a lack of prioritization by the Government. Indeed, education represented on average more than 20 percent of total
government spending between 2010 and 2012, which is substantially higher than the average of Sub-Saharan countries and
the low income group as a whole.

On the other hand, total spending on health decreased to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2012, while the average in Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) countries was above 6 percent. On average, total spending in Madagascar on health was 4.3 percent of its
GDP between 2009 and 2012, compared to 4.8 percent in the four years preceding the crisis (2005-2008). This was the
reverse of the trend observed in other SSA countries where the share of GDP allocated to health increased on average from
6 to 6.4 percent. In real terms per capita expenditure on health has not changed since 1995, at around US$20, a level
comparable to other Low Income Countries in SSA.

External aid makes up a very large share of total public spending on
                                                                                            Share of Domestic Funding in Total Public
health while the share of external funds in total public spending on                                      Spending
education is relatively low. Between 2009 and 2013, 80 percent of public
                                                                                       100%
funding to the health sector was financed through external funds, which is                                Education     Health
particularly high compared with other sectors in the country as well as with            80%
other countries. This poses serious concerns for sustainability, ownership and          60%
efficiency of existing resources. On the other hand, about 20 percent of total          40%
education spending was financed by external funds, down from 35 percent                 20%
in 2010. In fact, the sharp in external funding to education accounts for a              0%
large share of the overall decrease in funding to the sector.                                   2009     2010    2011     2012    2013


DOMESTIC FUNDING TO EDUCATION AND HEALTH IS MOSTLY GEARED TOWARDS SALARY COSTS

   Key findings: Madagascar’s domestic education and health spending is mostly geared towards salaries, which are rapidly
   increasing, leaving little room to finance much else. In both sectors, spending are very centralized, which can results in
   delays in transferring resources and a lack of alignment with local needs. In this context, there is a need to progressively
   reorient education spending towards inputs that have a direct impact on quality, which could require a more progressive
   timeline for the planned integration of community teachers into civil service. In health, expenditures on labor have also
   been increasing both in real term and in share of total expenditures, while other operational expenditures and internally
   financed investments have decreased. This indicates that Madagascar has clearly moved to an unbalanced situation that
   is concerning in terms of both efficiency and sustainability in delivering a sufficient amount of quality health services to
   the population.

                                                                  3

education went up from 70 percent in 2006 to 90 percent in 2013, while                100%

Although this is somehow comparable with other low-income countries, the on-

will make this trend unsustainable and detrimental to other important                  20%

Primary education absorbs almost half of total non-investment education expenditure. Primary education receives a
large share of public spending on education, between 45 and 48 percent over the period 2002-2013. This share is in line
with that in other countries at a similar level of development, and reflects the priority given to primary education by successive
governments. The non-wage recurrent budget, although a much smaller part of total expenses shows a surprisingly large and
increasing share of education spending going to post-secondary education, most likely related to the large program of
support to university students, including scholarships.

Regular salary expenditures in health have reached levels that are

not keep this advantage.

Administration and coordination takes the largest share of recurrent non-wage expenditures to health, more than
primary health care, maternal and child health, and public health combined. Administrative expenses constitute about 40
percent of non-wage recurrent expenditure, with a marked decrease from 43 in 2010 to 36 percent in 2013. The share
going to hospital services stayed relatively constant at around 25 percent. The share going specifically to primary health
care services was significantly reduced from 19 to 11 percent, although maternal and child health expenditures compensated
for the decrease.

Communicable diseases (CDs) and Maternal and Child Health (MCH) dominate expenditures identifiable by program.
Excluding the investment budget, expenditure on CDs clearly dominate every year, followed by MCH. Looking at investment,
CDs and MCH still make up the bulk of targeted expenditure. There has been some increase in non-communicable diseases
program funding, indicating that are starting to gain importance in the investment budget.

THE EDUCATION AND HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE HIGHLY INEQUITABLE AND INCREASINGLY FINANCED BY HOUSEHOLDS

    Key findings: The distributional analysis shows that the poorest regions have the lowest amount of spending for both
    sectors. Moreover, considering that two-thirds of the population lives in rural areas, the low amount of education and
    health expenditure in these areas is indicative of large inequities in the distribution of public resources, largely driven by
    unequitable distribution of human resources across the country. Cuts in public spending to social sectors have resulted in
    large increases in household spending, in particular on education. This has had far-reaching consequences in terms of
    enrollments in primary schools, learning outcomes and utilization of health services. Better equity in the distribution of
    spending will require that trained and qualified teachers are equally distributed across the country, and additional health
    human resources target the neediest areas. Finally, severe data limitations due to the lack of a recent census and more
    recent household data at the district level prevent a finer analysis of the distribution of spending by poverty level.

The distribution of government current expenditures by region indicates some regressivity, with some leveling out
during the most recent period. Expenditure shares by type of residence have evolved in favor of the large urban centers
(+14 percent), mostly at the expense of other urban areas and peri-urban rural areas. Rural areas (including the peri-urban
areas) received less than a third of expenditures.

Households are financing an increasing share of the total costs of education.
                                                                                                                    Financing of primary education, share

Household cost in terms of out-of-pocket costs are high with the cost of most medical consumables borne by the patient
through cost recovery. 2013 NHA-lite data indicates that Out of Pocket (OOP) expenditure represents 80 percent share of
private financing and 30 percent of total health expenditure. Yet, when looking at households, percentages of catastrophic
expenditures in the poorest quintiles are very low, which is usually indicative of “system failure”; i.e., the poor just do not seek
care. It should be noted that catastrophic expenditures may cause 4.5 percent of people in the richest quintile and 3 percent
of people in the fourth quintile to fall below the poverty line.
