Report No: 97146-UG
Preface
For about ten years, from the early 2000s to 2010, the Ugandan economy grew at an average of 7 percent per annum. This achievement was accompanied by a dramatic decline in
poverty rates (from 68.1 percent in 1992/93 to 33.2 percent in 2012/13, using the international poverty line of $1.90 [2011 PPP]). Since then, a number of external and domestic
factors slowed down the GDP growth rate (3.3 percent in 2013/14) which rebounded to 5 percent in FY2014/15 and an estimated 4.6 percent in FY2015/16.


Uganda is about to become an oil-producing country, and the Ugandan population hopes that the new resource will accelerate economic growth, reduce poverty and enable the
country to reach its long-term goal of becoming an upper middle income country in less than thirty years. The timing of the project and its impact will depend on the level of
international oil prices, which are extremely low today. However, we have reasons to believe that the price of oil will rise again and that Uganda’s future oil production will have
a major influence on the country’s economic and fiscal performance.


The experience of other countries, in Africa and other parts of the world, shows that large scale production of oil, gas and other mineral resources offers great opportunities, but
also presents major challenges. In Angola, during most of the 2000s, high oil production and high international prices boosted GDP growth, but a massively expanded and poorly
managed public investment program created congestion, inefficiencies and inflationary pressures, instead of developing - slowly and soundly - the necessary long-term physical
and human capital.


A new Uganda Country Economic Memorandum entitled “Economic Diversification and Growth in the Era of Oil and Volatility” has been prepared by a team of World Bank
economists working in close cooperation with a Ugandan Government team. The memorandum discusses the prospects of oil and mineral production in Uganda and uses the
lessons of international experience to propose an agenda of policy and institutional reforms aimed at maximizing the positive impact of oil production and avoiding the “resource
curse” that affected negatively Nigeria, Angola and too many other new producers of oil, gas and minerals in the world.


We shall not try to summarize the main conclusions of the report but would like to emphasize the following six messages, which - we believe - can guide future government and
donor policies.


First Message. The government views economic diversification as a key component of its strategy. The report fully supports that view. Past experience shows a strong
correlation between diversification and long-term economic success. The report argues that Uganda does not need to remain a low-productivity economy dominated by
agriculture and a mainly informal services sector. A product space analysis shows that Uganda has potential for the emergence of a modern manufacturing sector focused on
agro-processing and light manufacturing, which would serve both the domestic and the regional markets and would provide substantial export opportunities for a variety of small
and medium-sized enterprises.


Second Message. Improved governance and a conducive business environment are essential to promote the type of private sector development that will make economic
diversification possible. However, a sound and well managed public investment program, largely financed by oil-related government revenue, is equally essential to remove
constraints to private sector growth. Large investments in public infrastructure are urgently needed in the whole country and, in particular, in the underdeveloped and very poor
Northern region. For the long-term, increased public spending in education and health is even more critical. This will offer opportunities to all and also create the well-trained
labor force which a modern manufacturing and services sector will need.


                                                                                                                                                                                       1
Third Message. The report includes a wealth analysis which shows that oil-producing countries should invest to develop the long-term capital (physical and human)
that will replace non-renewable oil resources when depleted. Quality, however, is more important than speed. A massive increase in public spending and a poorly
designed and implemented public investment program will do more harm than good, stimulating a number of negative forces (resource curse, Dutch Disease) that
will block the development of non-oil economic activities. The report advocates a “sustainable investing approach” that combines substantial savings with
investment and links the size and speed of the public investment program to progress in absorptive capacity.


Fourth Message. Regional integration already helped Uganda diversify its production and its exports. More important than regional free trade are measures that will
reduce regional transaction costs, notably investments in regional transport and energy infrastructure, and also improvements in logistics services. More complex is
the issue of the creation of a monetary union. The example of the Euro-zone shows how difficult it is for individual countries in a monetary union to make the
necessary macroeconomic and fiscal adjustments to external and domestic shocks. More thinking is essential before final implementation of the reform.


Fifth Message. More than one third of the Ugandan population remains poor and vulnerable to shocks and recent economic growth did not reduce income
inequality. This is a major problem for many developed and developing countries today. Three types of measures could help reduce poverty and income inequality in
Uganda. First, a significant infrastructure development program in the underdeveloped Northern region. Second, improved education and health services overall and
in particular in the North. Third, the report discusses the feasibility of direct transfers to the poor linked with behavioral improvements (sending boys and girls to
primary school, reducing dropout rates, vaccination and other basic health services). That type of scheme may be tested on a small scale in the poorest communities.


Sixth Message. The CEM describes in general terms how Uganda can experience long-term growth, fight poverty and meet the challenges that come with the
development of new resources. Much more needs to be done to translate the proposed strategy into specific action plans. This should be the priority of future
economic and sector work for the Ugandan government and for its development partners.

Ghana is the most recent example that illustrates the need
to establish safeguards. The coming on stream of oil in           Stone quarrying for road construction
late 2010, which coincided with preparations for the 2012
presidential election, fuelled the formation of excessively
optimistic expectations, with negative consequences in
terms of fiscal prudency. Instead of using initial oil revenues
for fiscal consolidation, given Ghana’s high fiscal deficits,
the government raised expenditure and used future oil
revenues as collateral to increase its debt.

Excessive borrowing in Ghana was possible because
the revenue management law does not include clauses
which ensure that prospective oil revenues will not
lead to excessive government borrowing. Whereas an
original draft of the Petroleum Revenue Management Bill
included a clause that prohibited the use of oil revenues as
collateral for loans (that is, oil-backed loans), the clause
was dropped during the drafting process. Consequently,
the country is tapping heavily into international capital
markets to frontload investments which expanded from 15
percent of GDP in 2007 to 26 percent in 2013. Moreover,
in 2011 the government signed a US$3 billion loan with
the Chinese Development Bank, which explicitly commits
future oil revenues as collateral. Under the agreement,
the Government of Ghana will sell crude oil directly to a
Chinese agent to support the repayment of the loan.

In Uganda, the Public Finance Management Act explic-
itly prohibits the collateralization of future oil revenues.
However, prudent debt management will always be required
over time.

In this context, the development of an effective commu-
nication strategy is a high priority. This strategy should
define clear responsibilities for nation-wide communi-
cations on the oil and gas sector. The ultimate goal of the
strategy will be to empower citizens by educating them on
pertinent issues concerning the prospects and the possible
impact of oil, gas and other mining activities, and to encour-
age them to participate in the ongoing dialogue on the future
use of oil and gas revenue. This will also encourage trans-
parency and accountability.

Ultimately, the success of Uganda in optimizing the ben-
efits from oil will be largely determined by the country’s
capacity to set up the stage for a non-oil economy in the
longer term. Successful countries have been those that have
used non-renewable resources to diversify their economies
by a combination of policies and actions aimed at building
the stock of physical and human capital and implementing
an effective social policy to protect vulnerable groups. Sim-
ply put, Uganda’s success will be measured by its capacity
to go up the ranking in the human capital index, the doing
business indicators, and access to basic infrastructure over
time.
