Management Response
World Bank Management thanks the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) for the
report Learning and Results in World Bank Operations: Toward a New Learning
Strategy—Evaluation 2. The report presents an interesting analysis of how learning
takes place through projects, and ways in which the World Bank can improve the
process to generate, access, and use learning and knowledge in operations.


General Comments
The report provides useful insights from the review of academic and management
literature. The analysis on informal learning and tacit knowledge in chapter 2 is of
particular interest as it highlights the importance of behavioral underpinnings
derived from mindsets, group effects, and institutional incentives. It will help
Management consider how it can strengthen the culture of learning within project
teams as well as within the organization more broadly.

Management is committed to the knowledge and learning agenda, which was one of
the key drivers behind the recent organizational reform. The creation of Global
Practices (GPs), one of the most ambitious reforms in the history of the World Bank
Group, was done exactly to improve the balance between global and local
knowledge, and to strengthen incentives for learning and knowledge sharing—two
issues the report recommends to improve. The operationalization of this reform is
still under way. Numerous implementation decisions, taken on an ongoing basis,
and new initiatives, recently launched and yet to be launched, are driven by the
same agenda. Some examples of such decisions and initiatives are: (i) the creation of
new roles (e.g., global leads) and new functions (e.g., program leaders) as well as
learning programs and communities of practice to develop and strengthen them so
that they can truly take root in the new structure; (ii) the launch of the Global
Delivery Initiative, which addresses the agenda of adaptability and learning from
implementation experience, both successes and failures; (iii) the launch of the
internal and external client satisfaction surveys (not mentioned in the report), which
systematically seek feedback on every lending operation and Advisory Services and
Analytics product, from internal as well as external clients on how global expertise
is brought and adapted to local circumstances, and how collaboration across the
matrix is working; (iv) a number of reforms in organizing the learning agenda,
including the creation of a dedicated Vice Presidential Unit for Learning,
Leadership, and Innovation (LLI) and an ambitious reform of the Operational



                                                                                       xv
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


Learning program; and (v) the implementation of incentives to operational teams to
improve knowledge flow across GPs.

The timing of the report as well as the methodology used were not optimal to draw
conclusions on the effect of the recent reorganization, and thus the findings should
be treated with caution. A large part of the evidence used in the report comes from
staff surveys undertaken before the reorganization. A limited number of interviews
with staff were conducted during the initial months after launching the new
structure. It should be noted that the benefits of an organizational reform take time
to materialize, while structural reorganization substantially affects staff morale, both
in the time leading up to the reorganization and during the implementation period.
The process is dynamic and adaptive by nature, and requires adjustments and
course corrections along the way. In spite of the timing of the staff surveys and
interviews, the report often makes statements about the effects and potential impact
of the reorganization, which at times come across as premature. For example, one
conclusion states that there is a “concern that the Region-centered tasks of practice
managers and the overstretching of global solutions leads will undercut global
technical knowledge.” Yet, this conclusion was written before the role of global
leads was implemented, thus raising questions regarding the applicability of the
recommendation arising from this conclusion. Management believes that the
findings of this evaluation are largely based on the knowledge management and
learning behaviors that existed before the reorganization, and should be interpreted
with caution, particularly noting that staff views were gathered at an unusual time
of change and uncertainty. It is Management’s view that the report should not be
used to make judgments or draw conclusions on the reorganization.

While Management agrees with the overall spirit of the recommendations, the
articulation of some recommendations is of concern. The main recommendations are
mostly reasonable and useful. For example, Management fully agrees with the
importance of improving the use of informal learning and tacit knowledge,
strengthening incentives to promote learning and development outcomes, ensuring
the right balance between global and local knowledge, and promoting adaptation
during project implementation. However, some of the specific recommendations are
either difficult to translate into monitorable indicators (e.g., “strengthen the
behavioral skills of staff so that informal learning … is maximized”), impractical to
implement and measure (e.g., a recommendation on “consistently promoting
suitably qualified technical experts to higher level positions”), or too specific and
overprescriptive (e.g., the suggestion that senior staff in newly created positions,
such as the Global Practices chief economist, preserve time for learning and
knowledge sharing). In sum, Management would like to reiterate its strong
commitment to the overall spirit of the main recommendations and intends to

                                                                  MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


address them, even though it has reservations with the specific wording of some
recommendations.


Specific Comments
Management believes that it is important to have a strategic approach to its learning
agenda. However, Management notes that the report takes a very broad view of the
concept of “learning”, encompassing a wide variety of elements that are already
covered by operational policies and procedures (e.g., restructuring of operations),
Human Resources (HR) policies and practices (e.g., performance management,
promotion criteria), knowledge and learning related initiatives and approaches (e.g.,
formal and informal knowledge sharing, operational learning), and LLI’s evolving
role. While Management agrees to the need to rely on a strategic approach in those
areas and to be clear on the accountabilities of the various stakeholders (GPs,
Regions, LLI, Operations Policy and Country Services, HR, and others), it is of the
view that a new strategy document, covering the entire spectrum of issues on which
the report touches, would not be effective nor practical.

Management welcomes the opportunity to strengthen the use of informal learning
and tacit knowledge. A number of measures are already under implementation. For
example, new guidelines for peer review have been developed. Also, an ambitious
Global Delivery Initiative has been launched, which will systematically, and at scale,
identify and document operational approaches that have worked as well as the
lessons and concrete experiences from adaptation or failures. Management is also
committed to develop other means to strengthen the use of informal learning and
tacit knowledge, including implementing more systematic mentoring opportunities,
increased opportunities for bite-sized learning, and strengthening staff’s ability to
apply knowledge about informal learning, mindsets, and group effects in their day-
to-day operational work.

Management acknowledges the importance of institutional incentives to promote
learning and development outcomes. At the same time, creating a perception that
time spent on lending somehow crowds out time spent on learning is contrary to the
belief held by Management that learning happens through lending and other
operational engagements, not at the cost of, or at the margin of, operational work.

Much has been done to address knowledge sharing and learning in the performance
management system. In 2014, an extensive exercise was conducted, including
through broad consultations, to identify the Bank’s core competencies. The exercise
identified to “create, share, and apply knowledge” as one of the core competencies.



                                                                                   xvii
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


The Overall Performance Evaluation process now explicitly includes an assessment
against those core competencies. The suggestion that promotion in technical streams
should happen “consistently” only based on technical competency, as recommended
in the evaluation, irrespective of actual business needs and budget implications,
would not be feasible.

Management is committed to support the right balance between mobilizing global
knowledge and expertise, and adapting that knowledge to the local context. To
strengthen the feedback loop to get this balance right, Management has now
established a mechanism to systematically ask key internal clients (e.g., task team
leaders, practice managers, and country directors) as well as external clients
(government counterparts) about both the global and the local dimensions of the
knowledge transfer, at critical milestones (e.g., Board approval, mid-term review,
project completion) for every operational and analytic engagement. Management
has started using (with adherence to the confidentiality rule), the data obtained from
those surveys to inform decisions. It is unfortunate that the report fails to mention
these satisfaction surveys, even though one was launched in January 2015 and plans
for the external launch were announced around the same time. Management also
notes that some of the specific recommended actions (e.g., recording time for
operational work across Regions and sectors) have already been undertaken.
Furthermore, there are already existing mechanisms (e.g., Accountability and
Decision Making Framework, allocation of country engagement budgets to GPs)
that allow Country Management Units to exercise “authority” with the GPs in order
to ensure the right fit between global knowledge and local context. To address
shortcomings and constraints (e.g., budget pressure), Management believes that
working across the matrix is first and foremost a matter of collaboration and
partnership between GPs and Regions, rather than exercising authority. To that
effect, incentives and signals from Management would be critical in harnessing such
collaboration.

Management promotes the concept of adaptation and proactive restructuring of
projects as warranted. At the same time, the evaluation places disproportionate
emphasis on the change in the Project Development Objectives (PDO) or Level 1
restructuring, which is an important tool but has been, and will continue to be, a
small percentage of all the cases of restructuring. As noted briefly in chapter 5, Level
2 restructuring allows for significant modifications to a project within the given PDO
and has been an important and versatile tool for project adaptability. Rather than
making restructuring the “default” and entering into a project expecting to
restructure it soon, Management believes that building maximum flexibility in the
original project design and minimizing the need to amend legal agreements is an
approach that is more conducive to learning, course correction, and adaptability.

Chairperson’s Summary: Committee on
Development Effectiveness
The Committee on Development Effectiveness met to discuss the Independent
Evaluation Group’s (IEG’s) Learning and Results in World Bank Operations: Toward a New
Learning Strategy—Evaluation 2 and Draft World Bank Management Response.

The committee welcomed the discussion Learning and Results in World Bank Operations:
Toward a New Learning Strategy—Evaluation 2 and the Draft World Bank Management
Response. This report was the second in program of evaluations by IEG that aims to
address how well the World Bank generates, accesses, and uses learning and
knowledge in its lending operations and to assess the scope for improvement. Members
concurred with the findings and supported the focus on informal learning and tacit
knowledge; mindsets and team effects; incentives for learning; balancing global and
local focus; adaptiveness; and linking learning to results.

Members underscored the need to balance tacit and formal learning and to bring
together global and local knowledge. They welcomed the evaluation’s link to the World
Development Report 2015 on Mind, Society, and Behavior, noting the importance of staff
understanding then addressing preconceptions that can come into play in Bank projects;
members highlighted that staff must continually incorporate new learning and
knowledge in operations. Members agreed with the importance of promoting
adaptiveness in project design and implementation. Some expressed caution with
having project restructuring (especially at Level 1) as the preferred or default option but
encouraged Management to think creatively on how to further encourage adaptive
implementation and build in flexibility in project design.

Members welcomed the various important learning initiatives the Bank has launched
but agreed that the disparate parts do not yet add up to a compelling whole. There was
significant discussion on whether the Bank should develop a new strategy for learning
and knowledge sharing. Members agreed that Management should take clear steps
toward developing a consolidated strategic and systemic approach to learning that
takes an inventory, ties together the many dimensions of learning, and lays out clear
governance arrangements and institutional accountabilities.

The committee acknowledged that learning is hard; all institutions struggle with it.
What’s important is that the Bank take concrete steps to address learning and
knowledge sharing in a coherent, constructive way. Members agreed that it is a gradual
process. Members commented that the key to ensuring successful implementation of the


                                                                                       xxix
CHAIRPERSON’S SUMMARY:
COMMITTEE ON DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
reorganization is culture change. To avoid stalling the process, energy and momentum
need to be maintained and real, proper incentives need to be in place—incentives that
establish an environment where learning leads to results. They underscored that these
incentives and the associated messaging and concrete actions that lead to a new
learning ethic need to come from the top so staff have clarity on how learning
contributes to their jobs and careers. These are key steps to ensuring the institution
transitions to a “solutions Bank.”

1. Approach
The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) is conducting a program of evaluations on
learning through lending. The two evaluations conducted to date have sought to
answer two overarching questions:

       How well has the World Bank learned in its lending operations?
       What is the scope for improving how it generates, accesses, and uses learning
        and knowledge in these operations?

Based on its review of the literature and its cumulative experience of evaluating World
Bank operations, IEG answers these questions with a particular focus on informal
learning and tacit knowledge, whose role has not been explicitly recognized in the Bank
to date. The first evaluation in this program of evaluations found, from Bank staff
surveys and interviews, that for the vast majority of staff the main source of learning
relating to lending is informal learning and tacit knowledge.

The learning that occurs in the process of preparing and implementing projects is, for
the most part, learning by doing, involving interactions with other members of a project
team. It is informal learning and can be characterized as a process or flow. Informal
learning gives rise to tacit knowledge, which is generated or depleted according to the
quality of the interactions between group members and the quality of individual
introspection. This includes engagement with clients. Informal learning and tacit
knowledge are not written down or captured in a database. They reside in the heads of
individuals, whether they are Bank staff or country clients.

The Bank has produced elements of a knowledge and learning strategy but the
disparate parts don’t yet add up to a compelling whole. Three actions have been taken
to date: (i) corporate reports on knowledge and learning have been produced;1 (ii)
knowledge and learning are integral parts of the corporate monitoring framework
developed in 2013; and (iii) knowledge flow is an indicator to be measured. Still to be
developed are the steps by which learning occurs and knowledge is generated and, in
particular, an articulation of the roles of informal learning and tacit knowledge. The
elements of such a strategy do exist. They are embedded in the science of delivery pilots
and case studies that have been launched, in the learning-from-failure and after-action
review workshops that have been sponsored, and in World Development Report 2015:
Mind, Society, and Behavior, which examines how mindsets and behaviors influence the
approach to development (World Bank 2015). What remains is for these elements to be
woven into a strategy persuasive to managers and their staff. While it is not IEG’s role



                                                                                        1
CHAPTER 1
APPROACH
to develop such an approach, this evaluation assesses the evidence that such an
approach must take into account.

Evaluation 2 in IEG’s program of learning evaluations complements Evaluation 1 (box
1.1) in three ways. It brings new evidence to bear; it assesses how learning and
knowledge sharing are likely to be affected by the Bank’s new organizational structure
introduced on July 1, 2014; and finally, it identifies actions to enhance the contribution
of learning and knowledge sharing to the achievement of results.


Box 1.1. What Evaluation 1 Found
The Challenge. As the world’s leading development finance agency, the World Bank has an
unrivaled opportunity to promote learning and knowledge sharing about development
effectiveness. Learning and knowledge services should be seen as complements to lending
rather than substitutes. But Bank lending has fallen in relation to developing country gross
domestic product. To remain relevant, the Bank must improve the quality of its learning and
knowledge services.
Critical Gaps. Bank staff perceive the lack of institutional incentives as one of the biggest
obstacles to learning and knowledge sharing in the Bank. Revamping the organizational
structure may be an important component of change but, without tackling the underlying
constraints relating to incentives and organizational culture, the benefits of reorganizations and
other measures aimed at fostering learning and knowledge sharing will be limited.
Levers at the Disposal of the Bank. Apart from the intrinsic motivation of staff, incentives—
such as signaling, leaders leading by example, rewards, recognition, and penalties—are the key
drivers of staff willingness to engage in learning and knowledge sharing behaviors, while
budgets and time allocation govern the ability of Bank staff to engage in such behaviors.
Evaluation 1 found instances of misalignment between incentives, budget, and time allocation
on the one hand and the Bank’s commitment to learning and knowledge sharing on the other.

How Evaluation 2 Helps the Bank’s Reform Efforts
The changes launched in FY15 are the most radical restructuring to have occurred since
FY97. Evaluation 2 is based on the premise that, to understand where the World Bank is
going, it is important to comprehend from where it has just come. Bureaucracies can be
subject to inertia, and the bigger the institution the greater the potential for inertia. The
World Bank is a big institution and it will take time to change acquired habits from one
day to the next.

The contribution of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) to the change process is to
suggest a baseline that the Bank may use to evaluate the reforms. This needs to be an



2
                                                                                CHAPTER 1
                                                                                APPROACH
extended baseline rather than a single point in time because: (i) the changes stretch
roughly from World Bank Group President Jim Kim’s launch of the change process in
FY12, through startup of the Global Practices (GPs) on July 1, 2014, then reaching to
early 2015 when the first fruits of change began to bud; and (ii) the bulk of the survey
and interview data that IEG uses as evidence for Evaluations 1 and 2 was captured
between 2012 and the end of 2014 (see appendix A for a timeline of the Bank reforms
and the points when data were collected). Without a baseline of this length, there is a
risk that everything that happens from FY15 forward—the bad as well as the good—
will be falsely attributed to the new structure. For example, the lending portfolio and
the pipeline were not reinvented on July 1, 2014. Given that the average life of
investment projects is seven years, the portfolio will always be the legacy of cumulative
changes stretching back for many years.

This evaluation can also help the Bank’s reform effort by providing early warnings for
any necessary course corrections.


Evidence
Given that this is a program of evaluations, the evidence is cumulative. This report,
unlike the first, contains recommendations for the Bank and draws on evidence
accumulated to date to support those recommendations. Therefore, whenever data
presented in Evaluation 1 sheds light on, or substantiates, findings from Evaluation 2,
the Evaluation 1 data are reprised.

Table 1.1 lists the sources of evidence and shows which was collected in each of the two
evaluations. Sources of new evidence in Evaluation 2 were collected using the following
instruments:

       Case studies of Bank projects in seven countries were chosen to cover a range of
        country types and sectors—without pretending to be in any sense representative
        of the Bank’s work as a whole. Four countries are large clients of the
        International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)—Mexico,
        Morocco, the Philippines, and Turkey. Two are clients of the International
        Development Association (IDA)—Ethiopia and Tanzania. One is Sri Lanka, an
        IBRD and IDA blend client. The case studies cover three sectors—education,
        health, and water, and three themes—community and local government
        capacity building, social protection, and access to finance. About 350 persons
        were interviewed, comprising Bank staff, country counterparts, development
        partners, and civil society representatives, the aim being to capture diverse
        perspectives on how effectively the Bank learns in the course of lending. The



                                                                                          3
CHAPTER 1
APPROACH
        countries and projects are listed in appendix B and the interview protocols are
        presented in appendix F.
       From November through December 2014, IEG conducted semi-structured
        interviews with 50 Bank staff, asking them how the change process and the
        Bank’s new organizational structure were likely to affect learning and
        knowledge sharing in operations. Interviewees ranged by grade level from vice-
        presidents to task team leaders (TTLs). The interview protocols are presented in
        appendix F.
       The evaluation team assessed the link between results and learning and the
        drivers of learning, as suggested in IEG’s Project Performance Assessment
        Reports. These reports were completed within the past five years for 10
        purposively selected projects, five of which were rated highly satisfactory on
        outcome or bank performance and five of which were rated unsatisfactory. The
        projects are listed in appendix C.
       IEG studied changes over time in the frequency with which the development
        objectives of investment projects are formally revised and the incentives for task
        team leaders to restructure early in the project cycle. IEG drew a random sample
        of IEG-rated projects, representative of each of the periods before and after
        January 1, 2005 (the date when the split-outcome rating was introduced for
        restructured projects in order to increase the incentive to restructure). IEG
        randomly sampled 297 projects out of the total of 1,290 investment projects with
        Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) dated before January 1,
        2005, and 320 out of the total 1,890 projects with ICRs dated from January 1,
        2005 forward (see appendix D).
       The evaluation team assessed the extent to which attributable outcomes are
        measured and reported based on a sample of the Bank’s ICRs. For this purpose,
        IEG drew a random and representative sample of 71 investment lending
        projects from the universe of 261 projects that exited the portfolio in FY12 (see
        appendix E).
       The evaluation team studied the mobility of staff across sectors and Regions
        using the universe of data (roughly 20,000 individual records) from the Bank’s
        Time Recording System from FY00 to FY14. The aim was to measure mobility
        before the GPs and Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas (CCSAs) were introduced to
        establish a baseline against which their impact on staff movement could be
        measured.
       A content analysis was performed of the responses to an open-ended question
        in the first GPs and CCSAs Rapid Survey, conducted in late September 2014. It
        was addressed to all staff mapped to the GPs and CCSAs, and attracted 1,430
        responses.

Caveats

Thus far, this program of evaluations has addressed learning in World Bank investment
lending—an assessment of development policy lending is not undertaken. The role of
the other institutions that make up the World Bank Group (i.e., International Finance
Corporation and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) also extend beyond the
present task.

Furthermore, Evaluation 2 was undertaken at a time when the Bank’s reorganization
was still unfolding. Consequently, the evaluation does not assess the extent of learning
and knowledge sharing under the new organizational structure. What this evaluation
does is to highlight the gaps and grey areas which, if not addressed in a timely manner,
are likely to compromise learning and knowledge sharing as the Bank moves ahead
with its reorganization.




                                                                                                                               5
CHAPTER 1
APPROACH

What Changed on July 1, 2014?
To understand whether the new Bank supports learning and knowledge sharing, it is
necessary first to consider the structures and roles introduced on July 1, 2014. The new
structure is a nested matrix: 19 individual matrices embedded in an outer matrix. Each
GP and CCSA has a Regional side and a thematic side (the inner matrix). The various
GPs and CCSAs are together nested in an outer matrix comprised of Regional and
Country Management Units on one side and the GPs and CCSAs on the other (figure
1.1).

Figure 1.1. The New Structure of World Bank Operations




Note: The structure varies slightly between Global Practices (GPs) and Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas (CCSAs); for example, some have more than one director, others add
thematic practice managers (e.g., Global Programs) to regional practice managers. AFR = Africa Region; EAP = East Africa and Pacific Region; ECA = Europe and Central Asia
Region; LCR = Latin America and the Caribbean Region; MNA = Middle East and North Africa Region; SAR = South Asia Region.




                                                                                                                                                                             7
The reorganization builds on the matrix structure that was introduced in FY97 (IEG
2012). The essentials of the new Bank are as follows:

       The sector and thematic side of the matrix is divided into 14 GPs and 5 CCSAs.2
       Each GP and CCSA is a matrix in itself. One side of the matrix is divided into
        Regional units, each headed by a practice manager. The other side of the matrix
        is divided into 5–10 thematic solutions areas, each with a global task and under
        the authority of a global solutions lead.3
       Practice managers are responsible for managing the Regional portfolio and
        report to the director of the corresponding GP or CCSA.
       Global solutions leads are responsible for ensuring that global (Bank-wide)
        knowledge on a particular theme is brought to bear in the work of their GP or
        CCSA; they report to the relevant senior director of the GP or CCSA.4
       Within the Country Management Units (CMUs), program leaders are
        introduced. They are staff with sector or thematic technical skills responsible for
        ensuring that the operations proposed by the GPs or CCSAs are tailored to a
        country’s needs.
       Each country director has four or so program leaders who report to them and
        divide up the 19 GPs and CCSAs among them.
       Control of the budget rests with the GP or CCSA, not the CMU.
       Staff no longer have to compete with each other to be assigned to operational
        tasks funded by CMUs (known as the internal market). Staff in the GPs and
        CCSAs represent a fixed cost.
       Cross-support (i.e., when staff are temporarily deployed to work on Regions
        and sectors outside their units) is part of the fixed cost paid for by the GPs and
        CCSAs, not by the CMUs.
       Staff in GPs and CCSAs report only to practice managers, but country
        management contributes to the staff member’s Overall Performance Evaluation.

In sum, in the new matrix, power has shifted from countries and Regions to sector and
thematic practices (GPs and CCSAs). This evaluation assesses whether the shift can be
accommodated with the Bank’s continuing pledge to make learning and knowledge
client driven and adapted to the context of individual countries.


Organization of the Report
From Bank staff surveys and interviews, Evaluation 1 found that, for the vast majority
of staff, the main source of learning relating to lending is informal learning and tacit
knowledge. Evaluation 2 probes that finding further. Chapter 2 mines the academic and
management literature to examine the behavioral underpinnings of informal learning

and tacit knowledge. It examines how mindsets and group effects influence the
behaviors that are brought to bear in project management. It considers what steps the
Bank has taken to improve the working of project teams.

Chapter 3 examines how individual and team behavior is mediated by the incentives
that the Bank offers staff. It examines the role of signals from management, the effects of
the budgeting process, and the influence on behavior from the criteria used for
evaluating staff performance and making promotion decisions. It examines steps taken
by the Bank to strengthen teams and to understand how organizational networks
operate.

The net effect of behavioral attributes and incentives will bear on how well projects are
designed and implemented. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 examine three operational orientations
of particular relevance to the new Bank: balancing of global and local knowledge,
adaptiveness, and results focus (figure 1.2).

Chapter 5 considers the balance between generating global knowledge and customizing
it to the country context. It uses evidence from country case studies to illustrate ways in


                                                                                          9

which the Bank has been effective—and sometimes less than effective—in using
knowledge generated outside the Bank, in nurturing country-specific knowledge or
“political economy” knowledge, and in combining cross-Region and cross-sector
knowledge to meet client needs. It analyzes whether the structure and the roles of the
new Bank favor an appropriate balancing of global and country priorities.

Chapter 5 examines adaptiveness: how lessons learned in the course of managing
projects can spur course corrections in the life of a single project and the evolution of
design over the course of a series of projects. Also discussed is one aspect of
adaptiveness which is the incentive to restructure projects that are performing poorly.

Chapter 6 addresses the link between learning and results. It uses evidence from project
evaluations to suggest what factors are conducive to learning and to good results. It
presents research findings on the relationship between the number of years that project
team members have worked in the Bank and the probability that quality at entry will be
rated satisfactory. It examines the quality of the evidence used in ICR Reviews to
demonstrate results and considers how project monitoring and evaluation
frameworks—how objectives are defined, how indicators are derived, and how
baselines are deployed—help determine how effectively results are reported.

Chapter 7 concludes by suggesting that the Bank now needs to prepare an updated
strategy for learning and knowledge sharing. It makes recommendations for the
strategy to be built around the elements examined in this evaluation: understanding
individual and team behaviors; providing sound institutional incentives to promote
learning and development outcomes; striking the right balance between use of global
and local knowledge; and promoting project adaptiveness.

2. Informal Learning and Tacit Knowledge:
Mindsets and Group Effects
Tacit knowledge is primarily gained through informal learning (box 2.1). Drawing on
insights from World Development Report 2015: Mind, Society, and Behavior (World Bank
2015) and other research, this chapter analyzes mindsets and how they may influence
the approach to development work. It then examines how the influence of mindsets is
further mediated by group effects, referring to the composition and operating rules of
teams and networks.


 Box 2.1. What Is Tacit Knowledge, and How Is It Best Acquired?
 The term “tacit knowledge” was first introduced into philosophy by Michael Polyani in 1958.
 Succinctly put, people can know more than they can tell (Polyani 1966). They are not often aware
 of the knowledge they possess or how it can be valuable to others. Tacit knowledge is knowledge
 that is either (i) inarticulable, that is, impossible to describe in propositional terms or (ii)
 articulable but only with some difficulty. Sources differ about whether it is possible (or useful) to
 codify tacit knowledge—whether it can be transformed into propositions that can be
 communicated by speaking or writing (Kimble 2013; Nonaka and von Krogh 2009).
 Tacit knowledge is usually seen to be acquired through direct personal experience although to
 some extent it may be informed by reading documents. Because it is hidden from the outside
 observer, and possibly even from the holder of the knowledge, it may also be difficult to identify
 and measure. Effective transfer of tacit knowledge generally requires extensive personal contact,
 regular interaction, and trust. This kind of knowledge can be revealed through practice in a
 particular context and transmitted through social networks. To some extent it is “captured” when
 the knowledge holder joins a network, a community of practice or a work team. Tacit knowledge
 is not easily shared. As well as practical knowledge (knowhow), it consists of beliefs, ideals,
 values, and mental models that are deeply ingrained and often taken for granted. An individual
 can acquire tacit knowledge without language. Apprentices, for example, work with their
 mentors and learn craftsmanship not through language but by observation, imitation, and
 practice.
 Hildreth and Kimble (2002) observed that attempts to convert tacit knowledge to explicit
 knowledge have often disappointed. Knowledge resides in people, not in machines or
 documents. Technology-driven processes (e.g., web portals, search engines, help desks, and
 document systems) have an important role to play but there are equally high returns to be had
 enrolling people in communities of practice whose members create, nurture, and sustain
 knowledge by interacting with each other.

                           INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS

Mindset Biases Influence Informal Learning
Development professionals, similar to other individuals, are subject to biases resulting
from their mental models. They have disciplinary, cultural, and ideological notions that
can make them susceptible to all kinds of biases that affect their decision making.

The World Development Report 2015, Mind, Society, and Behavior draws on psychological
and social underpinnings of behavior and identifies three pillars of human decision
making (World Bank 2015). First, individuals think automatically as it helps them to
simplify problems and evaluate situations based on their assumptions about the world.
Second, people think socially—social norms, social preferences, and social networks
influence our behavior. Finally, individuals use interpretive frames provided by their
mental models to perceive the world around them.

Research cited in the 2015 World Development Report (WDR) sheds light on the biases
of individual mindsets that must be mitigated if teams are to work effectively. To begin
with, there is the “flight from complexity.” Faced with a mass of complicated data,
people fall back on rules of thumb (heuristics), and they take short cuts to reach
decisions under pressure (World Bank 2015, 181–182). This may be an essential survival
mechanism, but it may also lead to an over simplification of reality. When confronted
with too much information on the dimensions of a problem people are likely to be
paralyzed unless they break the problem down into small parts that can be tackled
singly. The Apollo 13 crew faced this problem in December 1973 when dealing with a
life-threatening breakdown. Mission control had been sending more and more
directions, corrections, and orders to the astronauts. The lead astronaut responded by
shutting down communications with Houston for 12 hours, a vital respite which
allowed crew members to work on small, manageable tasks of their own devising, thus
enabling them to regain a sense of optimism and control (Weick 1984).

Second, people are subject to “confirmation bias,” meaning that any data is used
selectively to justify previously held beliefs. The WDR team conducted an experiment
with Bank staff to test this proposition. Staff had to interpret data on the effect of
minimum wage legislation. When the data squared with their prior assumptions
(whether they agreed with the statement “incomes should be made more equal” or “we
need large income differences as incentives for individual effort”), staff were more
accurate in interpreting whether or not the presented data showed that a rise in the
minimum wage reduced poverty (World Bank 2015, 182–183). Confirmation bias goes
hand in hand with a tendency to downplay the importance of data. “Seasoned
practitioners tend to regard evidence as one factor among many shaping what policies
become politically supportable and implementable and thus, on the basis of these latter
criteria, are deemed ‘effective’” (World Bank 2015, 187).


                                                                                         13
CHAPTER 2
INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
Third, task team leaders (TTLs) can be subject to “self-serving bias”—a tendency to
claim more responsibility for successes than failures.

Fourth, managers may suffer from “champion bias”—an inclination to evaluate a
proposal based on the track record of the person presenting it.

Fifth, even the most sophisticated may fall prey to the “sunk cost bias.” The WDR team
asked World Bank staff if they would commit remaining funds to a project that was off-
track and almost certain not to meet its objectives. As levels of sunk cost increased, so
did the propensity of the staff to continue disbursing. The data show a statistically
significant linear trend in the increase in likelihood of committing remaining funds
(World Bank 2015, 186).

Sixth, people may have a “poorly developed theory of mind”—a limited capacity to
imagine what other people know and how they are likely to behave in a particular
circumstance. Development professionals devoted to reducing poverty may find it hard
to place themselves in the shoes of the poor. In another experiment with Bank staff, the
WDR team found that “although 42 percent of Bank staff predicted that most poor
people in Nairobi, Kenya, would agree with the statement that ‘vaccines are risky
because they can cause sterilization,’ only 11 percent of the poor people sampled in
Nairobi actually agreed with that statement. Overall, immunization coverage rates in
Kenya are over 80 percent” (World Bank 2015, 180). The disparity in perceptions reflects
not just a gap in Bank staff knowledge but also a mistaken mental model of how
poverty influences the mindsets of poor people.

Understanding the various kinds of biases that can come into play in Bank projects is
the first step toward addressing them. So, for example, with regard to the peer review
process, project teams may face confirmation bias on two fronts: the nomination of their
peer reviewers and incorporation of ideologically consistent comments. One way to
overcome confirmation bias in the project design phase is to expose project teams to
opposing views. Red teaming is a method used by modern military and businesses to
fight confirmation bias. Under this procedure, an outside team challenges the plans and
ideas with the intention to provide opposing perspectives. A solution in the Bank could
be to have a pool of pre-identified peer reviewers for different kinds of Bank operations
and assign them to TTLs randomly to take away the possibility of choosing “friends and
family.”

The Behavioral Insights Team in the United Kingdom has developed the Easy,
Attractive, Social, and Timely (EAST) framework to help influence behavior (Service
and others 2014). The first principle implies that to encourage a certain behavior, one
should start by making it easy for the individual to do the right thing (figure 2.1). Ways

                           INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
of achieving this can include setting defaults or reducing the “hassle factor” of taking
up a service. The second principle posits that by making something more attractive, one
is better able to gain an individual’s attention. The third principle acknowledges that
human beings are social animals and are heavily influenced by their peers. Hence, a
useful tool for illustrating certain behaviors could be to show that most people are
performing the desired behavior. Finally, getting the timing right, for example,
prompting people when they are likely to be most receptive, can be a highly effective
way of supporting individual action.

The EAST principles can provide pointers on how several Bank processes may be
improved. For example, with regard to the Bank’s peer review process, one way to
make it easier for the peer reviewer and more useful for the TTL would be for the
project TTL to flag areas of concern as early as possible, areas on which the peer
reviewers’ feedback are deemed indispensable. The guidelines for investment project
financing indicate that peer reviewers should be identified at the stage of project
concept review; but feedback to TTLs before the concept review meeting could often be
helpful. Furthermore, harnessing the power of social recognition in the peer review
process might mean, for example, including the reviewer’s name and comments in
publicly-disclosed project documents, thus providing a greater incentive for peer
reviewers to give their all and to weigh their words carefully. The Global Practices Vice-
Presidency has recently finalized guidelines for peer reviewer selection and terms of
reference for peer reviewers. This is an important initiative, but the details were not
available when this report was written so the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
could not to assess whether behavioral principles like those suggested by EAST are
reflected in the guidelines.

With regard to project restructuring, to enhance its attractiveness and ensure that staff
continually incorporate new learning and knowledge in operations, the terminology
could be changed from “restructuring,” which some staff contend has a stigma attached
to it, to “agile and adaptive project implementation.” The resistance to restructuring is
partly influenced by the “sunk cost bias” referred to earlier: the reluctance by the
project team and the country counterparts to countenance change of a design in which
considerable resources have already been invested. Greater awareness of this bias is a
first step toward embracing restructuring rather than retreating from it.

                           INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS


Team Characteristics Influence Informal Learning
The biases in individual mindsets do not disappear when individuals join teams—
indeed, they may be reinforced. Teambuilding centers on informal learning and the
generation of tacit knowledge. Because they derive from copying others’ behavior,
informal learning and tacit knowledge are eminently conservative and tend to be
uncritical—they reinforce received wisdom rather than challenging the status quo.
Therefore, as well as correcting for biases in individual mindsets, attempts to promote
smart learning need to take account of the obstacles to effective team performance.

Are teams innately wiser than individuals? The WDR (World Bank 2015, 183) reports
substantial research evidence that groups make more consistent and rational decisions
than individuals, and are less likely “to be influenced by biases, cognitive limitations,
and social considerations” (Charness and Sutter 2012, 158). When asked to solve
complex reasoning tasks, groups succeed 80 percent of the time, compared to 10 percent
when individuals are asked to solve those tasks on their own (Evans 1989). Efforts to
debias people on an individual basis run up against several obstacles, including the
problem that critical thinking skills appear to be domain specific and may not
generalize beyond the particular examples supplied in the debiasing efforts
(Willingham 2007; Lilienfeld, Ammirati, and Landfeld 2009). When individuals are
asked to read studies whose conclusions go against their own views, they find so many
flaws and counterarguments that their initial attitudes are sometimes strengthened, not
weakened (Lord, Ross, and Lepper 1979).

But it is also important to recognize that judgments made by groups may be fallible.
One requirement for good team judgment is that people’s decisions are independent of
one another. If everyone let themselves be influenced by each other’s guesses, there is
more chance that the guesses will drift toward a misplaced bias. This undermining
effect of social influence was demonstrated in 2011 by a team at the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology in Zurich. They asked groups of participants to estimate certain
quantities in geography or crime, about which none of them could be expected to have
perfect knowledge, but all could hazard a guess—the length of the Swiss-Italian border,
for example, or the annual number of murders in Switzerland. The participants were
offered modest financial rewards for good group guesses to make sure they took the
challenge seriously. The researchers found that, as the amount of information
participants were given about each other’s guesses increased, the range of their guesses
got narrower, and the center of this range could drift further from the true value. In
other words, the groups were tending toward a consensus to the detriment of accuracy
(Lorenz and others 2011).




                                                                                          17
CHAPTER 2
INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
This finding challenges a common view in management and politics that it is best to
seek consensus in group decision making. What you can end up with instead is herding
toward a relatively arbitrary position. Just how arbitrary depends on what kind of pool
of opinions you start off with and how much information you give to participants about
each other’s answers. In sum, the “wisdom of the crowd” resides more in the statistical
reality that the larger the group the greater the diversity of characteristics than in the
existence of a distinctive team virtue characterized by good will and an intention to
collectively arrive at the best decision.

There is a second respect in which the tacit learning generated through teamwork may
lead to poor decisions. People who make judgments by working with others are more
confident in those judgments than they would be if they had arrived at them by
themselves. They may become overconfident to the extent that they ignore input from
outside the group. The resulting myopia wipes out any advantage that the group as a
decision maker has over the individual (box 2.2). Discussions among people who share
similar views can lead them to become more extreme in their positions (Schkade,
Sunstein, and Hastie 2010). In those circumstances, hearing from others only confirms
biases. The failure to confront individuals with differing views can lead to consistently
biased decision making (World Bank 2015, 183).


Box 2.2. Two or More Heads Are Not Always Better than Onea
To test the hypothesis that confidence born of collaboration takes a toll on the quality of
judgment, Minson and Mueller (2012) asked 252 people to estimate nine quantities related to
U.S. geography, demographics, and commerce, either individually or in pairs after discussion.
They were then offered the estimates of other individuals and pairs and allowed to revise their
own; the final estimates therefore could come from the efforts of two to four people.
Participants earned a $30 bonus for each of two estimation rounds, but lost $1 for each
percentage point their answer deviated from the correct one. Individuals also rated their
confidence in their judgments.
The results showed that people working with a partner were more confident in their estimates
and significantly less willing to take outside advice. The pairs’ guesses were marginally more
accurate than those of the individuals at first. But after revision (or lack thereof) that difference
was gone. Even the combined judgments of four people yielded no better results than those of
two or three. Finally, the researchers found that had the pairs yielded to outside input, their
estimates would have been significantly more accurate. Their confidence was costly.
a. The title is drawn from the proverb, “two heads are better than one, but ten without wit are worse than none.” It was first
recorded in 1546 by John Heywood, an English writer.


So should teamwork be dropped? No, but since collaboration is expensive and time
consuming, it makes sense for team builders to have realistic expectations and to be
aware of what makes for good teamwork. A group of 10 may not be 10 times better.

                                                                                   CHAPTER 2
                           INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
Some researchers have found that the biggest incremental gain accrues to going from
one decision maker to two (Minson and Mueller 2012). For each additional person, the
benefit drops off in a downward sloping curve. Most important is awareness of the
costs of teamwork. If team members are aware that collaboration leads to
overconfidence, they are more likely to review each member’s input more thoroughly.
Other researchers have shown that group deliberation among people who disagree but
who have a common interest in the truth can harness confirmation bias to create “an
efficient division of cognitive labor” (Mercier and Sperber 2011). In these settings,
people are motivated to produce the best argument for their own positions as well as to
critically evaluate the views of others.

The key to productive informal learning is ensuring that groups are diverse enough in
composition and open enough to knowledge from outside to ensure continuous
competition between new and old ideas—resulting in the same process of pruning and
strengthening that characterizes the development of the individual brain. Members of
smart teams have equal voice, show empathy, and are of diverse composition (box 2.3).
New ideas are more likely to arise in heterogeneous teams with different backgrounds
and perspectives (Andriopoulos and Lewis 2010; Beckmann 2006; Eriksson 2013; Lavie
and Rosenkopf 2006; Lin, Yang, and Demirkan 2007). Social network experiments have
shown that a herd-like mentality or group think, when individuals slavishly follow the
single most frequently voiced idea, is counterproductive. This result also was
demonstrated in a financial market experiment involving data from 10 million trades,
which showed that returns on investment followed a parabola, peaking at the midpoint
where traders were neither too isolated nor too herd oriented (Pan, Altshuler, and
Pentland 2012; Pentland 2014).

Integration with Social Networks Influences Informal Learning
To become smarter at promoting learning, the Bank needs to pay more attention to how
integration with social networks influences informal learning. Networks are important
because research has found that learning from others is much more efficient than
learning solely from one’s own experience (Rendell and others 2010; Lazer and
Friedman 2007; Glinton, Scerri, and Sycara 2010; Anghel and others 2004; Sueur and
others 2012; Farrell 2011). Mathematical models of learning in complex environments
suggest that the best strategy for learning is to spend 90 percent of time on finding and
copying others who appear to be doing well. The remaining 10 percent should be spent
on individual experimentation and thinking things through (Rendell and others 2010).

Box 2.3. What Makes a Team Smart?
A series of studies linked to the collective intelligence research program of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology have identified the factors that make teams “smart.” To begin with,
researchers found that team smartness is not driven by the intelligent quotients (IQs) of team
members. Teams with a higher average IQ did not perform group tasks better than teams with a
lower average. Neither do teams of people who self-describe as extraverts and highly motivated
perform better. The ability to handle group tasks was measured by testing logical analysis,
brainstorming, coordination, planning, and moral reasoning. Smart teams have three
characteristics:
    Members contribute equally—the team is not dominated by one or two outspoken
     individuals.
    Members show empathy—they are good at reading what people outside the team feel,
     know, and believe (i.e., they have a theory of mind).
    Diverse teams work better than homogeneous teams, but in the best-performing teams
     women outnumber men.
A study published in December 2014 made the counterintuitive finding that smart teams are
just as smart online as they are offline. Their superior theory of mind works as well in computer
interactions as it does in face-to-face encounters.

An abundant literature indicates how connections to social networks and team
dynamics influence learning. This may be described as the “interpersonal dimension” of
learning, to distinguish it from the individualized learning that comes from perusing
documents and databases. The more connections are established between people, the
greater the scope for learning from others. Social network experiments have shown that
a learning curve moves from low returns, when individuals largely work in isolation
from each other, to high returns, when individuals interact more, and there is an
exchange of diverse ideas, the best being copied (Pan, Altshuler, and Pentland 2012;
Pentland 2014).


What Has the Bank Done?
Early on in the reform process, the Bank staged workshops to introduce operational
staff to the principles of the after-action review, a team-based reflection on lessons
learned conducted while memories are still fresh (IEG 2014, 74–75). In February 2014,
the Results, Knowledge, and Learning team of the then Sustainable Development
Network of the Bank hosted a week-long internal learning experience for more than
1,000 staff that was built around peer-to-peer learning concepts and which aimed to
encourage co-creation of knowledge, elicitation of tacit knowledge, and

                            INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
contextualization of global knowledge. Participant perceptions gathered on-site, right
after the event, and four months later confirmed the learning hypotheses: the smaller
the groups, the more personal the learning experience was perceived to be; and the
more involved the participants in co-creating the knowledge to be shared, the higher
the perceived value and memory retention by staff. Some of the formats are being tried
in other parts of the Bank.

Recently there have been other attempts to promote teamwork. The Bank unit
responsible for developing the Operational Core Curriculum (OCC) has included a
behavioral module that treats team building as an integral part of project design and
includes team-based role playing exercises (box 2.4). Given that staff have to graduate
from the OCC before they may be appointed as TTLs, this is an important step toward
promoting team formation skills. A further step, taken one year ago, was to require
OCC participants to be paired with a mentor during training.

Another important move, made in late 2014, was to formalize arrangements for two
staff to be appointed as co-TTLs. This development, which was strongly supported by
the staff interviewed by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) for this evaluation,
increases, among other things, the scope for empowering locally recruited staff in
country offices who may now share the credit for designing and implementing
operations with staff in headquarters. With regard to team work overall, there is still a
perception that rewards need to be more broadly shared, acknowledging the
contribution of all team members not just those of TTLs.

Bank learning specialists interviewed by IEG identified two obstacles to fortifying team
behavior. First, highly trained technical specialists tend to assume that their technical
expertise is enough by itself to ensure effective delivery. They are skeptical about the
value of behavioral training and top managers have not sent the signals needed to
disabuse them. Second, Bank training courses that do include behavioral components
are stratified—there are separate courses for supervisors, emerging leaders (high
performing G- and H-level staff), managers, and directors. While there is logic to this
separation (e.g., that staff at the same level can interact without being inhibited by
hierarchy), it would make sense to complement the existing approach with training
days when staff at different grades work together. Also, the learning specialists made a
case to IEG for embedding them in project teams, an initiative that would be more likely
to succeed if it were backed by senior management.

Box 2.4. Behavioral Training for Task Team Leaders
The World Bank unit responsible for developing the Operational Core Curriculum (OCC) has
included a behavioral module that treats team building as an integral part of project design.
Given that staff have to graduate from the OCC before they may become task team leaders
(TTLs), this step is important for promoting team formation skills. Using team-based, role
playing exercises, OCC trainers encourage staff to develop the following skills:
Forming. Team members get to know each other and acquaint themselves with the purpose,
objectives, and expectations of the training course. OCC trainers are alert to the range of
participant behaviors: politeness, shyness, boldness in presenting self and credentials,
reluctance to commit, curiosity, and eagerness.
Storming. Trainers mediate brainstorming exercises that involve competition between ideas and
between team members, with respect to the mission and goals of a typical project team.
Behaviors likely to occur are: challenges to team leaders; difficulties in ensuring that each
member is accountable; and confrontation between those comfortable with conflict and those
who respond to conflict by silence and withdrawal.
Norming. Create norms around decision making, conflict management, resource allocation, and
communication. A team unites around a common goal and plans for results. The following
behaviors need to be anticipated and managed: conciliation, collaboration, ambition, and
responsibility.
Performing. Support continuous learning and leadership by all when appropriate. Be ready to
provide support, whether or not it is requested. Clarify who is accountable for what. Develop
strategies, define goals and track results. Discuss how to lead, and when and how leaders
should delegate and rotate. Beware of the temptation to micromanage. Practice constructive
feedback.
Celebrating. Learn to recognize contributions by each member of the group, to celebrate success
and to empathize in the event of failure. Learn to anticipate and to handle the strong emotions
that might be kindled: joy, sadness, pride, fondness of each other, and desire by some to move
on and by some to stay longer.

Is it the quality of the TTL or the quality of his or her team that drives results? World
Bank research has shown that there is a strong association between project Outcome
ratings and the identity of the TTL. Some TTLs work on projects that are consistently
rated more highly than projects led by other TTLs. Moreover, “task team leader fixed
effects are of comparable importance to country fixed effects in accounting for the
variation in project outcomes” (Denizer, Kauffman, and Kraay 2011, 2). However, this
research was not able to sort out the effect of individual TTL attributes (e.g., education,
experience) from the effect of team attributes. Maybe the TTLs of “satisfactory” projects
were not individually more gifted than their less successful peers; they simply had
better teams to work with. Learning specialists are sympathetic to the view that more

                            INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
work is needed to establish if this reflects the innate quality of the TTL or the quality of
the team that he or she puts together (or both).

Furthermore, regarding the effectiveness of project teams, it may be that different types
of projects call for different levels of team diversity. Blueprint projects (typical of the
energy and infrastructure sectors where approaches are tried and tested) may be more
likely to benefit from homogenous teams acting cooperatively, whereas projects
requiring experimentation and innovation would perhaps benefit from heterogeneous
teams where team members bring different perspectives: this idea merits investigation.
Matching team characteristics to project characteristics may help to promote learning
and knowledge sharing. The Bank’s reward system will also affect the team dynamic. If
the TTL rather than the entire team gets all or most of the recognition, the cohesiveness
of the team and collaborative spirit will suffer. It remains to be seen whether the Bank’s
budget cutbacks can be implemented without compromising team diversity or the
proper reward of team effort. More generally, the Bank could adjust its training courses
to reflect the sort of research findings that this report has highlighted concerning the
characteristics of effective teams.

SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS SHEDS SOME LIGHT ON LEARNING
Access to the knowledge needed to prepare and implement projects, and the scope for
learning in the project process, are influenced by the organizational networks in which
staff are embedded. Cognizant of this, before the recent reorganization, two Bank units
separately conducted a social network analysis. The first was carried out by Financial
and Private Sector Development (FPD) and the second by Energy and Mining (EM).
Surveys were launched to measure (i) the total number of connections among staff and
(ii) the number of steps needed for one person—the knowledge seeker—to reach
another person—the knowledge provider. To reach the knowledge provider, the seeker
typically had to deal with several other people by face-to-face meetings, telephone calls,
or e-mail exchanges. Each of these steps was counted. In the case of FPD, the number of
steps between seeker and provider averaged 3.6 (FPD 2013). Eighteen months later, the
total number of connections among FPD staff had increased by 44 percent, and the
average number of steps decreased from 3.6 to 3.2. EM averaged 10.1 connections per
knowledge provider, higher than FPD (9.4) before its pilot, but lower than FPD post-
pilot (13.5). The range of such provider-seeker connections in EM was large: from 0 to
63.

These two exercises in social network analysis made four findings. First, cross-support
and learning events were important ways to increase connectivity. Second, both Bank
units found that it took more than three years for newcomers to become well-integrated
as measured by the time it took them to reach the average level of ties within the
network. Third, senior staff did most of the connecting and were likely to be


                                                                                           23
CHAPTER 2
INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
overburdened by requests for advice. In EM, staff at levels GH+ accounted for 22
percent of staff, but were responsible for 40 percent of all connections. Fourth, the staff
in country offices were isolated from knowledge and learning networks relative to
headquarters staff. People tended to connect with others who were recruited by the
same route, with little outreach by headquarters staff to locally hired staff in country
offices.

It would be wrong to assume from the research literature quoted and the Bank’s
excursions in social network analysis that more is necessarily better. A large number of
links between seekers and providers and a high proportion of time devoted to
teamwork may be a step in the right direction, but they are no guarantee of a
productive outcome. Although connections and teamwork are a necessary part of the
creative workplace, these are not sufficient to ensure that the most important and the
most relevant knowledge is transferred and the best knowledge is nurtured. The FPD
and EM surveys were not able to assess the quality of the knowledge exchanged
between network members—specifically, how much better it was than if the
knowledge-seeker had alone sought answers from the documents and databases.

The Bank experiments with organizational network analysis did not distinguish
between the different types of knowledge that people were typically seeking and
providing (i.e., technical, process, interpersonal, and country). This type of information
would have helped to identify misuse of an expert’s time. A person may be both a
technical and an operational expert, having a competitive advantage, but if there are
relatively few technical experts, it would be better to use his or her time on technical
questions and force people to go to others for the operational expertise (comparative
advantage).

Also, while the time taken to integrate new recruits may reduce efficiency, integration is
not always an unqualified good. It may lead to attrition of the distinctive knowledge
that recent entrants brought from outside the Bank. In the three to five years that it
takes for new recruits to be established in the Bank, they may lose the cutting-edge
knowledge they brought with them. Thus, to the extent that slow onboarding
temporarily insulates this distinctive external knowledge, it may be a plus not a
minus—contrary to what is suggested in the write-up of these two cases of network
analyses.

This is not to say that organizational network analysis is futile. By identifying the
primary knowledge providers in a network and the areas where providers are
overloaded with demands, managers may plan for recruitment and retirement more
effectively by anticipating the threat to the effectiveness of the network posed by the
removal of key players.

                             INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
Another implication is that it is not enough to plan training individual by individual
because individuals rotate. The learning plan should perhaps embrace the collectivity,
the social network in which individual TTLs are embedded. A future ‘learning agenda’
at the Bank must go beyond a focus on preparing programs for individuals and pursue
initiatives that build collective capabilities to implement.

In sum, organizational network analysis is a powerful way to visualize communication
gaps. Identifying insiders and outsiders may be the first step in a strategy to build and
sustain learning pathways. But it will not be enough by itself. If the Bank is to realize
the potential of the tacit knowledge embedded in the heads of staff, it will need to
become smarter at building teams—because working with others is the main breeding
ground for tacit knowledge. Not all teams perform well. For the Bank to effectively
nurture teams it first needs to understand the mindsets that individuals bring to the
team, and second to understand team dynamics—how decision making in teams differs
from decision making by individuals.

INFORMAL LEARNING PREDOMINATES IN OPERATIONS
IEG has found through staff interviews and a survey that Bank staff —particularly
TTLs—mainly acquire learning in the Bank informally. This squares with research on
organizational learning. According to one study, people are five times more likely to
turn to a coworker rather than a book, a manual, or a database (Davenport and Prusak
1998). Over 80 percent of the respondents to IEG’s 2014 survey of Bank staff agreed to a
very large or substantial extent that they had learned from learning by doing and from
conversation (table 2.1). There is a statistically significant difference between TTLs and
non-TTLs in this respect (figure 2.2).

highly than formal sources such as training, quality assurance review meetings,

                             INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
Movement between jobs (which is spurred on by the Bank’s 3–5–7 process of staff
rotation) was rated much less highly as a source of learning than cross-support. Only 15
percent of staff rated debriefing by outgoing TTLs as a significant source of learning
whereas 56 percent of staff agreed that mentoring was important for learning. In other
words, some sources of informal learning are rated more highly than others.

Why does Bank staff attach so much importance to informal learning? Timeliness and the
perceived reliability of information may be governing factors. Possibly, in organizations
like the Bank, where time for learning is limited and project deadlines are always
impending, the staff may favor informal to formal means of learning because information
can be assimilated more quickly and with less effort. Staff may prefer to talk to people
whose expertise they trust, rather than consult documents, because they perceive that
the information is more likely to be up to date and reliable. (This observation merits the
caveat that informal learning will always, to some extent, involve the transmission of
knowledge that was formally acquired—staff with years of university study do not
suddenly forget their book learning when they join the Bank even if some of their
intellectual capital is depleted in the course of preparing and implementing projects.)

Tacit knowledge is based on an intuitive sense of what works. Various people told IEG
that TTLs’ effectiveness depends on their ability to rapidly filter out information that is
not directly relevant to the operational task at hand. This process may be verbalized,
but it is likely to be only partially written down—indeed, it may be totally
undocumented. “Learning through doing” like this would appear to draw on the “fast
thinking” part of the brain as opposed to the slow thinking involved in reading and
inward reflection (Kahneman 2010).

MENTORING IS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMAL LEARNING
The support for mentoring as a source of learning that emerged from the results of
IEG’s survey was echoed in the interviews and focus groups conducted by IEG.
Interviewees observed that mentoring has taken a variety of forms at the Bank. Some
participants noted that when they joined the Bank a formal mentoring program was in
place. Others noted that they worked for years as part of a collaborative team where
they were given a chance to take on some responsibility but not expected to do
everything on their own. Only after they had substantial experience were they allowed
to take over supervision and after that given a project to design. Others described co-
TTL arrangements or operating as a “shadow TTL.” Whether mentoring is formal or
informal, what counts is the opportunity for novices to work side by side with seasoned
TTLs (particularly on missions). The people skills that mentoring fosters are perhaps
more important than the technical skills. To work well, the mentors have to be vetted,
not randomly paired off with new staff. Participants stressed that whatever form it

takes, mentoring is only effective if it has strong management support and a dedicated
budget.

Staff told IEG that new entrants to the Bank did not receive adequate mentoring (figure
2.3). Only 14 percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that new staff have
sufficient operational and technical experience to operate effectively as TTLs. Mentoring
is generally perceived to have fallen by the wayside, partly because the budget for
supervision missions is too tight to accommodate both the TTL and a fledgling.
Interviewees told IEG that managers need to invest in mentoring. However, managers
can’t mentor when they have more than 25 people reporting to them—the span of
control is too great.

According to interviewees problems arise in the absence of mentoring. If a TTL is
launched without adequate preparation, he or she may seek to compensate for his/her
lack of skills by hiring consultants. But, unless they are former Bank TTLs, consultants
will only bring technical knowledge to bear, not the operational know-how that is
needed to deliver projects that perform well. Novices are sometimes recruited as TTLs
before they are ready. Some interviewees observed that this tends to happen more in
country offices where staff insist on becoming TTLs, but have neither the international
experience to draw on nor the network of contacts at headquarters. When they fail, they
are dropped as TTLs, having been set-up for failure. This is not a new problem. In 1992,
the working group on information technology that contributed to the Wapenhans
report noted that the quality of project supervision is closely linked to the experience
and dedication of the TTL (Wapenhans 1992). The group concluded that the increasing

use of relatively inexperienced staff as TTLs was one of the major contributors to
supervision shortcomings.

In FY16, the Bank’s Learning and Leadership Initiative will pilot a mentoring program
in partnership with several Vice-Presidencies. There is much to learn from the Bank’s
past attempts to institute mentoring programs, formally and informally. An important
consideration is the cost of formal programs relative to alternatives. If, as staff told IEG,
most learning happens ‘on the job’ then it might make sense to adapt project teams
rather than invest in formal mentoring. Building on the approval of “co-TTLship” in
FY15, one option would be to push further with pairing senior and junior staff, or
jointly assigning responsibilities to locally recruited staff in a country office and
internationally recruited staff in Washington, DC.

BANK STAFF RATE TEAM DIVERSITY AND TEAM INTEGRITY HIGHLY
Research suggests that the diversity of a team and the way that it operates is likely to
influence informal learning and the scope for achieving results. In an earlier
reorganization of the Bank (1987), there was a keen awareness of the need for effective
team building based on previous experience in the projects divisions, which were
characterized by a strong team spirit. It was emphasized that task teams needed to have
the right skills mix and experience, and there should be a TTL backup—a permanent
staff member who could take over if the TTL moved on. Participants in IEG interviews
and focus groups observed that the most effective TTLs are those capable of mobilizing
a diverse team, with members whose skills complement, rather than substitute or
duplicate, the skills of the TTL.

Questionnaire respondents and interviewees told IEG that budget cuts and the
persistence of a “compliance culture” undermines team diversity. When budgets are
tight there is less scope for contracting technical experts in general or the most talented
in particular. First priority is given to the specialists in safeguards, procurement, and
financial management.

But two survey data sources do not bear out the impression that team diversity is
lacking. In the 2013 Employee Engagement Survey, 72 percent of Bank employees
strongly agreed or agreed that “my work group has a climate in which diverse
perspectives are valued”—compared to 73 percent in the 2009 survey. In 2013, 69
percent of TTLs responded strongly agree or agree. Although this question did not refer
specifically to the diversity of perspectives in project teams, the experience of these teams
probably colored the response to the question, particularly for TTLs. IEG’s 2014 survey
of Bank staff found that almost two-thirds of respondents (62 percent) regard project
teams to be diverse, encompassing individuals with different perspectives. This

perception was more frequently held by country-based TTLs than TTLs located at
headquarters (figure 2.4).

*p = 0.00.

With respect to the distribution of rewards within the team, about 40 percent of the
respondents strongly agreed or agreed with the statement that good performance by the
whole team is recognized, not just the performance of the TTL. No significant difference
was found in this respect between TTLs at headquarters and those in country offices.

In terms of team cohesiveness, the message from the IEG survey was relatively positive.
Less than one-third of respondents strongly agreed or agreed that there was a lack of
team work. However, in interviews and focus groups, several people pointed out that
team integrity had eroded over time. They noted that in the past, projects were staffed
with larger teams, and the full team went on mission for 10 days to two weeks. As
budgets tightened missions got shorter, and it became rare to have the full team
together. Increasingly, only the TTL is present for the mission’s full length. Interviewees
observed that the rest of the team tends to fly in at different times, each working in
separate cells. This was attributed in part to budget constraints but also to availability.
Interviewees told IEG that everyone is doing more with less, which adds demands to
everyone’s time and makes it difficult to schedule people to meet together. For the same
reason, the provision for debriefing outbound TTLs has languished. When IEG
surveyed Bank staff, only 15 percent of respondents reported that learning occurred to a
substantial or very large extent as a result of handover notes or exit interviews with
staff who were leaving.

                                                                                     CHAPTER 2
                             INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
The same finding about TTL handover emerged from another source of evidence
collected by IEG. A review of highly satisfactory and unsatisfactory projects conducted
for this evaluation showed that, because so much operational and technical knowledge
is confined to people’s heads, the gaps in handover between team leaders of projects is
an important source of learning discontinuity. Several of the TTLs interviewed for the
study said that there is very little overlap of TTLs at the moment of handover.
Handover missions are not carried out systematically, and it is left to TTLs to make the
time to seek out staff who had worked earlier on the operation.

Several solutions were discussed at IEG’s recent Design Lab. For example, having a
“permanent” co-TTL based in the project’s country office could ensure continuity and
institutional memory after the handover to a new TTL at headquarters. In addition,
ensuring that handover notes from the departing TTL are easily retrievable from the
World Bank’s internal data systems would greatly aid the new TTL particularly in the
first few months when he or she takes over, has a learning curve, is still completing
lingering tasks from the old job, and, might therefore have a limited cognitive
bandwidth—scarce time and mental attention. Furthermore, for their Overall
Performance Evaluation, the old and new TTLs could be feedback providers for each
other.

INFORMAL LEARNING, TACIT KNOWLEDGE, DOCUMENTATION, AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS HAVE A ROLE
The new Bank aspires to be a Solutions Bank, not a Knowledge Bank. In the past, the
Bank sought to strengthen its position as the world’s leading repository of knowledge
about development. The Bank’s new thrust recognizes, first, that stored knowledge
needs regular updating; and information management and library staff are part of that
effort. Second, the investment in web portals and knowledge search tools (e.g., Ask
SoFi, launched in October 2014) is a step toward linking to knowledge outside the Bank
as well as within its walls, although further enhancements in information technology
will likely be needed to ensure state of the art systems for capturing, storing, and
collating Bank knowledge so that Bank staff do not have to rely on google searches to
find their own work or that of their colleagues. However, these important initiatives do
not lessen the import of this evaluation’s central message about the need to foster
learning by strengthening the opportunities for informal exchanges within and outside
the Bank. Connectivity needs to be enhanced. One way to do this is by drawing on the
insights gleaned from the Bank’s recent experience with organizational network
analysis.

Document production will remain important but its role will vary from project to
project. If a project involves tried and tested solutions that are not subject to immediate
change, the project experience will likely be amenable to codification and distillation. If,
however, the project involves solutions whose effectiveness in particular circumstances


                                                                                           31
CHAPTER 2
INFORMAL LEARNING AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE: MINDSETS AND GROUP EFFECTS
is not yet fully known or whose solutions vary significantly depending on the context,
experimentation, iteration, flexibility, and adaptation will be key. In such cases, any
documentation (written or electronic) of the project’s experience would best be in the
form of options considered, pros and cons of each option, the option chosen and why,
what trade-offs were made, and what the preconditions of success were or why the
project failed, while also identifying a series of questions to ask that help customization
to the local context. New information technology makes this easier to do. The Bank’s
SkillFinder web tool can be used to find the people best placed to help frame questions
and propose solutions. LinkedIn is a way to locate expertise outside the Bank.

Since informal learning is nurtured through interpersonal exchange and teamwork, it
behooves the Bank to apply research findings to developing an updated strategy that
acknowledges how mindsets and teams are likely to influence consequential decisions
bearing on operational results. The next chapter examines how the behaviors that
individuals and teams bring to project management are mediated by the incentives that
the Bank brings to bear.

3. Incentives
The World Bank’s operating environment creates a set of incentives that influence
individuals and teams, influencing the importance given to informal learning and tacit
knowledge (figure 3.1). In the survey by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of
Bank staff, the lack of institutional incentives was singled out more frequently than any
other factor as one of the three biggest obstacles to learning and knowledge sharing: 52
percent of respondents named incentives as an obstacle. Participants in IEG interviews
and focus groups reinforced this message.

The survey also found that, when asked to select from a list of options, of the three
actions most likely to encourage learning in the Bank’s lending operations, the highest
percentage of staff chose allotting sufficient time for learning in the Work Program
Agreement (66 percent), followed by allotting sufficient budgets (57 percent) and by
greater recognition to learning in the staff promotion criteria (38 percent).

Time, Budget, and Lending Pressure

IEG’s content analysis of open-ended responses to the Bank’s September 2014 survey of
staff in Global Practices (GPs) and Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas (CCSAs) identified as
a recurring theme the worry that in the new Bank not enough time and budget would
be earmarked for learning and knowledge sharing. Furthermore, the quantitative
questions in the same survey found that almost 70 percent of the respondents strongly
agreed or agreed that lending pressure crowds out learning (figure 3.2). Separately, in


                                                                                                                     35
CHAPTER 3
INCENTIVES
interviews and focus groups, staff told IEG that the implicit “pressure to lend” would
be hard to mitigate. An earlier Bank report stated that “most staff members feel, despite
the growing importance of knowledge work, that the Bank’s main internal incentives
are still related to lending” (World Bank 2011), repeating a theme, first highlighted by
Wapenhans (Wapenhans 1992). According to the 2013 Employee Engagement Survey,
40 percent of all respondents agreed or strongly agreed that “the World Bank Group
prioritizes development results over the number and volume of transactions,” but only
29 percent of the task team leaders (TTLs) showed this level of agreement.

Signaling

Learning and knowledge sharing are more likely to flourish if management sends the
right signals. Such signals have now gone out from leaders in the Bank. Learning,
knowledge, and innovation form a pillar of the new Bank architecture. The desire to
align leadership, culture, and values is explicit in recent corporate presentations. Bank
management has communicated that the new structure was driven largely by the desire
to ensure that the best global knowledge was delivered to country clients in a timely
way. The GPs and CCSAs have been mandated to seek out and share the best available
global solutions in technical areas.


36
                                                                                              CHAPTER 3

But, as of September 2014, many staff had not yet picked up on, or were skeptical about,
these signals. The first survey of staff in the GPs and CCSAs found that only 23 percent
responded favorably concerning opportunities for learning and professional growth.
Moreover, only 29 percent strongly agreed or greed that they were equipped to use the
core GP and CCSA behavior of knowledge sharing (table 3.1). Also, IEG’s content
analysis of responses to an open-ended question in the survey identified a concern that
new information technology platforms were not being used because top managers had
not emphasized their importance.

Responses to the September 2014 survey also revealed that Bank staff were not
persuaded that the Bank had a strategy for learning and knowledge sharing. This
perception may have been encouraged by the absence of a clear structure of governance
for knowledge and learning in Bank operations. On the one hand, there is once again a
director-level chief learning officer. Responsibility for operational learning was
transferred from Human Resources to the Leadership, Learning, and Innovation unit
and, as part of this switch, a director-level position was reintroduced in 2014 after a
hiatus of several years. Operations Policy and Country Services had a director of
knowledge and learning from 2010 to 2014, under whose auspices the Bank’s first
knowledge strategy was produced. This post was abolished. Finally, the Global
Practices Vice-Presidency had intended to appoint a knowledge director. This position
was subsequently downgraded to knowledge manager, reporting to the Global
Practices chief economist. Thus, governance of operational knowledge and learning is
fragmented and the present structure does not accord learning and knowledge a
commanding position.

Budgeting
The FY15 World Bank budget projections made in October 2014 conveyed no sense of a
radical change in either the size or the distribution of the budget (table 3.2). Yet the way
in which budget is allocated changed fundamentally on July 1, 2014. Control of the

budget shifted from the Country Management Units to the GPs and CCSAs. The
internal market was abolished. TTLs no longer have to compete with each other to be
assigned to the operational tasks, whose budget is primarily allocated at the discretion
of country directors. In the new system, TTLs represent a fixed-cost that is paid by the
GPs (box 3.1). Cross-support—when TTLs are temporarily deployed to work on
Regions and GPs outside their unit—is paid for by the GPs not by the Country
Management Units, becoming an integral part of TTL overhead. Budget allocation
decisions are now limited to variable costs, principally consultants and travel.

Box 3.1. Global Practice Budgeting

“All staff expenses for Global Practices are funded upfront, so budget management
mainly deals with the allocation and use of variable expenses. In addition, there can be
revenue targets (i.e., on Trust Funds and reimbursable activities). The variable expense
budgets are allocated to Senior Directors and then given to each Practice Manager (PM) as
a notional variable expense ceiling (for planning assumptions). The PM prepares variable
expense plans for tasks assigned to him/her using the Task Planning Tool and reconciles
the plans with the agreed ceilings.
“As before, Task Members charge variable costs to tasks, and the PM monitors use against
plans on variable costs and staff time. PMs have full discretion to move allocated
resources across tasks and within practices in a given region.
“In contrast, Program Leaders do not hold or monitor budget. They help formulate
country work programs and monitor broad delivery to clients and cross-practice
collaboration. They also review/monitor burn rates against relevant tasks.
“The Global Practice VPs will hold back a contingency to encourage flexibility. These
funds would be released during the year according to a clear, well defined process.
Changes in work program that affect multiple Practices or Regions will follow a process to
be agreed early in FY15.”

Trends in table 3.2 do not square with staff perceptions of cutbacks. IEG’s content
analysis of responses to an open-ended question in the September 2014 survey of GP
and CCSA staff identified, as one of the recurring themes, a concern that budgetary
restrictions as well as the budgeting process itself would undermine the goal of
bringing the best global knowledge to bear in Bank projects. Some of the budget
constraints may be short term, capable of being resolved as new arrangements are
embedded, but there are also structural limitations that may prove more enduring.

Staff interviewed by IEG pointed to several concerns. First, it was not clear to them how
variable costs for multisector projects would be divided up between the GPs and
CCSAs. Will the GP where the TTL is located be responsible for all variable costs?
Second, interviewees suggested that the demand for technical expertise may outstrip
supply. Given that the new system only requires budgeting of variable costs, it is now
cost-free to request staff to work in countries and GPs outside of their duty station. The
question of how best to prioritize the time and use of the technical experts for whom
there is substantial excess demand is not yet resolved. In the previous system, the cost
of cross-support helped to balance demand and supply. The new structure has not yet
proposed an alternative—there is no rationing mechanism. Who will decide who goes
where? Will the process be decentralized, left to the discretion of individual managers
and staff, or will there be an element of central planning? These are the questions posed

by IEG interviewees. Third, staff interviewed by IEG expressed a concern that the
budget allocation for global programs had been cut relative to the funding made
available to the Regions although IEG was unable to obtain actual budget data to verify
this perception.

Fourth, although the FY15 budget for consultants appears to have increased relative to
FY13–14 (table 3.2), various people told IEG that consultant hiring procedures now
involve higher transaction costs than before the new organization was put in place. This
may make it harder to bring the best global knowledge to bear on projects, especially if
Bank staff do not have the necessary knowledge or are otherwise occupied on other
tasks. TTLs report that they now have less decision-making autonomy with respect to
consultant and travel costs. They spend more time negotiating with their managers than
in the previous system. Consultant decisions are now made at a higher level by
managers who may be less familiar with the project. It is good practice for TTLs to have
to make the case that the job could not be done by a Bank staff member before opting
for consultants. However, while in some cases the job could be done by a staff member,
it may take longer to line up in-house expertise than to hire a consultant. To the extent
that the longer time is due to bureaucratic inefficiencies rather than work or travel load,
this is a problem that must be addressed.


Promotion Decisions, Salary Increases, and Performance Evaluation
A review of the World Bank Group promotion process is underway, addressing criteria
such as collaboration, learning, and knowledge sharing. Pending completion of a new
corporate framework and the formation of Talent Management Teams—which should
be in place by the end of FY15—the GPs and CCSAs will continue to apply the previous
sector board procedures. The Bank’s Incentives Task Force has recommended that
salary review ratings of 4 and 5 only be given to those staff who perform strongly on
collaboration, knowledge, and results.

From FY15 forward, the World Bank Group Performance Management system
(ePerformance) will reflect the recently revamped World Bank Group core
competencies, including the one entitled, “Create, Apply, and Share Knowledge.”
Additionally, the cascading objectives framework for managers includes four
performance dimensions—results, clients, people, and corporate contribution, in which
corporate contribution includes the component of knowledge sharing. Also, the Bank
has committed to introduce a tracking system that will allow for associating team
contributions with project outcomes and not just deliverables.

Most of the staff interviewed by IEG remain skeptical that their incentives have
changed. They point out that, before FY15, the performance evaluation had a category
for learning and knowledge sharing. In IEG’s survey of Bank staff, only 7 percent of
respondents said that the learning and knowledge sharing rating influenced the overall
performance assessment to a substantial or very large extent. In focus groups,
participants observed that the rating carries little weight in their Overall Performance
Evaluation.

Interviewees said that managers need more guidance on the specific questions to
discuss with staff in the course of the performance evaluation: questions about the
extent to which intended results, not just deliverables, are on track; the extent to which
cross-GP, cross-country, and country-specific learning and knowledge sharing have
occurred; and how much staff behavior relating to learning and knowledge sharing will
be rewarded in relation to other behaviors. They also said that senior management
needs to explicitly define and communicate to program leaders, practice managers, and
global solutions leads what exactly they will be held accountable for in their own
performance evaluation.

Interviewees referred to the challenges posed by the proposed tracking system. Much
thinking will be needed on how to balance results—which may not be fully within the
Bank’s control—and effort, which may not guarantee results. In addition to the
nonlinearity between inputs and results, the time lags between inputs and results and
the difficulties in separating team and individual contribution are likely to make such a
tracking system particularly complex. Interviewees also pointed out that evidence of
delivery against lending and supervision targets will always be easier to assemble than
evidence of knowledge sharing behavior, raising questions about whether the Bank will
find a way to address the issue and whether the assignment of the salary review ratings
of 4 and 5 will adhere to the recommendation of the Bank’s Incentives Task Force.

4. Balance Global and Local Focus
Shortly after joining the World Bank Group, President Jim Yong Kim observed in a
keynote speech that “effective delivery demands context-specific knowledge” (Kim
2012). More than 10 years earlier, Eliot Berg, a prominent consultant to the Bank, noted
the difficulty of applying generalized lessons learned from one context to other
contexts. He observed, “The greatest weakness in Bank operations [is the] inability to
customize programs to country-specific needs” (Berg 2000, 38). In this chapter, the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) asks, on the basis of the limited evidence so far,
whether the recent reforms at the Bank are likely to enhance its ability to deliver
knowledge that meets the standard of global good practice while also responding to the
specific needs of the client. The logic of the new Global Practices (GPs) and Cross-
Cutting Solutions Areas (CCSAs) is that sector and thematic knowledge is globally
fungible. But there is a question of external validity: Under what circumstances can
lessons learned be generalized to contexts other than the ones in which they were
generated? Two other questions also arise: Can it be assumed that the results from a
successful pilot intervention will be attained when it is scaled up? Can it be assumed
assume that the positive results attained by Agency A can also be attained by Agency
B? In recent years, some researchers have cautioned that successes and failures are both
highly context specific, and that transporting lessons from one context to another is not
straightforward (Woolcock 2013; Pritchett and Sandefur 2015). The question now is: Can
the Bank articulate a credible basis on which the various lessons emanating from its
programs can or cannot be deployed elsewhere?

Based on IEG’s survey of Bank staff in January 2014 and country case study evidence
collected between May and November 2014, a case can be made that the Bank does not
pay sufficient attention to the country-specificity of the lessons that are extracted from
its operations and the knowledge that is accumulated. Respondents to IEG’s survey of
Bank staff were asked to what extent useful technical, operational, and country-specific
knowledge existed in the Bank. The last of these three was the laggard. No statistically
significant difference was found between the responses of task team leaders (TTLs) at
headquarters with those in country offices with respect to the extent of the Bank’s
useful knowledge on the country context (figure 4.1). This may appear surprising since
locating staff in country offices is supposed to enhance knowledge of local constraints
and opportunities. Possibly country office staff interpreted the question as relating to
the knowledge they can access rather than the knowledge they themselves possess.
There may be a tendency to underestimate the tacit knowledge about country context
that people carry around in their heads. Moreover, country case study evidence
suggests that for locally recruited country office staff in particular, the culture of the

them for doing so.

Recent data from Bank sources paint a similar picture, suggesting that staff are not yet
convinced that the new Bank structure will sufficiently balance global with local
knowledge. In September 2014, the Bank conducted the first of a regular quarterly
survey of staff in the Global Practices (GPs) and Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas
(CCSAs). This initial sounding attracted 1,430 responses. Twenty-five percent of
respondents strongly agreed or agreed that the GPs and CCSAs provided them with the
opportunity to access the relevant knowledge and expertise from across the World Bank
Group. Fifteen percent strongly agreed or agreed that the new structure allowed them
to work more effectively across boundaries (i.e., Regional, thematic, and between the
World Bank, International Finance Corporation [IFC], and the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency).

Based on the results of the September 2014 survey, IEG conducted a content analysis of
staff responses to an open-ended question about GP and CCSA performance.1 Among
the recurring themes, IEG found:

          A perceived tension between nurturing global knowledge and conducting
           operational work on behalf of country clients—a concern that Region and

CHAPTER 4
BALANCE GLOBAL AND LOCAL FOCUS
         country-specific knowledge would be compromised by the new structure
         because global technical knowledge needs adapting to the country context.
        Mixed opinions about the likelihood that the GPs and CCSAs would increase
         knowledge flow between Regions and GPs.
        Doubt that practice managers would have the incentive to allow their staff to
         work beyond unit boundaries.

These impressions are further supported by the interviews that IEG conducted with
Bank staff in late 2014. In sum, staff said that, to the extent that technical specialists are
now expected to cover the world, there is a risk that the steady accumulation of in-
depth knowledge about particular countries will be neglected. Some queried what value
could be added by “parachuting in”—joining a team in another country for just two
weeks. Also, given that the GPs are organized around sectors and themes, it is not clear to
staff how they will facilitate knowledge transfer in multisector operations. These findings
from IEG interviews are corroborated by Bank data from the 2014 survey of GP staff.

IEG suggests four dimensions around balancing the search for the best-available global
knowledge and the need to adapt that knowledge to the country context. First, the Bank
has to acknowledge that the best global knowledge will often lie outside its walls.
Second, the Bank has to be adept at facilitating the flow of knowledge between
countries. Third, within each country, the Bank must understand how to adapt global
knowledge to local institutions, capabilities, and values, which entails a sophisticated
appreciation of institutions and political economy. Fourth, within each country, the
Bank has to be agile in working across sectors.


The Bank Could Make More Use of Outside Knowledge
In the late 1990s the Bank aspired to encompass all of the important knowledge on
development, which was the essence of then-President Wolfensohn’s plan to develop a
Knowledge Bank. Today, President Kim is aiming for a Solutions Bank, with solutions
being found by pooling the Bank’s knowledge with that of partners and clients. He
asks, “…whether someone, either in or outside the Bank, has found ways to deliver the
solution. If so, can we capture it, apply it, and scale it up in other contexts?” (Kim 2014).

The Bank appears not to be making the best use of external knowledge. A Harvard case
study found, “The Bank remains strongly inward-oriented and insular in its knowledge
activities. …Bank operations are exactly the opposite of the open-source movement in
software; until very recently, the Bank predominantly relied on its own knowledge
rather than opening the institution up for broad-based collaboration with other
knowledge centers” (Oppenheimer and Prusak 2011, 5).

The Bank’s data bears this out. In replying to a 2012 survey of staff, respondents
indicated that the Bank makes limited use of external knowledge (figure 4.2). Whether
importing best practice ideas from other organizations, cultivating external contacts, or
networking with thought leaders on the outside, less than one-half of respondents said
that the Bank did so frequently.

Data collected by IEG paint a similar picture of insularity, in this case with respect to
the use of external documents. In 2014, IEG’s survey of Bank staff found that, during
project preparation, one-third of respondents cited non-Bank products as an important
source of learning. For implementation, the proportion was one-quarter. This picture is
reinforced by a separate investigation that IEG conducted. A review of all 97 project
appraisal documents produced in the second and third quarter of FY13 revealed that
only 36 percent of these documents drew on non-Bank research or other external
sources of knowledge. Also, participants in IEG interviews and focus groups were
unanimous in pointing out that, when preparing projects, TTLs use Bank documents
more than documents produced outside the Bank.

IEG country case studies shed more light on the Bank’s heavy reliance on its own
knowledge. In Morocco, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, discussions with outside service
providers revealed that Bank staff were reluctant to use knowledge and country studies
that were not funded by the Bank. Very few of the staff interviewed by IEG referenced
work done outside the Bank, and most designs and performance reports do not quote
external literature.

When interviewed by IEG, staff indicated that some of the most important knowledge
may lie in the heads of external experts. This is particularly the case with highly
specialized technical knowledge. For example, in the IEG project performance
assessments reviewed for this evaluation (appendix B), Bank staff sometimes lacked the
knowledge needed to check whether procurement specifications for high-technology
data systems were adequate. This made them vulnerable to companies seeking to sell
expensive systems that exceeded client needs, making it more likely that the systems
would not be maintained. Without importing such knowledge from the outside, the
Bank’s credibility with clients will suffer, particularly in middle-income countries with
more sophisticated needs.

In the country case study interviews, some consultants expressed frustration to IEG at
being cut off from the Bank-wide idea flow and the limited use made of their
knowledge. They said that much of the knowledge they help create does not flow
beyond the TTL who hired them.

In the IEG country case studies, locally recruited staff consistently referred to the
importance of maintaining networks outside the Bank. In the Philippines where the
nongovernmental organization sector is strong and well established, Bank staff working
on community-driven development (CDD) emphasized the importance of participating
in a local community of practice. This emphasis was also evident in the Sri Lanka health
sector where Bank outreach to physician networks is an important part of the reform
process, not least because the top ministerial posts are occupied by doctors, who will
carry the most weight in the communities targeted by the project.

Summing up, the Bank could better tap sources of knowledge outside the Bank, ranging
from studies, to consultant knowhow to the ideas circulating in local networks.


What the Bank Is Capable of as a Knowledge Broker
Despite findings about the Bank’s underuse of external knowledge, there are notable
exceptions—cases where the Bank has served as a broker of external knowledge as well
a promoter of its own knowledge. Increasingly, the Bank has moved to set up joint
client-staff communities of practice and to promote south-south learning exchanges.

The Bank’s work on social protection perhaps exemplifies this trend. The government of
Mexico took the lead in promoting conditional cash transfers, a model that was copied
around the world. As a financier, the World Bank came late to the game—the Mexican
government first approached the Inter-American Development Bank for a loan—but the
Bank nevertheless learned from what was happening in Mexico and helped pass on the
knowledge. TTLs told IEG that the 2008 global crisis was the spur that prompted
Mexico to seek Bank financing (box 4.1), rather than Mexico’s need for the Bank’s
knowledge. In the first instance, the Bank learned more from Mexico about cash
transfers than Mexico did from the Bank. But over time the Bank built up new
knowledge that proved useful to Mexico.

The Bank demonstrated its strength as a convener as much as a financier. In 2006 the
government of Chile asked the Bank to provide a neutral venue for Latin American
countries to regularly compare notes on their conditional cash transfers. Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, El Salvador, and Mexico participated every two months in video conferences
organized by the Bank. Every other year they met for face-to-face meetings. As a mark
of the Bank’s high-level commitment, this experiment in distance learning was run from
the office of the vice-president for Latin America and the Caribbean Region.

IEG’s country case studies found evidence of how ideas about social protection have
evolved as lessons are transferred from one country to another. A learning chain can be
traced from Malawi to Mexico via Ethiopia and Tanzania. In Tanzania, the first two in
the Bank-supported social protection series— Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) —
were designed as CDD projects. They involved demand-driven, community
infrastructure projects such as schools, clinics, and water supply systems.

The first TASAF project was approved in 1999, shortly after the president of Tanzania’s
1998 visit to Malawi when he was impressed by the work of the Malawi Social Action
Fund. It influenced the design of TASAF I and II. Since about 2008, however, a stronger
influence has been the Bank-supported Ethiopia Productive Safety Net Project and the
Latin American experience with cash transfers. A cash transfer scheme was piloted in
TASAF II and scaled up as a nationwide program, targeting extremely poor
households, not communities. As well as cash transfers, this new project design
includes components offering “lean season” wage jobs in public sector works and
savings mobilization. The Bank decided not to continue financing a CDD-oriented
infrastructure component.

Box 4.1. Countries Share Knowledge on Social Protection
“The Bank technically supports CCT programs throughout the world, by helping to organize
learning events to facilitate knowledge sharing among clients and staff from the Bank and other
international organizations. WBI and the HD Vice-Presidency have collaborated on three
international conferences held in Mexico (2002), Brazil (2004), and Turkey (2006). After the last
conference, several Latin American CCT programs requested the Human Development
Department within the Latin America Region to facilitate a CCT Learning Community by
organizing monthly virtual sessions through the Global Distance Learning Network for 5
programs (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, and Mexico). This community is now
completing its second year of operation and has discussed topics such as management, local
government institutional strengthening, monitoring and evaluation, and the future role of CCT
programs. This CCT Learning Community has fostered a strong, tight-knit network of senior
practitioners who have found a forum for continuous communication, where they can learn
from each other on second-generation issues specific to older CCT programs. Mexico’s
Oportunidades together with the Bank hosted a two-day workshop in Mexico in early 2008 that
allowed them to come together to discuss issues facing CCT programs as they mature,
including the changing challenges of impact evaluation and the future role of CCTs. These
learning events have expanded to South–North exchanges. New York City has modeled its own
transfer program, Opportunity NYC, on Oportunidades, and visited Mexico while designing
their intervention to learn from its experience. In June 2008 the Latin America Region organized
with an expanded CCT Learning Community a virtual learning session on ways that CCT
programs were trying to improve employment outcomes for their beneficiaries with the
participation of experts on US/UK experiences, including program managers of Opportunity
NYC. Finally, the Bank recently has published a Policy Research Report, entitled Conditional
Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty. The report lays out a conceptual framework
for thinking about the role and design of CCTs and reviews the evidence that has accumulated
on their performance in practice.”

The Mexico program known as Oportunidades, now Prospera, has been the most
influential model for the Tanzania social protection project. Staff from the TASAF
project management unit and from the Tanzania government visited Mexico in 2012.
Mexican influence on TASAF is evident in two respects. First, a Mexican firm won the
bid to conduct the impact evaluation of the TASAF II cash transfer pilot. Second, the
Management Information System was imported from Mexico.

Without the Bank’s presentation of worldwide experience with cash transfers, it is
unlikely that the government of Tanzania would have made the radical switch from the
social fund, CDD model to the cash transfer model of social protection. Before about
2008 the government had not heard of cash transfers. In addition to study tours to
Ethiopia, Jamaica, and Mexico, the Bank invited government and TASAF staff to attend
a training course in social protection at its Washington headquarters in 2010. By this

time, there had been a paradigm shift in the Bank. As a vehicle for poverty reduction,
cash transfers had replaced CDD as the preferred model. In Tanzania, there was
initially some resistance to this shift because cash transfers were equated with
dependence on government handouts. However, after discussion, the government was
persuaded that transfers targeted the poor more effectively than the social fund model.
This was the driver of the changed approach to social protection in Tanzania.

In sum, the Bank’s work on social protection exhibited a strong flow of knowledge
across countries and Regions well before the FY15 reorganization. It is an example from
which other Global Practices may learn. But there is a question that merits attention.
Did the successful transfer of learning between countries hinge on the quality of the
technical knowledge that was transferred—some vital element of global validity, or was
it the way in which knowledge from outside the country was successfully adapted to
the local context? A discussion of this topic follows.


Mixed Success in Understanding the Political Economy of Client Countries
The country case studies conducted for this evaluation find that the Bank’s country
focus and decentralization have led to more emphasis on political economy analysis
and to the hiring of locally recruited staff with an understanding of country networks. It
may also have led to some complacency about the extent to which the Bank has
internalized political realities and needs to invest in understanding the factors that were
likely to affect country ownership of the lending program. Until recently, the Bank
tended not to develop operationally relevant knowledge and training in the political
economy, culture, and institutional capacity of countries.

The importance of political economy analysis is illustrated by the Tanzania water series
and the Turkey health series assessed for this evaluation. In each case, the Bank only
became fully aware of political economy constraints during project implementation.
The lessons were not written up until after the projects closed. But the design of the
Turkey series took better account of the need to deal with competing interest groups
than was the case in Tanzania.

In Tanzania, a project sought to boost the efficiency of the water utility by leasing it to a
private operator (de Waal and Cooksey 2008). The project appraisal document cites
lessons learned from experience in Francophone West Africa, a region with which the
team leader was familiar. It was argued that leasing the water utility to a private
contractor had been shown to work and that it was feasible for the contractor to bear the
commercial risk, for the government to enforce payment of water bills, and for the
contractor and government to agree to share financing of repairs and replacement.



                                                                                          49
CHAPTER 4
BALANCE GLOBAL AND LOCAL FOCUS
The appraisal document goes on to note, “Experience worldwide and in particular in
Africa has also demonstrated the importance of…stakeholder participation in the
design of institutional reform to build a strong consensus on the “privatization” of a key
public service” (World Bank 2003, 7). But it was precisely this consensus that was
lacking, and the project was not able to accommodate those likely to lose from the
proposed reforms. These included the owners of tanker trucks that supplied the many
consumers in Dar es Salaam, including some of the most powerful citizens, who had no
faith in the capacity of the utility to provide a reliable service. Many government
officials had a vested interest in the survival of the tanker business, which was diverting
revenues from the utility. If the project had been preceded by participatory analytic
work on the political economy of reforming the water utility, the Bank would have
given more thought to the ease with which the successes achieved in Senegal (and,
predating Bank intervention, in Côte d’Ivoire) could be transplanted to English
speaking countries of Africa.

The case has since been written up as a case study (de Waal and Cooksey 2008; Triche
2012). Triche observes, “At the time the Dar es Salaam transaction was being prepared,
the policies of government of Tanzania’s international development partners led by the
World Bank strongly favored public-private partnerships (PPPs). Several successful
cases, including those in Western Africa, had created confidence that PPPs could lead to
significant improvements in the financial viability and quality of services everywhere.
The Bank’s preparation team tried to bring the experience of the successful cases to bear
on the transaction and advised the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission to address
certain operator risks but, in the end, the team still had some misgivings about the
viability of the Lease Contract. Despite these issues, the World Bank ‘no objections’
allowed the transaction to move forward. Since that time, the World Bank’s enthusiasm
for PPP has evolved in light of experience. The failure of several PPPs, examples of
highly effective public operators and a growing appreciation for the role of small local
service providers have led to the adoption of a more balanced policy of promoting the
efficiency and financial viability of public operators while promoting a wide variety of
forms of PPP where feasible.”2

Unlike in Tanzania, in Turkey the government’s grasp of political economy helped it
implement a comprehensive health care reform. The government, rather than the Bank,
was the driver. But, apart from helping to finance the reforms, the Bank played a useful
role by sponsoring an analysis of the political economy and by providing a forum for
Turkey to share the lessons of reform with other countries. In a recent report (Bump and
Sparkes 2013), produced at the request of the Turkish Ministry of Health, financed by a
Japan Trust Fund under the World Bank–Japan Partnership Program on Universal
Health Coverage, and written by two academics from the United States, the authors
show that, in implementing the Health Transformation Program between 2003 and

2012, the Turkish Ministry of Health tackled four political economy challenges. First,
following the “logic of collective action” (Olson 1965), losers were more likely to
organize against the reforms than winners were to mobilize in support of them. Costs
were concentrated on elite, well-organized groups, particularly doctors in university
hospitals, while benefits were thinly spread. The ministry responded by building
support among the broad base of beneficiaries through highly visible, fast reforms, such
as refurbishing waiting rooms, ending unpopular policies, and expanding the
ambulance network. These initial moves built popular support for the more difficult
reforms to come, which included changing provider payment systems, closing
underperforming facilities, and merging social security systems.

Second, early on, the minister of health and his senior leadership team worked to
neutralize the opposition by systematically rebutting opposition claims, by changing
some of the less popular reform plans, and by exploiting the differences between
different opposition groups. Third, the government built domestic support by playing
the sovereignty card when expedient. It openly resisted some of the recommendations
of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Fourth, the government was
astute in its choice of tactics. It used the existing Green Card Program of health
insurance as its primary vehicle for scaling up coverage for low-income households,
partly because modifying a program did not require parliamentary approval. The
Ministry of Health consolidated its control by taking over the Green Card Program
from the social security agency, by expanding the benefits package, by increasing the
number of green cards in circulation, and by improving health care centers.

These measures may not have worked in another context. The authors of the study
identify several factors that predisposed toward reform. The government could move
swiftly because several reform proposals had already been developed when it began the
program in 2003. These proposals drew on World Bank-supported work from the early
1990s. The economic crises of 1999 and 2001 gave a sense of urgency to health and
pension reforms. The 2002 parliamentary elections gave a legislative majority to the AK
Party, ending decades of coalition government. This made it harder for opposing
parties and interest groups to block the reform process. Strong economic growth after
2003 increased the fiscal space available for health care without imposing cuts
elsewhere. Finally, the youthful age profile of the population helped. Turkish citizens
demanded fewer interventions and at a lower cost than would have been the case if the
average age had been higher.

In sum, attempts to tailor perceived global good practice to the needs of individual
countries call for country-specific knowledge of institutions and political economy.
They may work best when clients already have the knowledge needed to challenge

Bank thinking when necessary. For these reasons, customization is more likely to
prosper in middle-income countries than in low-income countries.


Mixed Success in Working across Sectors in a Country
To serve its clients effectively, the Bank needs to be agile at working across different
sectors in the same country. This will always be a stretch. Because the academic and
professional training of Bank TTLs tends to be sector focused, staff are more likely to
work across countries in the same sector than across sectors in the same country. This is
confirmed by IEG’s assessment of time recording data from FY12–14 presented in the
next section.

Findings from IEG’s country case studies reveal that, before the reorganization, there
were instructive examples of working across sectors in a given country that could serve
as examples of good practice for the Bank.

In Mexico, the Bank simultaneously financed separate projects in support of the
conditional cash transfer program (Oportunidades, now Prospera) and the health
insurance program (Seguro Popular). In 2014 Prospera and Seguro Popular reached
respectively 25 million and 50 million beneficiaries, which is between 20 and 40 percent
of Mexico’s population. One of the challenges was to ensure that Prospera beneficiaries
registered with Seguro Popular. A communications campaign was launched to correct
the widespread misconception that Prospera beneficiaries would have to give up their
benefits once they registered with the health insurance program. A further problem was
the incompatibility of databases between states. Some states had a single database for
Prospera and Seguro Popular, and others had separate databases. Also, the Ministry of
Education ran a series of grant programs; for example, to support parent-teacher
associations. But many of these did not operate in the poorest areas, denying the clients
of Prospera the full range of benefits. The programs needed to be harmonized.
Although Mexico pioneered cash transfers, with respect to cross-sector coordination, it
is now behind countries that started their programs later. Chile is ahead on initiatives to
develop a system of unique identification for the beneficiaries of various social
protection programs, helping to improve targeting and promotion.

The Bank’s second project in support of Prospera (approved in 2014) directly tackles the
lack of cross-sector coordination. “Two key weaknesses are the duplication of programs
and the lack of information to identify gaps in demand and supply of social services.…
[I]n 2011 there were as many as 273 federal programs directed at improving socio-
economic welfare—each using different targeting and delivery mechanisms—co-
existing with as many as 2,391 state programs” (World Bank 2014, 3). The aim is to

integrate databases that capture the socioeconomic characteristics of beneficiaries
(consumers of social services), information on who receives which social programs
(unique registry of beneficiaries), and information on the supply of social programs.
The project also helps beneficiaries find jobs through the National Employment Service.

In Mexico, as well as promoting coordination between sectors within the Prospera
project, the Bank now faces a coordination challenge between projects in different
sectors. The Bank has promoted the development of rural financial markets through
Bansefi, the implementing agency for three Bank-supported projects. Because of its vast
branch network, Bansefi is also the conduit for delivering benefits to Prospera
beneficiaries. It wants to offer its Prospera clients loans secured against the future
stream of Prospera benefits. The Bank is examining the risks posed by this linkage of
programs.

Urban development projects in the case study countries have had mixed success in
dealing with cross-sector coordination. In Tanzania, the upcoming Dar es Salaam
Metropolitan Development Project has no water components. This appears to be
because water is already covered by the First and Second Water Sector Support Projects.
This avoidance of duplication makes sense but is not sufficient to justify the lack of
communication between project teams that IEG observed or the absence of attempts to
align sector strategy.

In the Philippines, Bank staff and their government counterparts told IEG how
important it was that the KALAHI-CIDSS3 CDD program and the Social Welfare and
Development Reform complement each other. Ministry officials praised the Bank’s
commitment to making these government programs work together. Technical
assistance and operational learning from both projects were regularly shared between
staff in the Department of Social Welfare and Development and the Bank. Government-
sponsored impact evaluations assessed how much the programs informed each other
(Edillon, Piza, and Santos 2011). The pressure for coordination and cross-fertilization
came squarely from the client’s side.

A recent report (IEG 2014) examines how cross-sector work has manifested itself in
projects that span human and animal health care systems, highlighting the institutional
obstacles that had to be overcome (box 4.2).

Box 4.2. Cross-Sector Coordination—the Bank’s Response to Avian Influenza
Effective control of avian influenza and pandemic preparedness requires cooperation and
coordination between animal and human health sectors, both at the strategic level and in
implementation. The outcomes of most serious concern are the risks to humans from a potential
pandemic, but improvements in these human health outcomes come in part from actions on
animal health.
In client countries, World Bank-financed projects had some success at increasing cooperation
between animal and human health agencies, often starting from a baseline of no cooperation.
National or Regional level technical committees with experts from multiple agencies were a
useful platform for organizing cooperation. Establishing committees of technical experts and
institutionalizing regular meetings helped to sustain cooperation beyond the lifetime of specific
donor-financed projects. National level plans helped to bring in civil defense, emergency
response, or security agencies.
Within the Bank, the response to avian influenza fostered a significant degree of cross-sectoral
cooperation at the strategic level in designing the Global Program on Avian Influenza, in
convening international agencies, and in working with the international community.
Leadership and prioritization from high-level management at the Bank (including the
president) were central to this process. But Bank institutional structures posed a barrier to
meaningful cross-sectoral work at the operational level. The mapping of the project and task
team leader (TTL) to either agriculture or health sectors determined the allocation of
responsibility and accountability to management in that sector, which tended to reduce the
incentive for managers and staff in other sectors to prioritize the project when allocating scarce
time and resources.
Positive cross-sectoral cooperation within the Bank did occur in some projects, but this was
largely driven by personalities rather than by institutional incentives. Informal co-TTL
arrangements generally did not make much difference as in the end one person was still the
formal TTL. (Co-TTL arrangements were formalized in late 2014.) After the Bank's
restructuring, animal health and human health are still in different Global Practices, and signals
will need to be sent by leadership of both practices that cross-sectoral cooperation is a priority.

In country offices, relative to headquarters, the physical proximity of staff in different
sectors may suggest that there are plenty of opportunities for cross-GP exchanges.
Indeed, some studies have shown that office layout strongly influences knowledge flow
(Pentland 2014). However, IEG observed that in some country missions, the frequency
of cross-sector meetings has declined. In the past, many country directors held regular
meetings dedicated to sector briefings where the staff would update the country
director and colleagues in other sectors about developments in their sector. In larger
offices, where the interaction with directors happened more infrequently, there were
operational meetings organized for the same purpose. In the case study countries, these
encounters are now less frequent. Office-wide meetings are more likely to be devoted to

human resource matters, security, and compliance issues. In country offices there are
also fewer informal lunchtime seminars than in Washington headquarters, which may
further reduce the opportunity for cross-sector exchange. At this stage, there is limited
evidence that working across sectors is likely to be adequately rewarded by the new
arrangements.


Monitoring Knowledge Flow
Knowledge flow is partly mediated by the movement of staff in whose heads those
ideas are embedded. Short-term mobility typically manifests as cross-support: staff
from one Bank Region are invited to participate in appraisal or supervision missions for
projects in another Region. Long-term mobility involves assignment to a new post in a
different Region, possibly encouraged by the 3-5-7 rule on staff rotation.4

To investigate staff mobility IEG took all the data from the Time Recording System for
FY00–14 and, for each Unique Personal Identification number, investigated the
percentage of staff in operations who had charged time to more than one Region and
more than one sector. IEG found that, between FY00 and FY14, 58 percent of operational
staff worked in more than one Region and 54 percent of operational staff had charged
time to more than one sector unit. If the data cut is limited to FY12–14, mobility is less,
possibly because the uncertainty created by the Bank reforms led staff to delay the
search for a new post: 45 percent worked in more than one Region and 31 percent
worked in more than one sector. Figure 4.3 summarizes these data and also shows what
proportion of staff charge time to a project series. More than one project in the same
sector and in the same country might increase the opportunity for learning from
mistakes.

The data reported assign equal weight to persons charging five hours (e.g., to review a
project concept document from another unit) and persons charging a year or more of
their time. But even when the data cut is limited to staff who have charged more than
the median gross staff hours per period per activity, the proportion of those working in
more than one Region or sector in FY00–14 is still relatively high: 53 percent (multi-
Region) and 43 percent (multisector).

One of the motives for Bank reform was to increase the sharing of knowledge and
learning by promoting mobility between Bank units. But the Bank’s Time Recording
System data show that, in the pre-reform Bank, mobility was already substantial. These
findings do not contradict earlier observations about the limited extent of cross-support
(IEG 2012) because they use a different metric that is more inclusive (measuring the
incidence of “working across” involving both cross-support and job change—not the

proportion of time devoted to cross-support). Although the data analysis needs to be
refined to distinguish cross-support from job change, a baseline can be created using
both elements. The baseline is important in order not to underestimate or overestimate
the post FY14 changes in knowledge flow resulting from the new Bank structure.

There is a risk that the new Bank has framed the effective deployment of knowledge too
much in terms of staff mobility. There is an implicit assumption in the new Bank that
generating the right solutions for clients entails bringing global good practice
knowledge to bear more expeditiously than before, and that knowledge flow, which is
one of the indicators in the Corporate Scorecard, calls for a more fluid movement of
staff across space and between contracts.

One implication of this is that success is equated with high mobility: movers will have
more illustrious careers than stickers. Typically, the movers are internationally recruited
staff (IRS) located in headquarters (IRS-HQ), and the stickers are locally recruited staff
(LRS) based in country offices (LRS-CO). The IRS-HQ staff are the guardians of good
practice. They are supposed to have the best technical knowledge that can be applied
anywhere in the world. Even though LRS-CO staff may be TTLs, their roles are
essentially seen as providing support. There is a risk that by increasing the premium on
mobility, the restructuring will further sharpen the divide between IRS-HQ and LRS-
CO staff, creating a two-class Bank. The challenge is to recognize that learning is not
wholly contingent on mobility and that learning and results will be best served by a

partnership between movers and stickers. Stickers have a particular role to play in
bringing knowledge of local institutions to bear on the design and implementation of
projects. Ultimately, all knowledge is local.

In sum, there are barriers to working across sectors in a given country, partly because of
the sector-specific nature of Bank staff’s technical knowledge and the difficulty of
coordinating line ministries. In some countries, the Bank has showed imagination and
commitment to cross-sector work, but this is probably the exception rather than the
rule. There is a strong sense that cross-sector work is most likely to succeed when the
client is driving the process.


Has the Bank Balanced Global and Local Knowledge?
In various respects, a case can be made that the new structure and roles will not
privilege global technical knowhow at the expense of customizing this knowledge to
the country context. Program leaders and the country directors to whom they report
have a clear accountability for ensuring that projects fit the local context. Program
leaders help to develop multi-practice programs and they are responsible for
identifying and filtering client demands, serving as a conduit to the GPs and CCSAs.
Although the balance of decision-making authority relating to project design and
implementation has tilted away from the Regions to the GPs, the Regions still have
responsibility for clearance and concurrence at key stages of the project process. Most
practice directors and practice managers have undertaken field assignments in the past
and understand the importance of country context in project design. The global
solutions leads will continue to devote part of their time to managing projects, which
will require them to keep sight of the local context. The same perspective will be
required in their work as peer reviewers and advisers.

But based on interviews with Bank staff—ranging from top managers to TTLs—IEG
encountered a repeated questioning of whether the GPs and CCSAs would permit a
balanced contest between global and country priorities. Given that the GPs and CCSAs
have overall responsibility for portfolio quality (through practice managers) and have a
somewhat elevated role within the new structure, will Country Management Units
(CMUs) be sufficiently heard—in practice—as they bring country-based local
knowledge to the table? It remains to be seen how the tension between global and
country-specific knowledge will be managed (table 4.1).

Leveraging local knowledge and moving it upwards is just as important as localizing
global knowledge. Important ways in which local knowledge can be leveraged include
the following: (i) local staff conduct briefings to share their local knowledge with

visiting headquarters staff or staff from other country offices during every mission and
the latter reflect the local insights into global knowledge; (ii) GP staff themselves glean
local insights and integrate them with global knowledge; or (iii) CMUs push local
knowledge up to GPs and CCSAs. Will the new Bank structure support sufficient
globalization of local knowledge?

Interviewees suggested that the integration of cross-GP knowledge into the project cycle
will be difficult given the large number of players (i.e., 19 GPs and CCSAs replace the
four network anchors). Some interviewees suggested that the office of the Global
Practices Vice-Presidency would be obliged to accommodate ad hoc groups with
multipractice representation that are chaired by senior directors.

Interviewees also noted that cross-practice collaboration will be difficult to achieve
unless it is mandated in the project design process. For example, it could be required
that there is one peer reviewer from another GP or from the IFC.

Interviewees also questioned the viability of the new global solutions lead positions. At
present, the role is grafted onto existing TTL and advisory responsibilities. It is not a
salaried position with a defined grade, the job will not be advertised, and it will not be
open to applicants from outside the Bank—appointments will not be fully competitive.
There is some doubt about whether staff will be interested in taking on this role, and a
concern that because it is an “add on” the global knowledge work may be squeezed out
by project management and advisory commitments. Past efforts to create such a
technical career stream did not prosper. To demonstrate its commitment, the Bank
needs to promote some qualified GH level technical experts to levels GI and above. It is
important to acknowledge, however, that there is some variation between GPs in the
responsibilities and profile of global solutions leads. In the Water GP, for example, the
global leads are full-time positions at GH level (or proposed at GI level), and do not
have TTL or managerial responsibilities.

Those interviewed by IEG also expressed a concern about the span of control of practice
managers and program leaders. The practice managers have 30 to 35 staff reporting to
them and in most Regions as many as 20 active country programs. Their capacity to
maintain a strategic focus and to provide substantive inputs into programs of this size
will be tested. For CMUs that cover several countries, it is an open question that the
program leader will be able to provide useful insights into each of the GP areas and
countries they cover because 50 percent of her or his time will be reserved for fulfilling
TTL responsibilities. Interviewees said that there may be a case for program leaders to
report to GP and CCSA management as well as the country director, given that
program leaders are expected to be the ‘hinges’ between global and local knowledge.




                                                                                          59
CHAPTER 4
BALANCE GLOBAL AND LOCAL FOCUS
This dual accountability could be reflected in sign-off arrangements for performance
evaluations of program leaders.

Interviewees expressed two other concerns. First, those in CMUs questioned whether
the Bank was still committed to its own decentralization. They asked whether practice
managers would be able to operate from country offices. Prompted by the evidence of a
partial recentralization in the Africa Region, IEG investigated whether this was part of a
broader trend. It seems that the move to pull back Africa Region staff to headquarters
was a cost-saving measure that predated the reorganization and does not amount to a
Bank-wide policy shift, although the trends in the Bank should be monitored.

Finally, some of those interviewed by IEG pointed to the challenge of ensuring that the
skills of top-rank technical experts are evenly deployed between countries. They noted
that there is a segmented market for global expertise. The best staff may be drawn to
work on the middle-income countries with strong technical counterparts.

5. Make Projects Adaptive
Adaptiveness is at the heart of what President Kim has defined as the science of
delivery for the World Bank Group. “We’ve been working on so many projects in so
many countries for so long that we have a lot of data evidence and experiential
knowledge that can help countries achieve what they want to achieve for their
populations,” he explained in a 2013 interview (UN News Centre 2013). “And so we’ve
been focusing a lot on helping countries actually deliver on their promises to the poor.
We call it a ‘science of delivery’ but really what it’s focused on is capturing all the best
experiences from around the world and then putting that information in a form
countries can use and try in their own local settings to improve their own delivery.”

Hirschman (1967) and Rondinelli (1993) made the case early on for operations that are
small-scale, exploratory, and risky—operations that do not always provide immediate
economic returns or yield quick results. More recent studies have strongly argued for
an adaptive approach to lending, emphasizing the importance of learning from failure
(Andrews, Pritchett, and Woolcock 2012).


Adaptiveness within and between Projects
Based on findings from surveys and interviews conducted by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG), Bank staff are more persuaded that there is interproject
adaptiveness—long-term design evolution—than they are willing to believe that there
is intraproject adaptiveness. Respondents to the IEG’s survey of Bank staff were asked,
in an open-ended question, to give one example of how they changed the design or
implementation of their lending operation in response to learning. The answers were
coded and the category with the largest share of responses (10 percent of the 356
respondents to this question) was “change occurred in the light of lessons learned from
previous operations.” On the other hand, while staff accept that there should be change
within the span of a single project, those who spoke to IEG said that intraproject
adaptiveness was lacking (box 5.1).

Box 5.1. Task Team Leaders Reflect on the Need for More Adaptive Project Design and
Implementation
The following observations emerged from the 100 interviews and 6 focus groups that IEG
organized with Bank staff between October and December 2013. The staff ranged by grade from
TTLs to directors and were drawn from across sectors. Although these comments were made
before the launch of the Global Practices on July 1, 2014, they touch on themes that transcend
the organizational structure of the Bank and therefore probably remain valid today.

   Too many resources are devoted to developing “failure-proof” project designs.
   Too few resources are devoted to supervising projects and adapting to inevitable changes.
   Restructuring should be the rule in projects, not the exception.
   At present, all projects are designed according to rules and procedures that may be
    appropriate for infrastructure projects but are not appropriate for policy reform programs.
   Too much time is spent designing Plan A, as if it will never change; when things change—as
    they inevitably do—there is no Plan B.
   Flexibility is the key because complexity is the rule.
   The solutions governments seek are often operational in nature—they are about the how,
    not the what.
   Solutions emerge in the course of implementation; it is impossible to find all the solutions at
    the design phase, even if preparation is very thorough.

A willingness to take calculated risks, to learn from mistakes, and to be candid when
operations fail are distinguishing traits of the adaptive approach. Although every
project appraisal document has a section on risk mitigation, overall the Bank does not
encourage risk taking. The IEG survey of Bank staff found that only 5 percent of
respondents felt to a very large or substantial extent that the Bank has encouraged
informed risk taking in its lending operations. Seventeen percent of respondents replied
that the Bank’s staff were able, to a very large or substantial extent, to learn from
mistakes. Managers were much more sanguine in this regard than staff at lower grades,
with the difference between the groups being statistically highly significant: 41 percent
of staff at grade GI and above replied that mistakes were learned from compared to 17
percent of GG staff. Managers have a key role to play in creating a safe space for staff to
candidly discuss operational problems and how to address them. Therefore, it is a
matter of concern that only one-third of respondents to the IEG survey opted for the
response “very large” or “substantial extent” when asked if they felt able to discuss
with their management what is not working in a lending operation.

MAKE PROJECTS ADAPTIVE

Examples of Adaptiveness from the Country Case Studies
IEG drew on country case studies to arrive at a better understanding of the variation in
project adaptiveness. The design of the FY04 Ethiopia Water Supply and Sanitation
Project was premised on learning by doing as exemplified by a sanitation and hygiene
initiative in the Amhara region that sought to change behavior (World Bank 2011).
Community members took part in a “walk of shame” to identify and map open
defecation sites. Health workers spelled out the link between open defecation and the
contamination of food and water sources, encouraging villagers to commit to ending
the practice. Three behaviors were promoted: hygienic disposal of human feces; hand
washing with soap; and household water treatment and safe storage of drinking water.
A 2010 survey representative of the 20 million inhabitants of the Amhara region showed
that open defecation dropped from 64 percent to 40 percent between baseline and
endline. Building of rudimentary latrines increased, and the chances of owning one
were about nine times higher in households located in villages that participated in the
walk of shame.

LESSONS LEARNED
Mid-course corrections were made. Learning from this initiative prompted two
corrections in the approach taken by extension workers. First, the emphasis given to
hand washing was better tailored to the availability of water and soap. In areas where
these were scarce, other means of cleaning (rubbing hands with ashes, for example)
made more sense. Second, greater attention was paid to promoting the correct use of
latrines. Building a latrine does little to deter open defecation if it is not kept clean, and
the pit is not covered.

Lessons were not broadly assimilated. With the exception of the Amhara initiative,
there was much less learning by doing than the appraisal document had promised. The
completion report concluded that an opportunity for learning was missed during
implementation because of no “robust feedback loop” from monitoring to project
management. As a result, there was less scope for mid-course correction. In addition,
neither of the two mid-term aide memoires from 2007 and 2011 reflect on lessons
learned. The box for the Amhara experiment is ticked, but there is no discussion of what
had been learned in that Region and how it might be applied elsewhere. The Amhara
experience was separately written up as a brief (World Bank 2011), but it was not
embedded in the supervision record. Also, an independent assessment in 2013 by the
U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) of capacity building under the
project points to a learning discontinuity (DFID 2014). Rapid staff turnover occurred at
all levels of government and no provision was made for transmitting lessons learned
from outgoing to incoming staff. For example, there was no systematic handover of

                                                                     MAKE PROJECTS ADAPTIVE
manuals and databases, meaning that capacity building became an interminable
process, nullifying the intended step-wise approach of “train first, then invest.”

Some projects changed in ways that responded to their varied contexts. In Morocco,
the Philippines, and Tanzania, community-driven development (CDD) programs
adapted over time. Adaptiveness was facilitated by the presence of technical experts
who had worked in other countries on similar CDD projects, south–south exchanges in
the design or operational phase, and an evidence base and analytical work that was
globally recognized and formally documented. In Tanzania, the CDD program
morphed into a social protection project, in Morocco the emphasis has been increasingly
on disadvantaged groups, and in the Philippines the approach has been scaled up into a
major government program whose sustainability is underpinned by legislative reform.

In the Philippines, three factors encouraged adaptive community-driven
development. The series of Kalahi community-driven development projects in the
Philippines provide a good example of how strong Bank facilitation and responsive
high-capacity partners can and do learn iteratively. The responsible government
ministry (the Department of Social Welfare and Development) showed how change and
regular interrogation of their work led to changes in how the project was delivered.
There were three priority initiatives to ensure a learning-by-doing approach. First, the
project team provided budget for the transmission of ideas through competitive grants,
encouraging field officers and other staff to develop ideas that would inform the future
work program. This approach motivated staff to be more innovative.

Second, the project team relied on an investigations unit in the Budget Office to track
project performance, with the findings being used by management to regularly fine
tune. Third, the project regularly sent field officers to visit other Regions to compare
approaches and advise on progress. They developed a project mapping tool that
compares Regions and is overlaid against other government and donor projects to
ensure cooperation in and between programs and cross-fertilization. The principle of
comparing and contrasting provincial performance has been a hallmark of the
Philippines statistical reporting for many years and is a spur to adaptiveness.

In Morocco, experimentation did not improve design coherence. By contrast, in
Morocco where the Bank has a 20-year history of investment in the water sector, there is
less evidence of cumulative design adaptation. Over the span of three projects, different
approaches have been tried—new approaches to infrastructure provision, participatory
approaches, and output-based aid. But the whole remains less than the sum of the parts.
A government official told IEG that the project designs proposed by the Bank did not
sufficiently address the big picture: “Without looking at land acquisition, sanitation
practices, water costs, distribution networks, and agricultural practices, the project


                                                                                           65
CHAPTER 5
MAKE PROJECTS ADAPTIVE
cannot hope to make the right policy choices. We know there are still big problems to
solve, but we need guidance on how to fit these problems to clear solutions.”

In Turkey, line-of-credit projects flexibly interpreted Bank orthodoxy. The small
enterprise access to finance project series in Turkey illustrates the high return to flexible
project design—designs that allow for changes within and between projects. World
Bank studies and guidance have recommended that (i) lines of credit should not be
subsidized because this crowds out private financial intermediaries; (ii) state-owned
banks should not be used as the vehicle because their lending practices may be
politically manipulated; (iii) lines of credit should not be directed to particular business
sectors or Regions because this may lead to less rigorous appraisal of credit subjects and
business plans; and (iv) it is better to direct World Bank funds through apex banks who
then on-lend to retail banks rather than lend to retail banks directly because this
provides an added layer of oversight, reducing the risk of default (IEG 2006).

Local context drove the need for flexibility as seen in three areas. In Turkey, the
project series departed from each of the good practice principles. Team members
stressed that Turkey was a special case: it is not best practice but best fit that counts.
First, the crowding out argument did not apply because few private banks were willing
to offer the medium- to long-term loans to small businesses that Bank terms allowed.
Second, the size of the branch network was more important than whether the bank was
private or public—the bigger the network, the greater the scope for reaching businesses
in the underserved south and southeast regions. Third, after the 2008 global financial
crisis, lending contracted in Turkey as it did elsewhere. To help restore liquidity, the
Bank relaxed its rule about working only with apex banks, allowing one of the
participating banks to shift from an apex to a retail arrangement.

Flexibility produced a sound adaptive response to an economic shock. Against the
background of a sudden deterioration in the economic outlook in 2008, the government
sought ways to scale up financial support to the real sector. In 2008, the government
requested and the World Bank Board approved an additional loan of $200 million
equivalent ($60 million and €109.1 million) to Halkbank guaranteed by the government.
The flexible design of the credit line and the role of state-owned Halkbank as a retailer
in the first Access to Finance for Small and Medium Enterprise Project was a key design
feature that “allowed the project to be scaled up rapidly and provide significant
funding to the small- and medium-enterprise sector at a time of great economic
uncertainty and credit contraction” (World Bank 2013, 6). This flexibility on the Bank’s
part led to speedy disbursement of the loan without compromising repayment rates.
The first additional finance was fully disbursed within nine months of effectiveness,
and a third of the second additional finance of the same project was also disbursed
within nine months after effectiveness (IEG 2012, 52).

                                                                    MAKE PROJECTS ADAPTIVE
The adaptive response was followed by a new cycle of adaptation. Once the crisis was
over, the Bank switched back to a wholesale approach and, in subsequent projects in the
series, diversified into leasing, Islamic finance, and credit guarantee instruments. This
design flexibility was facilitated by the solid analytic work that underpinned the
projects, including an influential investment climate study (World Bank 2010, 7).

In sum, staff perceive much more scope for adaptiveness. The country case study
evidence collected by IEG and the science of delivery pilots have showcased promising
examples of adaptive approaches. But projects vary widely in the degree of their
adaptiveness, and often the lessons learned are not disseminated and incorporated in
the design of subsequent operations.


Adapting by Revising the Project Development Objective
Staff skepticism about the incentive to formally restructure projects led IEG to test the
effect of a 2005 policy change that introduced split ratings. One aspect of adaptiveness
is timely restructuring of projects in the course of implementation. On restructuring,
IEG’s focus groups and interviews found that managers and quality assurance advisers
tended be more bullish, emphasizing that in recent years Operations Policy and
Country Services (OPCS) has facilitated restructuring. Task team leaders (TTLs) were
less convinced but, in general, they said that there is greater willingness to make
changes not requiring Board approval (typically involving the reallocation of loan
proceeds between components) than there is to countenance a Board-endorsed revision
of the Project Development Objective (PDO). Various people said that such level one
restructuring is “stigmatized,” partly because of a fear that it reflects badly on the
competence of the TTL.

Fifty-two percent of respondents to the IEG survey of Bank staff agreed or strongly
agreed that current Bank procedures for project restructuring have supported course
corrections. This covers all levels of restructuring—from shifts of budget between
components at the lowest level to formally approved revision of the PDO statement at
the highest level. However, in separate interviews, some staff reported that IEG was
“likely to mark them down” if project objectives were revised.

This observation is counter-intuitive because the harmonized guidelines of the IEG and
OPCS were revised to favor early revision of project objectives when progress toward
the original objectives was unsatisfactory. Beginning on January 1, 2005, all
Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) were required to apply a split
rating of Outcome whenever the PDO was changed during implementation. Projects
were rated against both the original and the revised objectives. The aggregation of these



                                                                                       67
CHAPTER 5
MAKE PROJECTS ADAPTIVE
two ratings was based on the percent of the loan disbursed before and after the date on
which the objectives were formally revised. Thus, the earlier the restructuring took
place, the greater the weight carried by progress toward the revised objectives in the
final calculus.

If the skeptical TTLs are right, there should be no difference before and after January 1,
2005 in the proportion of poorly performing projects that have their objectives formally
revised. Also, there should be no difference in the point between effectiveness and
closing when the objectives are revised. Post-2005 projects will not be restructured
earlier in the project cycle. Finally, the disbursement-weighted method will not make a
big enough difference to deliver a higher outcome under the post-2005 guidelines
compared to the earlier guidelines—when projects, with revised PDOs or not, were just
rated against their original objectives. IEG set out to test this null hypothesis (appendix
D).


Findings
IEG found no increase in the frequency of revising policy development objectives. In
FY00–14 the universe of IBRD/IDA investment projects with outcomes rated by IEG
was 3,180; of these projects, 1,280 were rated before January 1, 2005 (pre-reform), and
1,890 were rated from that date forward (post-reform). In the pre-reform period, 106
projects (8 percent) underwent a formal revision of the PDO. In the post-reform period,
156 projects experienced PDO revision (8 percent). This suggests that the reform had no
impact on the frequency of revision. To verify this, IEG also expressed the number of
PDO-revised projects as a proportion, not of the universe of projects, but of the subset of
projects that, on average, had a below-the-line Implementation Status and Results
Report (ISR) rating for progress toward development objectives (DO rating)—averaging
across the full ISR sequence. (Such projects would logically be strong candidates for
PDO revision). Only 3 percent of the projects rated before January 1, 2005 had an
average DO rating below the line. In the post-reform period, only 2 percent of projects
had a below-the-line rating. In other words, for both periods, the proportion of projects
with below-the-line ratings during implementation was lower than the proportion of
projects whose objectives were formally revised. This suggests a lack of candor in ISR
ratings—the supervision record understates the number of projects in need of fixing.
Either way, there is no evidence that the incidence of PDO revision increased with the
change of policy.

IEG also found no trend to restructure earlier. There was no significant difference
before and after 2005 in the timing of PDO revision. In the pre-reform period the
average span between effectiveness and completion was 7.8 years and the average

                                                                                 CHAPTER 5
                                                                     MAKE PROJECTS ADAPTIVE
period between effectiveness and PDO revision was 4 years. For the post-reform period,
the numbers were respectively 7.5 years and 4.4 years. Thus, although the split rating
rewards early restructuring, the introduction of this policy did not change the behavior
of TTLs.

A mixed picture emerges on incentives. Finally, IEG examined whether projects with
the split rating ended up with a higher Outcome rating than they would have if they
had only been rated against their original objectives. This exercise aims to assess if the
policy change increased the incentive for TTLs to restructure. Many TTLs told IEG that
the effort involved in revising PDOs is not rewarded by an improved IEG Outcome
rating. Although there were 156 IEG-rated projects with a split-outcome rating, only 76
of these had a complete explication (in section 6 of the ICR Review) of how the rating
against the original objectives and the disbursement-weighted overall rating were
derived. (The evaluators did not attempt to derive comparative ratings for the other
projects because this would have involved some second guessing of IEG’s review
process.)

Of the 76 projects, 33 (43 percent) had a higher rating under the split system than they
would have received if rated only against the original objectives. But for only 19 of the
33 was the upgrade sufficient to push them from below the line to above the line
(moderately satisfactory and higher). Of the 33 projects, 27 had loans that were less than
50 percent disbursed, indicating that early restructuring is conducive to a higher
Outcome rating. The split system made no difference to the rating for 40 projects. In
three cases, the rating was lower than it would have been if the project had only been
rated against its original objectives. Of course, a badly restructured project will continue
to have poor ratings regardless of whether the split system is applied or not.

The evidence supports early restructuring. In sum, if an adequate reward for the TTL’s
effort to restructure is construed as promotion from an Outcome rating below the line to
a rating above the line, the chances of being rewarded appear low overall (25 percent, or
19 out of 76 projects). But 89 percent of projects that were pushed above the line were
less than 50 percent disbursed at the moment when objectives were revised, indicating
that early restructuring does have a positive effect on the Outcome rating—it is only
last-gasp restructuring that the split system does not reward. However, this clear
incentive has not led to the expected behavior change. The data show that the frequency
and timeliness of restructuring did not increase after 2005. On the other hand, these
data do not support the perception held by some TTLs that revision of the PDO is likely
to increase the chance of a downgrade. (Downgrade will only occur if early
restructuring is coupled with revised objectives that are less relevant than, and achieved
to a lesser extent, than the original objectives.) Only 4 percent of the IEG-rated projects



                                                                                          69
CHAPTER 5
MAKE PROJECTS ADAPTIVE
(3 of the 76) received a lower Outcome rating under the split system than they would
have if rated only against the original objectives.

There is a caveat to these findings: although the introduction of the split rating in
2005 has not increased the incidence of Level 1 restructurings, there are many Level 2
restructurings, which may have had a substantial impact on project outcomes. A
review of FY12–13 project closings in East Asia and Pacific Region found that about 90
percent of these operations had been restructured, sometimes more than once. Only 8
percent involved Level 1 restructurings. Although Level 2 restructurings are not Board-
approved and do not involve revision of project objectives, they involve changes to
component funding and performance indicators which may significantly alter the
results framework. Summing up, adaptiveness embraces both Level 1 and Level 2
restructuring and more work is needed to establish how large an outcome increment
will be generated from a Level 1 relative to a Level 2 restructuring.

Several solutions to the problem of the lack of adaptive implementation were discussed
at IEG’s recent Design Lab. For example, it was suggested that project restructuring
could be made the default. If a project is not restructured by mid-term, the onus should
be on the TTL to explain why not. In addition, as noted earlier, reframing project
restructuring as “agile and adaptive implementation” can help not only to remove the
stigma attached to it, but actually make it attractive for TTLs to change course.
Furthermore, the restructuring process should be streamlined and made less
cumbersome. A tedious process can disincentivize much needed adaptation and course
correction. One way to facilitate adaptiveness would be to frame legal agreements in a
way that allows for changes in component descriptions and implementation
arrangements without requiring a formal amendment. This would also reduce
resistance to restructuring from country clients who must seek parliamentary approval,
although such an across-the-board change in the nature of the Bank’s legal agreements
would have to be approved by the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors.

Finally, where applicable, the Rapid Results Initiative, which breaks-up big problems
into several mini-problems and pilots the implementation of the associated mini-results
by a local team that is closest to the problem, could be considered (Matta and Morgan
2011; World Bank 2004; Schaffer 1991). Under this framework, the local team strives to
achieve a target for the mini-result—often an intermediate outcome that helps to
achieve the overall PDO—within 100 days. This problem-driven iterative process of a
few 100-day, mini-projects embedded in a larger project could not only help to create
local ownership and accountability for results but also would allow for testing of
different interventions across different contexts. However, it may be the case that such
an approach is not widely applicable. Especially in the case of complex projects with

complementarities, slicing and dicing a project into mini-parts could be
counterproductive.


Science of Delivery
The principle of adaptiveness lies at the heart of what President Kim has referred to as
the science of delivery: “the collective and cumulative knowledge base of delivery
know-how that helps practitioners make more informed decisions and produce
consistent results”(Kim 2012). Several initiatives were launched under the science of
delivery banner. Along with three other GPs and CCSAs (Climate Change, Governance,
Health), Water was chosen as a pilot for the Project Cycle Tools Initiative. These pilots
were concluded in November 2014. The Water Toolbox includes a module on political
economy analysis, which is intended to examine how local institutions and interest
groups can best be accommodated when global knowhow is adapted to the country
context. Furthermore, in March 2014 an international science of delivery workshop
hosted by the Bank and co-sponsored by the German Agency for International
Cooperation (GIZ) was devoted to the theme of “Scaling Up Sustainable Water Supply
and Sanitation Service for All.” A follow-up urban water supply and sanitation
workshop was held in February 2015.

In December 2014, the Global Delivery Initiative was co-hosted by GIZ and the World
Bank in Berlin with the aim of developing a better understanding of how to implement
development projects, including by rethinking project cycles to allow for feedback loops
and mid-course corrections; combining global technical expertise with local delivery
knowhow; and conducting research on recurring delivery challenges; and collaborate
on knowledge sharing. Over 40 participants, from around 30 different organizations
joined the initiative, including the Inter-American Development Bank, African
Development Bank, DFID, U.S. Agency for International Development, Harvard
University, the Overseas Development Institute, and the Gates Foundation.

Another science of delivery initiative has highlighted adaptiveness. In September 2014,
a case study was published on the adaptiveness of community-driven development in
Indonesia (Friedman 2014). The Indonesia program is a model of design evolution. This
is well illustrated by the changes in the approach to tackling corruption. Under the
earlier Kecamatan Development Program, a randomized controlled trial conducted by
the U.S.-based Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab showed that the risk of audits,
accompanied by a public reading and presentation of the audit results, had a greater
impact in deterring corruption than some other forms of community oversight (Voss
2008). The follow-on program was modified in the light of these research findings. In
2011 the Audit Board began to audit 20 percent of subdistricts each cycle, reading out

the findings in community meetings. Communities could also take the initiative in
reporting fraud to a dedicated Complaints Handling Unit via telephone, text message,
email, or local drop boxes. Thus, combating corruption works best when communal
oversight is backed up by external audit.

6. Linking Learning to Results
Do World Bank projects that obtain better results do so, at least in part because of more
learning taking place during the project cycle? The Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) approached this question in four ways. First, it purposively selected projects with
Outcome ratings in the satisfactory and unsatisfactory range and interviewed task team
leaders (TTLs) to probe the amount and type of learning that took place during various
stages of the project cycle. Second, it considered evidence showing how tacit knowledge
contributes to project quality. Third, it took a critical view of the evidence that went into
supporting the Bank’s Outcome ratings in order to investigate the assumption that
Outcome ratings are a good proxy for actual attributable results on the ground. Fourth,
it examined aspects of monitoring and evaluation essential for linking learning to
results—results frameworks, indicators, and baseline evidence.


Relationship between Learning and the Outcome Rating
This evaluation examined 10 projects that were subject to field-based IEG Project
Performance and Results Report Reviews (PPARs), comparing five projects whose
Outcome IEG rated highly satisfactory with five whose Outcome it rated unsatisfactory
(appendix C). This review sheds light on the relationship between learning and results.

A LEARNING PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CLIENT IS THE BEST GUARANTOR OF GOOD RESULTS
All TTLs interviewed for the study stressed that learning is necessary but not sufficient
to guarantee results. Having a highly committed counterpart and the environment in
which the project works were viewed as having a greater impact on results than
learning by itself. While learning was not viewed as the main driver of results or seen as
something that “guarantees success,” there was a shared perception that learning makes
a vital contribution. It helps the Bank set priorities among development interventions
and increases credibility with the client. The effect is all the greater when the client
share’s the Bank’s commitment to learning.

All of the those interviewed in connection with the highly satisfactory projects
described a strong relationship that developed with the client which in turn created an
environment in which both the Bank and government teams learned together, and this
was seen as an important determinant of success. Conversely, TTLs interviewed about
unsatisfactory projects described a more distant relationship with a client who was less
engaged or whose engagement waned over time.

LINKING LEARNING TO RESULTS
Two factors stood out as contributing to the development of a close learning
partnership with the client: frequent face-to-face interaction and continuity of project
teams. Frequent personal interaction was achieved in several ways. In some cases the
TTL was based in-country. In other cases the TTL was based in headquarters but
traveled to the field for extended periods of time at critical stages of implementation
and relied on locally based team members for day-to-day follow-up. In addition to
building trust with the client, a strong local presence was identified as enhancing the
project team’s ability to swiftly respond to unforeseen events. Consistency of core
project team members was identified as important for building trust, retaining
institutional memory, and making adjustments.

Looking across the project cycle, the following variables stood out as contributing to a
stronger learning-to-results chain in highly satisfactory projects compared to
unsatisfactory projects:

        The ownership of the project by the counterparts and their commitment to its
         success.
        The capacity of institutions, counterparts, and stakeholders and the extent to
         which the incentive structure provides motivation for successful outcomes.
        The quality of the project design in providing a technical and institutional
         model which is appropriately tailored to the country context, including political
         economy considerations.
        The quality of support and oversight during the implementation process and
         the capacity to respond both to risks that materialize and to unforeseen events.
         In projects rated highly satisfactory the Bank was able to identify and respond to
         implementation challenges in a more proactive manner leading to a more
         successful resolution.
        Projects rated highly satisfactory on Outcome had satisfactory ratings on the
         quality of monitoring and evaluation.
        More learning occurred from pilots in the projects rated highly satisfactory
         compared to those rated unsatisfactory.


Tacit Knowledge Appears to Enhance Project Quality at Entry
At the turn of the millennium, a study of 485 Bank project team members, covering 96
projects, assessed how knowledge gathering influenced the rating that an independent
panel of evaluators (the Quality Assurance Group) gave to project quality at entry
(Haas 2006). Knowledge gathering was assessed by analyzing responses to eight survey
questions, divided between technical and country-specific knowledge, with project
team members being asked to rate how much of these types of knowledge they had

                                                                  LINKING LEARNING TO RESULTS
gathered for the project and how much technical and country knowledge they had
before the project. The study examined how three variables—slack time, organizational
experience, and decision-making autonomy—influenced the relationship between
knowledge gathering and project quality. Organizational experience was defined as
number of years in the Bank, which could be construed as a proxy for tacit knowledge
because the more time operating in a given organization the greater the intuitive grasp
of what works and what doesn’t work in that context. Prior experience creates
absorptive capacity that facilitates the assimilation, interpretation, and application of
new knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Szulanski 1996), knowledge that may be
vital for project quality.

Based on a review of the literature, Haas (2006) hypothesized a trade-off between time
spent gathering knowledge (i.e., reading documents and talking to experts) and the
time devoted to other activities that are vital to project quality—maintaining network
ties that might be needed in the future, developing mutual understanding of team
members’ potential task contributions, or fine-tuning design to meet client needs.
Seasoned team members with years of experience in the organization may be able to
gather knowledge more efficiently without crowding out those other activities bearing
on project quality.

Greater knowledge gathering increased the chances of receiving a highly satisfactory
project quality rating more if the team members had high levels of Bank experience than
if they had low levels of Bank experience (Haas 206). On the other hand, non-Bank
experience did not necessarily boost project quality ratings. To be precise, teams that
were low in Bank experience were hurt by having more non-Bank experience in
development work, but teams that were high in Bank experience were helped by having
more non-Bank experience in development work. This suggests that tacit knowledge
acquired in the Bank helps teams filter for what knowledge from outside the Bank can
help them deliver projects that would attract a high quality rating by persons informed
by the Bank mindset (e.g., all the members of the Quality Assurance Group were Bank
staff or retirees).

Evidence Used for Rating Outcomes

IEG developed a survey instrument to assess the type and quality of evidence on
efficacy (the extent to which the project’s objectives are achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, taking into account their relative importance, and are attributable to the
activities or actions supported by the operation) contained in Implementation
Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) and applied it to a random sample of 71
investment projects drawn from a universe of 261 such operations that exited the
project cycle in FY12 (appendix E). The exercise had two specific objectives. First, to


                                                                                             75

assess what percentage of projects present at least some level of outcome evidence.
Second, to assess the type and quality of evidence on efficacy presented in the ICRs of
those projects that present at least some outcome evidence.

EVIDENCE IS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PROJECT
Most of the projects reviewed present at least some outcome evidence in their ICRs
(figure 6.1), but in two-thirds there was little discussion of the diverse factors that may
have affected the outcome of interest (figure 6.2). This means that in the majority of
cases the outcome of interest, if achieved, could have been due to the Bank supported
intervention, unrelated to it, or may have happened in spite of the Bank intervention.
The most prevalent evaluation design used for generating evidence on efficacy in ICRs
consisted in collecting data on the outcome measures of interest at the beginning and at
the end of the project with no control or comparison group. This design was used in 58
percent of the projects that have at least some outcome evidence (n = 60). In rare cases,
like in the Bangladesh Health Nutrition and Population Sector Program, the ICR had
acknowledged and discussed factors outside the project that may have affected the
observed positive developments in the outcome measures of interest.

ICRs lack rigorous evidence on the extent to which observed outcomes can be attributed
to Bank interventions. Three factors drive this lack of rigorous evidence on project
outcomes. First, Bank projects formulate their outcomes indicators in ways that do not
lead to comparisons of observed outcomes with what would have happened in the
absence of the project. The formulation of outcome indicators is usually done in
incremental terms (i.e., increase enrollment rate by 80 percent in Village A) without
reference to a counterfactual (e.g., increase enrollment rate by 80 percent above what
would have happened in the absence of the project). Second, the evaluation designs
used for generating evidence on efficacy do not exclude other factors that might have
affected the outcome of interest. There is limited guidance to staff on the importance of
considering alternative factors that might have influenced the observed outcome.

Third, there is weak specification of the type of evidence gathering that was anticipated
when the project was designed. Usually there is no discussion in the appraisal
document of which of the following hierarchy of methods for collecting evidence will
be used: experimental design, quasi-experimental design, nonexperimental design, and
input and output monitoring.


Results Frameworks
RESULTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PROJECT NEED LOCATING IN THE BROADER DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT
Throughout its evaluation work, IEG has found that the type of knowledge that is
brought to bear on a project is influenced by the results framework, which sets the
boundaries within which information is gathered. If results frameworks are to be


                                                                                               77
CHAPTER 6
LINKING LEARNING TO RESULTS
meaningful they need to be sufficiently comprehensive to embrace the higher-level
goals toward which the project is pushing, even if the project can only be expected to
make a small contribution toward those goals. The framework needs to include
indicators for outcomes that can be attributed to the project; but, if learning is to be
served, it also needs to situate the project in a broader sector and country context. A
water supply and sanitation project may improve health by providing clean water.
Even if not all the observed improvement in health can be attributed to the project it is
still useful to know that health improved—and if there was no health improvement this
raises valid questions about project design and performance.


Indicators
THE CASE FOR FURTHER HARMONIZATION OF INDICATORS BEARS CONSIDERATION
Bank staff will learn more effectively if they can draw on datasets that are comparable
within and between countries and sectors. The Bank is pushing in this direction. In
October 2014, Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) released the latest
versions of the Core Sector Indicators (A) and the Corporate Scorecard (B). Ideally, set A
should be the same as set B; or, more precisely, B should be a subset of the larger
universe constituted by A. But this is not the case. There is a further limitation. The
largest and most important source for comparable time series data is World
Development Indicators (C). A case can be made that A and B should be taken from C.
Once again, this is not the case. To further complicate matters, project-specific outcome
indicators (D) are different from A, B, and C. Finally, many D indicators are output
indicators wrongly described as outcome (or project development objective [PDO])
indicators.

Some sectors are more harmonized than others, but none is fully harmonized.
Education and health come closest. To illustrate, table 6.1 maps A, B, and C indicators
for education against the D indicators used in Sri Lanka projects from that sector. There
is some evidence of harmonization but there is room for much more. What the table
highlights is the challenge of moving toward harmonized guidelines and the variation
that exists in the type of project outcome. The suite of indicators needs to include those
that are country and sector specific (where harmonization is not appropriate) as well as
global development benchmarks (where more harmonization is feasible and desirable.)

Baselines
STARTING POINTS ARE OFTEN NOT WELL DEFINED
It is harder to learn what contribution a project made without a baseline against which
progress can be measured. Tier III of the October 2014 Corporate Scorecard refers to the
frequency that projects present baseline data in the first Implementation Status and
Results Report (ISR). Unlike its predecessors, the ISR format now includes a column for
baseline data so these data are more systematically cited than before. But the baseline
value is often misleadingly given as zero. For example, the Second Health Sector
Restructuring Project in Turkey inappropriately gives a zero baseline value for the
following indicator: “Smoking prevalence among the 18–29 age group in pilot provinces
relative to nonpilot provinces.” What this really means is that the baseline surveys had
not been conducted when the first ISR was prepared.

In the First National Initiative for Human Development Project in Morocco, the zero
baseline value was correct but not very informative, referring to access to subproject
services, which did not exist before the project. The second project in the series had a
better indicator: “Percent of the population provided with access to improved water
supply in targeted rural communes.” It is better because it acknowledges that the
project builds on an existing foundation (50 percent had access before the project),
rather than starting from scratch. It is also better because it is aligned with the Bank’s
corporate indicators and with a series in the World Development Indicators database.

INDICATORS ARE SOMETIMES NOT RELEVANT
The challenge of meaningful baselines is exacerbated by projects that seek to develop
proxy indicators that have only limited relevance to the range of activities conducted
within a project. These projects often default to tracking outputs and loosely linking
these to the high level project objectives. For example, in Morocco’s Second National
Initiative for Human Development Project, outcomes were measured against a set of
indicators that link to specific project components, but provide little evidence of the

broader contribution it made to poverty reduction in rural areas. Appropriate baseline
data on indicators aligned to the true intention of the project were not collected. This
disconnect between project objectives and results indicators was common in the country
case studies and was a persistent theme in mid-term review reports and in ICRs.

BASELINE DATA IS OFTEN NOT COLLECTED AT PROJECT STARTUP
The 35 projects in the country case studies have 172 outcome indicators. For 37 percent
of these indicators, no baseline value was specified in the first ISR; 34 percent had
baseline values of zero; and 29 percent had baseline values other than zero (figure 6.3).

What the Bank Has Done

STEPS TO IMPROVE PROJECT DESIGN
The Bank is taking steps to tighten oversight of the evidence used to inform project
designs. In December 2014, the Memorandum of Understanding for each Global
Practice (GP) and Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (CCSA) included a commitment to
“standardize agenda for Project Concept Note and decision meetings to include explicit
discussion of the evaluative evidence that has informed the design and the plan for
collecting baseline data.” Two indicators were developed to measure performance
against this commitment: “operations design drawing lessons from evaluative
approaches (percent)” and “projects with baseline data for all PDO indicators in the first
ISR (percent).” Error! Reference source not found. highlights the differences between
GPs and CCSAs in the gap between FY13 and FY14 performance and the FY15 target.

STEPS TO IMPROVE INDICATORS
To allow for systematic comparison of results between operations and between
countries, OPCS is committed to revamping the core sector indicators (CSIs). CSIs were
first introduced in 2009 to facilitate the aggregation of results data across projects. They
were limited at first to projects of the Independent Development Association (IDA) but
then extended to operations of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. There are currently 170 CSIs and, according to OPCS, only one-third of
them are used. Only 38 percent of the active portfolio uses at least one CSI.

In the past, CSIs were developed and approved by sector boards, with OPCS acting as a
“facilitator.” This approach led to a proliferation of indicators—many with questionable

relevance for corporate reporting. In December 2014 the OPCS Council approved a
moratorium on the selection of new CSIs or the revision of existing ones until their
governance arrangements are clarified and a new corporate approach to CSIs is
developed. OPCS is reviewing the usefulness and relevance of the existing indicators.

STEPS TO MONITOR KNOWLEDGE FLOW
In December 2014, the Memorandum of Understanding with the Global Practices Vice-
Presidency for each GP and CCSA included a section on ensuring internal knowledge
flows and World Bank Group collaboration. A common set of indicators for measuring
knowledge flow was introduced. It comprises:

       Technical staff time spent across practices (percent), breaking out H-level staff
        and excluding fiduciary and safeguards work;
       Technical staff time spent across Regions (percent), breaking out H–level staff;
       Portfolio “booked” to multiple GPs and CCSAs (percent); and
       Usage of online GP knowledge portals.

cells indicate how much data still need to be collected as of December 2014. FY15 targets
had been specified for only one indicator. How the indicators will be measured remains
unclear. There were no baseline data.

7. Recommendations
The World Bank’s new organizational structure represents a major commitment on the
part of Bank management to help ensure that the Bank achieves its goal of capturing
and using the best global knowledge that is needed to provide its clients with
development solutions and transformational programs in a timely way. This evaluation
highlights the gaps and grey areas which, if not addressed in a timely manner, are likely
to compromise learning and knowledge sharing as the Bank consolidates the
reorganization. The evaluation’s timing, when the Bank’s reorganization was still
unfolding, is aimed at establishing a baseline and providing early warnings that might
signal necessary course corrections. The evaluation makes the following five
recommendations:


Develop an Updated Strategy for Learning and Knowledge Sharing with the
Institutional Accountabilities for the Implementation Clearly Identified
       Develop an updated strategy for learning and knowledge sharing which
        ensures that the Bank makes optimal use of all relevant learning and
        knowledge—a strategy that gives sufficient weight to behavioral drivers, and
        focuses, in particular, on: informal learning and tacit knowledge; strong and
        visible incentives for staff learning and development outcomes, including the
        necessary time and budget for them; the balance between global and local
        knowledge; and project adaptiveness.
       Clearly identify the governance arrangements and institutional accountabilities
        for learning and knowledge, specifying who is accountable for what at each
        level, in order to ensure the effective implementation of the strategy.


Make Optimal Use of Informal Learning and Tacit Knowledge
       Strengthen the Bank’s mechanisms for capturing, disseminating, and using tacit
        knowledge (for example, on-the-job mentoring, hand-over, team learning, peer-
        to-peer learning, and peer review) to ensure that suitably qualified staff,
        especially those with substantial experiential and tacit knowledge, provide their
        best advice to other staff at critical junctures (including about operational
        approaches that have worked in the past, what the lessons from failure point to,
        and how best to adapt global good practices from within and outside the Bank
        to specific local contexts).

RECOMMENDATIONS
        Strengthen the behavioral skills of staff so that informal learning both by
         individuals and project teams is maximized.


Adjust Institutional Incentives to Promote Learning and Development Outcomes
        Take steps to ensure that the staff’s Overall Performance Evaluation and salary
         ratings, the Bank’s career development and promotion system, and the system
         for time and budget allocations in Work Program Agreements, give sufficient
         weight—in practice—to learning and knowledge sharing for the purpose of
         improving development outcomes, so that the pressure to lend does not
         compromise development outcomes.
        Strengthen the technical stream by consistently promoting suitably qualified
         technical experts to higher level positions.
        Provide better guidance to operational staff about the evidentiary standards
         needed to assess project outcomes and to establish attribution with due regard
         for factors outside the project that may have influenced outcomes.


Balance the Focus on Global and Local Knowledge
        Localize global knowledge (by, for example, ensuring that program leaders, and
         the country directors to whom they report, are able to exercise sufficient
         authority in relation to the Global Practices, which now have overall
         responsibility for portfolio quality) to enforce a good fit between project designs
         and country contexts.
        Leverage local knowledge (by, for example, ensuring that local staff conduct a
         briefing to share their local knowledge with visiting staff from headquarters or
         other country offices) to integrate relevant local insights into global knowledge.
        Ensure that senior staff in positions created under the new Bank structure (for
         example, the GP chief economist, global solutions leads, and program leaders)
         preserve time for learning and knowledge sharing, which can otherwise be
         crowded out by their wider responsibilities.
        Monitor the time that staff from the GPs and the Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas
         devote to working in different Regions and sectors, distinguishing between
         temporary assignments and movement to new jobs, to ensure that the intention
         of the Bank’s new structure is fulfilled.

                                                                      RECOMMENDATIONS

Promote Adaptiveness
      Encourage adaptiveness in project design and implementation by heightening
       senior management’s focus on the main lessons learned from past experiences--
       both successes and failures—at key stages of the project cycle.
      Make it easier and more attractive for teams to restructure their projects
       (including by considering bold solutions such as making restructuring the
       default and putting the onus of explaining why a project was not restructured
       on the Practice Manager under whom the project falls).
      Develop pilot approaches for possible future replication that incorporate fast
       feedback loops, for example, rapid results or other such approaches.
