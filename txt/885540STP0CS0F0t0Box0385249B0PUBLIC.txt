II. Methodology
In June 2012, 200 stakeholders of the World Bank in Sao Tome and Principe were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or the
Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the
judiciary branch. A total of 125 stakeholders participated in the country survey (62.5%).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned them accordingly, or completed
questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing Sao Tome and Principe; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World
Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank; the
Bank’s future role in Sao Tome and Principe; and the Bank’s communication and information
sharing in Sao Tome and Principe.

A. General Issues facing Sao Tome and Principe: Respondents were asked to indicate whether
   Sao Tome and Principe is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three
   most important development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing
   poverty and generating economic growth in Sao Tome and Principe.

B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Sao Tome and Principe, Bank staff
   preparedness, the extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development
   agenda, their agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to
   which the Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate
   the sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources,
   the Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Sao Tome and Principe, with which groups the
   Bank should work more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform
   efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps to achieve development results in Sao Tome and Principe, the extent
   to which the Bank meets Sao Tome and Principe’s need for financial instruments and
   knowledge services, and the Bank’s level of effectiveness across thirty-seven development
   areas, such as economic growth, public financial management, health, education, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge /research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, and
   the Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Sao Tome and Principe’s institutional
   capacity, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Sao Tome and Principe: Respondents were asked to
   rate how significant a role the Bank should play in Sao Tome and Principe’s development in
   the near future and to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Sao
   Tome and Principe.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank and
   that the Bank is responsive to information requests.

   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
        For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the financial sector/private
         banks were combined with respondents from private sector organizations; respondents
         from bilateral agencies were combined with those from multilateral agencies; and the few
         respondents from PMUs were included in the “Other” category. Respondents from
         NGOs, community based organizations, private foundations, trade unions, and faith-
         based groups were combined under the “CSO” category. Note that there were no
         respondents from the office of Minister, the judiciary branch, and consultants/contractors
         working on Bank supported projects/programs.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location
       The vast majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Sao Tome. Because
        of the small number of respondents from Principe, responses from two geographic
        locations were combined for all further analyses, and differences between geographic
        locations are not discussed in the report.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
    Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 4.8.
          Respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks, bilateral/multilateral
           agencies, the media, and independent government institutions indicated the highest
           levels of familiarity whereas respondents from CSOs and the office of
           Parliamentarian indicated significantly lower levels.
          It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
           significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
           effectiveness in Sao Tome and Principe.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       Respondents across all stakeholder groups gave statistically similar ratings for the World
        Bank’s effectiveness across all of these thirty-seven development areas, except “Equality
        of opportunity”. Respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks had the
        highest ratings for “Equality of opportunity” whereas respondents from the office of the
        President/Prime Minister, bilateral/multilateral agencies, and “other” organizations had
        significantly lower ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in this area.
       Responses across all stakeholder groups can be found in the Appendix B.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in STP, bivariate correlational analyses
were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-seven specific areas of effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in STP. The areas determined to
        be key drivers from these analyses were:
             Monitoring and evaluation;
             Economic growth;
             Food security; and
             Education.
       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in STP, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             Education;
             Governance; and
             Monitoring and evaluation.

its critical stakeholders. With this understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective
strategies, outreach and programs that support development in STP. The World Bank commissioned an
independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort in STP. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that
most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank.
