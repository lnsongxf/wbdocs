Executive	  Summary	  
During the 2012 Papua New Guinea Service Delivery Assessment of rural and urban water and
sanitation services, and the development of the country’s first National Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
(WASH) Policy in 2013-14, the need for services in urban informal settlements emerged as a recurring
theme. To address the gap in knowledge about the WASH situation in settlements, stakeholders and
the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) of the World Bank, set out to conduct research in early
2014. Port Moresby, the nation’s capital and home to almost 80 settlements, and the town of Wewak
(representing PNG’s 20 provincial capitals) were selected for the research. Investigations were made
using household surveys, focus group discussions, observations, and consultations.

The findings confirm that informal settlements are an established and permanent feature of the urban
landscape, many existing for 20 years or more. Yet they have long been overlooked and ignored for
water and sanitation services because settlements exist outside of the official town planning areas,
often on customary land, and are institutionally orphaned. Despite this, they are home to up to 50% of
the urban population, possibly housing as many as 250-350,000 people in Port Moresby alone.
Compared to Asian settlements, housing density is low but there are many people living in small
overcrowded houses, with little education and low incomes.

Surprisingly, most households do have access to a toilet, but these are overused, sometimes shared
by more than 60 people, are basic dry pit latrines unsanitary in both their design and use, and need to
be rebuilt frequently when pits fill. They often present health risks by overflowing in the wet season,
and the biggest complaint is that they smell. Defecating in the open does occur, particularly among
children under five who do not use toilets, as they are often frightened or disgusted by pit latrines, or
not encouraged to use them by their parents. Public toilets are not appropriate due to maintenance
issues, while public sewerage is expensive.

Access to piped water supply varies between settlements but it is common for women to spend large
amounts of time and energy filling and then carrying heavy loads of water from both legal and illegal
connections. While piped water is treated by utilities, there are significant risks of contaminating clean
water through illegal connections and risky collection practices. Many households are paying for water
– to local “controllers”, water committees or through formal utility arrangements – but often at unit
rates far above the official rates of water utilities and that paid by the general urban population. More
than 90% of households want to improve their water supply. Quick fix solutions provided by politicians
eg. paying off community debts, connecting to mains water only, or building rainwater tanks are not
long term sustainable solutions for services.

Generally households understand how germs spread from feaces to hands to mouths, and the
importance of washing hands to avoid diarrhoea, but rarely is handwashing practiced. No
handwashing facilities were observed near toilets, and the diarrhoea rate in children under five is high.

Disputes and conflicts within communities over the sharing and use of water and sanitation resources
is common, however, women and girls are at serious risk from poor WASH services in settlements.
Collecting water at night or using a toilet far from the house exposes women to sexual and physical
violence. Even intra-household discussions about the need to have a toilet or better water supply can
lead to domestic violence. Women bear the heavy physical and time-consuming burden of collecting
water. Despite women having primary responsibility for every household task using water, and
cleaning toilets, they have no say in decisions about improving water and sanitation services.

There are steps that can be taken to improve WASH in PNG’s settlements including: developing and
trialing low cost toilet models for self building by households; improving awareness about safe
containment of fecal waste, including infant’s faeces; trialing alternative equitable water supply service
delivery options; strengthening relationships between utilities and customers in settlements to improve
sustainability, and revenue; promoting handwashing facilities near toilets and washing hands with
soap at key times; and increasing awareness about safe water collection and storage. Internationally,
and from rural PNG, there are many examples of approaches which could be modified to PNG’s urban
settlements. Critical to improving WASH in settlements is the involvement of all relevant stakeholders.

1.        Introduction	  
In 2012 Papua New Guinea undertook a national Service Delivery Assessment of rural water, rural
sanitation, urban water and urban sanitation services to identify coverage and targets, how well
services are being delivered and the financing shortfalls in these subsectors. Immediately following
this assessment, stakeholders, through a national policy task force, have developed a draft of the
country’s first National Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Policy. During the course of the
assessment and policy development, peri-urban and informal settlements have been consistently
identified as areas which are underserviced and overlooked for water and sanitation services. The
need to provide affordable and appropriate services in settlements, as well as improve health and
living conditions, was highlighted.

Amongst stakeholders, it was agreed that baseline information on WASH conditions in settlements
was needed in order to develop strategies and to respond appropriately to needs of settlements in the
future. Previous settlement research has focused on urbanisation, housing ownership, land issues,
employment, and anthropology, but WASH has not been researched specifically or in depth. Therefore
in 2014, the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank (WSP), together with key stakeholders,
conducted research in informal settlements in the capital Port Moresby and a representative provincial
town (Wewak) to understand the conditions, aspirations, barriers and opportunities to improve water,
sanitation and hygiene for informal settlers.

The aim of this research was to:

     1. Find out more about existing sanitation, water supply, hygiene and handwashing conditions in
        settlements
     2. Find out what type of sanitation people aspire to and what are the barriers to sanitation
     3. Support the national WASH policy process to plan a strategy for approaches to settlements
     4. Help inform stakeholders about appropriate technical options for urban sanitation that can be
        considered as alternatives to high-cost sewerage-only approaches.

The research findings are also contributing to wider Pacific understanding about WASH conditions and
services in urban settlements in Melanesia.

2.         Approach	  and	  Methodology	  
2.1      Approach	  
The approach to the research has involved a high degree of collaboration with input and support from
NGOs (WaterAid, World Vision, Anglicare), National Capital District Commission, Wewak Local Level
Government (LLG), Department of National Planning and Monitoring, Office of Urbanisation, UN-
Habitat, Eda Ranu, and Water PNG. Collaboration has involved the sharing of information, offering of
local knowledge, suggestions for research needs, and provision of staff to undertake the interviews
and facilitate community meetings. This high level of collaboration is indicative both of the interest in
the topic from a variety of organisations, and the need for a multi-sectoral approach to tackle the
problem. WSP’s role has been one of designer and facilitator for the research. WSP employed a local
Research Coordinator to undertake field work in collaboration with partner organisations.

Given the limited budget and available resources, only two towns were selected for the research: the
national capital Port Moresby, and a typical provincial capital – Wewak, in East Sepik province. Port
Moresby was selected because it is home to some 79 settlement areas, and within the city,
settlements were chosen where partners had already had some (non-WASH) involvement; while
Wewak was selected as a typical provincial capital, and because the research could be supported by
partner organisation WaterAid.

The main challenges have been:
   • The expectation of follow up support for water and sanitation infrastructure, especially when
       World Bank is mentioned
   • The availability of staff from partner organisations to conduct interviews
   • Security in settlements

These challenges have been overcome by clearly explaining that the purpose of the research was
information gathering and that a follow up program cannot be expected; presenting the research as a
collaborative effort with government and other partners; pacing the research so that staff would be
available and recruiting additional enumerators when needed; and hiring security guards for the team.

Settlement residents were very willing to be interviewed and offer personal information to the
interviewers. Many said this was the first time they had ever been asked this information.

This research has its limitations. It is not meant to be a serious statistical analysis but a broad brush
picture on the situation in settlements in order to trigger further discussion and follow up detailed
planning and perhaps piloting by stakeholders. Because of the approach chosen for the research
there have been some unique data issues which have not affected the overall results. For example
there was a tendency for survey questions to be answered by several people in the household,
especially where the head of the household has seniority but may not have the capacity to answer
questions (if elderly and mentally impaired). An interview may start with the male head of household
but be completed by the female senior adult as interest waxes and wanes. This made it unfeasible to
do much analysis between sex of respondents and other indicators. The research did not use
professional interviewers but engaged local partners as a training and skill building exercise. This may
have compromised the objectivity of the data but in the long term has helped build a deeper personal
understanding of the situation in settlements.

The information is presented as an aggregate of all settlements visited to provide a general view of
settlements in Papua New Guinea. Selected settlements are identified to illustrate key points only.

2.2      Research	  Methodology	  
The research used several methods to gather and cross check information:

      1. Interviews with settlement leaders on history, ethnicity, size and WASH issues to provide
         context
      2. Focus group discussions with men and women separately
      3. Household survey – baseline situation of water, sanitation and hygiene practices in 25
         households in each of eight settlements

      4. Observation and photographs of WASH facilities, housing, general conditions
      5. Review of other documents and data eg. census material, academic research, Urban
         Development Plans
      6. Interviews with service providers (Eda Ranu, Water PNG), local governments, government
         departments, and community leaders
      7. A workshop of stakeholders in August 2014 to present key findings and obtain feedback.

Twenty-four focus group discussions were facilitated by WSP’s Research Coordinator, using a
question guide developed by WSP’s Water and Sanitation Consultant. Participants were selected by
councilors with the help of community leaders. Participants selected were those that were seen as
natural leaders in the community and those that had an interest in having community development in
their area as a priority. The participants were divided into separate Females, Males and Leaders
groups for the discussions. Male and female groups were asked the same questions, with the
exception that the women’s groups were also asked about menstrual hygiene practices. Younger
women were also included in the Female focus group discussions.

The household survey covered a sample of 200 households in Port Moresby and Wewak. The sample
numbers by urban location are shown in Table 1. A sample size of 200 at a confidence level of 95%
provides a margin of error of +/-6.89%. Given the survey implementation issues of cost, security,
availability of interviewers, this sample size, and margin of error, was deemed to be acceptable for this
broad type of research.

were only conducted during the day, especially the morning. 25 households were randomly selected in
each settlement. Although 97 females and 103 males were recorded as the primary interviewee, often
the household interview involved several people from the family contributing at the same time. Of the
primary interviewees, 50% were head of the household while 33% were the spouse of the head of the
household and 17% were another adult living in the household.

WSP’s Research Coordinator provided field supervision and checked the accuracy and completeness
of questionnaires. Data was initially entered into a customised Excel Spread sheet, and then data was
cleaned by the WSP Water and Sanitation Consultant, and analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences) software v.20.

Feedback from local partners and interviewers provided the following suggestions or observations of
the social research process:
    • The questionnaire should be translated into Tok Pisin to save time during interviews
      •      Most places had never participated in such a survey so there was a high expectation of follow
             on programs. Some areas (Wewak) had participated in surveys eg. Water PNG, so queried
             why the same questions were being asked again.
      •      The experience of stakeholders in interviewing households improved their personal
             understanding of the conditions, and problems in different settlements
      •      No information comes into settlements.

3.          Settlements	  and	  Urbanisation	  Context	  
3.1 What	  is	  an	  Informal	  Settlement?	  
There is no consistent definition of informal settlements as conditions and characteristics vary
between countries and regions. Formal definitions, such as the following from UN-Habitat, OEDC and
WHO, are simplistic for describing the characteristics of informal settlements in the Pacific:

         Informal settlements: are defined as: i) residential areas where a group of housing units has
         been constructed on land to which the occupants have no legal claim, or which they occupy
         illegally; ii) unplanned settlements and areas where housing is not in compliance with current
         planning and building regulations (unauthorized housing).
                                                                              -UN Habitat; OECD; WHO

A description of informal settlements compiled from several sources more closely reflects the
complexity of settlements:

         Informal or unplanned settlements are residential areas that have developed outside of the
         formal urban planning rules of a city, usually in physically marginal or peri-urban areas. They
         are characterised by uncertain or illegal land tenure; minimal or no services such as water
         supply, sanitation, electricity, and roads; informal employment and low incomes; and lack of
         recognition by formal governments.
                                                                - author’s definition, from several sources
                                                                  1
For PNG this definition includes the following characteristics:

     •    Typically self-built houses, owned by the occupant
     •    Large and overcrowded households
     •    People from the same tribal group living in clusters
     •    Occupation of land may or may not be illegal
     •    An entrepreneurial self-employed population (which may include legal and illegal activities),
          high unemployment, with few people working in the formal sector
     •    Variable levels of electricity, water supply and sanitation services
     •    Health issues including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis
     •    Tribal conflict and violence
     •    Environmental and ground water pollution from human and solid waste.

Traditional urban villages, for example Hanuabada in Port Moresby, are different from informal
settlements. While housing and settlement is “unplanned” in a formal urban planning sense and some
services are lacking, these villages do have a common ethnicity and a leadership structure and
security of tenure as they occupy their traditional land. They are not specifically included in the
research although some of the recommendations for water and sanitation will be relevant.

3.2 How	  many	  people	  live	  in	  settlements?	  
Port Moresby in 2010 was estimated to have 20 planned or formal settlements and 79 unplanned
settlements (of which 32 are on state land and 47 on customary land), with 45% of the city’s
                                          2
population living in informal settlements. The urban population of Port Moresby at the beginning of
2012 was best estimated in the range of 500,000 to 750,000 persons which means about 250,000 to
                                     3
350,000 people live in settlements. In the coastal city of Lae, it is estimated over 50% of the city’s
population lives in settlements, with rural urban migrants coming primarily from Mamose, the New

                                                                                      4
the population lives in settlements, while in Goroka the proportion is as much as 60%. Squatter and
informal settlements are a common feature in all of PNG’s three cities and most larger provincial
towns.

3.3 Urban	  growth	  and	  settlements	  	  
Squatters and settlements have become a ‘permanent’ feature of the PNG urban landscape.
Especially in Port Moresby, many settlements are long established – some since the 1950s.
Historically settlement growth has been due to high migration from rural areas in search of an urban
life, increased population growth, and the lack of formal and affordable land and housing to match this
increase. In Port Moresby recent growth has been triggered by resource projects driving up house
                                                    5
rents, as well as the eviction of other settlements.

PNG’s high urban growth rate (around 2.14% between 2005 and 2010), is predicted to be higher in the
future – up to 4% per annum between 2020 and 2030, and declining slowly after 2035. The urban
                                                                                                        6
population is expected to increase to 1.73 million and account for 17% of the total population by 2030.
It is certain that settlements will continue to grow as urban populations rise and there is increased
demand for housing and land. An analysis of the Port Moresby settlement inter-censal growth rate
                                                                                       7
between 2000 and 2011 conservatively indicates an average annual growth of 5.0%. Other analysis
of Port Moresby settlement indicates that “on average, a new informal settlement was established
each year over the 20 years to 2000 and the settlement population grew at an annual rate of 7.8 per
                                                                                8
cent—twice the population growth rate of Port Moresby overall—in this period.”

3.4     Complex	  land	  ownership	  	  
Some 97% of land in PNG is customary in nature, with 2% government or state-owned and 1%
freehold tenure. In PNG most informal settlements are on customary land held by traditional
landowners, usually without formal registered title. Customary land cannot be bought or sold except
through long and complex procedures. The government has no jurisdiction over customary land
unless the landowners have entered into agreement with the government for use of the land.
Customary land is not subject to government planning and development controls.

Some settlements are on “alienated” land, ie. land which has been removed from customary
                                                                               9
landowners and formally registered and titled by government or private owners. Much of the state
owned land is undeveloped and abandoned and therefore used for informal settlement.

Customary land ownership arrangements for settlements are complex. Customary landowners either
rent, sell, or provide land under kinship arrangements with relatives and tribal outsiders. The
occupation of land by people who are not members of the descent group is permitted both by custom,
         10
and law. This flexibility provides urban land and a place to live, which the formal land system cannot
deliver quickly or affordably. However the informal nature of these land dealings and settlement is
prone to conflict. Systems of settlement on customary land range from explicit (and sometimes
documented) arrangements on the purchase, sale, and rental of land and properties, to zero rental
                                                                 11
payments, and to overt occupation without any compensation. Some landowners find it difficult to
evict those settled on their land, and refuse any payments in fear of legitimizing the claims of the

  For example in 2011 the NCDC Manager mentioned a staff member renting for K550/week but when the rent
rose to K1000/week the employee was forced to move to a settlement. Evictions have occurred in Paga Hill and
other areas of Moresby South LLG.

settlers. “Third Party” settlers – those occupying customary land over which several customary owners
are in conflict – live the most precariously, as they have no binding agreements and could be forced
                           12
off the land at any time. In Port Moresby land is constantly sold, bought and rented without prior
knowledge or approval of the state or traditional land owners, and without going through formal
                                     13
processes to document land title. Land ownership disputes are perpetual.

3.5 Institutional	  Responsibility	  for	  Settlements	  
No particular ministry is responsible for dealing with settlement issues after a housing policy change in
1986 moved responsibility for housing development from the National Housing Authority to market
forces. The Department of Lands and Physical Planning responsibility extends only to land settlement,
land policies and allocation. Necessary policies and guidelines dealing with settlements are absent:
no up-to-date guidelines for design and utility service provision in the informal settlements; no pro-poor
policies to deal with settlements upgrading; and no pro-poor land policies.

The Office of Urbanisation, within the Department of Community Development, prepared the National
Urbanisation Policy 2010-2030, which for settlements, advocates a “sites and services” upgrading
approach. One of four pilots it is undertaking is customary land registration and development in
Taurama Valley settlement in Port Moresby. However the Office has few resources and capacity, and
government support for the Policy has been erratic.

Logically, settlements could be assumed to fall within the remit of urban LLGs (and rural LLGs where
peri-urban settlements spill beyond declared town boundaries). However several LLGs can cover one
urban area eg. Port Moresby. LLGs report to the central Department of Provincial and Local
Government Affairs (DPLGA) and therefore feel little direct responsibility for settlements in the way
that a municipal authority or city council might. Urban LLGs largely neglect and ignore settlements,
                                              14
and in some cases support forcible eviction. In Port Moresby, the NCDC is meant to be the main
implementer of capital works, and the implementing agency for development of settlements and low
               15
cost housing. Despite having a Settlements Division, NCDC does not acknowledge settlers in its City
Plan, and does not have the budget, power, or human resources to plan or implement any
                                                                    16
improvements, despite having an NCD Settlements Strategic Plan. On the positive side, the LLG and
ward committee structure overlays settlement areas, and councillors and politicians can represent
their constituent settlements through a formal government structure and process. Some ward
councillors live in settlements and are an important community focal point.

4.          Research	  Findings	  
The following section presents the findings from the social research under topics dealing with land and
settlement, socio-economic conditions, sanitation, water, hygiene, gender, and development priorities
and issues.

4.1 Settlements,	  land	  and	  housing	  
Settlements	  are	  a	  permanent	  feature	  of	  urban	  living	  
Most of the settlements studied had existed since the 1990s, and settlers had lived there for many
years - typically 20 years and on average 17 years – while Segani (Konedobu) had been settled since
1954. For adults who had long since left villages, settlements had been their home for most of their
adult lives, and were now a home for a second and third generation of children born and raised in
settlements.

Local governments do have a vision relocating some settlements into more formalized allotments with
services, however this is a long way in the future. Current attempts at relocating or providing land title
are proving to be complex and time consuming. For example in Port Moresby, UN-Habitat with Office
of Urbanisation, as well as NCDC are attempting to formalize selected settlements and allocate land
title so that services can be improved. This is a painstaking process and favours state land
settlements as the landowner is easier to identify. With 79 unplanned settlements in Port Moresby,
and a lack of policy, human resources and finance, it will be a very long time before all these
settlements are formalised.

Settlements	  are	  not	  high	  density	  but	  households	  are	  overcrowded	  
Generally, with the exception of Segani, settlements surveyed had low density housing compared to
Asian settlements. Houses had clear separation from neighbours, and defined boundaries and land
areas, usually delineated by fences. However household density is very high, with many people living
under one roof. The average household size is 8.4 people, with the median household size 8.0.
Households range in size from 1 person to over 30 people. A quarter of all households have between
10 and 30 people living in them, frequently in small houses in crowded conditions. This means that
services such as toilets or water points may serve large numbers of people.

Recent population growth also gives settlers the feeling of overcrowding. An example is 9 Mile
settlement which has absorbed people evicted from Port Moresby South LLG, leading to crowding of
small sub-settlements such as 102 Turn Off, White Stone and Mat Mat (Cemetery) within 9 Mile.

might feel they are closer to “owning” the house.

When asked about the likelihood of being evicted from the house, respondents were divided about
whether this was likely or not likely (figure 2). The feeling in Wewak was that there were more land
issues and a higher chance of eviction, and people interviewed felt they could be evicted.

4.2         Socio-­‐economic	  conditions	  
Many	  males	  and	  young	  people	  live	  in	  settlements	  
There are more males than females living in settlements: 52% males compared to 48% females
according to the household survey. The 2011 Census shows 54% males compared to 46% females
live in Port Moresby settlements, while Wewak settlements have slightly more females (51%)
compared to males (49%). There are many young people living in settlements – 48% are under 18
years of age in Port Moresby (compared to 37% for the city as a whole), and 41% under 18 in Wewak.
70% of households had a child under the age of five years.

Not all children are living a stable household. Women in 8 Mile settlement raised a concern about the
large number of orphan children who are scavenging in the settlement. The women feared that when
these children grow up, they will get involved in criminal activities.
	  
Education	  is	  Low	  	  	  
Education levels are low, particularly amongst women, who are more likely than men to be illiterate or
have achieved only primary level education. However during interviews it was observed that younger
respondents had higher education levels than their parents, although it was also observed that many
children in settlements are not attending school. Of primary survey respondents, 8% had no schooling
(12% of women with no schooling compared with 4% of men), with 45% completing primary level
education, and 29% achieving some high school education. (refer Table 2). The education level of the
head of the household is slightly higher, however this is distorted because there are many more male
household heads household (83%) than female (17%). Proportionally, 61% of female household
heads were illiterate or achieved only primary school level compared with 43% of male household
heads with primary education or less.

The low education level has implications for any awareness activities which must be suitable for an
illiterate population. There is also a need to translate awareness activities and information into local
dialects.

The	  main	  employment	  is	  irregular	  informal	  work	  	  
Market selling was a main source of income for more than 40% of households with casual work, such
as labouring, contributing to 10% of households. Income from private employer wages and salaries
was present in 40% of households while government wages and salaries featured in only 12% of
households. 2% of households relied solely on donations, gifts and charity.

Even though households are likely to underestimate their income in a survey, the dominance of
informal work means that there is not much money coming into households in settlements. Household
incomes average about K590 (US$238) per fortnight but range between K20-K4,200 (US$8-
US$1,696) per fortnight. The median household income was K400 per fortnight (US$162) or K28 per

day (US$11.31). The median income divided by the median household size (8 persons) gives a per
capita daily income of just K3.50 (US$1.45).

Those with regular government jobs appeared to have better housing and in some cases better
sanitation facilities. Government employees with practical skills stood out even more. One
government-employed mechanic in Wewak had a water meter registered with Water PNG (installed 15
years ago), a toilet and electricity, while neighbours had none of these.

Many	  houses	  are	  without	  electricity	  
About 60% of households have no electricity. Those that do have electricity, pay an average of K34
(US$14) per month for the service.

Port	  Moresby	  settlements	  are	  ethnically	  diverse	  
Nearly all households in Wewak were from East Sepik Province, although representing a range of
villages from all over the province. A few people from Morobe and New Ireland were included in
Wewak settlements.

In Port Moresby residents are from many different provinces – from the settlements surveyed
residents represented a dozen different parts of the country - but predominantly from Gulf, Morobe,
Oro and Eastern Highlands Provinces. Due to the nature of the sample of settlements, the full range
of origin of settlers was not covered.

4.3           Sanitation	  
Most	  households	  use	  a	  toilet	  
Most toilets (85%) used by a household are simple dry pit latrines, with about 8% of households
practicing open defecation (figure 3). Most open defecation is occurring in Wewak. In the past the
government had a bucket collection system of household sewage (night soil) but when this was made
illegal in the 1980s pit toilets did not replace this system and households reverted to using the bush.
Use of septic system is very rare and no one is connected to a sewerage system, although a system
only exists in Port Moresby.

Lack	  of	  toilets	  is	  due	  to	  laziness,	  lack	  of	  land	  and	  money	  
The main reasons given in the household survey for a household not having a toilet (or its own toilet)
were:
   • Land issues/do not own the land (21%)
       •       Not enough space in the yard to build toilet (19%)
       •       Not enough money to build toilet, not enough materials (14%)
       •       Groundwater level is too high (12%)
       •       For health reasons/attracts flies and smells/want to avoid flies (7%)
       •       Soil is rocky, difficult to dig (5%)
     • No water/not enough water to operate a toilet (5%)
Focus group discussions listed similar reasons for not having a toilet: laziness, no space to build
toilets, and some cannot afford to build toilets. Women’s focus groups gave reasons of: people not
wanting a toilet near their house as it is not healthy especially when it smells and also when it rains
and floods. Some households were not concerned to have a toilet of their own because they were
comfortable using another household’s toilet, while others did not mind using the bush. A men’s focus
group in Wewak thought some households did not have toilets because they preferred the sea or
beach, had a shortage of land, or existing land was swampy and prone to flooding.

Importantly there are issues that are not perceived as barriers to having a toilet. Land ownership was
not necessarily a major barrier to having a toilet. In Wewak despite a landlord requiring households
living on his land to have toilets because it was healthier, some households did not build a toilet due to
“laziness”, difficulties with the high water table, and lack of materials. Not having available labour or
knowledge in how to build a toilet were also not raised as barriers to having a toilet.

The main advantages of having a toilet were perceived as:
   • Convenience, can use any time (23%)
       •       Privacy (21%)
       •       Healthier/prevent disease (21%)
    • Safety, especially at night (12%)
Other notable advantages expressed were that if a household had its own toilet it did not have to
share with others, and it would reduce conflict.

Pit	  latrine	  styles	  are	  varied	  but	  basic	  
There is a wide range of pit latrine styles across all the settlements surveyed. This indicates that there
is no single design and choice of construction style is up to the builder and the individual household.
However, most dry pit toilets are of a basic construction, many little more than a hole in the ground,
and some without a roof. Toilets are usually made from timber off-cuts, roofing iron, trees from the
yard or nearby bushes, with pits sometimes lined with oil drums or tyres. Few latrines used new
materials.

Toilets	  are	  located	  away	  from	  the	  house	  
Only 1% of toilets are attached to the house, while
most toilets (69%) are within the yard area of the
household but away from the house, and 30% are
located outside of the household yard or premises.
The distance in metres from the house is shown in
Figure 4. Building toilets away from the house is
done because of the smell and flies. Local leaders
in ATS settlement also mentioned a health
program that had visited the community and
advised people to build toilets 30m from their
house.                                                                In some settlements toilets are clustered together

Sharing	  of	  toilets	  is	  common	  
Although there were some problems with understanding the survey question on sharing of toilets, the
results broadly indicate that about half the households share a toilet with others, usually related family
units and near neighbours. Most sharing occurs with two or three other families, but there are some
cases of up to eight households sharing in settlements in both Port Moresby and Wewak. Even two or
three households sharing could mean 16-25 people sharing one toilet, while eight households sharing
could equate to more than 60 people sharing one toilet. Sharing toilets is a common cause of
argument and conflict in the community.

Most	  Children	  under	  Five	  Years	  defecate	  openly

In 80% of the households with a child under five years of age, these children do not directly use the
toilet where one exists, while 20% do use a toilet. When children under five defecate in the yard,
parents sometimes collect the faeces or cover it (see table 3). During site observations, faeces was
noted on the ground in the toilet area. These were from children who go to the toilet area but defecate
in the open, beside or in front of the toilet, but not in the toilet. Given the poor condition, strong smell,
and darkness of most pit latrines it is not surprising that children are reluctant or afraid to use toilets.
Some of the reasons given for not using the toilet was fear of the pit and falling in, and fear of insects.

Some	  households	  have	  made	  toilets	  for	  children	  
A few households have constructed children’s toilets for use in the open air. Sometimes these are
near adult toilets. Families have recognised that children have difficulty using adult toilets or fid it
unpleasant.

Disabled	  are	  not	  accessing	  toilets	  
About 8% of households had someone who had difficulty using the toilet (eg. disabled, elderly, ill,
heavily pregnant). Their toileting was handled in different ways eg. defecation in the yard with the
faeces then covered or collected and put into the pit; defecation at the beach; some continued to use
existing toilets, including being carried to the toilet by family members when necessary; some use a
special toilet (such as a commode).

Soil	  and	  site	  conditions	  are	  challenges	  to	  sanitation	  
Soil conditions in settlements are challenging, making digging toilet pits to any great depth difficult.
Ground conditions include extremely rocky conditions, high water tables and sandy soils (which cause
pit collapse).

the toilet superstructure. Only about 5% of households empty their pit (often into a drain), while 3%
continue to use the pit even when it is full. There is no desludging or emptying of pits by external
contractors.

In Wewak, households realized they needed good toilets that last a long time, because with population
increases in settlements and current pit toilets lasting only 1-2 years, there is no space to build new
toilets. This was a reason given why some households do not build new toilets but resort to sharing

raised.

The	  greatest	  complaint	  about	  toilets	  is	  their	  smell	  
37% of households using a toilet said their toilet did cause problems for neighbours. The main
problems were smell, followed by overflowing pits during floods and pooling of waste around the
house. In 8 Mile settlement for example, during heavy rain toilets overflow and toilet waste can pollute
neighbour’s yards.

When asked about what householders disliked most about their toilet, the issue of smell was
significant. Also, toilets are disliked as being unhealthy and dirty. Issues about sharing the toilet with
others and the careless use of the toilet by others and inappropriate disposal of anal cleansing and
sanitary materials, when combined, is also a significant reason for disliking toilets. Other problems
included people not using toilets eg drunkards defecating wherever they like. About one fifth of
households liked their toilets.

Cleaning	  toilets	  is	  a	  woman’s	  job	  
Feedback from the survey shows that cleaning of a toilet is mainly the role of an adult woman in the
household (figure 7). While men do have some role in cleaning, this role is exaggerated when men are
responding to the question as they claim they are more likely to do this work. On the other hand,
women downplayed that cleaning a toilet was a shared household responsibility and attributed this
task more to female children or no one cleaning toilets.

From observation it is difficult to believe that much cleaning is done at all. There was no evidence of
cleaning materials or water in any toilet observed, nor evidence of having been recently cleaned.

Everyone	  wants	  a	  better	  toilet	  
Having an improved toilet was almost a unanimous desire, and the likelihood of being evicted only had
a marginal impact on whether households wanted to upgrade their toilet. 88% of households who said
they were “very likely” to be evicted wanted to upgrade their toilet, compared to 96% of households
who were “not at all likely” to be evicted. However it was more difficult to pinpoint exactly what type of
improvement was preferred as there is low awareness of the range of sanitation options available.
Given that most of the people have pit latrines in poor condition they saw a septic system as being
cleaner and healthier but without understanding the costs involved and other options for better on-site
sanitation. From focus group discussions, perceptions were that septic toilets were better than pit
toilets as they used water, flushed, were cleaner and did not smell.

The results to this question on toilet improvements highlights a gap in knowledge about what makes a
healthy and clean toilet and that a well constructed, appropriate and regularly emptied pit toilet does
not need to be unpleasant. There is an association between septic toilets and better sanitation, yet
there has clearly not been any exposure to positive models of dry or pour flush pit toilets which could
be cost effective options. Similarly, some households stated that a connection to the sewerage system
was a preferred upgrade as it meant no smell and a healthier alternative. The cost implications of a
sewerage connection was not considered. Insecure land tenure was a barrier to investing in septic
toilets as these were seen as a large and risky investment if there was a chance of being evicted.
	  
Building	  toilets	  is	  a	  man’s	  job	  
Men play a dominant role in deciding whether or not to build a toilet, as members of the household but
also in roles as landlords, community leaders, and extended family members (figure 8).

Because building toilets is hard physical work, according to both men and women, this is a man’s role.
Digging the pit is difficult and construction may take a full week of work, and can be delayed due to
difficult digging conditions eg. rocky ground, or in the wet season the pit walls collapse during
construction. Also men were believed (by themselves and wives) to have the knowledge and skill to
build pit toilets.

Households	  do	  spend	  money	  on	  sanitation	  
Building a simple pit toilet ranges in cost from K200-K500 (US$81-$202) with up to K1,000 (US$404)
and K2,000 (US$808) when land is also purchased as part of the construction. Used vehicle tyres
which are sold in town are used to support the pit walls from collapsing and cost K20 (US$8) each.
Other materials such as metal oil drums are used for pit lining (K10 each – and typically requiring 3-4
no.). Timber (K30-K100/US$12-US$40), roofing iron, sago leaves, nails and labour costs for helpers
(including food for workers) are all expenses for building a simple pit latrine. Even the most basic
toilets made from bush materials and timber off cuts incur costs such as transport of materials from
outside settlements. Costs for rebuilding a pit toilet after the pit is full are difficult to calculate, however
as a minimum it can be assumed to be equal to the cost of pit digging and lining materials.

Hardware	  is	  available	  but	  expensive	  
During the field work hardware shops in Wewak were visited to find out what sanitary hardware was
available in a typical provincial town and what the prices were. Prices and products are presented in
Table 5. A local PNG product - green plastic toilet unit consisting of pedestal with seat and lid for use
in a pit toilet - were out of stock in two hardware shops due to popularity. These were often used in
rural areas.

Some	  interest	  in	  financing	  of	  toilets	  
About half the households interviewed in the household survey said they would take a loan to build a
toilet. The main reason given for taking a loan is that it provides financial support to enable a better
quality toilet, the use of longer lasting materials, and the toilet could be built quicker as materials could
be obtained faster than without a loan. Others simply wanted to take a loan as it was a way of
improving the family health, sanitation and living. Those that were not interested in a loan had no
regular source of income and could not meet bank requirements to obtain a formal loan, such as
collateral or having a job. Others also felt that a loan would not work for people that were unemployed.
For female respondents who were unsure about taking a loan indicated that this would be the
husband’s decision, and they could not comment.

Neighbours	  who	  think	  the	  same	  may	  upgrade	  toilets	  
About half the households thought their neighbour would improve or build their toilet in the next 12
months, mainly because they have the same concern to improve their health/toilet. Some of the
reasons given why neighbours would not be likely to upgrade or build a toilet were that they had no
money, were lazy, were comfortable using the bush and other’s toilets.

The	  community	  can	  help	  the	  poorest	  households	  with	  sanitation	  
Responses to a question about how to help the poorest households in the community indicated a lot of
good will and altruism towards others. There were many suggestions about helping the poor by
providing materials, helping them to build toilets with community voluntary labour, or simply donating
or fund raising money for toilet building. Youth groups were suggested as being key helpers to build
toilets, in the survey, focus groups and the stakeholder workshop. Mention of the government or
outside donors providing support for the poor was rare, indicating a low expectation of outside
financial assistance.

Public	  toilets	  are	  not	  supported	  
Public toilets were widely thought to be an unsuitable solution to the sanitation problem as they would
not be managed, maintained or cleaned properly. There is a feeling that they would also be targets for
vandalism from drunkards or drug users, as well as expose women to risks from physical violence and
sexual assault. Others did not want to wait in line to use the toilet. Women also suggested that some
households might claim any public toilets as their own and control their use, leading to conflict.
Women were adamant that public toilets should not be encouraged as no one would take ownership of
them.

Of the very few people supporting public toilets, they saw them as a potential solution for households
who could not afford toilets, but only if leaders guarantee that plans and regulations will be imposed
for the management of the public toilets. This seems unfeasible.

Poor	  or	  no	  sanitation	  has	  safety,	  security	  and	  conflict	  implications	  
The issue of sanitation provides many opportunities for insecurity, conflict and physical and sexual
violence in settlements. These examples were provided during the research:
     • Often arguments occur as a result of excessive usage of other people’s toilet, those that do
        not have a toilet feel ashamed when arguments occur and resort to using the bush or drains

    •    Arguments with neighbours also occur when pit toilets are full and there is argument about
         land space for building a new pit
    •    Sometimes when children defecate in the neighbour’s area, it creates conflict and trouble with
         neighbours
    •    Using the bush is not safe as one can get bitten by snakes
    •    Girls can also get raped while using the bush as a toilet so it is not safe. In ATS and June
         Valley settlement focus groups said that it is not safe when women and girls are using the
         bush and the toilets at night, as they can easily be attacked by drunkards.

Wastewater	  disposal	  adding	  to	  pollution	  
Most households dispose of household waste water in their yard or garden, while others have access
to drains in their yard or to a street drain for disposal, or pour it into a creek or stream. Very few
households (around 4%) dispose of waste water in toilets.

Wastewater from pigs and chicken raising were also mentioned as causing pollution in some
settlements.

Drainage is a serious problem in some settlements particularly in Wewak where the water table is
already high. Women raised concerns about people using drains for defecating and the health risk
because women and children bathe in the drains, and when there is no water at all, the drains are also
used to wash clothes and dishes.

High	  use	  of	  piped	  water	  for	  drinking,	  but	  access	  is	  poor	  
The majority of households use piped water (from Eda Ranu or Water PNG) for drinking in both the
wet and dry season, although there is some substitution of rainwater for drinking in the wet season
(figure 10). Focus group discussions in Wewak suggested that dug wells were a common source of
drinking water, although this did not come out strongly in the household survey. A serious problem
with dug wells was that they were polluted from toilet run off by flooding in the wet season.

While there is little change in the location where water is sourced between the wet and dry season for
either Wewak or Port Moresby, there are significant differences in where water is collected between
these two cities (figure 11). Settlement residents in Wewak are more likely to get water from their own
tap or a neighbour’s source, while Port Moresby settlers collect water from public tap stands or illegally
tapped pipes.

Access to piped water through an unauthorised connection provides a low service level: low pressure,
many users, time consuming, distance from household, and unsafe collection point. Wewak
settlements had better access to piped water and a higher level of service than Port Moresby due to
historical piped water connections to groups of households in some settlements. Expansion of existing

services was not occurring however, and there were no plans by Water PNG to improve accessibility
of the service.

The water supply situation is dynamic in Port Moresby with recent connections and disconnections to
settlements and different ways of accessing supply, including tap stands installed by Eda Ranu, illegal
connections, and a combination of these. Recently politicians have been funding water supply to
settlements which is then provided by Eda Ranu as tap stands for groups of houses, and managed by
the community. In Segani settlement Eda Ranu installed additional standpipes in late 2013 (previously
only two with irregular supply) however only four out of five water points were working due to low
pressure. This places extra demand on existing standpipes, resulting in delays and queueing.

In 9 Mile settlement a local politician allegedly paid K100,000 for water to be connected in early 2014,
after the community was presented with a bill from Eda Ranu for K87,222.

In June Valley water was sourced from illegal pipe connections into the network including some
households with their own direct connection.

The location of the water source has profound implications for the time spent in collecting water, and
loss of productive time, especially for women to whom the burden of water collection mainly falls and
for young girls (figure 13). This time could be better spent earning income for the family, in education,

In Wewak, off-premises water collection took between 5 and 30 minutes, while in Port Moresby,
especially in the dry season water collection typically took two hours, but up to four or five hours for
some households due to distance and waiting time. For example, In 8 Mile settlement the water
pressure had recently been reduced, so while walking to the illegal connection might take 10 minutes,
waiting in line and then filling containers can take hours. Because women are manually carrying water
between the collection point and their home, they usually need to make multiple trips to satisfy water
needs of large households. Even if water collection takes just one hour, this may be needed three
times per day, taking three hours each and every day. For young girls, this responsibility may impact
on school attendance. To avoid queues when collecting water, some women collect water late at night
and/or very early in the morning, thus putting themselves at risk of violence.




  Even if the connection is an approved one, due to low Waiting in the queue for a trickle of water wastes time
  pressures and high demand from many households, for many women in settlements
  collecting water is tedious and time consuming, taking
  several hours each day

Domestic	  violence	  and	  conflict	  occurs	  over	  water	  	  
According to a focus group discussion of leaders in 8 Mile settlement, domestic conflicts and violence
usually occur when there is not enough water in the house. Women in ATS settlement stated that
women and children who need to collect water at night (from the previously few collection points) are
put at risk from physical and sexual violence.

For some women, water is not available within their residential block and they must walk to other
blocks within the settlement. As a result, arguments with women and children arise over the water and
they are forced to steal water from the other blocks.

  I run a piggery. Water is my business, now without water it is really hard to look after my business
  and it affects my family as well, I give too much work to my children and they get tired and when I
  complain my husband gets on me, he chased me with a knife yesterday when I did not want to pay
  K100 for the connection of the water supply. I don’t want to pay because I just came in last year and I
  should not be told to pay K100 at least a K50 would be reasonable. – Woman, 9 Mile Settlement


Disputes and conflict arise over contributions to shared bills eg. households sharing a tap stand or
meter, or when one household takes over a water point and controls it. In Wewak billing by Water
PNG was sometimes irregular (sometimes one month, sometimes two or three months) with a rising
debt up to K,1000 and threat of disconnection. At this point some households were unwilling to make a
contribution, leading to disputes and arguments. Water PNG in Wewak acknowledged that on
occasion bills were not delivered to the correct person each month, especially if meter readers did not
know the area and community well.

Illegal	  connections	  increase	  risk	  of	  water	  contamination	  
Most households (75%) do not treat their drinking water as there is a common perception that piped
water is good quality because it is already treated by utilities. Some households boiled water and/or let
it settle as forms of treatment. Breaks in supply eg. when the main network is turned off and then
reinstated, are also a potential source of contamination. Some households had observed that when
the water is cut off and supply is then resumed, there is a lot of dirt in the pipes and there was concern
about the quality of water when this happened. Drinking water was avoided as in the past children got
diarrhoea.

While the need for household treatment of drinking water is low given the widespread use of treated
piped water, the practice of collecting water from illegal connections and cut pipes poses a
contamination risk from both the water containers and the water point. More than 90% of households
store water in the household. Many households collect and store water in PET Coke bottles for
drinking water, and jerry cans for cooking and other domestic water, but some use recycled bottles
previously used for oil or chemicals such as acids. Dirty and muddy polluted water around the
collection point can easily enter containers and contaminate water. According to NGOs working in
settlements, containers are not cleaned and often contain mould.




  Not only is the water pressure low, but there is a risk of contamination while collecting water from these illegal
  pipe tappings


Settlers	  are	  paying	  for	  water,	  but	  not	  always	  fairly	  
Just over half (55%) the households surveyed are paying for water. Methods range from paying
someone who controls an illegal connection K2 per bucket or K2 per load of containers or K2/K5 per
day in 8 Mile and 9 Mile, to K10 per month from community managed public tap stands in Segani, to
monthly (or more infrequent) payments through formalized water billing for a shared tapstand from
Water PNG in Wewak. For those households paying for water, the estimated average monthly
amount paid for all sources of water is K43 (US$17.37).

A sample of household payments and quantities of water, obtained from the household survey and
interviews, are presented in table 6. What this selection shows is that there is wide variability and
inequity in what households are paying for water, especially based on their consumption per month.
The estimated unit costs per kL (1,000 litres or 1 cubic metre) ranges from K3.79 (US$1.53) to K100
($US40.39). By comparison, the Eda Ranu regular tariff is K1.00 (US$0.40) per kL, up to the first 15
kL consumed per month. Water PNG has a minimum charge of K16 (US$6.46) for 0-12kL. Clearly
some settlers are expending a lot of effort to get a little water and paying a lot more for it than
households in formal areas with connections directly to their house.

Willingness	  to	  pay	  for	  a	  better	  service	  
90% of households want to improve their water supply, and of these, 94% are willing to pay for better
water supply. For example, June Valley residents were willing to pay for a better service and thought
if five or so households had a dedicated tap stand then collecting money from every household
clustered around one tapstand would be feasible.
If we ask every household to pay K5 every month then it is very easy.
                                                                    –                Man, June Valley Settlement


Even households with illegal connections wanted a better service. For example a household with an
illegal connection to Eda Ranu water said they wanted to improve the reliability of their erratic supply
and “go straight” and were willing to pay for the better service.

There was a general sense that settlements had “learned their lesson” from the past when water had
been supplied but was cut off due to non-payment. Many people expressed a willingness to pay for
better access to larger quantities of water as it was critical to family life and health.

                                                                     -   Highlands Woman, 8 Mile Settlement;

Preference	  for	  household	  water	  connections	  
Most households were interested in having a household connection with a meter for the following
reasons
    • do not have to share with others; avoid conflict and disputes over water usage
     •     reduced cost – can control the water usage and pay for what is used
     •     convenient and easy access for household water use;
     •     more private, healthier and safer; can use night and day; avoid vandalism of tap stands, and
           avoid others claiming the supply and selling water
     •     saves time; tired of walking long distances.

As one respondent put it: My body aches from carrying water so I want water to come into my
household.

Regular	  payments	  to	  utilities	  preferred	  	  
A monthly payment frequency was preferred although it is thought that households did not understand
the concept of paying a smaller amount more frequently. A more frequent payment option eg.
fortnightly, which would be sensitive to the cash flow needs of low and informal income households,
could be explored further by water utilities as a way of improving payment recovery rates and
contributing to non-revenue water reduction.

Paying water bills to water utilities was the preferred payment method as the money was seen as
going straight to the service provider as direct payment for the service (figure 14). While a few
households were comfortable paying the water committee, partly due to their presence in the
community, many were not and expressed a strong distrust of the water committee’s ability to manage
the finances honestly and without misuse. Some settlements previously paid water committees or
leaders but this had failed. In 8 Mile settlement past water payments had been collected by a water
committee but the monthly fee was not paid to Eda Ranu and eventually the water was cut off.
                                               19
Support for paying through banks and easipay was because these methods provided a receipt and
evidence of having paid and the money would be safely used for the purpose intended. In Wewak,
where there had been some slow billing and disconnections, easipay was thought to be better for
avoiding disconnections as the current charge could be paid on time and access retained.

19
   Easipay is a prepaid method of paying for electricity supplied by PNG Power via a Digicel mobile phone.
Consumers can make a minimum K15 payment against their meter number. The advantage is that consumers
can check their balance, pay small amounts at a time, buy units 24 hours a day, make payments without visiting
the PNG power office or agent, and avoid disconnection.

Where piped water is formally available in
settlements, payment collection is rather sporadic
and unequal. For example in Segani settlement,                                         Segani local councilor publically displays records of
households are billed K10 per month through a well                                     which households have paid their monthly water bill

organized water committee, which publically
displays the amount owing for each household, but
some ethnic groups refuse to pay for water, and not
all installed taps are functioning.

Utility	  policies	  are	  a	  barrier	  to	  accessing	  water	  
Both Water PNG and Eda Ranu have policies that prohibit household connections in settlements
where the landowner is unknown, however neither utility discloses its connections policy or procedure
on their website. A men’s focus group in Wewak stated strongly that Water PNG must change its
eligibility guidelines or criteria as these are a barrier and stop people from being connected to the
water supply. The community thought that a connection could only be obtained with three approvals –
from landowner, ward councillor, and Court House. Clarification from Water PNG in Wewak was that
applications are made by completing an application form with some proof of ability to pay eg.
electricity bill, work pay slip; and some identification or statutory declaration. It was also mentioned
that Water PNG will not supply to an area if there is substantial debt, unless an individual can show
some proof of ability to pay. Another technical barrier, that overrides any connection policy, is the lack
of a mains pipe in the area and sufficient pressure in the network, and sufficient water treatment
capacity, and ultimately sufficient raw water to supply water.

4.5         Hygiene	  Behaviours	  
Some	  understanding	  of	  Fecal-­‐Oral	  Transmission	  	  
Defecating in the open was widely stated in focus group discussions as a way of transmitting disease
including diarrhea, and cholera, but also TB. Open defecation in bushes was thought by men and
women to be unhealthy, smelly, and brings diseases and sicknesses through flies landing on faeces
and then food.

The potential for toilets to cause sickness were also expressed eg. when pit toilets overflow during
floods, and also septic systems discharging waste to street drains and causing the same health and
disease problems as open defecation.

Diarrhoea	  is	  common	  in	  children	  under	  5	  
Of the 140 households with a child under 5, 34 households had a child in this age group with
diarrhoea in the last two weeks. This gives a household prevalence rate of 24% of households with a
child under 5 with diarrhoea.

Survey respondents stated that the main causes of diarrhoea in children were dirty hands, dirty water
and dirty food (table 7).

Handwashing	  knowledge	  but	  not	  practice	  
Knowledge of the importance of clean hands as diarrhoea prevention in young children is high. The
survey found that the most important times to wash hands were: after defecating, and before eating,
followed by preparing food. This indicates that hygiene knowledge is reasonably good, however there
is a gap between this knowledge and actual practice. According to the household survey only one third
of households had a place for washing hands. This place was commonly either a yard tap which may
or may not have soap, or a bucket of water outside. Observation during the field work showed that
rarely were handwashing places located close to the toilet, and handwashing appeared to be seldom
practiced.

Newspaper	  is	  the	  most	  common	  anal	  cleansing	  material	  
The survey and observation shows that newspaper is the most common anal cleansing material
(figure 15). A telephone Yellow Pages was also observed in one toilet. Although the survey indicated
toilet paper was also used this was rarely observed, and households may think of newspaper as toilet

households use sticks and stones.

Menstrual	  Hygiene	  practices	  
During menstruation, women clean up by bathing, sometimes at the same place they collect water for
cooking and drinking. Some women prefer privacy and carry the water all the way back to their homes
to clean up or bathe. In Wewak during menstrual periods women use the same area they normally
bathe in, but when there is no water they walk long distances to bathe or at least clean and change,
while others go to the sea. Sometimes women steal water from others because they are desperate to
clean themselves.

Women and girls use sanitary pads bought from the small canteens in the settlement, others use
babies diapers because it is less expensive than the sanitary pads, toilet paper and also pieces of
cloth, or face towels when there is no money at all to buy sanitary pads.

During menstrual flow, most women usually dispose the used sanitary pads in pit toilets; others store
the waste pads in plastic bags and then dump these in places where all the rubbish is disposed. A
hazard of this practice is that sometimes dogs scavenge in the rubbish for food and drag out the
sanitary pad waste and expose it openly which causes a lot of embarrassment for women. Many
women dispose of pads into creeks or drains. Some women store the waste pads and carefully burn
them later. Pieces of cloth or face towels or cloth nappies are washed and dried for use again later.

Health	  staff	  are	  the	  main	  sources	  of	  hygiene	  information	  
The main source of information about personal and household hygiene is from health extension
offices, hospitals, and clinics (figure 16). Mass media also plays an important role in spreading
information, particularly via radio.

In some settlements health staff never or rarely visit and for some residents the only contact with
health staff is when they visit a health centre or hospital. In ATS settlement hygiene and health
awareness was from visiting hospital, the sister from the haus sik coming to the settlement, and also
               20
Susu Mamas mobile clinics in settlements. Settlers in Segani also mentioned World Vision as
bringing health information.

   Susu Mamas is a non-government organisation (NGO) that was formed over 30 years ago to support and
promote breast feeding for infants. It now provides primary health care services.

4.6        Gender	  Aspects	  
The research highlights very clear divisions of labour around water supply and sanitation and in the
decision making and control of resources which would lead to improvements in services. Men are
responsible for ultimately deciding whether to build a toilet or not, providing the money or taking a loan
for this, and are the ones who physically build toilets. Women are users of toilets but also look after
the toileting needs of others eg. infants, sick and elderly, and also have special needs in terms of
menstrual hygiene and sanitary materials disposal (or reuse). Women and girls are at risk of physical
and sexual violence if defecating in the open or using a remote toilet at night. However women have
little say in whether a toilet is built and the type of toilet that is built and where it is located.

There is an opportunity for sanitation promotion and marketing to recognize the unique roles of men
and women and tailor approaches and information to men and women. For example technical
information on different improved toilet models might be primarily targeted at men. Men might be more
supportive of better sanitation if they are persuaded that it protects women and girls and has a better
health outcome for their family. There is likely a degree of pride for men in having self built an
improved odourless toilet.

Women are the prime collectors of water for all household needs yet have no influence on the
provision of water to their household and community. While some men sympathise with the physical
burden of women in fetching water, they do not share this function. Women and girls are also exposed
to physical and sexual violence if collecting water far from home at night. Clearly women need to be
brought into the planning and implementation of any water supply improvements as this has a direct
effect on their everyday lives. Men may be a powerful voice in advocating for better water supply if
they are persuaded that paying for a better water service reduces the physical and time burden for
their female family members.

Awareness and promotional approaches for water, sanitation and hygienic behaviour will need to
consider the generally low level of education in the community, but the particularly low education of
women.

4.7        Development	  Priorities	  
Water supply was the most important development priority expressed by households followed by
toilets and electricity (figure 17). Notably housing and land title each were not listed as top priorities
although in some of the focus group discussions, obtaining land title was seen as a major priority and
the key to unlock improvements in access to services and infrastructure. Non-ownership of land had
been the basis of refusal for connecting water services in the past. Women in 8 Mile said they hesitate

                                                                              30
Findings and Recommendations: PNG Sanitation, Water Supply and Hygiene in Urban Informal Settlements

to upgrade water and sanitation in fear that they can be evicted from the area when NCDC wants to
develop the land. Men in 9 Mile settlement felt gaining land title would bring access to services and
security as being on customary land they could be evicted at any time despite the settlement existing
for 20 years.

For women, a better water supply was critical as they are the ones that spend the time and energy
collecting and carrying water.

As settlements have different local physical and social conditions, other priorities for development vary
according to these local needs. These were expressed as: drainage, solid waste collection, sealed
roads, development of different skills for youths so they can get a job, also education programs like
early childhood and adult literacy, and addressing law and order issues related to alcohol abuse and
marijuana use by youths.

Suggestions from the community and local leaders specifically on water supply and sanitation
included:
     • Conduct awareness on how to build good toilets, using toilets, cleaning and maintaining the
        toilets
      •     Provide technical advice on building appropriate toilets
      •     Provide combined septic tanks between 4-6 households
      •     Provide loans to build toilets
      •     Conduct more awareness of water supply system and treatment, including more engagement
            with utilities, so leaders and community members can better understand the need to pay for
            water
      •     Conduct community awareness within settlements including with the Police and NGOs.
      •     Improve management skills of leaders so they can mobilise the community to develop, use
            and pay for services.

Community	  Leadership	  needed	  
The role of the local councillor and/or community leaders in mobilizing and coordinating community
resources was seen as important in both helping the poor but solving sanitation and water supply
issues generally. However, households were frequently critical of government leaders being too self-
centered and not doing their job to help people. The support of leaders for project initiatives was felt to
be missing, and meant that sometimes individuals in the community took it upon themselves to solve
problems. For example, in Wewak a group of women organized themselves to make a water
connection application which they presented to the mayor, however they were told there is a holdup
due to lack funding for household water connections. In June Valley a mothers group is closely
following the progress of a plan from Eda Ranu to supply water through shared taps.



                                                                       31

 We would be willing to pay for better water and sanitation services, we can be creative with our own
 initiatives to raise funds and start projects however the community is not too supportive in helping us,
 we have our own little group we formed to try to help our women and youth in the community.
                                                                          – Woman, Wewak Settlement

Where there are strong local leaders they can be quite influential in the community, but only up to a
point. For example in Segani the community leader had developed a transparent payment system for
water supply, however a different clan group refused to pay the water bill, which indicates that
community leadership does not override social and cultural networks.

There was a high degree of support expressed for any organization willing to bring better water and
sanitation services to settlements. From the community, this support is more likely to be in the form of
labour and mobilisation rather than cash.

4.8       Comments	  
Comments were received from only 68 out of 200 households surveyed. Comments focused on
reiterating the need for water supply and sanitation, questioned what the government is doing about
the issue, including land title, and also what will happen after the survey.

      •    After 20 years without proper water supply; we have been neglected, we need services
      •    Government must help us earn land title and provide proper water and electricity;
           government must help us to build septic toilets connected to sewage pipes
      •    Every household should have their own toilet, women also bath at the public taps which they
           should not be doing that, it is very unhealthy
      •    Main waste water drain flooding during wet season leaving debris, waste and faeces
           everywhere which brings all kind of diseases, we would like proper drains and proper
           sewerage system in place.
      •    Most people use the beach and mangrove for toilet and it is unhealthy
      •    Our area needs improvement of drainage and rubbish collection, also improve housing and
           support from healthy island programmes; we need clean piped water, good drainage and
           awareness on hygiene
      •    We need each household to have toilets and water supply to avoid conflicts
      •    We need proper water and sanitation to prevent diseases affecting our health
      •    Bring water into the settlement so I can bring it to my yard. My back is aching from carrying
           water
      •    We just need water to come inside our households, it is a great need, Water is life.
      •    Eda Ranu should improve water pressure so every household should collect their own water
      •    Water is important; water is the major problem, water is the key
      •    Clean water is needed, we suffer during frequent floods
      •    Would like these basic services to come into the settlements so our lives would change
      •    Thanks for coming, water and sanitation is a great need in this community, many children
           under 5 usually suffer from diarrhoea
      •    After this survey what happens?; appreciate this survey; happy about this study
      •    If this kind of survey is conducted every quarter every year to conduct the healthy island
           concept it would be good.

5.       Sanitation	  and	  Water	  analysis	  using	  SaniFOAM	  
Further analysis of sanitation and water is considered appropriate, including summarising the findings
within a structured approach, using SaniFOAM. SaniFOAM is a framework to analyze sanitation
behaviors to design effective sanitation programs. Developed in Durban, in February 2008, at a
workshop attended by participants from 6 organizations including UNICEF, the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, USAID and AED/Hygiene Improvement Project, SaniFOAM is
designed to assist program managers and implementers in answering questions about sanitation
behavior including the barriers and motivators for change.

In the acronymn SaniFOAM, FOAM stands for:
• Focus: - who is the target for sanitation behavior and what is the behavior to be changed?
• Opportunity: - does the individual have the chance to perform the behavior?
• Ability - is the individual capable of performing it?
• Motivation - does the individual want to perform it?

This SaniFOAM framework is used to analyse the sanitation and the water supply situation in PNG
settlements. The framework boxes (in bold) are populated with findings from the PNG settlement
research for Sanitation (figure 18) and Water (figure 19).

6.         WASH	  models	  and	  initiatives	  
The follow section provides a brief introduction to existing and potential models of water and sanitation
and lessons learned.

6.1       Sanitation	  
The ADB Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project (2000-2008) included a Low-Cost
Sanitation and Community Awareness and Health Education (LCS-CAHE) Program in Alotau, Lae,
Madang, Mt. Hagen, and Wewak, targeting poor households in urban fringe areas out of reach of
sewerage systems. The component attracted high demand for VIP latrines, although the cost of these
was not “low cost” at an average unit cost of K3,340 (US$1,200). Opposition to pit latrines from the
Local Level Government in Madang reduced the impact of this sanitation improvement as septic tanks
were insisted on. This project experience highlights two important points. (1) Engaging with LLG is
critical in the planning and implementation of any improvement program. Wewak LLG, for example, is
very willing to support improvements in settlements, even if this is improving on-site sanitation; others
may be less willing. (2) project supplied sanitation is not low cost, and does not achieve wide scale
impact. A better approach is to provide knowledge, skills, financing mechanisms, supervision, and
monitoring for households to improve their own sanitation.

In 8 Mile settlement, NCDC is trialing a combined septic tank for residents of one block (from Ialibu,
Southern Highlands). According to people on site during this settlement field work, NCDC is paying for
the communal septic tank and the cost of toilets (ceramic pedestal) and connections to the system. It
is not clear which section within NCDC is supporting this initiative, nor how the issue of low water
pressure (Eda Ranu closes supply between 4pm and 8am) will be overcome. It is also unknown what
arrangements are made for user contributions and emptying.

A demonstration toilet exists in the Department of Health
Environmental Health Division in Wewak, built in the 1980s
during a period of active promotion of rural sanitation. As a
demonstration model it has endured in good condition over the
last 30 years but uses expensive materials eg. ceramic pedestal
with cistern and a concrete slab. The pit is offset with a T-
junction vent and no outlet. The reason for the offset is that a
new pit could be built and the lining reused without destroying
the toilet housing and slab. The principle of a demonstration
toilet is good, however issues of affordability also need to be
considered if a demonstration is to be effective.

The EU Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program provides
some good examples of simple improved sanitation backed by
sanitation promotion such as Community Led Total Sanitation
(CLTS), which could be applicable in urban settlements.
                                                                      Low cost and hygienic pit latrine, Sibilai,
Internationally there are many examples of low cost toilets          Milne Bay (EU-RWSSP)
which focus on both the technical – pit design, ventilation,
product durability, and social - user preferences and innovation, ease of use, odour and fly elimination.

The range of technical options for settlements is outlined in the following list, however the options
depend on what the sanitation chain is in the wider urban area, including removal, treatment, and
reuse of fecal waste.

      •   Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrine
             o Relocate or arborloo
             o Empty and reuse the pit
             o Keep structure and move offset pit
      •   Sanplat with lid/cover
             o Relocate or arbor loo
             o Empty and reuse the pit

6.2            Water	  supply	  
Local politicians are funding water supply in some settlements but without thorough consideration of
payment mechanisms and sustainability. In Wewak local politicians are paying for water connections
and water tanks to some settlements where Water PNG is able to provide sufficient pressure, or
wiping outstanding debts of residents to reinstate supply. In 9 Mile a local politician had only
connected water in early 2014 (to a main and poly pipes). No water committee had been formed or
trained or tasked with collecting fees from households, although there was some discussion that K10
would be collected from households. In this vacuum some households near the start of the supply
control and sell the water. While this shows some entrepreneurship on one level it is illegal and unfair.
Similarly in Wewak where politicians give water tanks these are taken over by one family.

In ATS settlement, during the household survey, Eda Ranu began supplying water to tap stands
serving between 5 and 9 households. The payment method for water was rather unclear, depending
on who was asked, - ranging from paying per use or each household pays K10 per month to a
household in charge of each tap stand.

Overseas examples suggest:
   • Capitalizing on existing entrepreneurship in the community through formalized and metered
       water vending or water selling points/water kiosks – this provides jobs within a community
           •   If tap stands are provided, it is good practice to meter standposts to see which ones are being
               used excessively, are in high demand and which ones are not in use or not working effectively
               or not well used. This approach was suggested in Segani as there is conflict over use and
               payment of the tap stands and settlers feel it would be fairer to know how much water is used
               by different groups.
           •   Extending household connections to settlements through private or public utilities and Output
               Based Aid. This approach refocuses service provision on meeting household needs with
               operators receiving a subsidy payment only after an independent agent has verified that they
               have delivered working connections to the households.

Findings and Recommendations: PNG Sanitation, Water Supply and Hygiene in Urban Informal Settlements

In PNG settlements there is potential for greater awareness on water use, payments etc. Widespread
awareness should precede water installation so that everyone in the community knows what to expect
and what responsibilities are. ATS is an opportunity missed in this regard, clearly there is some
confusion about who pays and how much.

7.         Recommendations	  
Based on the research findings, the following next steps are recommended:

7.1       Sanitation	  

      •   Conduct market study on sanitation hardware and potential for low cost sanitary products to
          be available from local and international suppliers
      •   Using examples from PNG (including Department of Health’s rural sanitation handbook) and
          internationally, develop a range of appropriate urban low cost on-site sanitation options which
          are acceptable, eliminate odour, are convenient and safe and can be built by the householder.
          These should focus on the safe containment of fecal waste below ground. Fully cost each
          option including separate costs for pit/below ground; slab/seat; and toilet superstructure.
      •   Develop toilet options such as septic tanks for difficult ground conditions eg. high groundwater
          table, rocky ground, clay soils
      •   Conduct pilots of limited sanitation options in settlements (preferably located on state land)
          and monitor use and performance. Wewak LLG and WaterAid have offered to support a pilot
          during 2014-2015.
      •   Develop and implement community awareness such as CLTS with sanitation marketing, so
          householders reject open defecation, realise the need for sanitation, and choose the sanitation
          options themselves
      •   Investigate financing options for improved toilets including low interest loans. Adopt a no-
          subsidy approach except in challenging environments
      •   Research the fecal sludge flow diagram in urban areas, beginning with the pilot town of
          Wewak and investigate opportunities for fecal desludging of pit latrines in Port Moresby and
          provincial towns
      •   Improve fecal sludge management and treatment such as developing and maintaining
          septage ponds
      •   Conduct an assessment of the potential for reuse of fecal sludge eg. as a fuel or fertiliser.

7.2       Water	  Supply	  

      •   Shortlist and trial suitable management options for improving water services in settlements eg.
          Output based aid, private water kiosks etc
      •   Review water tariffs and charging mechanisms and standardize for settlements to ensure
          equity and value for the level of service provided. Develop a policy on fees and charging
          mechanisms for settlements which is broadly consistent between utilities.
      •   Improve capacity of water utilities to engage with settlement communities including
          consultation with men and women.
      •   Increase awareness of settlement residents on how water is provided through field visits,

My name is .............................. and I am working on a water supply, sanitation and hygiene
improvement study for the Government of PNG. Your household has been randomly selected to
participate in a survey to understand water and sanitation practices, services and desired
improvements.

I would like to interview the head of the household or their spouse, or another adult who lives in the
house. The answers will be used for the purpose of this study only and will be confidential. Your co-
operation will greatly help in assessing water supply and sanitation improvements in your area.

Are you willing to answer questions about your household: Yes/No? If NO, thank the person and
move to next house.
