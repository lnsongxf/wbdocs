SPREP AND VANUATU CONTEXT

      Context: SPREP Region
The Pacific Islands is a place of enormous diversity in physical geography, culture, languages, social-
political organization, size and natural resource endowment. The area is also extremely vulnerable
to environmental changes because its predominantly small islands and fragile environment are
susceptible to natural and human-induced geologic and climatic hazards such as cyclones, droughts,
and tsunamis, resulting from the global rise in greenhouse gas emissions, increasing populations,
and unsustainable exploitation of its biodiversity and natural resources.
The Pacific Islands region includes 14 nation states and eight territories scattered over one third of
the globe, covering an area of around 30 million km2. Of the total area, only 0.4% is covered by land,
made up of between 20,000-30,000 small islands, with Papua New Guinea (PNG) covering 83% of
the region’s land area.

As reflected in Table 1, the Pacific Island nations range in size and population, from Papua New
Guinea, which is spread over 400,000 km2 with a population of over 5 million, to Nauru with a
population of less than 9,800 and a land mass of only 21 km 2, and Niue with a population of roughly
1,500 residing on a land area of 259km2. Solomon Islands and Fiji have populations above 500,000,
while Vanuatu, Samoa, Tonga, Kiribati, and Micronesia have populations of between 100,000 and
230,000. The remaining smaller island states of Nauru, Palau, Cook Islands, Niue, Tuvalu, and
Marshall Islands have populations ranging from around 60,000 down to 1,400. The population
growth rates for the region are relatively high, averaging 2.2% per annum. Countries that have high
emigration rates such as Tonga, Samoa, and Tuvalu normally have less than 1% growth rates, while
Niue and Cook Islands with New Zealand citizenship have had negative growth rates for the last 10
years.1
With the exception of PNG, the Pacific’s populations predominantly reside in rural coastal areas,
thus making them even more vulnerable to sea level rise and tsunamis.

The Pacific economies are primarily dependent on agriculture (20-40% of GDP), fishing (10% of GDP)
and tourism (up to 40%) of GDP in some countries.2 For countries like Samoa and Tonga,
remittances account for 25% and 32% of their respective GDPs. The continental high islands of the
Melanesian group have extractive industries such as logging and mining as additional major
contributors to their economies.
The resource-rich Melanesian states have higher GDPs than the Polynesian and Micronesian states.
PNG has a GDP of USD$7906 million, Fiji a GDP of USD$3061 million, Solomon Islands a USD$715
million GDP, and Vanuatu a USD$729 million GDP. The rest of the region – which includes Samoa,
Tonga, Niue, Cook Islands, Tuvalu, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Kiribati, Nauru, and the
Marshall Islands – have GDPs ranging from USD$523 million in Samoa to USD$54 million in Nauru.
The 14 Pacific Island nation states have all signed and either ratified or acceded to UNFCCC, UNCBD,
UNCCD, and Stockholm Convention on POPs for which GEF is the financial mechanism.
To have individual countries undertake national efforts to combat the environmental challenges is a
difficult task due to small populations, limited economies, lack of technical knowledge base, and
trans-boundary conditions. It is for these reasons that the Pacific Island countries established
regional bodies such as the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) to
coordinate regional efforts and support the countries’ sustainable development efforts.
SPREP was established by Pacific Island governments and territories under the Agreement
Establishing SPREP in 1993, “… to promote co-operation, and provide assistance in order to protect
the environment and to ensure the sustainable development for present and future generations.”3
The key focal areas under SPREP are climate change, biodiversity and ecosystem management,
waste management, pollution control, environmental monitoring and governance.

    Context: Vanuatu
The Vanuatu islands are located in a seismically and volcanically active region and have high
exposure to geologic hazards, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and landslides.4
Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French condominium of the New Hebrides, is an irregular Y-shaped
chain of some 80 islands, with a total land area of about 12,190 km2. The country’s total population
was estimated to be 240,000 people in 2010, and it has an annual population growth rate of 2.3 %.5
In 2010, Vanuatu’s GDP was approximately $729 million with a growth rate of 4.7% and per capita
income of $1,908 as shown in Table 1. Agriculture and tourism are the main productive sectors
contributing to Vanuatu’s economy. Agriculture contributes 21.5% of GDP; tourism contributes 19%
of GDP.6 The vast majority of Vanuatu’s population is engaged in informal subsistence economic
activities. 79% of Vanuatu’s population lives in rural villages, ranging from one family to a thousand
people, meeting subsistence and cash needs from locally available terrestrial and inshore marine
resources. The monetized commercial sector accounts for less than one third of all economic
activity.
Vanuatu ranks 118th on the Human Development Index (HDI) and 52nd on the Human Poverty Index
(HPI). Poverty levels stubbornly remain at about 40% of the population, with about 26% living on
less than $1 per day. The low economic and social statistics for Vanuatu are a major stumbling block

PACIFIC ISLANDS AND VANUATU GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS
The Global Benefits Index (GBI) is a measure of the potential of each country to generate global
environmental benefits in a particular GEF focal area. Separate indices are determined for the
biodiversity and climate change focal areas as shown in Table 2.
The GBI for Biodiversity seeks to measure the potential global benefits from biodiversity-related
activities in a country. It reflects the complex, highly uneven distribution of species and threats to
them across the ecosystems of the world, both within and across countries.
The GBI for Climate Change seeks to measure the potential global benefits that can be realized from
climate change mitigation activities in a country. The approach reflects the objectives of the GEF
climate change operational programs to address long-term priorities to mitigate climate change.
Adaptation funding is through the Least Development Countries (LDC) Fund, the Adaptation Fund,
and the Special Climate Change Fund, which is outside of the GBI calculations.
As shown in Table 2, the GBI’s for the Pacific Islands for climate change are all zero, which suggests
that there is no global environmental benefit to climate even from the region as whole. As for the
biodiversity GBI, the assessment given below clearly shows how both the terrestrial and marine
biodiversity exist in the region. This is the unfortunate issue as in reality, the Pacific is home to a
very high and rich biodiversity, high endemism and are the most vulnerable to climate change due
to the smallness of the islands and the tropical locations which bears the brunt of tropical cyclones
and drought on a regular basis. This will be explained in detailed in the following sections.

   Biodiversity
The Pacific Islands region is one of the richest areas of terrestrial and marine ecosystems on earth,
with habitats ranging from mountain forest ecosystems to volcanic islands and low lying coral atolls

and extensive coral reef systems. The New Guinea Islands (the west is part of Indonesia and the
east is part of Papua New Guinea) alone is home to over 5% of global terrestrial biodiversity, with
two thirds found nowhere else in the world, despite being less than 1% of the global landmass. The
Western Pacific, which includes Melanesian countries and Palau, is recorded as having the highest
marine biodiversity along with the most extensive coral reef system in the world. The region’s
isolated islands provide ideal conditions for the evolution of new species. As a consequence, Pacific
islands have high numbers of "endemic" species, including more than 400 endemic bird species.7
The huge expanse of ocean supports the most extensive and diverse coral reefs in the world, the
largest tuna fishery, the deepest oceanic trenches and the healthiest and in some cases, largest
remaining populations of many globally rare and threatened species including whales, sea turtles,
dugongs and saltwater crocodiles. The richness of biodiversity in the Pacific is evident in the
presence of biodiversity hotspots that include both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Eastern
Melanesia, New Guinea Island and New Caledonia are recognised for their rich and diverse
terrestrial areas.
The Coral Triangle hotspot is one of the richest marine biodiversity hotspots globally with over 600
coral species, and over 3,000 documented fish species are known to exist in the Coral Triangle,
which includes the Melanesian countries of Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.
The Polynesia-Micronesia hotspot is home to approximately 5,330 native vascular plant species, of
which 3,070 (58%) are endemic; 242 breeding native bird species, of which approximately 164 (68%)
are endemic; 61 native terrestrial reptiles, of which 30 (49%) are endemic; 15 native mammals, all
bats, 11 of which (73%) are endemic; and three native amphibians, all endemic. Although there are
no true native freshwater fish, at least 96 marine species are found as adults in freshwater and 20
species are endemic. Knowledge of invertebrate diversity is very patchy.8
New Guinea Island’s biodiversity as documented in the PNG National Biodiversity Strategy and
Action Plan and the biodiversity literature is home to some 15,000-21,000 higher plants, 3,000
species of orchids, 800 species of coral, 600 species of fish, 250 species of mammals, 760 species of
birds, and eight species of tree-kangaroos, of which 84 genera are endemic. Ecosystems range from
lowland forests to montane forests, and alpine flora down to coastal areas which contains some of
the most extensive pristine mangrove areas in the world.

Many of the unique plants and animals of the region are amongst the most endangered in the
world, mainly because the tiny sizes of most of the islands also means the total populations of many
species are naturally very small, which makes them especially vulnerable to any disturbance. The
Pacific currently has about 25% of the world's threatened bird species and has already lost many
species. Worldwide, the largest number of documented extinctions (28 between 1600 and 1899 and
23 in the twentieth century) has occurred on the islands of Oceania which now have more
threatened species (110) than any other region. Estimates identify that there are roughly seven

times more endangered bird species per capita in the South Pacific than in the Caribbean, 50 times
more than South America, and a hundred times more than in North America or Africa. The
Polynesia-Melanesia hotspot is considered the epicentre of the current global extinction crisis.9
Long-standing cultural and spiritual foundations link Pacific Island peoples with their terrestrial,
coastal, and marine ecosystems and the species they harbour. However, native species are in
decline and ecosystems are being disrupted by human activity. For many years, growth in
economies and populations has been driving unsustainable resource use and extraction. This has led
to over-harvesting of vital coastal and pelagic fisheries. Unsustainable logging and forest conversion
for plantation agriculture has often resulted in severe localised impacts on terrestrial ecosystems,
fresh water and soil loss. On some larger high islands, poorly managed mining operations have had
devastating environmental and social impacts.
Increasing transport and trade have brought invasive species to the Pacific Islands. These have
severe ecological impacts on biodiversity, as well as economic impacts on major production sectors,
tourism, and trade.
Protecting and sustainably managing these important biodiversity areas is something Pacific Islands
countries cannot do alone with their limited technical, financial and human resources.

     Biodiversity in Vanuatu
Vanuatu belongs to the East Melanesian Islands biodiversity hotspot. As detailed in table 3 the
hotspot is rich in biodiversity, and being islands are also very high in endemism with 26% of plant
species 45% mammal species 42% bird, 90% amphibian and 6% of freshwater fish species.10 A
review on studies of the flora and fauna for the Vanuatu Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan noted the
presence of more than 1,100 plant species, 297 coral species, 80 species of insects, 13 mammal
species, and more than 469 shallow fish species. Vanuatu’s terrestrial ecosystems are classified into
five main vegetation types, mainly lowland rainforests, montane cloud forests, seasonal forest,
scrub and grasslands, and coastal vegetation. The rich marine ecosystems include coral reefs,
mangrove forests, sea grass beds, wetlands, and rare marine biodiversity such as sea turtles, whales,
dugongs, and dolphins.

     Climate Change
The Pacific Islands, with large spans of untouched forests, mangroves and pristine inshore reefs,
provide great carbon sequestration values, but are also the most vulnerable to human-induced and
natural climate change and sea level rise. This is despite the region amongst emitting the least
amount of carbon into the atmosphere.
Climate change is already disproportionally affecting the islands of the Pacific. Although islanders
have done little to contribute to the cause – less than 0.03% of current global greenhouse gas
emissions – they are among the first to be affected. Most islands are experiencing climate change
impacts on communities, infrastructure, water supply, coastal and forest ecosystems, fisheries,
agriculture, and human health as well as tourism.
Agriculture, which is mostly rain-fed in the region, is susceptible to changes in rainfall distribution.
Intense and prolonged rainfall could damage seedlings, resulting in greater run-off and soil erosion
and encourage conditions that promote pests and diseases. Droughts combined with higher
temperatures would cause added thermal stress on plants. Projected increases in sea surface
temperatures combined with increased ocean acidification (from increased CO2 concentrations in

the atmosphere) are likely to put pressure on the marine food chain (particularly reef systems and
other calcifying organisms such as planktons) which in turn potentially threatens aspects of marine
food supply and associated livelihoods. The incidence of vector-borne disease such as malaria and
dengue fever, and water-borne diseases such as dysentery and diarrhea are likely to increase and
shift in distribution (malaria is likely to extend further southwards)11.
All 14 Pacific Island nations have submitted their First National Communications to the UNFCCC as
shown in Table 3, through financial support of the GEF enabling activity. Through this, countries
were also able to develop climate change policy frameworks which were used as guides for
implementation of efforts to effectively reduce carbon emissions, and implement adaptation
programs. For the least developed countries of the region, National Adaptation Programs of Action
(NAPA) have been produced using the LDC Funds, which provide additional guidance on specific
actions to address adaptation.

The first National Communications under the UNFCCC for Pacific Island countries identified the
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which as shown in Table 4, are very low in all Pacific Island
Countries (PICs). The carbon emissions per capita are also considered low. Most of the GHG
emissions in the PCIs are from the combustion of fossil fuels for power generation and in
transportation. Power generation is only from fossil fuel in most of the PICs and the transport sector
utilizes 100% fossil fuel. Petroleum accounts for an estimated 90% of commercial energy
consumption. Other lesser sources of GHG emissions for the region are forestry and land use.
The PICs are at varying stages of developing their energy sectors. The rate of electrification ranges
from 10-100% but in general about 70% of the people in the Pacific Islands still do not have access
to electricity. The share of renewable energy in the power generation mix ranges from 0% in most
PICs to more than 50% in some. 12
The impacts of climate change and sea level rise on the Pacific Island nations are real and life
threatening. For example, citizens on some of PNG’s islands have been relocated in response to
rising sea levels. Tuvalu and Kiribati have been seeking countries for its people to relocate to in the
near future as the sea level continues to rise, inundating their low-lying atoll islands. Droughts and
cyclones are threatening the national economies and livelihoods of Pacific people.

      Climate Change in Vanuatu
Vanuatu’s location in the “ring of fire” and the “cyclone belt” of the Pacific makes it extremely
vulnerable to a range of natural hazards. Vanuatu has often experienced volcanic eruptions,
cyclones, earthquakes, droughts, tsunamis, storm surges, coastal and river flooding and landslides.
In addition, it has suffered from extreme events associated with climate variability and sea level rise
such as an increased frequency of tropical cyclones.
Since 1939 Vanuatu has experienced 124 tropical cyclones, of which 45 were categorized as having
hurricane force winds. Several of these disasters have caused loss of human life, disrupted
livelihoods and resulted in millions of dollars in infrastructure damages. Cyclone Prema, which
occurred in 1993, caused some US$60 million in damages, and Dani in 1999 resulted in damage
estimated at US$8 million. The Penama earthquake and tsunami of November 1999 affected 23,000
people.13
Vanuatu is also affected by the cycles of El Niño, which comes with changes in precipitation patterns
(drought) associated with increased mean temperatures, and La Niña, which brings increased
rainfall.
The country’s vulnerability is further heightened by a number of socio-economic factors. The narrow
economic base is comprised of subsistence small-scale agriculture, which contributes 65% of the
country’s GDP, with fishing, offshore financial services and tourism making up the remainder. Some
80% of the population are rural and depend on agriculture, but productivity is low and the domestic
market for agricultural products is limited.
Vanuatu has completed both a National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) and a National Action
Plan (NAP) for Disaster Risk Reduction. Additionally, the national government’s commitment is
reflected in the merging of the former National Advisory Committee on Climate Change (NACCC)
and the National Disaster Management Committee (NDMC), and upgrading it to a National Advisory
Board for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction. The establishment of the Project
Management Unit for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction is resourced both by the Vanuatu
Government and funding from the GEF and other development partners.

   International Waters
The Pacific Ocean covers an area of nearly 40 million km2 (15.4 million square miles) or over 7.9% of
the Earth’s surface. This vast and complex marine system contains an enormous and largely
undocumented array of biodiversity. This rich biodiversity includes the most extensive and
biologically diverse reefs in the world, the deepest ocean trenches, deep-sea minerals, the world’s
largest tuna fishery, as well as an array of globally threatened species such as sea turtles, whales and
dugongs.
The many thousands of islands are, with the exception of some larger Melanesian Islands, entirely
coastal in nature, often with limited freshwater resources, and surrounded by a rich variety of
ecosystems including mangroves, seagrass beds, estuarine lagoons and coral reefs.
Within the Pacific is the Coral Triangle which is considered one of the richest marine biodiversity
areas in the world. This area stretches from Southeast Asia to encompass PNG, Solomon Islands,
Vanuatu, Fiji and Palau.
The Pacific hosts the world’s largest remaining stocks of tuna, providing approximately one-third of
the world’s catches of tuna and related species. The western and central Pacific Ocean tuna fisheries
industry have a total landed value of around US$2 billion/year and an estimated market value of
US$6–8 billion/year. About half of this annual catch is taken from the Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZs) of Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Annual licensing fees for the predominantly
foreign fishing fleets provide revenues of about US$60–70 million to the region. As a consequence,
responsible and effective stewardship is a priority, recognising the scientific advice that over-fishing
of two key species –big eye and yellow-fin tuna – now places stock levels in jeopardy.
The ocean and its resources have been the lifeline for Pacific people for millennia, but with declining
fishery resources, rising sea levels, warming ocean temperatures, ocean acidification and pollution,
the oceans are changing rapidly. These changes are degrading the livelihoods, and threatening the
very survival of Pacific Islanders.
The Pacific islands Strategic Action Plan on International Waters identified the degradation of their
quality, degradation of their associated critical habitats, unsustainable use of their living and non-
living resources as the main transboundary issues.
The root causes noted were those of the pollution of marine and freshwater (including
groundwater) from land-based activities, physical, ecological and hydrological modification of critical
habitats, and unsustainable exploitation of living and nonliving resources.
Predicated on strong national leadership and regional cooperation, the Pacific has embarked on an
ambitious program called the Pacific Oceanscape initiative. This focuses urgent and timely attention
on critical issues. The Pacific Oceanscape will expand protected areas and protected area networks
that take into consideration entire archipelagos, and will foster collective effort to minimize climate
change impacts. The Oceanscape will facilitate the sharing of information and lessons valuable to
the sustainable management of the region’s vast resources to secure Pacific Islanders’ livelihoods
and well-being for future generations. The Pacific Oceanscape initiative will entail collaboration
amongst various national governments, regional and global agencies, and non-government
organizations such as Conservation International and the International Union for Conservation of
Nature.
The Pacific Oceanscape initiative follows from several other regional initiatives by Pacific
governments to control and sustainably manage the region’s marine resources. These include the
Regional Seas Program under UNCLOS, the management of migratory fish straddling stocks,
management of marine pollution, and conservation migratory birds under the Ramsar Convention.

      Land Degradation
All 14 Pacific Island states have ratified the UNCCD which addresses land degradation. Of these, only
four have submitted to the UNCCD Secretariat their National Action Plans. The rest of the Pacific
Parties have either completed but not officially submitted their NAPs or are in the final stages of the
development. All these were made possible with enabling activity funding through the GEF.
Despite the absence of completed NAPS for most Pacific countries, information gleaned from
reports and consultations suggests that land degradation is a pivotal issue for most of the smaller
Pacific Island countries. Countries such as Nauru, which has no native forest left due to years of
mining, while Tonga (12% remaining native forest), and Kiribati (15% remaining native forest) face
problems for future land use and management. Land degradation from clearing of native forests for
logging operations, commercial plantations and farms, and the increasing urban settlements poses
additional problems such as the contamination of the underground water lens and resulting threats
to the livelihood and food security of the resident populations.

      Land Degradation in Vanuatu
The volcanic origins of the Vanuatu archipelago make most of the islands steep and mountainous.
About 36.7% of the country is forested and only about 9.8% of Vanuatu’s total land area is
considered to be arable. Approximately 60% of low-lying coastline areas is utilised for agricultural
activities and human settlement and industrial activities.
There have been numerous changes in the way land is used in Vanuatu in the last decade,
particularly in the urban areas of Vila and Louganville, and land under agricultural development or
use in rural areas. In the rural communities, land remains primarily under customary ownership and
a large proportion of it is under cultivation. The extent of land degradation in Vanuatu is largely
unknown. The impacts of land degradation on local economic and subsistence activities and national
economic and political aspirations have not been assessed.
The majority of the population that is engaged in the informal economy practices shifting
subsistence farming (called “gardening”) based on taro, yams, bananas, manioc, sweet potatoes and
coconuts. Island cabbage (Abelmoschus manihot) and fruits such as pawpaw and mango are widely
grown. Introduced vegetables such as onions, carrots, pumpkins and corn are grown to a lesser
extent. Cultivated crops are supplemented by a wide range of leafy vegetables, fruits, and nuts
harvested from nearby forests. Birds and other animals including giant fruit bats and wild pigs are
hunted for their meat. Domestic pigs and chickens are also commonly raised. The near shore reefs
are also commonly relied on for increasing household food security through reef gleaning and
fishing activities. The long-term sustainability of land resources is critical for the survival of the
people of Vanuatu.

      Persistent Organic Pollutants
All 14 Pacific Island nations have signed the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
(POPs), but are in various stages of developing and implementing their National Implementation
Plans (NIPs). Six of the countries from the region have completed and submitted their NIPs, with
FSM, PNG, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Palau awaiting submission of their reports.14 Vanuatu’s
National Implementation Plan is in its draft form.
In a regional study of hazardous waste conducted by SPREP in 13 Pacific countries except PNG, a
total 131 tons of PCBs, and 10.4 tons of DDT were recorded at over 20 sites. The chemicals were

mostly disposed by burial or sealing off from human contact.15 The results of this study were used as
the basis for the Pacific Regional POPs project under consideration for GEF5.
No POPs chemicals were recorded as commercially produced in the region, although DDT was used
in the past for the eradication of malaria. These have since been banned and are not used anymore,
but cleanup of the previous storage sites and leftover chemicals are the issues at hand.
PCB found in electrical transformers and capacitors was the only other POPs chemical found in
adequate amounts within the region. Health waste incineration is identified as the main source of
dioxin and furan release into the atmosphere. Although no accurate volumes could be estimated for
this study, programs for improving healthcare waste incineration in most Pacific Island countries will
address this concern moving into the future.
Much of the information from SPREP regional hazardous waste assessment has been used as the
baseline for the preparation of NIPs for the POPs Convention. Unfortunately, because most of the
Pacific countries still have not completed their national assessments and NIPs, a regional overview
on the global environmental benefits could not be adequately ascertained. The completion of the
NIPs at the national level will fold in well with the Regional hazardous waste.

      Persistent Organic Pollutants in Vanuatu
Vanuatu did not intentionally produce POPs nor are there any future plans to do so. There is no
legislation governing the intentional production and use of POPs in Vanuatu.
Through the preparation of the National Implementation Plan, it was confirmed that DDT was used
for the control of malaria carrying mosquitoes until it 1989, and some of the used stocks of electrical
transformers in Vanuatu contained PCBs. The report for the inventory of chemical imports has
shown that the main sources of dioxin and furan releases in Vanuatu are from the incineration of
quarantine and medical wastes and uncontrolled burning, including landfills and backyard rubbish
fires.16
Vanuatu lacks the capacity to record, control or monitor the releases of dioxins and furans. The
knowledge and application of best available techniques (BAT) and best environment practices (BEP)
for new or existing sources in Vanuatu is very limited or non-existent.

A. BACKGROUND FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK

A.1. Introduction

The environmental legal framework in the Pacific Islands consists of international and regional
agreements that countries have signed and ratified/acceded to, non-binding strategies and plans
endorsed at high-level international conferences, and national-level legislation and regulations, and
accompanying institutional arrangements for their administration. For Pacific Islands States, the
lines of demarcation between obligations and responsibilities at these different levels are often
blurred in practice, in large part because obligations for reporting, information sharing, and
implementation are often overlapping.

A.2. Regional environmental legal and policy framework

Three regional conventions set the context for the regional environmental legal and policy
framework: (i) the Apia Convention 1976, (ii) SPREP (Noumea) Convention 1986, and (iii) the
Waigani Convention 1995. The conventions deal respectively with the conservation of biodiversity,
the management of pollutants and pollution reduction, and hazardous wastes.

Table 1 summarizes the status of ratification of the regional conventions. A description of the
conventions follows the table.

A.2.1.a. Apia Convention 1976
Its objective is to take action for the conservation, utilization and development of the natural
resources of the South Pacific region through careful planning and management for the benefit of
present and future generations.
The main provisions require that Parties:
a. Create protected areas to safeguard representative samples of natural ecosystems, superlative
   scenery, striking geological formations and regions and objects of aesthetic, historic, cultural or
   scientific value (art.2);
b. Do not alter national parks so as to reduce their area except after the fullest investigation, their
   resources not to be subject to commercial exploitation, hunting and collection of species to be
   prohibited and provision to be made for visitors (art. 3);
c. Maintain lists of indigenous fauna and flora in danger of extinction and to give such species as
   complete protection as possible (art. 5);



                                                                                                       14

d. Make provisions as appropriate for customary use of areas and species in accordance with
   traditional cultural practices (art. 6).

A.2.1.b. Noumea (SPREP) Convention 198617
The objective of the Noumea Convention is to protect and manage the natural resources and
environment of the South Pacific region.

Under the Noumea Convention, the Parties agree to take all appropriate measures to
a. prevent, reduce and control pollution of the Convention area (art. 5), particularly pollution from
   vessels (art. 6), land-based sources (art. 7), exploration and exploitation of the sea bed (art. 8),
   airborne pollution (art. 9), dumping (art. 10) and the testing of nuclear devices (art. 12);
b. ensure that the implementation of the Convention does not result in an increase in pollution in
   the marine environment outside the Convention area (art. 5.2);
c. undertake to prohibit the storage of radioactive wastes in the Convention area (art. 11);
d. take all appropriate measures to protect and preserve rare ecosystems and endangered flora
   and fauna, as well as their habitat, in the Convention area (art. 14);
e. cooperate in taking all necessary measures to deal with pollution emergencies in the Convention
   area (art. 15).

A.2.1.c Waigani Convention 1995
The 1995 Waigani Convention bans the exporting of hazardous or radioactive waste to Pacific
Islands Forum countries, and prohibits Forum Island countries from importing such waste. The
convention has been ratified by Britain, France, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Ten Pacific region
countries including Cook Islands, FSM, Fiji, Kiribati, Niue, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga,
Tuvalu and Vanuatu.
The objectives of the Waigani Convention are:
e. To reduce or eliminate transboundary movements of hazardous and radioactive wastes into and
   within the Pacific Forum region;
f.   To minimize the production of hazardous and toxic wastes in the Pacific Forum region;
g. To ensure that disposal of wastes is done in an environmentally sound manner and as close to
   the source as possible; and
h. To assist Pacific Island countries that are Parties to the Convention in the environmentally sound
   management of hazardous and other wastes they generate.

A.3. International agreements

All Pacific Island states are parties to a large number of Multilateral Environmental Agreements
(MEAs), including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the United Nations Convention for Combating
Desertification (UNCCD). Their participation reflects the serious regional concern regarding their
vulnerability to transboundary impacts of environmental issues such as marine pollution, climate
change, loss of biodiversity and ozone depletion. The MEAs provide for Pacific Island States not only
access to a global stage on which to express their issues and sometimes grievances but also the

opportunity to cooperate with the international community and to access financial resources to
support the implementation of their activities.
The extent of Pacific Island States participation in MEAs is indicated in Table 2. Those of particular
relevance to GEF – i.e., CBD, UNFCCC and UNCDD – are particularly well supported.

A.4. Other regional policy and planning frameworks

Regional policies, plans and frameworks often endorsed at high-level international and regional
meetings constitute an important part of the larger framework within which SPREP and its member
countries operate. While these are not legally binding, compliance with them is important for
political and other reasons, including that of access to financial resources. Many of these directly
support international conventions and agreements. For instance, the Pacific Plan 2005’s purpose
(among others) is “… to guide the region’s efforts towards achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs)” (PIFS, 2011)18. The Action Plan for the Implementation of the Climate Change
Framework, noted the Pacific Islands Climate Change Roundtable (Madang, 2005), “… will also be
guided by decisions and activities at the level of the UNFCC and GEF ” (SPREP, 2009).19
Most regional frameworks are developed through highly inclusive and consultative regional
processes and because they are formally endorsed and adopted by high-level meetings of Pacific
leaders, they command a high degree of legitimacy and recognition both at the national level and
with development partners.
The international and regional frameworks, strategies and plans widely recognized and used are
thematically organized below:

A.5. Secretariat for the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)20

SPREP was established under the Agreement Establishing SPREP in 1993 “… to promote co-
operation, and provide assistance in order to protect the environment and to ensure the sustainable
development for present and future generations.”21 The Agreement calls on SPREP to promote co-
operation, provide assistance in order to protect the environment and to ensure the sustainable
development for present and future generations. It requires SPREP to formulate an Action Plan
setting out strategies and objectives including the following:

b. monitoring and assessing the state of the environment in the region including the impacts of
   human activities on the ecosystems of the region …,
c. promoting and developing programmes, including research programmes, to protect the
   atmosphere and terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems and species, while
   ensuring ecologically sustainable utilisation of resources;

   marine pollution;
e. strengthening national and regional capabilities and institutional arrangements;

The Secretariat is located in Samoa. It has a Director, and a complement of professional and support
staff that implement the organization’s annual work programme and respond to country-specific
requests for assistance and support. In 2011, SPREP had a total of 69 professionals and support staff
and an operating budget of US$14.3 million22.
The Secretariat reports to the annual SPREP Meeting consisting of representatives of all 25 member
states and territories. The Meeting approves the organization’s annual budget and Work
Programme. The current work programme addresses four strategic priorities: (i) climate change, (ii)
biodiversity and ecosystem management (iii) waste management and pollution control and (iv)
environmental monitoring and governance.
SPREP assists its member countries by (i) coordinating regional input and providing technical and
legal advice for instance in conventions negotiations, and COPs participation; (ii) directly
implementing regional programmes and activities in pursuit of its strategic priorities, including
donor-funded programmes and projects, and (iii) directly responding to specific country requests for
assistance.
SPREP, in collaboration with other regional and international organizations, has also been
instrumental in setting up and supporting the operation of regional coordinating mechanisms that
bring together and link a broad range of stakeholders including funders, international and regional
NGOs, academic institutions and civil society groups. These coordinating mechanisms share a
common interest, to collectively strategize and coordinate their activities, and to share information,
resources and experiences. Two highly successful networks are the Pacific Islands Roundtable for
Nature Conservation and the Pacific Islands Climate Change Roundtable.

B. THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK OF VANUATU

B.1. Political Context

The political context within which sustainable development occurs is complicated and has significant
implications for the planning and implementation of environmental management initiatives. The
following section draws heavily on findings of a recent SPREP-funded capacity assessment study
(Wickham, Kinch and Lal, 2009)23.
Vanuatu gained independence in 1980 after being governed as an Anglo-French condominium since
1906. For most of the period since independence, two political parties, one anglophone and the

other francophone, has dominated parliament. Since the 1990s, politics in Vanuatu has been
fragmented and is characterised by a high degree of instability, which has caused long periods of
policy paralysis and economic mismanagement (Schoeffel and Turner 200324; Cox et al. 2007)25. The
current political system can be viewed as impacting on sustained approach to development.
There are three levels of government in Vanuatu, the national government centred in the capital
Port Vila, the provincial government consisting of six provinces, and the Local Government Councils
(LGCs), which are highly autonomous entities operating at the local level.
The national government is organized around a series of departments which in turn fall under
several ministries that are responsible for public policy and administration. The provincial
governments’ major functions are to promote rural development and undertake land use and
physical planning, with the assistance of the centralized Department of Provincial Affairs. These
provincial governments are under-resourced and largely unable to deliver services outside the
provincial headquarters (Cox et al. 2007). The Local Government Councils were established under
the 1980 Decentralization Act. There are 63 LGC’s and most have one employee each with their
main activity being tax collection (ibid.).
Subordinate governments in Vanuatu, at both provincial and local levels, are generally poorly
resourced in both financial and human terms (Lane 2006)26.

B.2. Environmental Legal Framework

Vanuatu’s Constitution (revised 1988) holds that it is a fundamental duty of all “to protect the
Republic of Vanuatu and to safeguard the national wealth, resources and environment in the
interests of the present generation and of future generations.” To implement this constitutional
provision, the Government is empowered to enact specific laws and create institutions to protect
and manage the environment.
The principal environmental legislation is the Environmental Management and Conservation Act No.
12 of 2002. The main parts of the Act deal with (i) administration; (ii) environmental impact
assessments; (iii) biodiversity and protected areas; and (iv) offences under the Act. The Act provides
for a department to develop, implement, and coordinate the Government’s environmental policies
and programs and makes it mandatory to (i) prepare and publish a national state of environment
report at least once every ten years and (ii) maintain a publicly accessible environmental registry.
The Act provides for establishment of a biodiversity Advisory Council, and specifically covers the
issues of bio-prospecting and community conservation areas.
The Act also governs the management of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), with the Minister
empowered to regulate (amongst other things) the environmental effects associated with the
importation and transportation of hazardous substances, pests and weeds, waste management, and
air and water pollution.
The Act bestows on the Director considerable powers including the power to, directly appoint staff
from outside the Department, determine if a development application requires an EIA and the
manner in which the EIA must be compiled, and to stop any specified activity due to non-compliance
with the terms under which its EIA was approved. This discretionary authority has been a source of
some controversy.
A major gap in Vanuatu’s environmental framework is in waste management and pollution. To
address these deficiencies, the Pollution Control Bill and the Waste Management Bill were drafted

and submitted to Parliament in 201227 and are expected to be enacted before June 201328. Since
1994, the Public Health Act No. 22 of 1994 provides the basic requirements for sanitary systems for
all dwellings in rural and urban areas. A National Waste Management Strategy and Action Plan 2010-
2015 is now in place.
Additional information on the Environmental Management and Conservation Act, and the key
environment-related legislation currently in place are given in Appendix 1.

B.3. Institutional Framework

B.3.1.Department of Environment Protection and Conservation (DEPC)

Vanuatu’s environment agency, previously called the Vanuatu Environment Unit, was upgraded to
become the Department of Environment Protection and Conservation (DEPC) in 2009. It is hosted
under the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources and is responsible for the administration of the
Environmental Management and Conservation Act (EM&C) 2002. The DEPC also leads the
preparation of both the National Conservation Strategy and the National Biodiversity Strategy and
Action Plan, and is involved in the development of the National Waste Management Strategy. It is
the Operational Focal Point for international environmental conventions like the Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CI TES), among others (SPREP-IWP 2004).
DEPC’s capacity is limited. Prior to upgrading to a Department, the VEU was moved between
different ministries with only few permanent staff while most were as project officers under
projects financed through the GEF.
The institutional instability of the past and lack of capacity effectively means progress on the
implementation of legislation, and international environmental treaties obligations were very slow
to say the least. To its credit, however, notwithstanding its limited capacity, the DEPC has been
successful in other areas, notably in promoting and facilitating the establishment of Community
Conservation Areas which total registered area has increased from 194 km2 in 2005 to 16,259 km2 in
2008.
Although DEPC is not as well-resourced as it should be, the task of managing the environmental
actions has taken on a more multisectoral approach such as the climate change division housed
within the Ministry of Meteorology and Disaster Management. A number of agencies have
responsibilities that are integral to the health of coastal environments29 but the absence of policy
leadership on integrated coastal management is likely to lead to sub-optimal management. This is
important given the fact that 70 per cent of the population live on the coast.

B.3.2. Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Unit
The Vanuatu government established a multi-sectoral Climate Change advisory committee in 1990
in the lead up to the Earth Summit of 1992 Climate Change Unit to coordinate national activities on
climate change. This same committee continued until 2012 when it was changed to the National
Advisory Board on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction. With the change from an advisory

   The DEPC, for instance, is responsible for biodiversity and environmental management through the 2003 Environmental
Management and Conservation Act, and the Vanuatu Fisheries Department (VFD) has responsibility for managing the
harvesting of marine resources, the 2005 Fisheries Management Act, No.: 55, and the 2008-2013 Aquaculture
Development Plan.

  committee to a Board, the Vanuatu government put emphasis on the climate change work with the
  establishment of a centralised project management unit for climate change within the Department
  of Meteorology and Geo-Hazard. The Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Unit now has over
  20 staff dealing with international conventions and policies, adaptation, mitigation, communications
  and corporate services.
  The CCDRR Unit work is managed through the National Advisory Board made up of Permanent
  Secretary and Director level personnel from the all the relevant Government Agencies impacted by
  climate change. Despite not having climate change legislation, the PMU’s work is guided by the
  Climate Change Policy Framework.

  B.3.3 Other responsible national agencies
  Environmental management is also implemented through sector specific legislation (see Appendix
  1). In the land sector, the Land Lease Act (1983) and the Urban Land Act (1993) guide the operations
  of Vanuatu’s Land Use Planning Office. There are also many other land use policies formulated to
  ensure effective management of lands and related resources, such as the National Land Use Plan
  and Policy and the Provincial Land Use Plans and Strategies, Land Suitability Criteria, etc. Other laws
  that regulate the use of natural resources by other sectors are the: Mines and Minerals Act,
  Petroleum (Prospecting and Production) Act, Geothermal Energy Act, Forestry Act, Fisheries Act,
  Foreshore Development Act, the Pesticides Act, and others.
  The Department of Geology, Mines and Water Resources under the Ministry of Lands and Natural
  Resources administers the Geothermal Energy Act of 1987, which regulates the exploitation of
  geothermal energy, as well as the Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act of 1993 which
  regulates the searching for and producing of petroleum on land – including land beneath water, the
  seabed and the subsoil beneath the territorial seabed; and the seabed and the subsoil of the
  continental shelf or beneath the waters of the exclusive economic soil. The Ministry of Land and
  Natural Resources implements the Mines and Minerals Act (1986), which regulates the exploration
  and development of minerals and related matters through a licensing and permit system. Quarrying
  is the only current mining activity but presence of gold on Santo and Malekula has been confirmed.
  There may be reserves of petroleum, although this is not yet proven.

  B.4. National environmental policies and strategies

  Vanuatu does not have a National Sustainable Development Strategy per se. However, a National
  Priority Action Agenda (PAA) includes sustainable development of Vanuatu’s forests and marine
  resources. Vanuatu’s first national conservation strategy was prepared in 1993 (Environment Unit
  1993), with assistance from SPREP, AusAID, and IUCN. The highest priorities were identified as (i)
  improving environmental education and awareness; (ii) improving legislation and law enforcement;
  (iii) strengthening existing environment institutions; (iv) preserving natural resources and tabu
  places; and (v) using resources more efficiently.
  Some of the strategies identified in 1993 were implemented, while many others were not (ibid.).
  Other national strategies and plans have since been developed; including some that were developed
  under GEF funded enabling activities:
       -   Forest Policy (1997)
       -   NBSAP (1999);
       -   NAPA (2005);
       -   National Waste Management Strategy and Action Plan 2010 - 2015

B.6 Role of GEF-funded interventions in the development of national laws and policies

The extent to which GEF-funded interventions contributed to the development and strengthening of
the environmental legal framework in Vanuatu is partly evidenced in the explicit acknowledgement
of GEF support expressed in national planning documents and reports, where one of the outputs of
the GEF enabling activities were the production of these documents themselves. GEF influence can
also be inferred from the timeline illustrated in Appendix 1, wherein different events including the
ratification of conventions, enactment of national legislation and the adoption of national strategies
and plans, and the periods of implementation of GEF projects, are sequenced along a horizontal
time axis to illustrate their connections.
Examples of acknowledgements of GEF involvement are seen in the National Biodiversity Strategy
and Action Plan (NBSAP), National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) and the National Capacity Self
Assessment (NCSA) Report.
The Timeline (Appendix 1) is a tool for showing the sequence over time in which events took place,
to illustrate their connections. For example, the sequence of events resulting in the adoption of the
NBSAP started with the ratification by Vanuatu of the CBD, the enactment of the CBD Ratification
Act by the Vanuatu Parliament, before the start of implementation of the NBSAP Enabling Activity of
which the NBSAP was produced. The development of the NAPA followed a similar sequence. Both
sequences are illustrated below in Figures 1 and 2.

In the case of the NAPA, two regional enabling activities (GEF 336 and 850) were implemented
before the NAPA with a focus on gathering information for NAPA formulation, such as in the
compilation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) inventories, identification and assessment of various
options for climate change mitigation and adaption and the development of different scenarios of
future changes in climate and sea level.
The influence of GEF funded interventions in strengthening the framework for the management of
persistent organic pollutants took a different track relative to that taken in the development of
NBSAP and NAPA. Where in the case of the former two plans, GEF assistance followed Vanuatu’s
ratification of the CBD and UNFCCC, in the case of the Stockholm Convention, GEF intervened to
prepare the groundwork for ratification and initial reporting requirements. Vanuatu’s subsequent
ratification of the Convention paved the way for its participation in the GEF funded regional POPs
project (GEF ID 4066)31, which is currently being implemented. The Pollutions Bill and a Waste
Management Bill – both dealing with aspects of hazardous waste management and presently before
Parliament for enactment - is not an intended output of the GEF project. However, its formulation
and presentation before Parliament occurs at the time when the issue of hazardous waste
management is topical and current, as a result of the GEF funded project, and possibly similar
activities of other stakeholders. The two legislations will also address some of Vanuatu’s obligations
under the Stockholm Convention including obligations for appropriate legal and administrative
measures under Article 3.

GEF’s influence in the development of environmental legislation in Vanuatu may also be seen not
only in the way the NBSAP called for and supported the development of the Environmental
Management and Conservation legislation, but also in setting in motion a process of stakeholder
consultation that generated discussion and reached consensus on specific actions and provisions to
be considered in the drafting of the legislation. The NBSAP made nine (9) specific recommendations
of issues for inclusion in the Environmental Management and Conservation Act, and one proposed
amendment for the Fisheries Act 1982. Those for the Environmental Conservation and Management
legislation, were the following:
    -   Controls on the introduction of living materials;
    -   Management regulations for designated terrestrial species including measures for size
        limits, closed seasons for birds, flying foxes, crabs and freshwater prawns;
    -   Establishment of an EIA process
    -   Establishment of an Environment Trust Fund to fund biodiversity research and conservation
        work;
    -   Establishment of a legal mechanism to protect intellectual property rights of ni-Vanuatu
        with respect their knowledge and use of biodiversity;
    -   Appropriate controls for the import and export of rare species
    -   Appropriate controls for the importation and safe handling of living modified organisms;
    -   Establishment of a Scientific Research Council with responsibility to issue permits for
        environment and natural resource focused research within Vanuatu;
    -   Setting up a high level Environment Coordinating Committee with responsibility for the use
        and management of biological resources.
The enacted legislation (Environmental Management and Conservation Act 2002) contained
provisions for four of the nine areas proposed for consideration. These are the (i) EIA (Part 3
sections 11 – 28); (ii) Bio-prospecting (Part 4; sections 29 – 34); (iii) LMOs (Part 6, Section 45(2)(a)(ii);
and (iv) Regulating the harvesting of marine organisms (Part 6, Section 45(2)(b).

Appendix 1: National Environmental Legislation of Vanuatu

1.     Natural Resources Laws & Policies (Terrestrial)
1.1    Constitution of the Republic of Vanuatu
The 1980 Constitution touches on natural resources or the environment in two places. Firstly, it
imposes for every Ni-Vanuatu a fundamental duty to himself and his descendants and to others
“to protect the Republic of Vanuatu and to safeguard the national wealth, resources and
environment in the interests of the present generation and future generations”32 (emphasis
added). Although the fundamental duties in the Constitution are non-justifiable, they are still
important in shaping laws and policies.

1.1.1 Land tenure provisions under the Constitution
The other place where the Constitution provides for natural resources is chapter 12 (articles 73-
81), which sets out broad outlines of the land tenure system of the country. It begins by stating
that Ni-Vanuatu indigenous custom owners collectively own all land in the country in
perpetuity.33 It provides for the alienation of customary land through a system of national land
laws. All land transactions between indigenous citizens and either a non-indigenous or a non-
citizen is permissible only after consent of the Government is obtained34. The Constitution sets
out the conditions of government consent, which is mandatory in all land transactions35.

1.2.    National Land Laws
The seven laws listed below set out the national land law as envisaged under articles 73, 74 and
75 of the Constitution. However, they have little to do with the protection, management and
conservation of the environment.

1.2.1 Land Leases Act (CAP.163)
This Act provides for the creation and disposition of leases on land, their registration and all
dealings connected with leases. Standard agricultural, residential and commercial lease
agreements have an indirect, albeit significant, part in environmental protection because they
can impose conditions to preserve water resources or prevent soil erosion.

1.2.2 Land Reform Act (CAP.123)
The stated purpose of this Act is to make interim provision for the implementation of chapter 12
of the Constitution. In particular, it protects the land interests of non-indigenous landowners
(called “alienators”) by allowing them to remain on land they occupied on Independence Day
until they entered into lease arrangements with or received compensation for improvements
from customary land owners.

1.2.3 Alienated Lands Act (CAP.143)
This Act prescribed the system for registration and dealing with the claims of alienators as
recognized under the above Act.

1.2.4 Land Acquisitions Act No. 5 of 1992
This Act sets out the process for the state to acquire land and easements in the public interest.
Presently, there have been no state acquisitions of land for the purpose of conservation and
environmental protection. Acquisitions have been limited to urban, commercial and
government administration purposes.

1.2.5 Valuation of Land Act No. 22 of 2002
This establishes the office of Valuer-General and makes provisions for valuation of land in order
to improve the system of land tenure in the country. This Act is yet to be implemented and a
Valuer-General appointed.

1.2.6 Land Valuers Registration Act No. 23 of 2002
This provides for registration of valuers in order to ensure professionalism amongst their rank.

1.2.7 Strata Titles Act No. 29 of 2000
This provides for establishment of strata titles to land. Although this Act is gazetted and is
entered into force, other legal and administrative steps are required to enable the lawful
registration of strata titles in the Land Records Office.

1.2.8 Customary Land tribunal (CLT) Act No. 7 of 2001
Parliament enacted this Act to provide for a system based on custom to resolve disputes about
customary land. This was done mainly in response to the inability of the earlier established
courts to deal expeditiously with disputes concerning customary land. The CLT is currently
undergoing review to identify further areas of development.36

2.      Conservation of mineral resources and environmental regulations regarding mining
        and related activities
2.1. Mines and Minerals Act 1986
This Act was enacted to regulate exploration and development of minerals and related matters.
For purposes of this Act, a mineral is “…….any substance, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous form
occurring naturally in land, formed by or subject to a geological process, but does not include (a)
water or (b) petroleum”37.

2.2    Regulation of Geothermal Resources
2.2.1 Geothermal Energy Act 1987
The Geothermal Act No. 6 of 1987 (CAP.197) regulates the exploitation of geothermal energy.
The property in and control over all natural reserves of geothermal energy in land vested in the
Republic of Vanuatu38. Geothermal energy is defined as:
       “……energy derived or derivable from within the ground or there under by natural heat,
       and includes all steam, water or other fluid and any mixture of all or any of them that
       has been heated by such energy, and every kind of matter, fluid or mixture, but does not
       include water that has been heated by such energy to a temperature not exceeding 70
       degrees Celcius”39

2.2.2 The Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act No. 13 of 1996
This Act makes provisions with respect to searching for and producing petroleum on land –
including land beneath water, the seabed and the subsoil beneath the territorial seabed; and
the seabed and the subsoil of the continental shelf or beneath the waters of the exclusive
economic soil.40

2.2.3 Foreshore Development Act of 1975
This Act regulates all works carried out on the foreshore. Any developments on the foreshore of
the coasts of any island in Vanuatu must first obtain consent from the Minister of Internal
Affairs.

2.4     Control of Introduced Animal Species
The Animal Importation and Quarantine Act No. 7 of 1988 (CAP. 201) regulates the control of
animal importation including the importation of animal products and biological products into
Vanuatu and related matters. It repeals sections of the Animal Imports (CAP.98) which are
inconsistent with its provisions. The primary intention of this Act is to prevent diagnosed and
suspected animal diseases from entering Vanuatu ports of entries.41

The definition of “animal” is taken to be “any living stage of any member of the animal kingdom
except human beings and includes arachnids, birds, crustaceans, fish, insects and reptiles and
also fertilized egg or ovum”42 The importation of fish and fish products with the exemption of
live fish is exempt from import permits.

2.8     National Parks and Nature Reserve
2.8.1 The National Parks Act No. 07 of 1993
This Act provides for the declaration of national parks and nature reserve; for the protection and
preservation of such areas and all related matters.

2.9      Convention on Biological Diversity (Ratification) Act No. 23 of 1992
This is the instrument of ratification of the Vanuatu Government to the United Nations
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) signed on the 5th day of June, 1992. By virtue of this
law, the CBD became part of the domestic legislation of Vanuatu on 1st March 1993.

3.0     Environmental Management and Conservation Act 2002
The stated objective of this Act is “to provide for the conservation, sustainable development and
management of the environment of Vanuatu and the regulation of related activities.” In short, it
builds on existing laws and is regarded as the main legislation that will foster sustainable use of
resources and due protection of the environment of Vanuatu, “including its lands, air and
waters”43

The Act introduces four main categories of regulatory provisions: (i) production and keeping of
instruments (documents), (ii) Environment Impact Assessments (EIA), (iii) bio-prospecting and
(iv) community conservation areas.

a.    Production and keeping of documents
Establishes an Environmental Registry on which information about prescribed documents,
applications, permits, approvals, regulations, standards, guidelines, codes, reports and plans
have to be registered. The objective is to promote transparency.

b. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)
Part 3 of the Act (sections 11 – 28) provides statutory linkages and inter-Government agency
coordination for implementing EIAs. Subject to a few exceptions, this law states that EIAs are
mandatory for all development activities, projects and proposals that cause or are likely to cause
significant environmental, social and or customs impact.

It also empowers the Director to intervene on his or her own initiative and request an EIA for
any proposed development if he/she sees fit.

c. Bio-prospecting
The Act establishes a Biodiversity Advisory Council (BAC) that is responsible for vetting all
bioprospecting applications.

d. Community Conservation Areas
The Act empowers the Director of Environment to register a Community Conservation Area in
the Environment Register where custom landowners agree to the formal protection of areas of
biodiversity significance within their customary land. Upon registration, landowners will be
obliged to manage the area for conservation purposes, and the Director will by the same
legislation be required to assist technically and/or financially to support conservation area
management.

4.      Preservation of Sites and Artefacts [Cap.39] (JR 11 of 1965)
The Act provides for the preservation of sites and objects of historical, ethnological or artistic
interest.

4.1     Preservation of Sites and Artefacts JR11 of 1965, Order No. 12 of 1993
     th
On 13 April 1993, this subsidiary legislation provided for the classification of the Yasur Volcano
on Tanna as a preserved site44.

5.       Plant Protection Act (No. 14 of 1997)
The objective of this Act is “To provide for the exclusion and effective management of plant
pests; and to facilitate exports of plant produce.” The Act defines plant material as “any goods
that are wholly or partly derived from a member of the plant kingdom or its excretions or
secretions.”45 A plant pest is “any organism, including pathogen, which is known, suspected, or
liable to be directly or indirectly harmful to plants or beneficial organisms and includes any
noxious plant or weed and any product of any pest.”46 This wide definition extends to aquatic
plants.

6.      Conservation of Forests
The Forestry Act No.26 of 2001 commenced on 03 March 2003. It provides for the protection,
development and sustainable management of forests and the forest industry. It repeals the
Forestry Act [CAP147].

7.      Forestry Rights Registration and Timber Harvest Guarantee Act 200047
The objective of this Act is to provide for the registration of certain forestry rights granted in
respect of land and to the harvesting and accreditation of timber plantations.

8.      Control of Pesticides
The Pesticides Control Act No.11 of 1993 commenced in March 1998. The objectives of this Act
are to make provision for the regulation and control of the importation, manufacture, sale,
distribution and use of pesticides.

1.      Introduction
This review is conducted as part of the Global Environment Facility Evaluation Office’s Vanuatu and
SPREP Portfolio Evaluation. The review aims at assessing concrete, measurable and verifiable results
(outcomes and impacts) of the GEF in the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) using an impact evaluation
methodology developed by the GEF Evaluation Office called the Review of Outcomes to Impacts
(ROtI). The ROtI methodology assesses progress from project outcomes to impact-level results.

The focus of this ROtI analysis is the Medium-sized Project (MSP) Pacific Islands Renewable Energy
Program (PIREP) (GEF ID 1058). The Secretariat for the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme
(SPREP) was the executing agency with UNDP the GEF Implementing Agency for the project. Details
are presented in Section 2 below.

There are several issues and challenges faced with the application of the ROtI methodology to the
PIREP. Firstly, PIREP is not a typical MSP. It is an output-based, project preparatory exercise with no
higher order outcomes (i.e. global environmental benefits) other than the gathering of information,
the production of a series of national and regional assessment reports and the design of a regional
program on renewable energy. In this case, the intended final end result or intended ‘impact’ is the
PIGGAREP, another GEF-funded project that builds on PIREP and is presently in the final year of
implementation.

The ROtI analysis also had to sieve through the changing objectives and outcomes of the Project,
between the Project Document, to the Annual Progress Reports to the Final Terminal Evaluation (TE)
report. Twenty-seven (27) outcomes were defined in the Project Document but only 13 were
monitored and reported on by UNDP’s APR and Quarterly Reports. The Terminal Evaluation further
reduced these to only four (4), which it said “… more realistically describe PIREP.” For the ROtI
methodology, the TE is the starting point; therefore, the four outcomes of the TE are examined and
analysed based on the theory of change for Outcomes-Impacts Pathways. The change in outcomes
rendered the ProDoc’s logical framework largely irrelevant for this exercise, as a guide to the
underpinning thinking and assumptions that framed the project design.

The third issue is that the PIREP was completed in 2006 and many PIC officials with involvement in
the PIREP have either moved on or were uninterested in responding to email requests. A limited
amount of consultation was possible, but many reported activities and outputs produced for
different countries were confirmed using sources within SPREP, individuals in Vanuatu and Samoa,
and information available from the TE and monitoring reports of the Implementing Agency (UNDP).

2.      Project Background Information and Description
The PIREP’s effectiveness date (i.e. the project implementation start date in GEF terminology) was
March 2003, and the actual closing date was 21 August 2006. Table 1 below presents the project
milestones based on APR and TE reports.

The project justification is built largely on the PICs’ heavy dependence on fossil fuels, the resulting
high level of greenhouse gas emissions, and the extreme economic vulnerability of PICs to
fluctuating and rising world prices that typifies its importation and use. The option of renewable
energy (RE), mostly hydro, although potentially significant, was estimated to contribute less than
10% of each PIC’s commercial energy use. The region is also characterized by scattered and
fragmented efforts to promote RE technologies that are based on unreliable and unsubstantiated
data on RE resource potential.

The Pacific Islands Renewable Energy Project (PIREP) proposed to facilitate the widespread
implementation and ultimately, commercialization of appropriate RE technologies (RETs) within PICs
through the establishment of a suitable enabling environment. The establishment of such an
environment conducive to the region-wide adoption and commercialization of RETs would involve,
as a first step, the identification and verification of a wide range of institutional barriers that should
be dismantled, and capacity needs that should be built or strengthened, to accomplish this end. The
barriers and needs are wide-ranging and diverse, involving legal, fiscal, financial, regulatory, market,
technical, technological and information issues. The project would also involve the development of
interventions for strengthening the relevant institutional structures and national capacity for the
coordination and the sustainable management (design, implementation, monitoring, maintenance,
evaluation and the marketing) of RE initiatives in each PIC.

The PIREP was implemented in 14 Pacific Island Countries with SPREP serving as the regional
executing agency. The final project budget was US$811,000 of which US$700,000 was GEF’s
contribution and $111,000 co-financing.

The Project’s Global Environmental Objective:
        The goal of the project was preparation of a regional approach to removing barriers to the
        development and commercialization of renewable energy (RE) systems in the Pacific Island
        Countries (PICs) that influences country efforts to reduce the long-term growth of
        greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuel uses. (Project Appraisal Document)

Project Development Objective:
        The project development objective was to facilitate adoption and commercialization of
        feasible and applicable renewable energy technologies, as part of the efforts to support
        sustainable development of the Pacific Island Countries through the removal of barriers to
        the widespread application of renewable energy technologies and the accelerated reduction
        of their implementation costs.(Project Appraisal Document)

3. PIREP’s Global Environmental Benefits
PIREP made no direct contribution to global environmental benefits, which in this case, is the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It was a project preparatory exercise aimed at preparing a
follow-up regional project, i.e. PIGGAREP, that would contribute to the reduction of greenhouse
gases by reducing dependence on fossil fuels through the greater use in PICs of renewable energy
technologies.

The proposal for a GEF funded project preparatory grant52 to develop a full sized regional initiative to
promote and facilitate the removal of RE barriers and encourage the use of renewable energy
technologies (RET) was formally endorsed by the 2000 SPREP Meeting in Guam53.


4. The PIREP Outcome-Impact Theory of Change
4.1. The ROtI: A theory-based approach to understanding impact
The project’s logical intervention approach or theory of change is the expression of the strategy
chosen to achieve the objective(s). Based on the strategy, the outputs and activities are designed to
drive the expected intervention approach. Inputs and activities produce outputs, leading to
outcomes and eventually impacts. As a whole these steps together define the outcome impact
pathways.

The generic project results chain that underlies the theory of change approach is illustrated in Figure
1 below. On the left of the diagram is the project strategy, which encompasses the entire results
chain and comprises a set of activities that are designed to deliver certain defined outputs, which in
turn aim to make a significant contribution to the achievement of a set of outcomes. Ultimately, the
outcomes are in turn expected to result in a set of long-term project impacts, the ultimate goal of
the project concerned. All levels of the results chain are connected through a series of logical means-
end pathways (signified by the arrows connecting the boxes).

The diagram in Figure 1 shows a single results chain; however, in practice a project often involves
several strategies, each having its own particular results chain, and which all together make up the
project’s theory of change, which is summarised in the project’s logical framework.

The key elements for the ROTI analysis are the assumptions, impact drivers, and intermediate states,
which are described in Table 2. Sustained changes in environmental resources require significant
time because changes in the natural world occur slowly. The ROtI methodology acknowledges and
recognizes that in most interventions targeted at improving environmental status (impact-level
results), time is required following the end of the project for processes to occur, eventually leading
from project outcomes to environmental impacts. The GEF EO’s Review of Outcomes to Impact
(ROtI) Practitionres Handbook provides further details about the ROtI methodology.54

4.2. PIREP Outcomes-Impacts Theory of Change
The output-based nature of PIREP has been discussed in the previous section. It means that the
impact sought from the logical progression of change from the production of outputs-to-outcomes-
to-impacts is not a higher order change, i.e. global environmental benefit, but a more immediate and
measurable change. In PIREP, this impact is a regional approach to removing barriers to the
development and commercialization of RE systems in the PICs influences country efforts to reduce the
long-term growth of GHG emissions from fossil fuel uses.

Consequently the means of verification are discrete and tangible outputs consisting of reports
produced, workshops conducted, databases, websites, consultative activities completed and so on.
The sources of information for verifying their completion are also therefore relatively reliable, i.e.
GEF progress reports and Terminal Evaluation studies, with little need for qualitative and anecdotal
evidence from interviews with project personnel and stakeholders to confirm and verify changes
that may have taken place.

Having said this, the opportunity to discuss PIREP with regional SPREP staff and national
representatives in Vanuatu was utilized. This was mainly for purposes of validation and to obtain a
feeling of the kinds of stakeholder engagement that took place. As to be expected, with PIREP having

been completed in 2006, some key people that would have shed light on project issues have moved
on and therefore could not be consulted.

The project’s logical framework was prepared with and appended to the Project Document. It shows
the flow of logic from objectives, to outputs to outcomes. Importantly, assumptions made by the
designers and underpinning these relationships were clearly stated.

The ROtI analysis reviewed these assumptions. Using the four TE outcomes, it also constructed an
outcome-impact logframe to better clarify the relevant assumptions (A), key impact drivers (ID) and
intermediate states (IS) that were at work in achieving the goal of a regional RET program that is
acceptable to GEF and other funding partners.

The revised TE outcomes for the Project is the result of the TE Consultant’s attempt to define “… a
clearer set of objectives, outcomes and activities that more realistically describe PIREP.”55 The lack
of clarity is acknowledged by UNDP as resulting from the formats used by UNDP and GEF for project
formulation (project briefs, executive summary and project document) and progress monitoring
(APR, PIR and quarterly reports) which “seem to change every 2 or 3 years”56 and attempts to design
PIREP as a typical MSP rather than the expanded PDF exercise that it was.

4.3. Assessment of Achievements of the Outcomes-Impacts Pathways
The analysis of the outputs-outcomes-impacts pathways was conducted based on a review of the
project documentation, and information received via consultations with individuals that were in
UNDP and SPREP during project implementation, and others who are current or ex staff of the
SPREP, Department of Environment in Vanuatu and the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment in Samoa. A list of those consulted is appended.

The assessment is broken down by individual strategies for the key outcomes. The following rating
system for the field ROtI methodology is given in Table 4 below.

4.3.1 Overall Assumptions Necessary for the Achievement of Outcomes
There were two critically important assumptions that needed to hold true in order for PIREP to
achieve its intended outcomes. The first critical assumption is that participating PICs are fully
committed to supporting PIREP at the national level and to providing co-financing.

The second critical assumption is that stakeholder consultations are inclusive and effective.
Effectiveness means the project’s consultation process is successful in meaningfully engaging all key
stakeholders despite the potential negative impacts of the proposed project on their own interests.
To elaborate, some of institutional barriers are outdated legislation and political arrangements
supporting and perpetuating monopolistic arrangements and unfair business practises in energy
production and distribution. Private sector operators as suppliers of RET have self-serving
objectives. In other words, some stakeholders are benefitting from the status quo and would lose
profit margins by the removal of barriers and the introduction of other regulatory mechanisms as
envisaged in PIGGAREP. There are also sensitive issues of poor coordination between government
agencies, and overlapping jurisdictions and mandates between regional organizations (in particular
SPREP and SOPAC) over renewable energy and climate change that could conceivably influence their
willingness to provide information. In this broad context, it is critically important that the process of
consultation not only brings together all relevant stakeholders including existing monopolies but
that there is a genuine acceptance and commitment to serving the larger good as opposed to their
respective vested interests.

4.3.2. Strategy 1: Capacity Building on RE Policy Formulation
The stock taking exercise at the national level depended on the effectiveness of local and
international consultants and the support of country teams provided by participating countries.
Some delays in the putting together of country teams were reported, due to lack of staff within
relevant agencies, delays in the recruitment of national coordinators and local consultants, and
ineffective collaboration between international consultants and their local counterparts. The
support of organizations and individuals in possession of relevant information was critical. Such
includes the experience of private sector operators in the use of solar power in remote islands in
some countries and the willingness of state monopolies such as the Electric Power Corporation (EPC)
in Samoa to discuss issues and options that deviate from the status quo that is beneficial to them.

The Terminal Evaluation report noted that while national assessment reports vary in quality, all were
delivered in time to contribute to the regional synthesis workshops and report compilation.
Similarly, three special topics reports were prepared and delivered on time. It is important to
recognize the useful role of governments in providing the logistical support and local staff that
greatly facilitated the delivery of national-level outputs.

The main potential threat to the achievement of the desired impact within this pathway was with
the quality of the national and regional assessment reports, and whether they provide compelling
evidence of significant potential global benefits to justify a GEF-funded intervention. The fact that
PIGGAREP is approved and under implementation answers this question unambiguously and reflects
positively on the quality of the information gathered from these assessments.

    4.3.3. Strategy 2: Project Framework Design
    The effectiveness of change from the outcome to the desired impact through this pathway rests on
    two main factors: (i) the quality of the process that was used, and (ii) the quality and
    appropriateness of the design itself that resulted. Part of the discussion of process involves the issue
    of consultations and engagement of relevant stakeholders. This is discussed in Strategy 3.

    The quality of the program design is satisfactory as it is now accepted by GEF. But there were initial
    issues that had to be addressed. The TE hinted at deficiencies in the proposed PIGGAREP design
    when it observed that there should have been more focus on PIGGAREP conceptualization, as
    opposed to the emphasis given to the formulation of assessment reports. According to the TE, PIREP
    had the resources and the time to do some of the activities that have been included in PIGGAREP.
    The original output from the MSP Regional Project design workshop had inadequate co-financing
    and the CTA did well to deal with this effectively with further visits to countries. There were also
    some concerns from people interviewed about balance, and the importance of striving for balance
    between country-specific activities and regional activities. This is important given the highly
    diversified needs and circumstances of the 11 participating PICs. Conversely, there are common
    activities wherein the regional approach was more cost-effective.

    The importance of co-financing as an impact driver is its role in making PIGGAREP bankable with
    GEF. It is also a clear indicator of PICs’ commitment and of other multilateral co -funders (in this
    case, US$1.0m from UNDP and others), which provided leverage for other donors including GEF. The
    level of co-financing secured in the end (US$27,983,000) showed that this problem was effectively
    addressed.

    The Intermediate State in this pathway is identified as the PIGGAREP framework design that is
    endorsed by PICs and satisfies GEF design requirements. The emphasis on PICs endorsement is
    important in pushing this forward in the best possible light for GEF consideration. In this sense, the
    proposed IS is also an impact driver. The quantification of global benefits in terms of potential CO2
    emission reductions (which was estimated to average 1.3% of annual growth in CO2 emission in the
    first 15 years) is essential information for the GEF.

4.3.4. Strategy 3: Stakeholder consultations and engagement
The critical requirement for Strategy 3 is the quality of stakeholder participation and engagement in
the design process. Reports from the TE and from those interviewed suggested that consultations at
the national level were well attended by representatives from all key stakeholder groups including
government agencies, NGOs, and the private sector. The general impression gained from interviews
conducted and project reports of the quality of the consultation process is also positive, in part due
to the effective use of the SWOT tool in facilitated group exercises.

Stakeholder participation and engagement at the regional level, for PICs, were largely limited to
national coordinators and government officials from energy agencies, representatives of regional
organizations mainly of the CROP Energy Working Group, and bilateral and multilateral donor
representatives. There were reportedly no private sector representatives, nor were there any
attempts on the part of the project to encourage and support their participation at this level. On the
other hand, those who attended for countries were well versed with the goals and objectives and
national priorities.

The TE observed that more consultations could have been possible given the amount of funds
available to engage more non-governmental stakeholders (utilities, renewable energy technology
suppliers, NGOs, and financial intermediaries) in the design of the PIGGAREP concept as well as for
having a more detailed planning and prioritization of project activities. Thus the Impact Driver
identified in this pathway is valid even though this opportunity was not fully utilized by extending
this assistance to non-governmental and private sector representatives.

4.3.5. Strategy 4: Effective coordination of project implementation
This pathway recognizes that PIREP has a wide range of outputs which all contributed to and
ensured that the PIGGAREP proposal was not merely produced, but to a quality that GEF would
accept. Project progress reports revealed continuing efforts on the part of the CTA and SPREP to
find innovative ways to deal with a range of stumbling blocks that impeded progress, including slow
recruitment of national coordinators, delayed start-up for some national level assessments,
difficulties of finding competent local consultants in some PICs, issues of effective collaboration
between international consultants and local counterparts, initially insufficient co-financing, etc.

4.4 Overall PIREP ROtI Conclusions
The PIREP produced all its intended outcomes, to a large extent, satisfactorily. The PIREP was
basically a project development exercise and, despite being a MSP, was not expected to generate
global environmental benefits such as a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions or removal of
barriers to renewable energy development. It only involved studies of barriers, capacity
development needs and strategies, consultation meetings with stakeholders and project document
formulation.

Notwithstanding, this ROtI analysis followed the pathways from the four outcomes defined in the
Terminal Evaluation report to the intended ‘impact’ of the PIGARREP proposal’s development and its
ultimate approval for funding by GEF. It identified and discussed impact drivers and assumptions
that underpin this progression, and the critical intermediate states (IS) that were attained at the
penultimate stage of each of the four pathways that, when combined, produced the desired impact.
It found that while the final impact (PIGGAREP produced and accepted by GEF) was achieved from
the outcomes generated during project implementation, there were issues with the program design
and the process that affected implementation effectiveness and the quality of the PIGGAREP
proposal. For some of these issues, effective adaptive measures were taken by the CTA before the
end of the project to address them effectively. But the opportunity to engage more inclusively with
key non-governmental and private sector stakeholders in consultations at the regional level was not

used and is a weakness in the proposal. It is also an important lesson for the future. The opportunity
to extend the scope of the PIREP further into detailed planning of some national level activities was
not taken, despite the availability of funds and time. These were highlighted in the Terminal
Evaluation report.

On the other hand, PIREP achieved more than was intended with some unanticipated but positive
impacts. It raised awareness in PICs of the benefits of RET, as well as galvanized and generate
interest in both government and private sectors in support of the wider use and commercialization
of RET.

PIREP also strengthened the capacity of 15 participating PICs by producing baseline studies that have
since been widely used for other planning purposes, such as in the development of national energy
policies (as in the case of Samoa), the new WB/GEF-supported Sustainable Energy Financing Program
(SEFP), which would be implemented in five PICs (i.e. Fiji, PNG, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands and
Vanuatu), as well as the UNDP/GEF MSP proposals ADMIRE (Marshall Islands) and SEDREA (Palau).
According to the individuals consulted, the awareness in and knowledge of renewable energy
technologies, barriers and capacity needs generated by PIREP have been the catalyst and the major
source of information for the development of sector policies that have since taken place in many
PICs, which have also been progressed further and supported by PIGGAREP.
The final milestone in the progression from PIREP outcomes to GEF approval of PIGGAREP is the
formal endorsement of PIGGAREP during the 16th SPREP Meeting, and letters of endorsement from
11 PICs and the significant co-financing commitment that were essential parts of the PIGGAREP
proposal. In this analysis, they were important elements in making the PIGGAREP proposal ‘GEF-
able’.

All things considered, the ROtI’s overall assessment is therefore satisfactory. In the context of a
regional exercise involving 15 Pacific Island Countries of diverse capacities and economic conditions,
it is a commendable achievement. GEF approval for PIGGAREP is the ultimate measure of success
and this has been achieved.

PIREP can also claim some credit for the global environmental benefits expected from the successful
implementation of PIGGAREP. These include, but are not limited to the following:
- Installation and operation of renewable energy systems, such as solar PV systems, solar
- water heaters, biofuels and micro hydro;
- Impacts on end users and degree of socio-economic development;
- Development of policies, legislation and regulations that support RE development and
    utilization;
- Expansion of business and supporting services for RE technologies;
- Increase of financing availability and financing mechanisms;
- Improvement of awareness and understanding of technologies among producers, users
- and intermediary organizations;
- Change in energy consumption and fuel use patterns and resulting greenhouse gas
- reductions and other environmental impacts.

Strategy 4: Effective coordination of project implementation                           3
Overall Rating Summary:

Strategy 1: Capacity building for RE policy formulation. PIREP ‘s outputs of reports on national barriers,
capacity needs, the regional synthesis report and three special topic reports (financial mechanisms,
technology support system and demonstration projects to showcase energy service delivery) provided
for countries and the project team (CTA and consultants) the baseline information from which to build
the PIGGAREP proposal. This is indispensable to the achievement of the intended impact. The various
other uses of this information by countries for their national planning purposes may have been
unintended, but highly significant. These include policy making in the energy sector and several
national and sub-regional funding proposals from some PICs who opted out of the PIGGAREP initiative.
The rating of 3 reflects the direct contribution of this strategy to both the intended impact of PIREP and
the other unintended benefits that participating PICs have since gained.

Strategy 2: Project framework design. The PIGGAREP proposal was endorsed by PICs, approved by GEF
and now in the final stages of implementation. This is the ultimate evidence that the design was sound.

Strategy 3: Stakeholder consultations and engagement. PIREP conducted consultations at the national
and regional level. For all PICs, there have not been any expressed concerns about their inclusiveness in
project reports, except a missed opportunity to engage more at the regional level from the non-
governmental sectors, as noted in the TE. In light of the fact that there were adequate project funds to
allow this, it is a valid observation. But overall the level of stakeholder consultations is assessed as
adequate.

Strategy 4: Effective coordination of project implementation. Overall, all four main outcomes were
satisfactorily delivered, and this is evidenced in the production of all outputs and the final PIGGAREP
proposal. Some delays were reported in some national-level outputs and one can expect quality to vary
as well. But those less visible elements of the project that contribute to its success – i.e. winning the
endorsement of PICs, securing a high level of national and external donor co-financing, engaging the
assistance of the Energy Working Group of CROP successfully, navigating successfully through sensitive
CROP agencies politics to obtain agreement on SPREP to be the executing agency of PIGGAREP, and
others - are important results that reflect effective coordination and good project management.

1.      Introduction
This review was conducted as part of the Global Environment Facility Evaluation Office’s (GEF EO)
Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation. This review aims to assess concrete, measurable and
verifiable results (outcomes and impacts) of the GEF support in Vanuatu using an impact evaluation
methodology developed by the GEF EO, called the Review of Outcomes to Impacts (ROtI). The ROtI
methodology assesses progress from project outcomes to impact-level results.

The focus of this ROtI analysis is the Medium Size Project (MSP), Vanuatu: Facilitating and
Strengthening the Conservation Initiatives of Traditional Landholders and their Communities to
Achieve Biodiversity Conservation Objectives (GEF ID 1682), also known as the Local Conservation
Initiatives (LCI) project. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was the GEF
Implementing Agency for the project. Project details are presented in Section 2.

There were several challenges in applying the ROtI methodology to the LCI. First, several project staff
have transitioned to other employment and the organization has not retained institutional
knowledge about the project. Second, the filing system with the Department of Environment
Protection and Conservation (DEPC) contained limited information; therefore, obtaining information
about the project depended heavily on interviews and focus groups. The evaluators were not able to
travel to some of the islands where the project was implemented due to transportation
infrastructure issues (flight logistics and roads).

Despite these challenges, the evaluation team conducted focus group discussions with several
former project staff and others with connections to the project. All available documentation, which
was from the GEF EO database, was used to supplement the input from the consultations.

2.      Project Background Information and Description
Project implementation officially started in February 2005 after three years of preparation, which
included the project concept, country endorsement, project proposal, and approval by the GEF and
the GEF Implementing Agency (UNDP). However, actual implementation activities only started in
early August 2005 following the recruitment of the project coordinator and the administrative
assistant. The delay between submission of the project proposal and initial disbursement of funds
created uncertainty about hiring project staff and procuring necessary equipment.

The project lasted 59 months, and extended 10 months beyond the initial proposed closing date.
This was due to the initial delays in setting up the project, as well as staff transitions throughout the
project including the LCI project team and the UNDP staff responsible for the project. The project
milestones are presented in Table 1 below. The project was executed by the Vanuatu Environment
Unit (VEU), which is now the DEPC.

The MSP was initially designed by the VEU to continue the work initiated under the GEF-funded
National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) and the South Pacific Biodiversity
Conservation Program, which emphasized the community-based conservation approach as most
land in Vanuatu is under customary land ownership.

The LCI project also supplemented ongoing programs in Vanuatu by several organizations such as
the Vanuatu Culture Centre on documenting and protecting traditional knowledge, the Wan Small
Bag’s environmental awareness programs, the Forestry and Fisheries Departments’ work on
conservation and sustainable harvesting of biodiversity resources, and the Foundation of the
Peoples of the South Pacific (FSPI) project on community governance for sustainable forestry
management and gardening.

The total project budget was USD$1,455,843, with USD$745,910 provided by the GEF grant and
USD$709,933 co-financing committed by the Government of Vanuatu and its NGO project partners.

The overarching goal of the project was: “The greater and more effective application of locally and
culturally appropriate mechanisms to conserve Vanuatu’s internationally significant biodiversity.”
The project defined three outcomes intended to support this goal:57

       1. Outcome 1: Facilitate, adapt and strengthen traditional mechanisms to conserve biodiversity
          on Gaua, Tanna, and Santo Islands.

       2. Outcome 2: Provide an enabling environment and strengthen government and non-
          government capacity to support community-based conservation initiatives and replicate
          successes in other areas of Vanuatu.

       3. Outcome 3. Monitor the impact and effectiveness of landholder-based conservation areas to
          inform and direct work to adapt and strengthen traditional conservation approaches.

Project activities included the following:58

          Document local knowledge of internationally significant species, including their local use and
           management.
          Provide opportunities for networking and information exchange between communities
           engaged in biodiversity conservation areas.
          Establish participatory biodiversity documentation systems to improve knowledge of poorly
           known species of internationally significant biodiversity.
          Establish participatory monitoring of important species and project sites to document the
           benefits of community-based conservation initiatives.
          Promote awareness of the internationally significant species present in the local areas.
          Promote wider consideration of ecological issues and impact on community within local
           biodiversity conservation decisions.
          Promote successful local-level conservation initiatives.
          Support local site management initiatives, including self-policing mechanisms, strengthening
           mechanisms for chiefs/landowners to impose fines, introduction of bylaws, etc.

   A fourth intended outcome was “Effective and efficient administration and management of proje ct
activities.” The ROtI focuses on the first three objectives.

        Encourage pride in traditional resource management systems and their benefits to
         biodiversity conservation.
        Foster initiatives to develop ecotourism, where feasible and appropriate.
        Conduct trial initiatives to reduce threats to internationally significant biodiversity as
         appropriate: control of invasive species, alternate subsistence and commercial resource
         management approaches, and diversification of the commercial resource base.
        Develop appropriate maps of conservation sites for government and community purposes.
        Strengthen the status of local conservation initiatives in government policy, legislation, and
         provincial governments.
        Promote cross-sector interaction so that locally protected biodiversity is recognized within
         government and provincial decision making.

The Terminal Evaluation (TE) summarizes the major issues that the project addressed under each of
the three outcome areas listed above. In addition, the TE describes the outputs for each of the three
areas, and provides ratings on performance in each category. This information is summarized in
Table 2.

significant biodiversity. Specifically, the project focused on three islands with unique and
internationally significant biodiversity, as described below.

3.1     TANNA
Tanna hosts internationally significant flora, which is restricted to remnant natural vegetation blocks
and custom sites. Tanna is one of only three islands where the monospecific palm genus Carpoxylon
occurs in the wild, and the only island known to host genetic variants of Carpoxylon (Benzie and
Ballment, 199521). Tanna is one of two centres of genetic biodiversity for the culturally and
commercially important plant Piper methysticum (Lebot and Cabalion, 198822). In addition, a
number of endemic butterflies, orchids, and snails have been documented, mostly in association
with natural vegetation.

3.2     SANTO
Santo’s montane forests provide refuges for internationally significant endemic bird species
including Ducula bakeri, Charmosyna palmarum, Gallicolumba sanctaecrucis and Aplonis
santovestris. Megapodius freycinet, a Vanuatu endemic species recognised within the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Megapode Action Plan, remains widespread in forested
areas. The island supports the endemic genus Neolalage banksiana and the endemic species Halcyon
farquahari, Ptilinopus tannensis, Phylidonyris notablis and Zosterops flavifrons. While not recorded in
recent surveys, the rare endemic Erythrura cyaneovirens is thought to still occur in inland areas.
Eight species of skink and eight geckos have been recorded from Santo, including populations of two
endemic reptiles, Emoia sanfordii and E.nigromarginata.

The rare endemic kauri Agathis silbiae is only recorded from forests in northwest Santo. Endemic
orchids, bryophytes, land snails, and freshwater fish have been described, but many have not yet
been formally named and recorded. While biodiversity on the lowlands of eastern Santo is
threatened through agricultural and subsistence pressures, and forestry activities, the biodiversity of
the more significant montane and western coast areas are less affected by human activities. Invasive
species are problematic in disturbed areas across the island.

3.3     GAUA
Gaua is a small volcanic cone with a total land area of some 330 square kilometers. The central
caldera is occupied by a freshwater lake, Lake Letas, one of the largest bodies of freshwater in the
Pacific. Almost surrounded by Lake Letas is Mt Garet, with continuous low-level volcanic activity
represented by a cloud of mainly volcanic gases and steam. Water in Lake Letas accommodates a
diversity of freshwater species and is believed to be an important reservoir for amphidromous
species including eels and prawns in the Pacific Region.

A small island within Lake Letas is a nationally significant nesting site for waterfowl. Nineteen
endemic plants have been recorded, including two endemic plants with a restricted range in
Vanuatu Oxera vanuatuensis and Pandanus halleorum. Natural strands of the endangered palm
Pelagodoxa henryana occur. Almost all plant species occurring are of importance to local
communities, have local vernacular names and have specific uses.

Assessments conducted by the NBSAP recorded over 50% of Vanuatu’s land and freshwater birds
occurring in Gaua, including two-thirds of the country’s endemic bird species, as well as 40% of
Vanuatu’s reptiles. Hot water and sulphur vents within the lake provide habitats for highly
specialised invertebrates that have not yet been studied in detail.

Both endemic fruit bats, Pteropus anetianus and P. fundatus, have been recorded along with the
primitive Notopteris macdonaldi, which is restricted to only a few locations in Vanuatu and Fiji.

4.                The LCI Outcomes-Impact Theory of Change

4.1               The ROtI: A Theory-Based Approach To Understanding Impacts
The project’s logical intervention approach or theory of change is the expression of the strategy
chosen to achieve the objective(s). Based on the strategy, the outputs and activities are designed to
drive the expected intervention approach. Inputs and activities produce outputs, leading to
outcomes and eventually impacts. As a whole these steps together define the outcome impact
pathways.

The generic project results chain that underlies the theory of change approach is illustrated in Figure
1 below. On the left of the diagram is the project strategy, which encompasses the entire results
chain and comprises a set of activities that are designed to deliver certain defined outputs, which in
turn aim to make a significant contribution to the achievement of a set of outcomes. Ultimately, the
outcomes are in turn expected to result in a set of long-term project impacts, the ultimate goal of
the project concerned. All levels of the results chain are connected through a series of logical means-
end pathways (signified by the arrows connecting the boxes).

The diagram in Figure 1 shows a single results chain; however, in practice a project often involves
several strategies, each having its own particular results chain, and which all together make up the
project’s theory of change, which is summarised in the project’s logical framework.

The key elements for the ROTI analysis are the assumptions, impact drivers, and intermediate states,
which are described in Table 4. Sustained changes in environmental resources require significant
time because changes in the natural world occur slowly. The ROtI methodology acknowledges and
recognizes that in most interventions targeted at improving environmental status (impact-level
results), time is required following the end of the project for processes to occur, eventually leading
from project outcomes to environmental impacts. The GEF EO’s Review of Outcomes to Impact
(ROtI) Practitionres Handbook provides further details about the ROtI methodology. 59

The remainder of this study applies the ROtI methodology to assess the outcomes to impacts of the
LCI project.

4.2     Local Conservation Initiatives Outcomes-Impacts Theory of Change
The LCI project achieved several important outcomes: conservation areas were established,
management plans were developed, biodiversity was identified, and threats were addressed. The
ROtI now looks at whether the successful outcomes at the conclusion of the project were sustained
and whether they were catalytic in scaling up the results to achieve impacts at the national level and
in communities throughout Vanuatu.

The project’s theory of change was defined in the initial formulation of the project and remained
consistent throughout the project. The TE and TER also used the same theory of change, providing a
consistent foundation for the ROtI to assess the project’s longer-term outcomes and impacts. Based
on the progress made since the end of the project, the outcomes-impact theory of change is
presented in Table 5 below. The table breaks out the outcomes-impacts pathway for the three
strategies that were defined by the project and reaffirmed in the TE and TER.

4.3       Assessment of Achievements of Outcomes-Impacts Pathways
To provide an overall impression of the project and its possible impact, the evaluators conducted
consultations with project stakeholders and reviewed the project documents. Using information
from the consultations, focus groups and desk review, the ROtI provides the following assessment of
the project’s achievement of its overall goals and intended environmental impact. The assessment is
broken down by individual strategies for the key outcomes. Table 6 presents the rating system for
assessing progress from outcomes to impacts.

Table 6: Field ROtI Rating System
  Rating                    Description
      0        Not achieved
      1        Poorly achieved
      2        Partially achieved
      3        Well achieved

As stated above, the overall goal of the project is “Greater and more effective application of locally
and culturally appropriate mechanisms to conserve Vanuatu’s internationally significant
biodiversity.” As was identified in the three project strategies discussed above, the main goal is
conserving globally significant and nationally important biodiversity.

4.3.1 Strategy 1: Traditional mechanisms for the conservation of biodiversity
      identified and strengthened in three Vanuatu communities
With most land in Vanuatu under customary ownership, conservation efforts can only be effective if
the landowners support and actively engage in implementing the required actions. Therefore, the
first strategy was to revive these systems and engage the landowners. Figure 2 illustrates the
outcomes-impacts pathway for Strategy 1.

conservation areas developed their own draft management plan; a management committee was
developed in Loanamilo (Tanna); and another conservation area in Tanna developed eco-tourism
guidelines. In Santo, rural communities began replanting sandalwood on the west coast of the island,
and a Community Resource Center opened at Penoru. In Gaua, all six conservation areas developed
draft management plans, five conservation areas established management committees, and survey
management shifted from LCIP staff to local team leaders around Gaua. Overall, the communities in
the three project sites continue to adhere to the conservation area management plans developed
during the project as well as conducting regular biodiversity monitoring programs initiated during
the MSP.

The conservation area committees established during the project are still in existence and have in
fact been strengthened now with the participation of the provincial and government extension
officers on the committees. The presence of these extension officers is very useful for ensuring that
threats to biodiversity conservation from government developments are minimized. Their presence
is also important for supporting community conservation efforts.

Project activities were also supported by civil society and NGO groups. However, the civil society and
NGO community engagements were all funder-driven, in that they were able to participate and
collaborate with the project only as long as there was funding either from their own projects or
through the LCI. At the completion of their projects and LCI, they no longer work on these activities.
However, some of the lessons learned and information generated from the project are used in their
other projects. Table 7 provides the theory of change assessment for each component of Strategy 1.

The provincial governments for Santo, Tanna and Gaua have taken up the outcomes of the LCI and
are working with the conservation areas. In Santo, the provincial government has employed a full-
time staff member to assist the conservation area, and the province is using the land use maps for
planning purposes. Furthermore, the provincial government is working on extending the
conservation area to other communities and registering the conservation area. The provincial
government in Tanna has also indicated support for the program, and is working with other
traditional communities to see how the LCI lessons learned and approach can be used. In Gaua, the
island communities continue to support the conservation areas, with Lake Letes and upland forests
now included in the GEF PAS project (GEF ID 3819) on Forest Protected Areas and Conservation.

While results at the provincial level are promising, scaling the results to the national level has been
more challenging. The capacity of the DEPC as an institution is still low due to funding and human
resource constraints. Although the DEPC was upgraded to department-level status from its original
designation as a unit, the organizational structure and increased budget requests by DEPC have not
yet been granted, despite agreements on the importance of conservation work. The National Budget
is overly stretched on all national priority activities. According to the Director of DEPC, the current
proposed national budget is already several million dollars short. The DEPC’s budget allocation is not
sufficient to support the sustainability of LCI communities or to scale up and replicate project
outcomes.

There is only one DEPC staff currently working on biodiversity issues. The DEPC Biodiversity Officer is
using the biodiversity data generated from the project to compile the Vanuatu biodiversity database,
as well as regularly giving advice to communities when time avails. She is also responsible for
connecting the communities with the GEF SGP program to fund community activities, such as
aquaculture farming, ecotourism, community resource center, and conservation area management
plans.

After the project ended, several staff who were involved in the LCI project transitioned to other
government agencies and non-governmental organizations. The transition of staff has mixed results:
On one hand, the departure of knowledgeable staff represents a loss of institutional capacity for the
DEPC and other organizations that participated in the project. On the other hand, many staff have
carried the skills and expertise that they gained in the LCI project into their new employment. For
example:

       One former DEPC staff became the Project Manager for Land Use Planning with the Ministry
        of Lands and Survey. This individual is using the land use maps from the project to review
        requests by different interest groups on land in the project areas. He is also currently
        working to have land use mapping conducted with communities throughout Vanuatu.
       Another staff person moved on from the project to become the Director of the Church of
        Melanesia’s Community Conservation Program. The program is using the local community
        model that was established under the LCI project.
       A former staff at VEU is now the GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP) Manager and has been
        very active in taking the lessons learned and information from the LCI to her SGP work. As
        National Coordinator for SGP, she has also been able to provide funding for some of the
        community projects such as the resource centre in Santo, the coconut crab management
        plan in Tanna, and other smaller projects.
       The former Director of the Vanuatu Cultural Centre, which participated in the LCI project, is
        now a Member of Parliament. Prior to entering politics, he was instrumental in the Council
        of Chiefs Land Summit, which introduced the lessons learned and land use mapping to other

         that future land lease agreements allow for the conservation of important biodiversity and

after the project ended. However, some communities have used the results of the project to develop
projects that were funded through the SGP. Although communities continue to monitor biodiversity
at a local level to some extent, the results are not being used at the national level due to the
absence of a sustained relationship between the communities and the DEPC.

Local communities’ capacity to manage their biodiversity resources was achieved and has been
strengthened with the provincial governments and district officers participating in the community
conservation area committees. However, replication at the national level is limited due to human
and financial resource constraints and turnover among government staff.

As noted in the Project Implementation Reports (PIR), measuring the project’s effect on livelihoods is
difficult due to the many external factors that affect local economic conditions.61 However, there is
some anecdotal evidence that the project enhanced local livelihoods. For example, eco-tourism
projects in Tana and Santo generated income for local communities. At least, it appears that the
project’s conservation goals have not interfered with development objectives.

4.4     Local Conservation Initiatives ROtI Overall Conclusion
The project was designed to promote the conservation of globally significant biodiversity in three
island communities in Vanuatu through the strengthening of traditional governance mechanisms. It
is clear from the TE that at the conclusion of the project, the three communities have increased their
knowledge of the globally significant biodiversity in their areas, and appropriate steps have been
taken to conserve biodiversity at the community level. This is seen through the establishment of
conservation area management plans with land use maps, community biodiversity monitoring
systems, and committees to continue efforts to minimize threats and rehabilitate degraded and
threatened biodiversity. The project also strengthened linkages with provincial governments to
ensure the long-term sustainability of community efforts. The project further established some very
important linkages with the GEF Small Grants Program and other NGOs to support biodiversity
conservation activities in local communities. Furthermore, the traditional leaders have taken the
results and lessons learned from the project and included them in the resolutions passed by the
Council of Chiefs National Land Summit.

Where the project has been less successful is strengthening national government mechanisms to
support community efforts, and scaling up and replicating the outcomes from the project to the
national level. Technical constraints, lack of financial resources, and high staff mobility are barriers
to extending the project’s national reach and impact.

Overall Rating Summary
The project was successful in that the targeted communities continue to adhere to the conservation programs
developed during the project. The committees managing and monitoring the activities in the protected areas
have continued their activities, albeit at a lower level, reducing threats to biodiversity in those areas.

The provincial governments have shown strong support for the program and have integrated elements into
provincial-level work as resources allow, but at a smaller scale than during the project.

Unfortunately, although the VEU was upgraded to DEPC, the human and financial capacity is such that they are
unable to support the project communities or replicate the work in other areas of the country.
