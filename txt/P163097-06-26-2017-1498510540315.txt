KEY MESSAGES:
1.	 All over the world, women have less access to credit than men.
    Because of both discriminatory property laws and unwritten social customs,
    women are less likely than men to own high-value assets that can be used as
    collateral to secure loans.

2.	 Financial institutions in developing countries rely on heavy collateral
    requirements because they don’t have enough information about their
    borrowers. New technologies – many emerging from financial technology
    (fintech) startups in the Silicon Valley – have the potential to generate data
    on borrowers that can replace traditional collateral requirements, and unlock
    finance for women.

3.	 In Ethiopia, we explored introducing fintech that could harness the
    data that financial institutions are already sitting on. The technology
    focuses on digitizing hard-copy loan application files of previous borrowers
    to identify trends and characteristics associated with repayment, and predict
    creditworthiness of new borrowers.

4.	 Fintech solutions can viably address the collateral constraint for
    women borrowers, and can work even in low tech environments.
    But technology adoption isn’t easy, and assessing the readiness of financial
    institutions to adopt fintech and embark on technological change is a critical
    first step.

Can we find a viable solution to harness data to help financial institutions get
around the collateral constraint to reach more women borrowers? A team from
the Finance and Markets Global Practice, the Financial Institutions Group, and
the Gender Innovation Lab, supported by the SME Launchpad Program, set out
to understand the feasibility of digitizing customer data and introducing data-
driven lending to improve access to finance for women owned SMEs in two
microfinance institutions in Ethiopia.
