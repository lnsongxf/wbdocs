                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.      The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) is a constitutionally recognized
semiautonomous region in northern Iraq. Its government, the Kurdistan Regional
Government (KRG), based in Erbil, has the right—under the Iraqi constitution of 2005—
to exercise legislative, executive, and judicial powers according to the constitution, except
in what is listed therein as exclusive powers of the federal authorities. The Iraqi constitution
defines the Kurdistan Region as a federal entity of Iraq. KRG has a parliamentary
democracy with a regional assembly that consists of 111 seats.

2.      KRI has been largely immune to the insecurity and conflict witnessed elsewhere
in Iraq, especially following the 2003 Iraq War. This has allowed KRG to promote its
burgeoning private sector and attract foreign investments in both oil and non-oil sectors.
However, starting from mid-2014, the plunging of oil prices coupled with increasing
threats to security have intensified pressure on the overall Iraqi as well KRI’s economies,
necessitating a need for action to address the immediate and medium-term challenges
presented in this report. Government of Iraq (GoI)’s fiscal position has deteriorated and
political tensions have increased with widespread demonstrations demanding reforms
across legislative, executive, and judicial branches.

3.      KRG is facing a wide range of immediate and medium to longer-term challenges
that are intrinsically linked to the overall macroeconomic situation of Iraq as well as the
regional and global environment. The immediate challenge consists in coping with (a) the
deep fiscal crisis, and (b) the security and social problems brought about by the conflict
with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group and the resulting influx of Syrian
refugees and Iraqi Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). These challenges are clearly
immediate priorities for the KRG, and would bear significant repercussions nationally and
internationally if inadequately addressed. The medium to longer-term challenges pertain to
moderating dependence on the oil sector and transforming the KRI economy into a
diversified one that supports private sector-led economic growth and job creation in a
sustainable manner.

4.      Similar to the rest of Iraq, the fiscal crisis and the security challenge posed by the
ISIS insurgency have had a significant adverse impact on economic growth in the KRI.
The fiscal shock is severe. KRG has been dealing with the fall in revenues by a combination
of postponing its investment projects, letting payments fall in arrears including wages and
salaries of government employees, borrowing domestically from private and foreign
companies and banks, and borrowing externally. The impact of reduced investment in
infrastructure will be felt in the medium-term through lowering private sector productivity
and crowding out private investment. Also, arrears in payments to oil companies and
contractors create an uncertain business environment. These, in turn, discourage
investment both foreign and local. The ISIS insurgency has put significant pressures on the
Government through increased security spending and the influx of refugees and IDPs.




                                               ix
5.      To address short-term as well as medium- to long-term structural issues, the
Government requested the World Bank support to develop and implement a structural
economic reform roadmap. This work is a response to an official request of the KRG
Prime Minister H.E. Nechirvan Barzani in a letter to the World Bank President Dr. Jim
Yong Kim in February 2016 seeking a partnership for growth and development to address
the economic and social challenges. As a response to the Government request, this report
proposes reform options for fiscal adjustment and for the diversification of the economy in
addition to social mitigation measures to protect the vulnerable from impacts of the external
shocks. The proposed economic reform roadmap is expected to guide policy makers in
KRG as they address the immediate and more medium- to long-term challenges facing the
region in the context of increasing vulnerabilities confronting Iraq as a whole. This work
builds upon the World Bank’s extensive analytical and technical assessments conducted
under the Economic Growth Diagnostics Study for the KRI, as well as technical assistance
for social protection reform and modernization of public procurement system. The report
also draws on IFC’s experience with the private sector in KRI over the last few years to
identify the necessary reforms that would help KRG move to the next level of attracting
necessary private sector investments in the context of a challenging domestic and regional
environment. KRG is in need of a structural economic reform roadmap, which is inclusive
and serves as Government’s umbrella framework for reform actions in the short to medium-
term. The Ministry of Planning (MoP) laid out broad objectives as guidelines for policy
formulation through the Kurdistan Region of Iraq 2020: A Vision for the Future, with the
diversification of the KRI’s economy away from the oil sector being at the core of these
objectives. The success of these reforms and the ability to deal with multiple shocks will
require support from KRG’s partners. This report is the first phase of the potential World
Bank assistance to the KRG to design and implement long-standing reforms. The second
phase of the technical assistance is expected to provide implementation support for the
Government. The KRG has already started implementing austerity measures including
wage bill and subsidy reforms.

Similar to the rest of Iraq, the KRI economy is characterized by severe dependency in four
areas:

  I.   High dependency on the oil sector. Either directly or indirectly, KRI’s economy is
       highly dependent on oil sector. Despite a series of negotiations, a dispute with the
       central government about the sharing of oil revenues and the budget transfer has
       not been resolved. Oil export revenues, which had been received from the central
       government as budgetary transfers (recently suspended), constituted about 85
       percent of the Government’s fiscal revenues. However, the sector’s estimated share
       is only 1 percent in region’s employment. Such a high level of oil sector
       dependency has become a “Dutch disease” particularly at times of high oil prices.
       Combined with a difficult enabling environment for private sector business
       development, skill formation that is not as advanced as desirable, and strong
       incentives for people to seek jobs in the public sector, it undermines other sectors’
       competitiveness in local and international markets and suppresses private sector
       development and domestic production in tradable sectors and exports.

                                             x
          High oil dependency has created a rentier state, a boom-bust business cycle and an
          uncertain business environment. The boom period concealed the structural
          problems the KRG faces. In the past, flush with oil money the Government became
          complacent to identify and address the structural problems. The current bust period
          has brought all structural problems to the surface.1

    II.   An excessive role of the public sector in the economy. The public sector dominates
          the KRI economy. The KRG public spending to GDP ratio is over 50 percent,
          compared to 61 percent for the whole Iraq. The KRG is the main employer with a
          share of more than 50 percent in total employment (26 percent in non-military
          employment). Similar to the rest of Iraq, payments for salaries, pensions, social
          assistance and subsidies (electricity, fuel, water supply, and agriculture) comprise
          over 50 percent of the budget. Taxes constitute only 4.7 percent of total revenue.
          As a result, public expenditure is a primary driver of economic growth. A key
          problem is high volatility of public expenditure, which translates into high volatility
          of growth through the fiscal multiplier.2 Volatility of expenditure originates, in turn,
          from volatility of the KRG revenues, which varies widely reflecting fluctuations in
          oil prices, interruptions in production and transportation of oil driven by conflict,
          and most importantly the dispute with the central government about sharing of oil
          revenues. Despite the strong entrepreneurial spirit and potential, the local private
          sector in KRI is small and under-developed due to the significant crowding out by
          the public sector.

III.      Dependency on imports. Due to the relatively undiversified nature of the overall
          Iraqi economy, there is a large gap between demand for and local production of
          tradable products in KRI (hydrocarbon exports account for around 95 percent of
          the total export basket of Iraq—the highest among Upper Middle Income
          Commodity Exporters). The gap is filled by imports, which amount to about 90
          percent of non-oil GDP. Local production is confined to retailing of imported
          products, small-scale tradables, and other services including bloated public
          services. Exports of locally produced goods are very limited. This is a typical
          feature of a rentier economy. This is aggravated by weak behind the border policies.
          Under the current policy regime, it is hard for the local businesses to compete with
          imports to diversify and grow.

1
  To manage the oil revenue better KRG approved a law that authorizes establishment of a Sovereign Wealth
Fund (The Oil and Gas Revenue Fund Law, approved in April 2015), which could help pursue a dual
objective of stabilizing the economy and saving to optimize the investments. The law identifies five areas
where oil revenues may be allocated for: the Kurdistan Region's annual budget, investment spending, oil
infrastructure, environmental protection, and a “future generation’s” wealth fund. This is a step in the right
direction, which will also help with establishing accountability and transparency in spending the natural
resource revenues. However, although the law and a fund could provide the necessary infrastructure for fiscal
management of natural resource revenues, by themselves they are not sufficient. A carefully designed
principle for operating these funds, e.g., a fiscal rule, and the political will to pursue those principles are
equally important.
2
  One would expect a high fiscal multiplier in KRI because income tax rate and marginal propensity to save
are very low although marginal propensity to import is high.

                                                      xi
IV.       Weak financial system and dependency on cash-economy. An inclusive and
          efficient financial system is critical for private sector development. A well-
          developed financial system would fund greater investment for larger numbers of
          people. KRI has a poorly developed financial sector, including weak financial
          infrastructure and low access to finance, especially for small and medium-sized
          enterprises (SMEs). There is a strong preference for cash in business transactions.
          Around three percent of companies rely on the banking sector for investment and
          working capital (over 20 percent in the Middle East and North Africa). This is
          explained partly by the pervasive atmosphere of mistrust in the banking sector
          created by frequent financial disruptions and instability in the region.

These structural challenges have been aggravated by a series of recent shocks:

         Conflict with the ISIS group since mid-2014within 13 miles of Erbil;
         Influx of 1.8 million Syrian refugees and Iraqi IDPs increased KRI’s population by
          28 percent;
         A sharp decline in international oil prices, from US$115 a barrel in June 2014 to
          US$35 in December 2015 which means less revenues from direct sales; and
         A sharp fall in revenue transfers from the central government, from US$12 billion
          in 2013 about US$1 billion in 2014, which was suspended in June 2015.3

6.      The growing inflow of Syrian refugees and internally displaced Iraqis into the
KRI has imposed additional strains on the budget and service delivery. This major influx
severely constrained the Government’s ability to deliver health, education, and social
protection programs to the increased population. The standard of living of the population
has deteriorated, and many people have fallen into or are vulnerable to falling into poverty.
As a result of the multiple crises, the poverty rate for KRI doubled in host communities—
with the largest increase in Dohuk which experienced the highest influx of IDPs. When the
IDP and refugee population is included, the poverty rate increased even higher: poverty in
KRI increased to 12.5 percent in 2014. More than 75 percent of the refugees and IDPs are
women and girls who are very vulnerable. KRG is providing public goods for the entire
region and delivering services to this increased population. The needs of the displaced
population are significant and cannot be adequately met under the fiscal crisis that the KRG
is confronted with. According to the joint World Bank and KRG Ministry of Planning study
entitled The Kurdistan Region of Iraq: Assessing the Economic and Social Impact of the
Syrian Conflict and ISIS, the stabilization needs assessment of the IDPs and Syrian
refugees were evaluated at US$1.4 billion in 2015.


3
  In December 2014, a new agreement was reached between KRG and the Central Government to resolve the
dispute. According to this agreement, KRG would export 550,000 bpd through Ceyhan, Turkey (250,000 bpd
from its own fields and 300,000 bpd from federal fields) for the Central Government State Oil Marketing
Organization (SOMO). In return, the Central Government would resume transferring the 17 percent of its
budget to KRG. The agreement was not been fully implemented; KRG did not receive its 17 percent share
fully, and has delivered less than 550,000 bpd to SOMO. Dispute continued. Finally, in June 2015, the Central
Government suspended transfers, and KRG stopped delivering its oil to SOMO and continued exporting
independently.

Diversifying the KRI Economy: Main Contours of a Structural Economic Reform for
the KRI

7.      Kurdistan Region of Iraq 2020: A Vision for the Future provides the KRG’s
overarching view for its structural reforms. Presented in 2013, the Vision calls for “a
Kurdistan Region of Iraq where all people enjoy the benefits of freedom, health, welfare,
and economic security and opportunity.” It defines policy priorities in four areas: Putting
People First (health, education, inclusivity, and labor); Building the Region
(infrastructure); Creating an Economically Prosperous Region (agriculture, the private
sector, and environmental protection); and Putting Government to Work for the People
(effectiveness, transparency, fiscal responsibility, and civil service reform). By producing
the Vision, the KRG has established the foundation upon which any structure economic
reform for the KRI must be built.

8.      The KRG is committed to significant structural reforms to secure fiscal
consolidation and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth in the KRI. The region is
faced with multiple challenges but also with an opportunity to move forward with long-
standing reforms and diversification of the economy. The deteriorating fiscal deficit
exposes KRG to greater risks and calls for gradually strengthening fiscal position by
containing expenditure growth and improving revenue generation. KRG will use the
opportunity to reform the economy to address continuing structural issues. The
Government is committed to implementing much-needed critical reforms ranging from
subsidies and public employment to financial sector and energy sector reforms. These will
contribute to a higher degree of efficiency in public spending. Furthermore, deepening
economic reforms aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil would help encourage
private sector development and create jobs.

9.      Rebalancing of the public sector is essential to cope with the uncertain and
volatile revenue transfers and to support the private sector-led economic diversification.
The strategy that could bring the region out of the fiscal crisis and gradually put the region’s
economy on a balanced and sustainable growth path needs to have two core pillars and
supporting structural policies. These core pillars are fiscal consolidation for macro-stability
and laying the foundations for sustainable and inclusive growth. The Government should
introduce fiscal reforms to strengthen its fiscal capacity to isolate core expenditures from
fluctuations in fiscal revenues, and enhance its budget credibility and sustainability in the
medium and long term.

10.     Fiscal adjustment includes expenditure and revenue-side measures. Expenditure-
side reforms would include rationalization and reprioritization of public expenditures
including targeting subsidies and retrenching excess civil servants while simultaneously
preparing them for the private sector with adequate retraining and other direct labor market
policies. These reforms would increase the productivity of public expenditure and crowd
in private investment supporting diversification. Rebalancing requires redistribution of
public expenditure towards infrastructure (where private investments and financing are not
forthcoming or there is no commercial viability for private investments), education, and
health services, which could be achieved by restructuring subsidies and resizing public


                                              xiii
sector employment. The Government has already launched an unprecedented fiscal
adjustment equivalent to 37 percent of GDP in less than three years, by slashing almost
half of its expenditures. On the revenue side, revenues collected from regional sources
should be raised to cushion the impact of volatility in oil prices and the central government
budget transfers. There is also a need to underpin fiscal adjustment with strengthening of
the public financial management system, starting with the resumption of annual budgets,
and their approval by the regional legislature (a constitutional requirement), to restore the
cycle of accountability, on which systems of improved financial control and management,
reporting, procurement, accounting, and external audit can be built.

11.     Connecting sector strategies to resource allocation is critical. To cope with the
volatile fiscal situation and highly unpredictable budgetary process, the medium-term
expenditure planning should be delinked from the short-term revenue transfer estimates.
This would require a medium term fiscal framework (MTFF) which in turn could be
developed into a full medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) to guide annual
budgeting. Such a framework should be based on identification of essential needs, some
agreed upon standards to budget for core expenditures, and the fiscal capacity of KRG. The
MTFF/MTEF would also assure the quality and sustainability of expenditure levels by
ensuring that capital projects are properly budgeted and completed as planned, rather than
their completion being contingent on the fluctuations of oil revenues and transfers.

12.     In the medium-term, spurring private sector activities in non-oil sectors is a core
objective of the Government. To achieve this objective, an enabling business environment
coupled with entrepreneurship support (particularly for the youth labor force) and firm-
level support to improve productivity, quality, innovation, and local and global market
access would be critical. Policies and programs to enable SMEs to grow would be critical
to create jobs. At the same time, encouraging larger companies to become competitive both
in the local and global market, preferably in partnership with Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) and/or public sector, would be also important. Building a strong, diversified, and
competitive private sector is a critical economic objective as discussed in the Vision 2020.
A large number of complementary policy tools in a variety of areas could be used in
conformity for an extended period to achieve this goal. A prioritized and sequenced
program would include (i) reforming laws and regulations that make it difficult to start, run
and close a business; (ii) piloting and scaling up interventions to promote entrepreneurship,
especially among the youth; (iii) scaling up firm-level interventions related to product and
service quality upgrade and innovation by becoming a part of local or global value chain;
(iv) building a strong advocacy and lobbying organization for the private sector
development; (v) making the borders more efficient so that transit trade can grow; (vi)
putting in place an effective technical and vocational education and training program; (vii)
increasing access to finance, especially for SMEs; and (viii) improving infrastructure
services (especially power).

13.     KRI’s financial sector needs to be strengthened to contribute to private sector
development. Despite a large number of banks operating in KRI, its banking sector remains
underdeveloped. It does not serve its basic function of channeling financial resources to
the private sector to support its development. Banks are not engaged in their core function


                                            xiv
of providing loans to KRI’s real-sector economy or financing long-term investment
projects. As a simple yardstick, to bring the ratio of private credit to GDP from a current 2
percent to the MENA region average of 50 percent, banks would need to provide credit to
the KRI private sector of ID 15 trillion (US$13 billion). Presently, banks in KRI are facing
a severe liquidity crisis, which has crippled their operations and has had negative effects
on KRI’s economy. The current situation is exacerbated by weak banking-sector
supervision as functions of the Central Bank have been subordinated to the direct control
by the KRG Ministry of Finance and Economy (MoFE).

Prospects for Growth and Development of the KRI

14.     Services could play an important role in economic diversification efforts. Services
are essential inputs in any form of production, as well as a major component of the regional
connectivity, hence a key determinant of KRI’s competitiveness and ability to join and
move up regional and global value chains. Services could also become an important source
of exports outside the oil and gas sector, along models in the region, and provide jobs
outside the public sector. Being landlocked, the KRI is even more relying on services; this
situation could be turned into an opportunity, and KRI could become a platform for transit
and services provision in the region, given it is sharing borders with large potential markets.
In particular, the KRI could become a gateway for the provision of a large array of services
in other areas of Iraq. Therefore, this is a win-win situation for overall Iraq. This will
require, however, that the KRI first removes a number of barriers to services trade that
remain, given that services trade mainly takes place at the intermediary level and within
global networks. It will also require restoring some legal certainty, adapting modern laws
and regulations, and building capacity (skills, standards, and infrastructure). Beyond the
economic dimension, the reform of the regulatory framework and the improvement of the
services offered in the KRI will first and foremost benefit the local population, given that
major gaps exist, for example in the health or education sectors.

15.      Regional connectivity can be improved through ICT and transport services. There
are complementarities to be realized from trade in IT services in addition to the benefits of
enhanced ICT services as an enabling platform for trade. In addition to being an important
sector of the economy, ICT, and broadband in particular, is a powerful enabler of trade
development. The transformative role of digital technologies in the KRI resides in its
ability to create jobs, diversify the economy and increase the overall competitiveness and
efficiency of the private sector. To harness this potential, the KRG, in coordination with
the central government authorities, needs to foster the development of high-speed Internet
connectivity and the IT market through a set of actions and regulatory reforms. These
include i) opening the market to competition through new licenses, open access policies,
new supply models such as PPPs, and sharing of infrastructure; ii) strengthening the
monitoring capabilities and regulatory powers of the Ministry of Transport and
Communications; iii) leveraging the geopolitical location to establish KRI and the rest of
Iraq as a hub for international connectivity that serves the regional and international
Internet markets; iv) devising an IT strategy to address the weaknesses in supply and
demand of IT services; and v) stimulating innovation in content development in the
Kurdish language. Based on good geostrategic location, in addition to ICT services,


                                              xv
transport network plays a very important role for the economic development of the region.
Transport sectors in KRI is mainly dependent on roads as the most developed transport
sector, but it is neither well-connected nor maintained at the proper level. Besides this
sector, air transport needs significant upgrade. Railway sector and logistic hubs are not
developed which is a constraint for KRI to benefit from regional economic opportunities.
Furthermore, the legislation for the transport sector is outdated. It is necessary to carry out
customs and trade facilitation reforms to strengthen cooperation among neighboring
counties. Therefore, with improved transport and ICT services, KRI has a significant
potential to become a transport and logistics hub for the whole region based on its
proximity to major markets and relatively safe geopolitical position.

16.      Electricity sector reforms can reduce fiscal burden, enhance energy trade, and
improve electricity service delivery. Although power generation capacity in KRI has
expanded manifold over the last decade due to private sector investments, the sector
continues to be characterized by heavy fiscal burden of subsidies, dependence on costly
liquid fuels to address natural gas shortages, transmission bottlenecks, high technical and
commercial losses, low tariffs, poor institutional capacity, and poor quality of supply. A
strategy based on three pillars is proposed to address the immediate as well as longer term
challenges in the KRI’s power sector: (i) Adopt an enabling legal, policy and regulatory
framework based on clear roles and mandates for different entities. The framework would
include a new electricity law, an independent sector regulator, unbundling of the vertically
integrated sector, corporatization of sector entities, and their eventual privatization. (ii)
Undertake crucial infrastructure investments to ensure adequate power availability,
reliability, reduction of losses, and trade of surplus electricity with neighboring areas of
Iraq as well as Turkey. Given the constrained fiscal situation, it is imminent that private
sector resource induction would be required. However, private sector investments need to
be undertaken carefully to ensure that current sector performance attracts adequate private
sector interest, as well as sufficient ramp-up in institutional capacity and legal-policy-
regulatory framework to manage a complex ecosystem. (3) Undertake measures to support
performance improvements and accountability. This would include a systematic
rationalization of electricity tariffs as well as a focused program for loss reduction and
revenue enhancement. While full privatization of the distribution business is a complex
undertaking, loss reduction and revenue enhancement can be achieved through a well-
structured contract with the private sector to manage billing and collection services. In
addition, a clear policy framework and robust program for energy efficiency, energy
conservation, and renewable energy can help contain the growing electricity demand.

17.     Agriculture presents an opportunity for the KRI, and the sector’s development
will be associated with divergent needs for investment and labor. KRI’s agricultural sector
has been subjected to numerous shocks during the past 30 years, including low priced food
imports under the oil-for-food program, the oil boom (which moved resources out of
agriculture to the public sector and construction), and high cereal subsidies (which moved
resources out of non-wheat commodities). To restart the sector, in addition to required
agricultural investment projects, KRG must work on the following fronts: i) data
improvement should start including a launch of an agricultural survey, price collection,
creation of soil and water maps as well as a land registry; ii) all subsidies, taxes, import


                                             xvi
bans, and licensing fees should be reconsidered; and iii) an effective research and extension
mechanism should be put in place, which should be undertaken in coordination with the
Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, the existing Research Stations, and the
Colleges of Agriculture. Furthermore, a significant agricultural rehabilitation program can
generate localized economic activity and employment.

18.     Investments in the water sector are required to reach a more sustainable use of
water. Water shortages are becoming increasingly common. The sector is faced with
dwindling supplies due to smaller inflows into KRI and deteriorating water quality. Yet,
the demand for water from agriculture, households and industry (including for oil sector)
is increasing rapidly. In addition, water is needed for hydropower and environmental flows.
The increasing water shortages are likely to increase over time as upstream riparians are
planning to develop more water infrastructure, making KRI increasingly vulnerable. The
policy mix for addressing gaps between supply and demand will depend on a range of
social, environmental, economic, and technical factors. Closing the gaps is within KRG’s
reach if it makes the necessary adjustments to include supply management strategies into
an integrated approach that also addresses demand-side issues. To reap benefits of the large
investments that have been made in developing water resources, it is recommended that
the Government introduces broad and poverty-targeted interventions affecting not only
water resources development and management but also water service delivery. Priority
areas would be: (i) water security planning and management; (ii) improving service
delivery; and (iii) strengthening governance mechanisms and water users associations.

Strengths of the Region and the Way Forward

19.      The KRI has strengths and opportunities to get the economy out of the fiscal crisis
and on a balanced sustainable growth path. These include: (i) large oil and gas resources;
(ii) fertile agricultural land; (iii) young population; (iv) central location at crossroads of
trade routes; (v) a government that is determined to implement reforms; (vi) a donor
community that is eager to help; (vii) the entrepreneurial spirit of its population; and (viii)
a relatively stable location as of now to do business in comparison to the rest of the country.
If these strengths and opportunities are used effectively in a supportive policy environment,
the KRI economy has a good chance to overcome the current difficulties and have a more
diversified economy and sustainable high growth in the medium to longer term.

20.     The acceleration of economic growth and diversification of the KRI economy
requires simultaneous effort in the main sectors of the economy. The Government could
begin the reform process which should involve sectoral restructuring and further
developing the legal and regulatory framework needed for a market economy. Sectoral
reforms should be implemented in tandem and in a well sequenced manner. This is because
the effectiveness of reform in one sector is often dependent on the success of reform in
other sectors of the economy. In KRI, these linkages will be accounted for by sequencing
and coordinating reform in and among the various sectors. This roadmap brings together
concrete sectoral policy reforms for Government’s implementation.




                                             xvii
Mitigating the Adverse Social Impact and Building a Robust Social Protection System

21.     The most immediate priority is to stabilize the economy without further
increasing socio-political fragility. Strengthening and retooling social protection
mechanisms to deal with the emergency are critical priorities for the Government. In light
of the emergency, social protection should be a top short-term priority. Existing social
protection mechanisms should be strengthened and to extent possible retooled to handle
the ongoing social and humanitarian crisis. The Government has recently developed a
robust social protection framework to protect the poor and the vulnerable. Furthermore, the
reform program proposes a range of actions, which should be carefully assessed to identify
the vulnerable population groups likely to be affected, and to estimate the size of the
adverse welfare impact. In particular, actions related to changes and increases in income
taxes; phasing out and lowering subsidies on petroleum, electricity, wheat, and on
agricultural inputs have the potential to adversely impact less-well off households. In
addition, given the size of the public sector, which employs individuals of varying
education levels, some of the proposed reforms to the civil service, such as rationalization
of public sector employment, could adversely affect the less-well off.

22.     The poor and the vulnerable will need to be protected. The proposed reforms affect
different groups of the population in a heterogeneous manner. A poverty and social impact
analysis exercise should be undertaken to understand the size and nature of the impacts of
the reform program as a whole. This exercise will help estimate the size of the
compensating transfer needed to protect the poor and vulnerable in a fiscally sustainable
way. For social safety nets, targeting is the main challenge. The categorical targeting used
in KRI does not consider the poverty line or the size of the household leading to high
leakage. The transfer of ID 150,000 is allocated to beneficiary household regardless of size
of the household nor its status, as defined relative to the poverty line or consumption level.
Cash transfers use broad social categories instead of more effective targeting mechanisms
to determine eligibility which explains why the majority of the poor do not benefit from
this program. As such, only 11 percent of the bottom quintile currently are receiving the
cash transfer. Currently, a proxy means test (PMT) to determine eligibility under such a
poverty-targeted safety net program is being developed, and discussions are underway
about transitioning the Social Security Network (SSN) from a categorically targeted
program to one where eligibility is determined based on the PMT. This targeted safety net
system will be underpinned by a unified registry, and transparent and fair governance and
grievance mechanisms.

23.     Even prior to the crisis, KRI had been faced with the challenge of reforming its
social protection system. KRI faces the daunting task to increase the size and dynamism
of the private sector where most future employment growth is expected to come. The
employment challenge comes from the small size of the private sector, a fast growing labor
force due to natural population growth and geopolitical events. The employment-to-
population rate in KRG stands at 22 percent and is similar to the average for the non-GCC
Middle East. The employment rate is very much affected by the very low labor force
participation rate of working age (15-64) women at 14 percent that nevertheless rises to 17
percent if students are excluded.


                                            xviii
24.     The pensions and social insurance system in KRI is not sustainable, suffers from
low coverage, and is inefficient. In 2014, the total pension spending in KRG was estimated
to be around ID 1.3 trillion (or 2.8 percent of GDP), which is high compared to other
economies at a similar stage of demographic ageing. More than 50 percent of the labor
force in KRI is covered by the social insurance system. However, most of them are
employees in the public sector. In the private sector, around 84 percent of the labor force
is not covered. Also, only around 50 percent of people above the age of 65 in KRG are
currently receiving a benefit from the pensions system (mostly retired public sector
employees). The rest of the elderly have to rely on informal care, or public transfers as
social assistance (non-contributory social safety nets). The main challenges of the social
insurance system in KRI can be summarized in four points: (i) administrative capacity is
low; (ii) schemes are inequitable and financially non-sustainable; (iii) the system is
fragmented, leading to distortions in the labor market between the public and the private
sector; and (iv) the system suffers from low coverage in the private sector.

25.     To address the above challenges, KRG has outlined an ambitious strategic
framework for reforming social protection in KRI. The KRG Social Protection Strategic
Framework supports implementation of this reform through an integrated package of
strategies, legislation, institutions, and programs. The proposed strategies align well with,
and provide the mechanisms for implementation of, the Vision 2020 policy priorities. The
strategies are as follows: (i) KRG will create an effective labor supply of well-equipped
job seekers and skilled workers through the education and training systems and market
driven incentives; (ii) KRG will take measures to reduce the duality between employment
in the public sector and private sector and thus contribute to a more dynamic private sector;
(iii) KRG will develop regulatory and institutional frameworks based on timely data
analysis, well-designed employment policies, and constructive dialogue among the social
partners; (iv) KRG will implement parametric reforms to the current schemes to ensure
financial sustainability and will move towards integrating public, private and other
(occupational) pension schemes; (v) KRG will design and implement conventional and
alternative mechanisms to expand pensions and social insurance coverage; (vi) KRG will
design and implement an Unemployment Insurance Program; (vii) KRG will use poverty
as a main determinant of eligibility for its social safety net programs (including the PDS)
and provide effective social care for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups; and (viii) KRG
will protect its human capital by providing incentives for better health and education.

Risks to the Reform Program

26.     There are substantial risks that could jeopardize the success of the reform
program, which is ambitious and far-reaching in its implications. The risks range from
security threats to political and economic challenges. Political tensions between the KRG
and the Central Government could continue to persist. Furthermore, political tensions
between the main political parties in the KRG could endure. In parallel, security risks
remain significant. ISIS could continue to pose a security threat to the KRI. The potential
for a takeover of Mosul by the Iraqi military force may increase the influx of IDPs to the
KRI. Moreover, oil prices could remain depressed for a protracted period of time, thereby


                                            xix
limiting the scope for higher fiscal revenues and economic growth. Should any of these
risks materialize, their impact on the progress of the reform program may be disruptive.

The Lay-Out of the Report

27.     The detailed action plan presented in this reform roadmap is prepared in light of
the strategic objectives discussed above. This work builds on an ongoing productive
engagement of World Bank Group teams with line ministries, private sector, academia and
the international partners which resulted in development of in-depth technical assessments
and analytical work in all sectors of the economy, as well as IFC’s growing footprint in the
region across diverse sectors. The findings and policy recommendations of these evidence-
based analytical work are based on comprehensive consultations with all stakeholders in
KRI. The report covers economy-wide issues such as private sector development, trade and
investment regime, labor market as well as sectoral issues. The first chapter provides a
macroeconomic background while second and third chapters introduce proposed short-
term reform actions in the form of fiscal consolidation measures and medium-term targets
to lay the foundations for diversified, sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The
fourth chapter discusses upcoming social sector reform actions to address ongoing major
social and humanitarian crisis in KRI. The fifth and sixth chapters focus on the governance
issues and reform actions including accountability, institutional framework, and judicial
oversight. The final chapter presents proposed implementation modalities of the three-year
structural economic reform roadmap.

                   1.    MACROECONOMIC BACKGROUND

1.1. After buoyant growth during 2011-2013, the KRG economy has mirrored the path
of the overall Iraqi economy and experienced a significant downturn since 2014. The
region remains highly dependent on oil, with most of the labor force employed by the
public sector. The oil sector, which is the main engine of growth is capital intensive
industry and absorbs only about 1 percent of the labor force. Since mid-2014, the fall of
revenues has dried government liquidity and curbed public investment and economic
growth, which has discouraged foreign investment in oil developments and other private
investment. Consumption has been also affected by the increasing tighter government
finances and growth of arrears on the government’s payroll. The regional conflict is adding
on this crisis. The violence driven by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) insurgency
and clashes with the region’s armed forces Peshmerga, has dampen economic growth in
the oil and non-oil sectors. The ISIS overran about a third of Iraq and large parts of Syria
since 2014, which has disrupted foreign investments and driven 1.8 million Syrian refugees
and displaced Iraqis into the KRI, adding to government spending pressures.

1.2. Combined with the increased security spending and oil price shock, the cut back
of transfers from the federal government has seriously deteriorated the KRG
Government finances. The KRG has escalated independent oil export sales (albeit at a
substantial discount to market) and slashed government spending since mid-2014. Debt
and arrears on payments of the government payroll and on payments to the IOCs have
mounted. The compression of government spending this year, expected to continue in
2017, has led to the cutting of government investment, further dragging down the economy,
including the non-oil sector. Growth deceleration could extend into 2016 and 2017, driven
by low oil revenues and fiscal adjustment. The economic growth is expected to remain
sluggish in 2016-2018, with government spending, private consumption, exports, and
investment to remain depressed by low oil prices and a tight government budget.

1.3. As with the rest of Iraq, fiscal consolidation is urgently needed to address the
current crisis. The Government has already started taking expenditure-side measures.
Budget cuts announced in December 2015 include downsizing government paid
allowances and subsidies on the payments of rents and electricity bills of senior civil
servants, although this has created tremendous political pressures. Further fiscal reforms
will address the size of the wage and salaries bill and the pension payroll, which currently
consumes about 70 percent of the KRG budget, and reduce subsidies for petroleum
products and for the electricity sector. The reforms will address, in particular, the issue of
“ghost workers,” and the need to strengthen public sector staffing controls. The announced
current cuts on the government budget this year will curb household incomes and spending.

1.4. Poverty rate is increasing in KRI as a result of the fiscal crisis and the regional
conflict. The twin crises—the fiscal crisis, and the influx of Syrian refugees and displaced
persons from the rest of Iraq—starting from mid-2014, adversely affected the welfare of
the host community (existing residents of KRI). In the second half of 2014, poverty rates
had increased to 6 percent. Most of this increase was driven by an increase in poverty
among the host community in Dohuk, which experienced the largest influx of internally


                                              1
displaced persons. When the IDP and refugee population is included, poverty rate increased
even higher. An alternate estimate using a microsimulation approach suggests that poverty
in KRI increased to 12.5 percent in 2014. This estimate includes the IDP population, which
was on average less-well off than the Kurdish population, and experienced a large negative
welfare shock upon displacement.

                         I. Output Performance and Inflation

1.5. Oil has been a substantial driver of economic development within the KRI .
Legislation designed to encourage private investment and economic diversification (the
2006 Kurdistan Investment Law) effectively lowered financial barriers to entry for both
local and foreign investors into KRI markets and played a supporting role in overall
economic growth. During pre-2014 period, the growth performance was to a large extent
underpinned by oil revenue transfers that reached about US$12 billion by 2013 from the
central government in account of increasing oil production and exports by Iraq. Such
inflows funded KRG’s budget, which were used to pay government employee salaries,
capital expenditures and other priority investments in health and education sectors. In 2013,
real GDP increased by 8 percent in KRI with oil production as the primary growth driver.
The construction sector also expanded while both public and capital spending increased.
Per capita nominal GDP recorded an increase by around 12 percent between 2008 and
2011, estimated at US$4,452 in 2011. However, strong economic growth between 2007
and 2013 was accompanied by very modest declines in poverty within the KRI.

1.6. In 2014, a combination of factors has adversely affected the overall economy.
First, and foremost, KRI's share from the federal budget of about US$12 billion a year
(US$1 billion per month) has not been transferred because of the political gridlock.
Ministry of Finance and Economy reports that only US$1.1 billion was transferred for the
entire year. Similarly, in 2015, there was no fiscal transfers. Second, the humanitarian
response offered to the IDPs, who add up to more than five times the number of refugees
from Syria has brought significant pressures on the KRG. Third, ISIS-related issues have
affected domestic economic activities, and international trade and investment. Both current
revenues and expenditures registered large declines and the government has been able to
pay wages and salaries for its staff only partially and with lags. Investment spending by the
public sector as of June 2014 was 60 percent of its 2013 level, and the execution of the
investment budget has now been put on hold. Currently, over 4000 projects that were under
implementation have been suspended.

1.7. Investments are declining. The period 2007 to 2013 saw a boom in economic
activity in the KRI, and foreign investment flows, particularly in the construction sector.
While construction dominated, associated sectors, including cement, tourism and real
estate have also seen significant increases. The Board of Investment (BOI) maintains data
on licensed and approved non-energy sector investments financed by the private sector.
Figure 1.1 below shows the increase in investment projects, followed by a drop off in 2014.
The BOI estimates that between 2006 and 2012 the region received US$22 billion in
investment, 21 percent of which was FDI or joint ventures. According to the BOI, licensed
investment projects declined from US$12.4 billion in 2013 to US$4.4 in 2014. As a result



                                             2
of sharp decline in government capital spending, construction projects have been
suspended and cement production plants are operating below full capacity. Property prices
have fallen by about 50 percent by early 2016 from their peak reached in early 2014. The
three major private oil companies (the Anglo-Turkish firm Genel Energy, DNO of Norway,
and the UK’s Gulf Keystone Petroleum) have cut their investments in new oil field
developments.

1.8. As a coping strategy, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has been
providing support to the KRG and assumed wages and salaries payments albeit with lags.
In addition to small amount of borrowing from banks, the MNR by and large seems to have
covered the deficits. The Ministry has borrowed about US$1.5 billion from domestic
private sector and another US$1.5 billion from international companies and suppliers by
selling its future oil output. It also exported about US$1.3 billion worth of oil. Wages and
salaries payments as well as other transfers to a number of ministries and funding of
investment projects seem to have softened the impact of the budgetary crisis. The Ministry
has been not only paying wages and salaries (with delay) and has directly incurred about
US$1 billion in order to provide the IDPs with basic support. These expenses include diesel
imports and de facto electricity subsidies as well as health and education services. It has
been financing some of its investment projects and it spent about US$2 billion in 2014.
The Ministry provided about US$2.6 billion in 2013 for investment projects only.

1.9. As expected, fiscal crisis had a contractionary impact on the KRI economy. With
public and private expenditure being almost 60 percent down, aggregate demand remained
low and hence GDP growth was considerably less than in the previous years in 2014. It is
estimated that GDP growth in 2014 was about 3 percent, down from 8 percent in 2013.
Had it not been for the support of the MNR, the economy would have registered a negative
growth rate for the GDP in 2014.



                                               3
1.10. Consumption has been hit hard. The economic downturn that began in mid-2014
in line with the accelerated deterioration of fiscal revenues has consequently hit private and
government consumption. Total consumption is estimated to have declined by 14 percent
in 2014 and 24 percent in 2015. Government consumption dropped 27 percent in 2015.
The Government cut wages and the purchase of goods and services which affects the
provision of public services. Private consumption has also declined given the large size of
the labor force employed by the Government. Property values and sales of cars and
consumer goods have fallen sharply.

1.11. Inflation has remained subdued in the KRI, as in the rest of Iraq, anchored by a
pegged exchange rate, price controls, and subsidies. The exchange rate peg to the US
Dollar and government controls of electricity, fuel and basic food prices have been key
factors containing inflation during 2010-2015. Consumer price inflation was 3.7 percent
on average during 2012-2014, and it fell to 0.8 percent in 2015 from 3.9 percent in 2014
(in overall Iraq, inflation rate declined from 2.2 percent in 2014 to 1.4 percent in 2015). In
KRI, food prices—about 40 percent of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)—fell by 2.5
percent in 2015. However, electricity prices have increased significantly in recent years
(Figure 1.3). Figure 1.4 presents inflation comparisons in Iraq’s selected governorates. The
official exchange rate remained fixed to the US dollar at ID/US$ 1,166 during 2012-2015.
In December 2015, Central Bank of Iraq devalued the official exchange rate by 1.4 percent
to ID/US$ 1,182.

                                 II. Non-Oil GDP Estimates

1.12. Public administration and construction sectors have the highest share in non-oil
GDP. In 2014, the RAND Corporation and Ministry of Planning KRSO provided an
estimate of 2012 non-oil GDP based on sectoral value added in all sectors on a consistent
national income accounting framework basis. Based on these figures, a detailed assessment
of sectoral growth rates have been carried out in consultation with the KRSO, key
ministries, and the representatives of the private sector for 2013 and 2014. Estimated
sectoral growth rates were mostly derived from actual production data reported by key
ministries to the KRSO as well as by the private sector. The GDP estimate for 2012 is
US$24.1 billion. Sectoral growth rates for 2013 and 2014 are based on production data
from sectoral ministries. The results show that public administration and construction
sectors have the highest contribution to GDP while other non-oil sectors improve their
contribution to growth only marginally in the last few years. The agriculture and
manufacturing sectors have lagged behind. Production and investment in agriculture and
manufacturing activities have been undermined by low labor productivity in non-oil
activities, low protection from imports, weak operation of markets, and the ISIS
insurgency. The economic crisis has induced some people to go back to agriculture, but the
lack of modern technology and low capacity has made farming a survival activity. Some
large scale manufacturing has emerged such as the Coca Cola and Awamedica (a
pharmaceutical company) with factories located in Erbil. However, of the total numbers
of factories in the region only 54 percent were operating in 2015.

1.13. The weak operation of markets for goods and services, including financial
services, and for labor has discouraged the growth of non-oil sector activities. Most
recently, since 2015, non-oil activities have been additionally harmed by the ISIS
occupations and clashes with the Peshmerga as productive assets and infrastructure have
been destroyed, internal and external trade disrupted, and the confidence of households and
investors undermined.

                              III. Employment and Growth

1.14. Public sector employment has been expanding. Job creation has not kept pace with
the growth in the labor force and new jobs are increasingly being created in the public
sector rather than the private. Between 2007 and 2012, more than 750,000 new jobs were
created in Iraq, more than 80 percent of which were public sector jobs. Consequently, the
share of public sector employment (which includes public administration, and other public
sector jobs in education, health, utilities and other services) increased from 42.4 percent in
2007 (already higher than the national average of 34.7 percent in 2007) to 44.3 percent in
2012 (national average was 39.1 percent) and further to 53 percent in 2014 (Figure 1.7).
The Government should be reversing this trend by supporting private sector-led job
creation which has the potential to reach many more of the poor. In 2012, 73 percent of the
employed urban poor (primarily in construction, commerce and retail, and transport,
storage and communication) and 78 percent of the employed rural poor (primarily in
agriculture and construction) worked in the private sector.

1.15. In KRI, the services sector has the highest share in total employment, however it
is public-sector oriented. While consistent throughout the KRI, the labor market, as a
whole, is skewed towards service-oriented jobs as illustrated by Figure 1.8. Labor force
survey data shows that the service sector is most represented by the KRI public sector.
Furthermore, KRI’s labor force participation rate among women (12.2 percent) is one of
the lowest in the region compared to overall Iraq (14.7 percent), Jordan (15.3 percent), and
Iran (16.4 percent). When women do find employment within the KRI it is primarily within
the service sector (93.1 percent) as opposed to the agricultural (4.7 percent) or industrial
(2.2 percent) sector. Oil sector employs about 1 percent of the total KRI labor force.

1.16. The Government is focusing on increasing the quality of labor force. Human
capital is a key factor of production, therefore, policies related to labor and education are
important. Large population movements, such as the influx of IDPs and refugees into KRI,
increased the population and available workforce, although many hope to return to their
homes. In any event, population of KRI has increased which reduces per capita income but
increases available labor. The key issues in this context are of course the availability of
jobs, especially in the private sector, and the quality of human capital of newcomers. Also,
quality of labor force participation directly affects output growth and productivity. Another
issue is the hours worked. Compared to hours worked in high growth economies, KRG
employees spend very limited time at work.

1.17. While KRG has made remarkable progress in improving its education sector,
there is still some way to go. There are human capital or labor quality issues that need to
be addressed. The leading non-oil sectors in the KRI economy (primarily construction, real
estate, and tourism) were able to thrive in part due to less reliance on technical or high
skilled employees. For the group of economies with similar per capita income, KRI’s
average enrollment rate is about 10 percentage points lower. This makes it obvious that
improving educational attainment is necessary to support sustainable economic growth.
Given the need to constrain the public sector wage bill, improvements to the education
sector outcomes in the near term should be aimed at through improvements in the
productivity of the existing cadre of teachers rather than increasing their numbers.

                              IV. Poverty and Vulnerability

1.18. Poverty is increasing in the whole country but at a higher rate in ISIS-affected
governorates including KRI. The structural vulnerabilities that were evident prior to the
crisis have been exacerbated by the ongoing violence and economic and social disruptions.
Microsimulation estimates suggest a reversal of the hard-won welfare gains of the past,
with poverty rising in overall Iraq from 19.8 percent in 2012 to 22.5 percent in 2014.
Poverty was accompanied by a massive human capital deficit—in health, education and
access to basic services. Many Iraqis live close to the poverty line, vulnerable to increases
in the price and availability of necessities, and/or the loss of assets and livelihoods.
According to the World Bank projections, the recent shocks have increased the number of
people living below the poverty line by an estimated 2.8 million by end-2014. IDPs make
up half a million of Iraq’s poor in 2014, with an estimated poverty rate of 40 percent, almost
twice the average. The Kurdistan Region experienced a quadrupling of poverty rates to
12.5 percent, due to the large influx of IDPs and Syrian refugees and the increased
competition for jobs, goods and services. The IDP population was on average less-well off
than the Kurdish population, and experienced a large negative welfare shock upon
displacement. In the ISIS-affected governorates (Nineveh, Al-Anbar and Saladin), the
direct impact of economic, social and security disruptions is estimated to have doubled
poverty rates to 41.2 percent. The other governorates in Iraq have also seen a notable
increase in the head count rate.

1.19. Household consumption is declining. As a result of the 2014 crisis, total income,
which includes both labor and non-labor income, is estimated to have declined in almost
all of Iraq’s governorates. Consumption per capita contracted by 14 percent in the KRI
compared to declines of 11 percent in the South, 9 percent in the Center, 9 percent in the
rest of the North, and 8 percent in Baghdad (Figure 1.11).

    V. Fiscal Issues and Budgetary Process: The Need for a Medium Term Fiscal
                                    Framework

1.20. KRG faces peculiar challenges that complicate the design of effective fiscal
policies. Under the circumstance where no agreement has been reached with the central
government on the oil revenue sharing and the budget transfer, oil economy has a
predominant role in KRI: about 45 percent of all value added and more than 90 percent of
all fiscal revenues are estimated to be generated by the oil sector. As such, the economic


                                                              9
and fiscal dependency on oil is deeper than that of economies with much higher natural
resource potentials. For instance, Saudi Arabia possesses about 5 times more oil reserves
than KRI in per capita terms; however, its economic dependency ratio is identical to that
of KRI and its fiscal dependency ratio is much lower, at 78 percent. In KRI, threats posed
by volatility and exhaustibility of natural resources are amplified by geopolitical turmoil.
First, the revenue volatility faced by KRG is much higher than what other resource-rich
economies face. In addition to oil price fluctuations, KRG’s revenues suffer disruptions
that stem from the conflict with ISIS and disagreements with Baghdad. For instance, KRG
received only US$1 billion of its US$12 billion share from the federal budget in 2014.
Second, as a region within a federal structure, KRG is credit-constrained. Therefore, it is
unable to close its financing gap. As a result, KRG has accumulated large arrears with
domestic creditors and international oil companies in recent years. Third, KRI’s future
revenue stream is obscured by political and legal uncertainties. The relationship with
Baghdad, the status of regional conflicts, and low public revenues have significant effects
on KRG’s fiscal inflows.

1.21. The KRG government finances have worsened since 2014. Government revenues
shrank from 87 percent of GDP in 2013 to 38 percent of GDP in 2014 reflecting multiple
shocks.4 The contribution from tax revenues have remained small. The deterioration of
government finances during 2014-2015 has dried government liquidity and slashed public
investment. Government expenditures remained high despite sizable fiscal adjustment.
Debt and arrears on payments of the Government payroll have mounted since 2014.

  The KRG handles two separate budgets. The MNR transfers only a part of oil revenues to the MoFE. The
rest is used to pay for the MNR operating expenses, payments to IOCs, and defense expenditure.

1.22. KRG’s non-oil revenues are low. In 2015, revenues from taxes contributed with
only about 3.5 percent of GDP. Government workers pay 5 percent on monthly salaries.
Salaries in the private sector are subject to a 12 percent tax, of which 5 percent is paid by
the employee and 7 percent paid by the employer. Companies pay 15 percent tax on their
sales, but any project registered in and licensed by BOI is exempt from taxes and import
tariffs. IOCs are exempted from paying taxes. A general sales tax doesn’t exist, and few
taxes are subject to a reported weak tax administration and compliance. Vocational taxes
at rates that range between 3 percent and 10 percent are charged to revenue from shops and
independent technical professions such as carpeting and blacksmith. There is a 9 percent
tax on the rental of houses and 2 percent tax on the rental of lands. The general custom
duty rate is 5 percent, but imports of intermediate produces by factories licensed by the
BOI pay no duties on their imports of intermediate and capital goods; factories not licensed
by the BOI pay only 1 percent duty. Several goods are exempted from customs duties such
as basic food products, medicines, and stationary. Five star hotels and restaurants are
exempted from taxes for 7 years if located outside Erbil city and for 5 years if located inside
Erbil city. Also hotels and restaurants granted an excellent or first class category rate by
the BOI are exempted for taxes.

1.23. Adjusting government expenditure has not been easy, given the large wage, social
security, and defense spending demands. Government expenditures fell from around 90
percent of GDP in 2013 to 50 percent of GDP in 2014 reflecting cuts on the purchase of
goods and services, and payments to IOCs and contractors. In 2015, total expenditure rose
to 58 percent of GDP driven mainly by partial past due payment to IOCs and contractors,
and defense spending driven by the growing ISIS insurgency in the region. The KRG
resumed payments to the three main IOCs since September 2015 (about ID 87 trillion) but
the payments barely covered operational expenses and left little space for additional oil
development investments. The Government unveiled spending cuts in December 2015
which included slashing allowances of Ministers and other officials by as much as 50
percent, and eliminating allowances for rent and electricity bills of senior civil servants. In
March of 2016, wages and salaries were cut across the government, excluding payments to
the Peshmerga. The cut ranged between 15 percent for salaries below ID 200,000 per
month to 75 percent for senior staff salaries and 80 percent for minister salaries. The
average cut was about 60 percent on the            Figure 1.12: KRG Government Debt
wage bill. The Government also                                (US$ millions)
established a committee to review non-
salary expenses and to propose further 18000

1.24. Debt is increasing rapidly. KRG’s        10000
                                                8000
government debt reached about US$17             6000
billion at the end of 2015 (Figure 1.12), of    4000
                                                2000
which accumulated arrears were about               0
US$8 billion. The KRG planned to issue                  2012      2013      2014      2015
international bonds in the amount of
US$500 million, but this has not                Sources: KRG, World Bank estimates.

materialized. The Government is looking to sell some assets for serving the accumulated
debt, including payment arrears.

1.25. The budgetary process of KRG needs urgent improvement so that the budget can
become a more effective policy tool. In this way, risks to economic growth could be
managed and the achievement of the Vision 2020 document which aims to diversify its
economy could be attained. The current capacity of the MoFE is limited. Whether budget
allocations are in line with priorities is not clear. On the spending side, line ministries do
not provide sufficient and timely information to the Ministry. During the reform years, the
Ministry and the KRI Government could benefit from a budgetary process as described
below.

1.26. The first step in the process is the determination of the resource envelope , or the
volume of resources from revenues, domestic and foreign borrowing, and other revenues
(such as oil revenues or privatization proceeds) likely to be available consistent with
economic growth targets. This is the starting point for any system of public resource
management and prioritization. In the case of KRI, there is no determination of the resource
envelope, except the capital budget. Furthermore, current arrangements do not lead to the
establishment of a budget constraint, or the resource envelope, which would necessitate the
adjustment of expenditures and their prioritization. While at one level this is one of the
results of lack of a MTFF, it is also the result of lack of appropriate budgetary process.

1.27. The attainment of the Vision 2020 targets, which are medium-term targets,
require a medium-term budgetary approach. Essentially this is the MTEF which is a
process for determining available public resources and allocating these resources in line
with government priorities. It seeks to cap spending within the limits of what is affordable
and increase predictability of resource flows over the medium term. It is based on the notion
that the policy decisions made by government will be disciplined by resource realities over
the medium term and that the most effective way to restructure spending so that policy
decisions reflect resource availabilities is by taking a medium term perspective. It is
important to note that before KRG develops a medium term budgetary approach, it needs
to put in place an annual budget process followed by disciplining resource allocation
policies with a medium term perspective.

1.28. Required reforms to link policy, planning, and budgeting are institutional and
organizational. While KRG’s fiscal situation has been seriously problematic starting in
2014, much remains to be done to ensure that budgetary process and resultant expenditures
are linked with strategic priorities and are efficiently utilized. The budgetary discipline in
2014 and 2015 has been achieved essentially through a system of cash rationing. An
efficient public finance framework, particularly if the Vision 2020 is to be implementable,
require a number of steps with associated processes. In general, there are three sets of
considerations in the assessment of budgetary processes and these are:

    Legal basis of budget preparation and execution process, including documentation,
     coverage, assignment of expenditures, controls and requirements of accountability
     and transparency.



                                             12
    A process for identification of a resource envelope that determines total available
     resources and establishes the budget constraint.
    A sound budget preparation process that prioritizes expenditures in line with needs
     and available resources to ensure public service delivery.

1.29. KRG’s fiscal revenues are susceptible to oil price volatility. This dependency is
critical given that KRG’s non-oil local revenue to GDP is very low. KRI has a narrow
export base as about 90 percent of its exports are oil based. The MTFF will need to take
this issue into account. Alternative price and quantity scenarios need to be produced and
factored into the MTFF and in this way resource flows can be estimated and disruptions to
budgetary process could be minimized. Recent large swings in petroleum prices have
shown the volatile nature of such markets. These large terms-of-trade shocks necessitate
appropriate policy response and mechanisms to mitigate their impacts on the economy.
During the reform years, the Government should give priority to developing adequate
policies and institutions to mitigate the detrimental effects of price booms and busts.

                             2. FISCAL CONSOLIDATION

2.1. KRG’s fiscal pressures are mounting. The decline in oil prices brought large
decreases in economic activity as fiscal revenues decline, with second round effects on
investment and the financial situation of oil and gas companies. In the absence of a buffer
and an agreement on budgetary transfers from the Central Government, KRG will need to
re-assess medium-term spending plans and carry out fiscal adjustment. The KRG’s
response going forward aims to contain current expenditures while protecting priority
spending categories, in light of the security situation and influx of refugees and IDPs. The
Government should contain current spending by refraining from public sector wage
increases, freezing public sector hiring, reducing transfers to state-owned enterprises and
subsidies.

2.2. Subsidies, transfers, and arrears create distortions. Explicit and implicit subsidies
often have hampered resource allocations in KRG. Furthermore, the arrears are high and
this undermines financial discipline and deters the emergence of the required norms of
behavior needed for a market economy. Subsidies, both explicit and implicit, are
detrimental to competition, which reduces the role of price signals in guiding resource
allocation. Fostering a market economy and raising productivity requires the elimination
of these distortions.

2.3. KRG has taken significant steps for fiscal adjustment. Between 2014 and first
quarter of 2016, the Government has conducted a large fiscal adjustment in the amount of
ID 10.1 trillion, equivalent to 37 percent of GDP, by cutting half of its expenditures. 5 The
Government cuts included ID 3.5 trillion from current expenditures, ID 2.3 trillion from
capital spending, ID 1 trillion reduction in MNR-financed expenditures, and ID 3.4 trillion
reduction in salary and wage bill. The Government also phased out some subsidies
including fuel (i.e., gasoline and diesel subsidies) which provided a fiscal saving of ID 2
trillion between 2014 and 2016. By switching to natural gas, the Government has reduced
fuel purchase costs for the power sector by ID 3 trillion. Furthermore, KRG removed
subsidized loans for buying apartment buildings, subsidized industry loans, and subsidized
agriculture loans. On the way forward, the Government plans on reforming subsidized
electricity, direct support for power producing companies, and industry’s access to cheap
energy. KRG’s goal for 2016 is to reduce electricity fuel subsidies from US$1.5 billion to
US$500 million. By mid-2017, the Government plans to privatize distribution and
collection in electricity sector. In the next three years, through progressive introduction of
fiscal reforms, including revenue and expenditure-side measures, the Government expects
to cut fiscal deficit by as high as ID 15.8 trillion under the low oil prices scenario.

2.4. As the decline in oil prices could prove to be persistent, KRG should adjust its
fiscal position to ensure fiscal sustainability. Given the large magnitude of Government’s
fiscal adjustment, clear macro-fiscal targets should be established to improve the quality

of austerity measures. The adjustment should be anchored by medium-term fiscal
consolidation and would require limiting current spending. Careful prioritization and
appraisal of sizable investment projects would also be important to ensure medium-term
growth dividends. Priority projects should move forward. Through a macroeconomic
framework, the Government could link broad development plans to economic policy
formulation. This will ensure that spending, revenue, and debt targets are consistent with
growth targets as part of a Medium Term Fiscal Framework. In addition, the role of the
MNR should be revisited, as it seems to be conducting quasi-fiscal expenditures outside
the control of Treasury authorities.

                   A. CIVIL SERVICE AND WAGE BILL REFORM

2.5. An effective and fair public sector is a prerequisite for sustained economic growth
and inclusive social development, and this is duly recognized in the Vision 2020. In
particular, the Vision 2020 includes two interlinked pillars that call for policies to “put
people first by focusing on health, education, the social safety net and the labor market”
(Pillar 1) and “put the Government to work for the people through an effective and honest
Government, a transparent, efficient, and equitable public finance system and civil service
reforms” (Pillar 4). Achieving these objectives would require significant and consistent
efforts over a long time horizon.

2.6. Public sector is very large in KRG. Between 2007 and 2012, the share of the public
sector jobs in KRG increased from 41.9 percent to 44.2 percent (above the national
average). Around 90 percent of public workers are entitled to retirement benefits.
Additionally, public sector jobs imply working fewer hours relative to the private sector.
For KRG, this gap increased from 2007 to 2012—from 22 percent fewer hours relative to
the median hours worked in the private sector to 27 percent fewer hours. The possibility of
a public sector job, with greater job security, benefits, and fewer hours of work, raises the
reservation wage among the working age population, and limits active job search as people
wait and queue for openings in the public sector. In 2012, an average male in the working
age population received 20 percent more in the public sector by having completed primary
education relative to being illiterate. However, the premium for getting an additional level
is almost negligible thereafter until he completes tertiary education. Table 2.1 below shows
an evidence of a slowdown in job creation between 2012 and 2014, except in the financial,
insurance and other services sectors—which turn out to be security sector related jobs when
disaggregated further.

2.7. The size of public sector employment is much higher than international
standards, and it has also been growing at an unsustainable rate. Even allowing for
security issues and the fact that one-in-three of the residents of the KRI are students
(therefore a large number of teachers is justified), a disproportionate share of the labor
force is employed in the public sector (around 680,000) which corresponds to 11.6 percent
of the total population employed in broad public sector (including military and police) and
8.3 percent employed as civil servants. The international norm for civilian employment as
percentage of population ranges from 3.5 percent to 6 percent respectively for low and
middle income countries and is around 5 percent for the Middle East and Central Asia
region. The share of public sector employment increased from 42 to 44 percent between
2007 and 2012, and went up to 46 percent in 2014. On average, between 2007 and 2012,
KRI added approximately 32,300 jobs per year in the private sector and 31,900 jobs per
year in the public sector. In contrast, in the 2012-2014 period, the private sector lost jobs
at the rate of 13,000 per year, while the public sector added jobs at the rate of 17,000 per
year.

2.8. Wages, salaries, and untargeted subsidies constitute the bulk of non-military
public expenditure leaving insufficient resources for much needed infrastructure and
for the non-wage outlays for quality education and health services. Until the recent cuts
in public sector wages and the emergence of salary arrears, the expansion in public sector
employment has been accompanied by an increase in earnings among public sector
employees, from already high levels compared to the private sector. The initial conditions
in KRG are extremely challenging in terms of the size and compositions of public sector
employees, the de facto role of government employment as a social safety net, its weak

administrative capacity and the lack of systems to carry out operations, and evidence-based
analyses. KRG’s wage bill is rather high. In 2012, public sector employees earned 30
percent more than private sector workers, excluding benefits. Within the public sector, men
earned, on average, 20 percent more than women in 2012. Given the sharp reduction in
government revenues and oil prices, public sector wages have become a substantial
financial liability that limits the ability of the KRG to make critical public investments and
deliver services effectively. This situation is compounded by large un-targeted subsidies,
which create dependence, discourage hard work and crowd out productive public
expenditure. The KRG provides untargeted subsidies in a number of areas, from electricity
to food to social welfare payments. These end up benefiting people who do not need
assistance and reduce the ability of the government to fund services that will not only
benefit the poor but will benefit all of the KRI through enabling a growing economy.

2.9. The oversized public sector employment has fiscal implications. The dire fiscal
situation has consequences for funding public services and investments compromising
citizens’ welfare and limiting economic growth. The Government has recognized this and
in recent years the rate of increase in civil servant wages and salaries has been declining.
A hiring freeze was introduced in 2014 (with exceptions of some proficiencies such as
doctors) and the pay for senior civil servants has been reduced. However, a more strategic
and comprehensive approach to the challenge is required.

2.10. The way forward is to turn the public sector from a (bureaucratic) employer of
last resort to a meritocratic professional body that hires on the basis of priority needs of
the region and fiscal affordability. Thus, Government employment should no longer serve
as a de facto social safety net where those hired by the government do not have the skills
necessary to do the job they are recruited for. Recruitment should be transparent and
limited, and on the basis of justified needs of ministries and departments, and budget
affordability. Public sector pay, in turn, should be reviewed, and the large public sector pay
premium eliminated. This will also level the playing field between the public and private



                                                 17
labor markets and will reduce the number of students pursuing studies expecting a public
sector job instead of getting skills required by the private sector.

2.11. The Government has recently introduced several short-term austerity measures
to balance the budget. The payroll of government employees was cut—salaries of high-
ranking officials by 75 percent and other employees by 10-20 percent. This is intended as
a temporary measure by the Government: “withholding a portion of salaries that will be
paid back later when fiscal situation stabilizes.” However, this plan presents a strong risk
of building up unsustainable arrears in the medium-term. Therefore, the KRG as it revisits
many aspects of its governance, should carefully reconsider salary structure going forward.
There is both a need to bring public sector pay into line with regional labor market
comparators, and to restructure the overall pay and grading system, to ensure equal pay for
equal work, and greater transparency and affordability. Salaries of region’s armed/security
forces will remain unchanged. The Government also intends to reduce the public sector
employment. This is a more challenging task because there is no employment registry and
a functioning payroll management system in place including the job descriptions of the
positions. It is not clear how many positions are needed and who performs what.

2.12. A strategic objective for KRG is to align the public sector with the Vision 2020
and existing fiscal constraints. This will require significant preparatory operational and
analytical reviews to introduce at first wage freezes, wage cuts, hiring freezes, retirements,
retrenchments and eventually adopting new criteria and measures for the hiring of civil
servants. It also means building a stronger database of existing public sector staffing,
modernizing establishment and payroll control systems, overhauling human resource
management systems, including regular staff appraisals, and creating new institutions, such
as a regional public service commission to set and implement public service policies and
processes, including more meritocratic hiring and promotion practices.

2.13. An essential part of this will be the creation of a voluntary separation program
with different options that are in line with the labor laws. Doing so will require technical
assistance and database development, including collecting data on employee skills, and
should be a goal for the medium term. This will include using various levels of incentives.
The critical issue in implementing the voluntary separation program is how to retain the
‘best’ employees.

Policy Response

2.14. A three-pronged approach would translate Vision 2020 into action. The reforms
will be sequenced and gradual (Table 2.2). Typically, civil service reforms are very
challenging and can take many years to fully implement, requiring sustained, high level
support in government. Further, civil service reform and private sector expansion need to
proceed simultaneously.

               Table 2.2: Public Service Reform: A Three-Pronged Approach
1. Sustainability & Establishment Control
High Priority: to be done in near term (1-2 years) and on-going
Assign and convene a high level committee (e.g., a High Level Authority for Civil Service
reform at the Prime Minister’s Office composed of Ministers) to confirm the need for civil
service reforms. Plan and launch a reform process. Create a KRG public service commission to
ensure new rules and processes are followed.
Posts vacated due to attrition (retirement, resignation, or death) will not be filled with new hiring
but met by reallocating and re-prioritization of existing staff. Existing pay cuts should be
generally maintained, pending adoption of a new and more affordable public sector pay policy.
Conduct a payroll audit to eliminate “ghost” employees. Eliminate improper hires.
Review governance framework for parastatals with a view to improving their performance and
better controlling staffing levels.
Medium Priority: to be completed in the medium term (3-5 years)
Establish medium-term wage bill to total expenditure and regional GDP targets, tapering them
downwards to more sustainable levels, consistent with the MTFF/MTEF, and track adherence.
Restrict any increases to the overall civil service pay scale, and limit all promotions and step
increases to only the defined criteria in the regulations.
Analyze the civil service salary scale for structure and in comparison to private sector wages.
Review and rationalize civil service allowance types, amounts and eligibility, and ensure
allowance equity across ministries. Develop a new public service pay policy.
Launch a series of functional reviews of the main ministries of the KRG, examining mandates,
organizational structures and staffing levels. The reviews will also examine the scope for
efficiency gains through contracting out.
Institute a voluntary separation program to shed public sector workers, and a program of
equitable separations for staff identified as redundant by functional reviews.
Lower Priority: Reforms to be done in longer term (5-7 years)
Assess the role of government in delivery of key services and determine which can be contracted
out.
Assess ministries’ structures and mandates to eliminate sprawling.
Consider policy to reduce the number of civil servants including severance packages.
2. Civil Service Foundational Reforms
High priority: to be done in near term (1-2 years) and on-going
Build a database of existing staffing levels by organization, and analyze the drivers of staffing
levels, revisiting policy as required.
Designate the PM’s office or other existing high level body, such as a regional Public Service
Commission, as the authority over the civil service providing it with sufficient capacity to
manage and oversee the civil service and its regulation, including reviewing the legal framework
and existing regulations.
Build establishment control system, tied to agreed organizational structures and staffing levels,
in turn linked to a verified and centralized payroll program.
Create attendance system, including number of hours worked.
Medium Priority: to be done in the medium term (3-5 years)
Improve capacity of departments targeting those with critical service delivery/ economic
mandates.
Create a basic performance appraisal system with individual job descriptions, performance plans,
ensure regular staff assessments, and end automatic progression up a scale.
Lower Priority: Reforms to be done in the longer term (5-10 years)
Conduct basic skills assessment of civil servants.



                                                 19
    Establish training plans for ministries based on skills assessments.
    Support development of the Kurdistan Institute for Public Administration (KIPA).
    Build and maintain employee records and develop a unified Human Resources Management
    Information System (HRMIS).
    Work with education institutions on skills mismatch of incoming civil servants.
    3. Recruitment Practices
    High Priority: KRG will initiate this work to prepare for further recruitment (1-2 years)
    Build upon the merit-based recruitment previously initiated.
    Jobs to be advertised based on approved terms of reference with basic deliverables.
    Medium Priority: to be done in the medium term (3-5 years)
    Recruitment can be centralized for all positions or only for higher grades

2.15. Civil service reform will assist in reducing the role of the government as main
employer and support the growth of non-oil sector activities. The reform will reinforce
the professionalism of the civil service, which would require improving on the selection
criteria, recruitment and promotion systems, and dismissal procedures. The reform will
also address the re-sizing of employment across government ministries and entities,
including the state enterprises. Improving the efficiency and financial viability of state
enterprises is crucial for fiscal sustainability. The reform will review delivery prices and
costs, ensuring the cost recovery in the provision of goods and services. The reform will
include reviewing of the size of employment, accountability in the delivery of products and
services, and accountability in the management staff. Fiscal reforms will address the size
of the wage and salaries bill and the pension’s scheme, which currently consumes about 70
percent of the KRG’s budget. The reform will address, in particular, the issue of “ghost
workers” (people who are on the public payroll but do not actually work or may not exist).

2.16. The recent review of the public administration by RAND Corporation and MoP
proposes a number of reforms and these need to be considered and their financial
implications to be estimated. Since most people are in the public sector, getting civil
servants into productive jobs is a major issue. As economic diversification is an objective,
the Government will develop an action plan using the RAND-MoP study for public sector
reforms. Addressing disincentives and barriers to employment in the private sector will
boost growth and productivity and is likely to lead to more investment.

              B. SUBSIDIES, SOCIAL BENEFITS, AND PENSIONS REFORM

2.17. Subsidies, social benefits and pensions impose pressure on the overall budget ,
with subsidies for electricity, water and agriculture reaching US$2.4 billion per year.
Pensions and social benefits constitute 12.2 percent of the total GDP.6 Pension incomes,
which are not explicitly designed to as an anti-poverty transfer, reach less than 20 percent
of the poor, and more than a quarter of the non-poor. About 85 percent of pension recipients
belonged to non-poor households in 2012.

2.18. The KRG should start moving away from public sector employment and universal
subsidy systems as the main social support for the poor, in favor of supporting private
sector-led growth and developing more targeted social safety nets. Fiscal reforms will
include reducing the subsidies for petroleum products and for the electricity sector. Social
transfers should ensure that they target the most vulnerable groups such as those covered
by the food program and other social benefits. Increasing fiscal savings is essential not only
to raise public investment but also for raising fiscal savings. Government current spending
on pensions should be rationalized and tax compliance strengthened. These actions will
reduce borrowing requirements from the government on the banking sector and open room
for private sector credit sector.

                         C. REVENUE GENERATION MEASURES

2.19. Currently, almost all KRG public revenue comes from oil exports, which is
unstable because of volatility in oil prices. In addition, there has been a long standing issue
concerning the oil revenue sharing and the budget transfer with the central government.
Local taxes, a more stable part of public revenue, constitutes only 2.6 percent of GDP and
4.7 percent of total revenue—one of the lowest in resource rich countries: 17.8 percent in
Azerbaijan, 35.2 percent in Botswana, 15.5 percent in Malaysia, and 5.3 percent in Saudi
Arabia. Such a low level of tax revenue of KRG is the result of a combination of (a) low
rates, (b) low compliance because of widespread informality in the economy, and (c) low
enforcement. This situation perpetuates dependence on oil prices and volatility of
government revenue and expenditures.

2.20. KRG has a presumptive tax system. It is based on the Iraqi Tax Code of 1982 with
amendments made in 2007 and 2011. Tax liability is based largely on pre-determined
deemed taxable income schedule prepared by the Tax Authority rather than an account-
based self-assessment system. It diverges in some ways from the tax system of the Central
Government. Corporate income tax rate is a flat rate of 15 percent. According to the Tax
Law, tax is calculated based on net accounting profits per audited financial statements. In



                                              21
the absence of audited financial statements or if these statements are found unreliable by
the tax authority, corporate taxable income assessment is made based on pre-determined
deemed profit schedules for sectors. It is very common for the tax authority to disregard
the financial statements and assess the companies’ tax liabilities on a deemed profit basis.
Income taxation is based on a deemed income tax system. Essentially, the tax authority
determines the taxable incomes on the basis of deemed income schedules, which are
prepared annually taking account of the nature of the businesses and economic conditions
in the region. The exercise involves significant discretion. For contractors and purchases
from public agencies taxable income (deemed profit) is calculated as a percentage of the
contract amount or purchase value.

2.21. Business income tax ID and import license ID numbers are separate, so there is
no single identification number linking the level of business activity and level of imports
to the same company. While this is only one type of cross-check that can be used to help
validate income levels, it is potentially one of the most accessible, and the reluctance to
unify these two ID numbers and exploit the linked information indicates an important
direction for improving the regulatory framework. Across the border in Turkey, for
example, the income and import tax identification systems are identical.

2.22. The tax enforcement office is not organized in such a way that permits the
collection of relevant information to allow most types of income cross-checking. Tax
office staff lack business experience and thus lack the technical skills to properly examine
business records. Enforcement tools are limited, and political authorities prefer to avoid
antagonizing businesses with tax enforcement. As a result, the tax morale appears to be
low, i.e., firms assume that most other firms do not pay the regulated amounts of taxes,
thus they avoid penalizing themselves by paying when others do not pay. Even so, the
presumptive, or lump sum tax can be imposed whether firms have profits or not. This also
contributes to low tax morale.

2.23. Revenue generation measures are required to reduce the extreme dependence
either on the volatile central government budget transfer or on oil revenue and
vulnerability to swings in oil prices. Customs duties on imports should be rationalized to
international levels to balance raising government revenues and fostering the growth of
non-oil sector activities. Revenues from taxation should become an increasing source of
government revenues. Enhancing the sources of government revenues from taxation is
crucial for reducing the exposure to the fluctuations affecting the oil sector. Taxation
should concentrate in few taxes, to keep it simple and easy to enforce, be broad based, and
tax administration should be effective to reduce tax avoidance and tax evasion. The
adoption of a value added tax (VAT) broad based, and raising the corporate income tax to
international levels should be considered. Elimination of multiple taxes and fees that
produce low revenues but imply high administrative costs should be considered as a main
pillar of a tax reform.

2.24. To isolate the essential public expenditure from volatile oil prices, KRG should
increase local tax revenue substantially. Policy measures could include:




                                            22
      Review the rate structure and composition of taxes to determine tax potential of
       KRI and raise tax rates accordingly.
      Strengthen controls to reduce informality and improve compliance.
      Set up a well-staffed taxation unit that is capable of managing the tax system and
       enforcing the tax laws effectively.
      Keep the current system of presumptive taxation for the time being, but develop a
       modern tax system for the longer-term that introduces self-assessment, initially for
       large tax payers, and other taxes such as sales tax, and VAT.

2.25. Government has the opportunity to improve the tax base while also keeping the
tax morale high. By improving data collection, and by establishing a regulatory
environment that encourages formalization of economic flows, Government can enhance
information about the tax base and increase private participation in the tax system. By
generating more reliable information about the tax base, KRG can establish the medium-
term fiscal resources that will finance the Government’s program, including investments
in infrastructure.

2.26. A new tax policy needs to be sequenced as a reform package, and new revenues
should be accompanied by agreed improvements in services. Changes in the tax regime
should be matched with improvements in enforcement in order to avoid encouraging
informality and unequal tax avoidance. Cross-agency information sharing to ensure
enforcement should be facilitated by Government. Elements of the new tax regime should
be disseminated through an appropriate public information plan, as should agreements on
how to improve public services. A more reliable and steady flow of public revenue, more
evenly enforced across firms, will be an advantage not only to KRG, but to Iraq as a whole.

2.27. Public-private dialogue should be strengthened. KRG could facilitate private
sector participation in the tax and regulatory system in order to implement a pro-growth
policy. The private sector needs confidence measures from Government to be convinced
that participation in the tax system is worthwhile. To realize the mutual benefits of such an
accord, the Planning and Finance ministries could strengthen public-private dialogue that
can yield a broad-based and constructive agreement on better public services and higher
private sector compliance with formal systems.

  3.   STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS
  FOR SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE PRIVATE SECTOR-LED
                      GROWTH

3.1. KRI’s economy is suffering from severe structural weaknesses. The Government
is facing the challenge of delivering public services to the Kurdish people, Syrian refugees
and Iraqi IDPs amid a severe fiscal shock while fighting with ISIS. Excessive dependence
on oil sector makes KRI’s economy highly vulnerable to changes in international oil prices.
However, even before the regional conflict and fiscal crisis, KRI’s economy was already
suffering from structural economic issues such as a small non-oil sector, large public sector,
and a weak business environment. Addressing the current crisis with an immediate plan to
kick start growth and inspire confidence is the Government’s priority. The Government is
committed to address not only the current crisis, but also to lay the foundations to address
the long-standing structural policy weaknesses.

3.2. KRG should accelerate structural reforms to liberalize the economy, especially to
support reforms for easing business regulation and strengthening competition.
Accompanying measures that would help limit the adverse impact of fiscal consolidation
on the growth of the non-oil economy include deeper reforms to diversify the economy
away from oil, particularly by improving the business environment and banking sector,
creating incentives for private entrepreneurship, and increasing private sector employment.
The overall economic situation calls for efforts to stimulate development in non-oil sectors
of the economy. At the same time, social protection reforms will be conducted to protect
the most vulnerable.

3.3. Entrepreneurship and firm-level supports are essential to harness the benefits of
an enabling business environment. To maximize the benefits of an enabling business
environment, policies and interventions to promote entrepreneurship particularly for the
youth population and to enable existing firms to grow and create more jobs would be
essential. The younger generation needs to be exposed to entrepreneurship so that they do
not view public employment as the only viable option as they enter into the job market.
Similarly, existing firms need to improve their product and service quality so that they can
supply to new markets and thus can grow and create jobs. Hence firm-level support for
technology and product upgradation, improving managerial and business practices, and
accessing new markets would be also needed.

3.4. Supporting economic growth will require the acquisition of skills for private
sector-led development. The KRG has made progress in terms of school enrollment and
improving universities but there is a need to review the capacity and skill base of the young
and working age people which encompasses basic human competencies and organizational
skills. Improving workers skills is a fundamental source of economic and social progress.
Technology absorption requires a skilled labor force. In this context, ensuring that the
education system in KRI (from basic through post-secondary education) helps gear youth




                                             24
to meet labor market needs will be critical. Also, current public sector employees who will
search for jobs in the private sector will need re-training to acquire required skills.

                            A. FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM

3.5. The financial sector in the KRI is dominated by banks, however, private sector
credit remains low. There are 49 banks operating in Kurdistan consisting of 43 private
banks and six state-owned banks.
                                                  Figure 3.1: Credit to the Private Sector

percent. Such a low contribution Note: Data for KRI is an estimate for 2015. is the rest of the data
reflects the fact that banks in are for 2014.
Kurdistan are not engaged in their core function of providing loans to KRI’s real-sector
economy or financing long-term investment projects. In private banks, lending to the
private sector accounts for only 6 percent of total assets. The majority of bank assets are
sitting idle: about 60 percent of private banks’ total assets are in the form of cash and cash
equivalents. At the same time, the banking sector has a significant potential to contribute
to the development of KRI’s economy. As a simple yardstick, to bring the ratio of private
credit to GDP from a current 2 percent to the MENA region average of 50 percent, banks
would need to provide credit to the KRI private sector of ID 15 trillion (USD 13 billion).

Restoring liquidity in KRI’s banking sector

3.6. The banking system in the KRI is experiencing a severe liquidity crisis. This crisis
has resulted from multiple shocks that KRI has been subjected to since 2014. Facing
significant cash shortages, many private banks have restricted their customers from
withdrawing cash from their bank accounts. Most banks cannot facilitate transfer of money
within the KRI and between the KRI and the rest of Iraq. Bank lending to the private sector
has virtually stopped and private banks do not issue letters of credit or guarantee.

3.7. This liquidity crisis was caused by the Central Bank of Iraq’s (CBI) branches in
Erbil and Sulaymaniyah freezing current accounts that commercial banks have placed
with them. Banks’ cash reserves were further depleted by KRG-issued checks, which banks



                                                25
cashed to their customers but then were unable to exchange for cash at the CBI branches
in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah (as the latter have no cash to do so). KRG needs to restore
liquidity in the banking sector by having the CBI branches in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah
unfreeze commercial bank deposits and honor KRG-issued checks.

3.8. KRG needs to restore liquidity in the banking sector. KRG has removed billions
of dollars in cash deposits at Central Bank of Iraq’s (CBI) branches in KRI. This move has
led the CBI branches in Erbil and Sulaymaniah (the two CBI branches operating in KRI)
to freeze current accounts that commercial banks have with them. It is estimated that about
US$5 billion of bank deposits with the Central Bank in KRI have been affected.7 Banks’
cash reserves were further depleted by KRG-issued checks (estimated at US$1 billion),
which banks cashed to their customers but then were unable to exchange for cash at the
CBI branches in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah as the latter had no cash to do so. Restoring
liquidity in the banking sector by having the CBI branches in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah
unfreeze commercial bank deposits and honor KRG-issued checks needs to be addressed
to re-launch the banking system in KRI. It could be best addressed by the Government of
Iraq and Kurdistan Regional Government settling their disputes. In the absence of such
solution, effective options for restoring liquidity in the banking system are limited.

3.9. KRG needs to restore people’s trust in the banking system. Even prior to this crisis,
public confidence in the banking system was low and now it has severely deteriorated.
Building public trust is a long process and there is no quick solution to it. As a first step,
KRG needs to re-establish a stable macro-fiscal environment in the region. Second,
banking regulation and supervision in the KRI need to be restored to ensure good
governance. Third, KRG can link with the Government of Iraq in an ongoing effort to
establish a deposit insurance system that would safeguard people’s deposits with banks.

Addressing banking sector regulatory issues

3.10. The banking sector regulatory environment in the KRI is facing two fundamental
issues. First, the CBI branches in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah have been subordinated to the
control of KRG Ministry of Finance and Economy instead of being controlled by the CBI.
Second, public banks in the KRI are regulated by the KRG MoFE and operate without a
license from the CBI.

3.11. This situation poses a systemic risk for KRI’s banking sector. Banking regulation
and supervision fall under an exclusive authority of the Government of Iraq.8 With KRI’s
banking sector effectively cut off from the Central Bank of Iraq, the sector appears to be
going into an unregulated mode with no effective oversight from either Baghdad or Erbil.
To ensure good banking sector governance, the CBI branches in Erbil and Sulaymaniah
should be de-linked from KRG’s MoFE and restored as an integral part of the Central Bank.
This is a crucial step necessary to bring KRI’s banking system back into the functioning
mode with independent oversight and necessary regulation. Moreover, state-owned banks

  Official data on the amounts of private bank deposits frozen at the CBI branches in KRI is not available.

  According to Article 107 of the Iraqi Constitution.


                                                    26
operating in the KRI need to be de-linked from the oversight of KRG MoFE, brought under
the supervision by the Central Bank, and obtain a banking license from the Central Bank.

Improving banking sector competition

3.12. Private banks in the KRI operate on an uneven playing field compared to state-
owned banks. Until recently, legislation did not allow government agencies and state-
owned enterprises to hold deposits or current accounts in private banks. Nor could they
make salary payments through private banks. In addition, government agencies and state-
owned enterprises were not allowed to accept letters of credit or checks issued by private
banks.

3.13. This situation distorts competition in the banking sector and has а number of
negative consequences. First, private banks do not have access to important liquidity
sources, which KRG has effectively directed to state-owned banks, thus putting private
banks at a significant disadvantage. Second, as state-owned banks have had an exclusive
ability to service KRG, the efficiency of their services has not been checked by competition
from private banks. Third, since private banks do not have access to salary accounts of
KRG employees, they cannot assess their salary history and consequently, provide them
with loans, thus limiting their access to finance.

3.14. Recent changes proposed by the Government of Iraq have tried to make an equal
playing field for both, state-owned and private banks.9 However, the situation on the
ground has not changed. KRG authorities continue to direct all government agencies’ and
state-owned enterprises’ cash flow activities to state-owned banks. To address this issue,
KRG needs to enforce new regulation and demonstrate that both, state-owned banks and
private banks have equal access to serving government agencies and state-owned
enterprises. By doing so, KRG would not only promote an equal playing field for all banks
working in the region but would also set an example of promoting fair banking-sector
competition for the rest of Iraq.

Improving banking sector infrastructure

3.15. Credit information sharing services are an essential element of a banking sector
infrastructure necessary to facilitate financial market intermediation. When making a
decision on credit extension, banks vitally rely on information about creditworthiness of
prospective borrowers. Thus, the availability of well-functioning credit registries (which
house this information) can be directly linked to banks’ willingness to extend loans to
private sector players.

3.16. Presently, banks operating in the KRI have no ability to check a prospective
borrower’s credit history as there is no credit registry. The CBI has its credit registry but
it appears to be largely incomplete and non-functional. At the same time, the CBI (with

support from USAID) is currently working on regulations to introduce a credit registry in
Iraq. KRG should link up with the CBI to ensure credit registry coverage for Kurdistan.

                        B. AGRICULTURE SECTOR REFORM

3.17. KRG’s agricultural sector has been subjected to numerous shocks. First, the oil-
led expansion of employment at the public sector crowded out employment in the
agricultural (and other non-oil) sector(s). Agricultural wages increased sharply, from
US$5 per day in 2002 to more than US$30 per day during 2011-13. The agricultural sector
became uncompetitive, which combined with the currency appreciation (the so-called
“Dutch disease”) increased food commodity imports. Currently, 80 (20) percent of fruit
and vegetable consumption during the winter (summer) comes from imports, mostly from
Iran and Turkey.

3.18. Second, the agricultural sector has turned to mono-culture, that is, production of
wheat and (less so) barley. An estimated 90 percent of KRG’s agricultural output comes
from cereals. This expansion was a result of the high prices at which GoI was purchasing
wheat. During 2005 - 2012, the procurement price of wheat was above US$600/ton,
evaluated at current exchange rate, compared to the world price of US$200/ton. That is,
KRG wheat farmers received (at least, until recently) a multiple of the world price, even
under generous assumptions about transport costs. The GoI did not honor the agreed wheat
price. Only a portion of the 2014 purchases has been paid to the farmers and nothing for
the 2015 purchases.

3.19. Employment in agriculture sector is declining. At the national level, employment
in agriculture sector fell in absolute terms for both men and women between 2007 and
2012. While agriculture’s share in total employment in KRI fell from 25 percent of jobs
for women to 22 percent and from 8 percent to 7 percent among men; there was some
increase in agricultural employment in absolute terms (almost 9000 jobs for men and 5400
jobs for women). At the same time, the share of households with some diversification, i.e.,
with members employed in both agriculture and non-agriculture, increased in KRI; and this
group made welfare gains at the national level (with a halving of poverty among these types
of households).

3.20. Competitiveness is low. The collapse of the oil prices, from more than US$100/bbl
prior to mid-2014 to less US$50/bbl during 2016Q1 (and associated fiscal pressure), the
considerable decline in world grain commodity prices, the apparent discontinuation of high
wheat subsidies (which makes as much as half of wheat production uncompetitive at
current world prices), and the conflict surrounding the region (which makes exports to the
traditional destination of the Gulf countries much more expensive) present a number of
challenges.

3.21. But these are not the only challenges. Other challenges contributing to low
competitiveness include degraded soil quality, water pollution, availability and the decline
of the water table, low-productivity seeds, limited cold storage facilities, poor agricultural
logistics, and lack of knowledge. To increase the competitiveness of agriculture in order to
fully account for domestic consumption needs and also foster exports, the Government
should focus on following areas.

Sectoral transfers

3.22. Wheat program. It appears that the costly subsidies of wheat are coming to an end.
As a short term step, the wheat purchases already made should be honored at the agreed
price. As a medium term, the wheat (and barley) subsidies should be formally phased out,
to end the crowding out of resources for other higher valued commodities such as fruits,
vegetables, and animal products.

3.23. Input subsidies. There are various input subsidies (such as fertilizers, seeds,
chemicals, and fuel). At present, it is not clear how much they cost and who receives them.
Again, given the fiscal pressures, these subsidies should be discontinued.

Trade policies

3.24. Import bans. In order to protect locally produced food commodities, KRG imposes
import bans. Yet numerous market participants question their effectiveness while others
argue that they lead to corruption. The effect of such bans should be examined closely, and
if they are, indeed ineffective, they should be removed. If they are effective, they should
be rationalized.




                                                   29
3.25. Import duties. There are some import duties on numerous items, including
agricultural machinery. Private sector representatives report that the effect cost of a
medium-sized tractor, which costs about US$20,000 at the border, is subject to an
additional US$5,000 cost in due to import duties, and licenses. Such duties should be
eliminated. Any reduction in fiscal revenue could be balanced by the reduction in input
subsidies. Elimination and/or streamlining of import bans and import duties should be
coordinated with the GoI, since it affects both KRG and Iraq.

Farmer support

3.26. The objective of farmer support programs should be to diversify the crop base to
meet consumption demands and export potential, to raise crop yields to global standards,
to make farmland well-developed and sustainable, and to integrate farmers into a modern
food supply chain. For this, a number of farmer support initiatives are proposed.

3.27. Agricultural research. Currently, KRI research is undertaken by four research
centers. In the past, these centers were funded by FAO. A number of problems are faced
by the centers. First, they (or, at least, the one in Erbil) are engaged in numerous activities.
Second, they are underfunded. Third, their results do not reach producers. Fourth, release
of new varieties is subject to delays by the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture, which often takes
as much as two years to approve them. The research stations should form an independent
entity, thus reducing the bureaucratic delays. They should also narrow their focus and
prioritize their activities on research that is relevant to the production needs of Iraq in
general and KRG in particular. Such research should be undertaken in conjunction with
overall Iraq’s agricultural research capabilities. The research stations should also
collaborate with the Colleges of Agriculture as well as the MoAWR.

3.28. Extensions services. Extensions services are practically non-existent, which is why
research findings do not reach producers. To address these issues, the MoAWR should
reform its Department of Extension, Training and Research and collaborate with the
Research Stations and the Colleges of Agriculture, thus creating an effective education-
research-dissemination “triangle.” The Department should be responsible for training
extension agents, conducting crop research, and providing regular information to farmers.

3.29. MOAWR should review the current subsidy and crop insurance programs for
rationalization and rebalancing to meet world prices over a phased period.

3.30. To integrate farmers into a modern supply chain, MOAWR should upgrade
certification, infrastructure and technical support across the agricultural supply chain. This
should include establishing standards of good agricultural practices, and providing support
to the private sector to upgrade supply chains and to invest in land and agribusiness.

Sectoral and market information

3.31. Agricultural survey. The information on agriculture is very limited and of poor
quality, not surprisingly, since there is no recent agricultural survey in the region. A survey
should be undertaken soon, so the information on issues such as farm size, composition of


                                              30
labor, input used, price received for output and prices paid for inputs should become readily
available and subjected to research by the Universities.

3.32. Market information. Price information is currently limited. Prices collected by the
central vegetable markets (which are already compiled) should be collected on a daily basis
(currently they are weekly). These prices should made available to the public to ensure that
farmers, traders, importers, and government have all access to them. These data will also
be very useful for research purposes. Further, the MOAWR should collect data on agro-
climactic conditions, land, water, crop production and pricing, and animal husbandry
production. This should be accomplished through an initial baseline survey and ongoing
collection of market information. Currently, there is no Department of Agricultural
Economics in any of the four Agricultural Colleges. At least one of the colleges should
establish an Agricultural Economics Department whose research could focus on market
information for more informed policy making. This Department should collaborate closely
with the research stations and extension services.

Regulatory framework

3.33. The licensing requirements appear to be excessive and not always clear. In addition
to increasing the cost of production, these requirements induce corruption. The process
should be streamlined, and to the extent possible should be handled by one agency (a type
of “one-stop-shop”). The streamlining and cost rationalization of the licensing procedures
should be undertaken in coordination with the GoI.
3.34.

Food vouchers

Eliminating PDS could boost agriculture in the region, limit the distortions currently in
place in the market for staple foods, and provide better targeted assistance to the poor. This
could be accompanied by a transition to ‘smart cards’ linked to biometric identification
underpinned by a universal registry. This reform is already under discussion. There are
some global experiences that could be taken into consideration. For example, in late-2014,
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, previously known as the food
stamps program) in the US was changed to incorporate a similar initiative, the Food
Insecurity Nutrition Initiative. This initiative boosts the purchasing power of existing
SNAP or food stamps at farmers markets. If a SNAP recipient used US$10 of their benefits
at a farmers’ market to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables, they received US$20 worth of
produce. The US$10 gap is financed by the USDA and private donations, which benefit
both low income households and local, small farmers.

                     C. WATER SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT

3.35. Water shortages are becoming increasingly common. The sector is faced with
dwindling supplies due to smaller inflows into KRI and deteriorating water quality. Yet,
the demand for water from agriculture, households and industry (including for oil sector)
is increasing rapidly. In addition, water is needed for hydropower and environmental flows.
The increasing water shortages are likely to increase over time as upstream riparians are


                                             31
planning to develop more water infrastructure, making KRI and the rest of Iraq increasingly
vulnerable (in the absence of basin wide agreements for the Euphrates and Tigris river
basins). The fast increasing demand is partially the result of large inefficiencies in the use
of water resulting in high evaporation losses and network losses, whereas management
practices in agriculture and other water uses result in water logging, salinization and
pollution which is affecting the quality of the available water resources.

3.36. KRG’s vision for water security requires a broad spectrum of goals. Foremost is
to ensure a supply of water for the people that is adequate both in quantity and quality. In
order to foster this goal, specific actions must be taken internally outside transboundary
water issues: distributing and allocating water supplies based on demand management;
using technology to more efficiently use water such modern irrigation and on-demand
irrigation distribution systems; recycling water; more responsible management of
groundwater resources, mitigating droughts; promoting public private partnership; and
establishing ways to cooperate effectively with riparian neighbors. A strategy that
optimizes supply and demand across the full spectrum of water users is an integral
component to water security, as is consideration of hydrologic variability and droughts,
which amplify water scarcity issues. The institutions, policies, and practices that help
achieve water security simultaneously help protect and advance other essential areas like
human health, socioeconomic development, and ecosystem services.

3.37. To satisfy KRI’s future water needs, both supply-side and demand-side strategies
must be sought. Supply-side strategies include increasing the amount of freshwater
available through the improved use of existing and proposed dams, and implementing new
water allocation and reservoir operation strategies. Surface water and groundwater will
each be important contributors to the overall freshwater supply. Controlling the demand
for water is equally important to ensure that each sector is provided with a reliable supply
of water.

3.38. The nature of water use and associated problems varies greatly between the KRG
governorates. The policy mix for addressing gaps between supply and demand will depend
on a range of social, environmental, economic, and technical factors. Closing the gaps is
within KRG’s reach if it makes the necessary adjustments to include supply management
strategies into an integrated approach that also addresses demand-side issues. To encourage
a more sustainable use of water and to reap benefits of the large investments that have been
made in developing water resources, it is recommended that the government introduce
broad and poverty-targeted interventions affecting not only water resources development
and management but also water service delivery. Priority areas would be: (i) water security
planning and management; (ii) improving service delivery; and (iii) strengthening national
and local governance mechanisms and water users associations.

Priority 1: Water security planning and management

3.39. KRI’s water resources are characterized by significant inter- and intra-annual
variability, even not counting the effects of global climate change. There is also a limited
scope to increase storage capacity, and an increasing demand from domestic, industrial and



                                             32
agricultural sectors. Responses are constrained by lack of an integrated water policy.
Institutions for water resources planning and management need to be strengthened at the
central level, and the administration of water entitlements needs to be more transparent and
accountable at all levels. Achieving water security will require a critical look at the
resilience of existing and future infrastructure. It will also require measures on demand
management such as: i) pricing to reflect the scarcity value of the resources, coupled with
targeted subsidies to ensure the protection of the poor; ii) incentives for the reduction of
consumption in urban areas (metering, programs to decrease losses in water systems and
at household level); iii) improving efficiency in agricultural productivity; and iv)
investments to close the water cycle by the reuse of water.

3.40. Cooperation over shared water resources, both domestically and internationally,
is fundamental to the achievement of water security. Today, approximately 50 percent of
supply of surface water originates outside its borders and development upstream is
projected to significantly reduce the amount of water that reaches its borders between now
and 2035. Turkey and Iran are each pursuing independent plans that address their
respective socioeconomic development objectives through expansion of irrigated
agriculture, industrial activities, and energy generation. Construction of infrastructure in
support of these objectives has already had an impact on the hydrology and water quality
within the shared watersheds as dams and other water diversions have been constructed.
Ongoing development in the riparian states will continue to put pressure on KRG’s efforts
to achieve water security unless cooperative measures are taken. There is a need for
cooperation among Iraq (including KRG), Turkey, Syria, and Iran so that collective efforts
can be made to conserve water and introduce water efficiencies in the water consumption.

Priority 2: Improving water services including rural sanitation

3.41. Agriculture suffers from persistently low productivity. Years of investment have
marginally improved water efficiency, but overall productivity remains very low. In
addition, groundwater is over-abstracted, leading to falling water tables, and progressive
salinization of aquifers and farmland. Priority actions include modernization of irrigation
infrastructure and institutions; adoption of higher-value, water-efficient crops; improved
crop husbandry and post-harvest operations; delegation to local and farm-level
organizations; and a strategy of supply and demand management for groundwater
sustainability.

3.42. Water supply services are intermittent and there are high technical losses, and
lack of good management. The low tariffs render utilities dependent on state subsidies. A
widespread unregulated informal water sector meets extra demand, at high cost to the poor.
Wastewater treatment is limited. Investments in water supply and sanitation infrastructure
for service delivery are necessary. Also, service delivery institutions need to be reformed
to increase efficiency, reduce losses, and recover costs through public-private partnerships.

3.43. In recent years there has been less improvement in productivity, and water
availability for irrigation is increasingly constrained. The Government has long led the
expansion of irrigation, but performance has been suboptimal, and reforms have not yet



                                             33
been introduced to improve efficiency and water service. Faced with this challenge, the
irrigation sector has been wrestling with three deep-seated problems: low water use
efficiency, a high reliance on government financing, and poor standards of management
and maintenance. Much of the search for improved investment and institutional models in
irrigation and drainage has been driven by the need to resolve these three problems.

Priority 3: Strengthening governance mechanisms

3.44. Service providers should be given incentives to perform efficiently. One solution
that has been tested over the last two decades has been participatory irrigation management
involving the Water Users Associations (WUA) in the financing and management of
schemes. This solution had its logical culmination in the irrigation management transfer,
the handover of responsibility for scheme operation and maintenance (O&M) to farmers
and their organizations. This solution promises to relieve the government of both the fiscal
burden and the responsibility for asset management and maintenance and to improve
efficiency by empowering farmers. However, efficiency has risen only marginally, and
there are many schemes in which O&M is beyond farmers’ capacity—for example, the
management of headworks and major distribution systems. In addition, major irrigation
investments are often simply beyond the financial capacity of farmers.

3.45. Public Private Partnership (PPP) concept could be one way of bringing in
efficient management skills and fresh funds and relieving government of fiscal and
administrative burdens. A number of PPP arrangements show that investment,
operation/maintenance and management are the key functions for private sector
involvement. The key point is that the objective is improved efficiency—timely and less
expensive water service responsive to farmers’ needs. It is important to design the most
appropriate institutional setup. Given that the private sector is demonstrably efficient in
many of the functions in irrigation, it is likely that in many cases a PPP arrangement would
in fact be optimal. However, a third-party service provider could be public (for example, a
reformed and financially autonomous government agency) or private (for example, a
private irrigation service provider looking for business or a WUA turning into a private
corporation).

                                    Box 3.1: Lessons Learned
Global experience demonstrates the requirements to build water—and therefore state—resilience.
Water scarce countries, such as Australia, Singapore, India, United States, and Chile, have
demonstrated that with appropriate political will, water vulnerability can be transformed into water
resiliency. The common lessons learned are:

Integrate Communities: More rapid delivery programs with strong citizen engagement to close the
water supply and sanitation and irrigation service gaps, particularly in poor, peri-urban and rural
areas.

Build Secure Water Services: Introduce integrated urban water management and agricultural water
productivity systems which simultaneously address sustainability of water services and water
resources (institutions and infrastructure).



                                                34
Introduce Technology and Tariffs for Water: Establish progressive pricing and quantitative controls
to drive allocation and development and adoption of innovative technologies (including solar
desalination, wastewater reuse, drip irrigation) to address water shortages at lowest possible cost
through both incremental supplies and demand management.

Expand international water management agreements: Establish multi-country technical platforms
for information exchange, analysis and dialogue in support of political agreements on shared water
resources, along with enhanced water resource monitoring and modeling capacity.

Water Resources

3.46. Based on average annual rainfall, the Region is divided into three area: assured
rainfall area (over 500 mm); semi assured rainfall area (350-500mm); and un-assured
rainfall area (less than 350 mm. The growing demand will have to be satisfied from a shared
resource, since the region is both in an upstream and downstream position: 50% of the
surface water resources originate from the upstream neighbors, Turkey and Iran. On the
other hand, water resources management also directly affects downstream water
availability in central Iraq. Both climate change and increased water use by the upstream
neighbors are likely to have negative impacts on the availability of surface water resources.
To cope with these challenges—growing demand, sharing of water resources and a
decrease of the available resources—there is a strong case for having trans-boundary
agreement to share and jointly manage water resources. Water scarcity is increasing and is
a binding constraint on the economic and social development.

Surface Water Resources

3.47. Surface water is an important source of water. It is in the form of rivers and springs.
Water resources are largely associated with the quantity of rainwater and snow falling on
main water basins and with the policy of operating dams and water reservoirs built
upstream the shared rivers in Turkey and Iran. The absence of international water sharing
agreements among these states results in instability of available water resources from one
year to another. It is expected that more water shortages and reduced water quality are
expected to occur in the future, after Turkey and Iran completion of its irrigation projects.
These two states seek to cultivate about one million hectares, with water fed from the Tigris
water basin. Consequently, the Tigris flowing into Kurdistan Region and Central Iraq will
experience more water flows reduction.

Springs

3.48. Springs are traditionally the main source of water supply (both irrigation and
drinking water) in Kurdistan’s mountainous regions.

Groundwater Resources

3.49. Groundwater is one of the most used water resources. It is the major resource for
drinking water, irrigation and for other urban and rural life uses. Statistical results for 2006
indicate that total number of exploited wells was about 19,448 wells, of which 79 percent


                                                35
were used for drinking, 18 percent used in agriculture, and the rest were exploited for
industrial, and agricultural extension and research purposes.

Water Demand

3.50. The present beneficial use of all water resources is about 3 billion m3, out of
available water resources of 6.5 billion m3.

Oil Fields

3.51. Conservative estimates of development of the oil sector indicate that oil production
will increase. As oil production increases, the demand for water to support the industry will
increase as well (it takes 1. 5 barrel of water to produce one barrel of oil). Accounting for
potential water losses along the water distribution network, the gross water demand for the
oil sector will increase. Gross water demand for refineries is projected to increase as well.
In a water-scarce future there is no justification to use freshwater to support oil production.

Dams

3.52. There are three large dams (Derbendi Khan, Dokan and Dohuk). High variability
of the climate and hydrological regime differences of the hydrogeological characteristics
and the presence of karst phenomena cause major variations of unit flows and many other
hydrological parameters. Storage of winter flows would secure more water for the several
usages in summer (irrigation, drinking water, industry, tourism and hydropower). The
policy is to increase storage capacity in Kurdistan region by building small (ponds) and
large dams.

Dam Safety

3.53. Though dams are believed to be in good conditions and there is some inspection for
major dams, there is no systematic inspection for dams to ensure their safety and there is
no program for dam safety. An independent unit needs to be established for this purpose.
It is recommended that for each dam an emergency preparedness plan be prepared.

3.54. Water supply and sanitation systems were already facing challenges prior to the
crisis in providing continuous service to the KRI population. The proportion of the
population using improved access to water is above 90 percent. The quality of service,
however, in terms of continuity of access and water pressure, remains poor. The water
consumption in KRI is estimated to range between 373 and 400 liters per capita per day.
This remains very high relative to the median water consumption of middle-income
countries of about 162 liters per capita per day. The high consumption is largely explained
by over-design of the system which is further aggravated by modest prices.10 Furthermore,
the cost recovery of operations and maintenance (O&M) is only 4.4 percent.

3.55. The sharp increase in access to water supply services has not been accompanied
by similar investments in wastewater infrastructure. Sanitation remains a major concern,
most notably in IDP camps. The major gaps relate to physical facilities, namely the lack of
wastewater treatment plants and sewerage collection networks, except in the Sulaymaniyah
Governorate where the capital city and a few municipalities have storm water networks.
This lack of sanitation increases public health risks and environmental pollution. On the
water supply side, the use of groundwater11 has resulted in lowering of the water table,
which results in higher costs to treat and pump the water. Furthermore, there is a significant
gap between the rural and urban areas in terms of population with access to improved water
sources and sanitation facilities.

3.56. Cost efficiency in service delivery. Water and wastewater authorities do not cover
their operation and maintenance costs through their revenues, hence compromising their
financial viability. Non-revenue water is thought to be high although no reliable data are
available as most households do not have meters. Yet, the fact that the majority of the
households complain about insufficient supplies suggests that despite the high design
standards, a significant part of the water produced does not reach consumers. Another
source of inefficiency is over-employment. Reducing these inefficiencies in operating costs
can generate large benefits in the long run. Yet, as long as tariffs remain very low and
authorities can rely on operating transfers, the incentives of government agencies to strive
for efficiency are minimal. Changing these incentives—including by amongst others
improving billing and collection efficiencies and also increasing water and wastewater
tariffs for all users—will be critical.

3.57. Before making any changes to the tariffs, utilities should first address their low
billing and collection efficiencies. Fixing the gaps in the billing systems will generate
additional revenue while it reduces the pressure to increase tariffs to ensure the
sustainability of the water supply service. It will also make the water and sewer directorates
less dependent on government funds to operate and maintain their systems while providing
consumers with more incentives to use water and wastewater services more efficiently
Affordability is not a very critical issue right now in the Iraqi context. The majority of
households do not pay for their water and wastewater services.



11
  The estimated use of wells is estimated at 35 percent in Erbil city center and 40 percent outside the city. In
Sulaymaniyah, in the city it is 2 percent while it reaches 70 percent outside the city; and in Dohuk it is 2
percent in the city and 40 percent outside the city.


                                                      37
                                    Box 3.2: Smart Meters
KRG could conserve significant amounts of water by using advanced technologies for water
metering. “Smart meters,” which measure consumption and relay the information to a central body
for monitoring and pricing, can help Government authorities see how much water is being used and
where, and serve as the foundation for enforcing a more robust water tariff. The UAE, which has
one of the highest rates of water consumption in the world, is about from having all of Abu Dhabi
covered by smart meters and reforming water tariffs based on the metering scheme.

Lack of revenue flows

3.58. This will require better billing and collection practices, more customer awareness
on the cost of the service and the need to use water more conservatively and slow steps in
the direction of customers paying more cost-reflective tariffs, and the explicit formulation
of subsidy policies. Institutional changes that provide utilities with more autonomy, but
that will require large reforms internally. For now, there could be an intermediate step of
ring-fencing water and wastewater operations in the directorate to move to more autonomy
and accountability.

Irrigation

3.59. Land use in most areas is dominated by rain-fed agriculture with little water
requirements. One of the bottlenecks identified for the development of agriculture is the
poor irrigation system, limited in coverage and technology. The level of irrigation use is
far lower now than in the past, and considerable potential exists for increased use of
irrigation to support production of high value crops. In KRG irrigation is considered
essential on three accounts: (a) to minimize climatic risks; (b) to ensure quality of products
essential to commercial agriculture; and (c) to provide adequate incomes and living
standards in the rural areas. For fruit and vegetables, irrigation is essential for quality and
timely production, besides increasing yields substantially. It is expected that, with
irrigation, small farmers would move to more high-value crops and specialized markets,
and away from near subsistence agriculture.

3.60. Approximately 150,000 ha are irrigated. Modern irrigation methods (sprinkler and
drip irrigation) are still at their early stage of implementation.

3.61. The present consumption of water in the agriculture sector is high, and the current
overall irrigation efficiency is low. Immediate water conservation measures has to be
implemented in the agriculture sector to ensure that sufficient water is available to support
all water users.

3.62. Crop production is the major source of income for 75 percent of farmers, while the
rest depend on livestock cultivation. Grains, primarily wheat and barley, are KRI’s main
crops. Animal husbandry is practiced extensively and backyard chicken raising are a
valuable source of protein and income for rural populations.




                                               38
3.63. The agricultural sector consumes 77 percent overall water resources. As a result,
when a drought occurs, agriculture is among the hardest hit. For example, in 2008 and
2009, drought damaged almost 40 percent of Iraq’s cropland, and Ninewa and Erbil
experienced damage to over 50 percent of their cropland. Compounding the threats of
drought, the cultivated land requiring irrigation for wheat alone has expanded by 33 percent
between 2000 and 2010.

Droughts management

3.64. In the last 10 years there was frequent occurrence of droughts in the region which
affected agricultural production as well as availability of water resources and caused more
overdrafts of groundwater aquifers. This may also contribute to the migration from the
rural areas to the urban centers.

Subsidies

3.65. Since there are no charges for irrigation water, all operation and maintenance
(O&M) cost for small and large irrigation schemes can be considered as a subsidy. The
annual subsidy amount for that can be as estimated as about US$3 million (US$20/ha X
150,000 ha irrigated). In addition, there is a subsidy for pumping of groundwater because
farmers do not pay irrigation water charges and other users do not pay the actual O&M
cost. This definitely results in having no incentive for water saving and is one of the major
causes of overdraft in the groundwater aquifers. Also, the above subsidy does not include
the salaries of the irrigation department staff that works on O&M which can be added to
this cost.

Institutions

3.66. The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources is the bulk water supplier and is
responsible for the water planning, operating dams, hydropower stations and irrigation
schemes. There are two general directorates that deal with water resources and dams: the
General Directorate of Water Resources and the General Directorate of Large Dams. The
General Directorates of Water Resources has several departments: Departments of Studies
and Design, Department of Irrigation Projects, Department of Groundwater and
Department of Small Dams (ponds). The total number of staff in that directorate is as
follows:

     General Directorate of Water Resources. Total number of employees is 1,585 out of
      that a total of about 686 staff are technical staff (engineers, geologists, agriculturists )
     General Directorate of Large Dams. Total number of employees is 110 out of that there
      are 50 engineers and 15 geologists, and 7 agriculturists, while there are also about 650
      employees in the governorates.

Water sector reform

3.67. So far, little efforts to reform the water sector have been carried out except for
drafting a new water law. The new law will include clear statements about the need to
develop water resources in an environmentally sustainable way including the impact of
climate change, promote users participation and include also the two universal principals
for water use: users of water should pay and polluters of water should pay.

                              Box 3.3: New Models for Service Delivery
Transfer of O&M activities to an independent company through a contract process has been used
in Vietnam with some success in the North of the country where Irrigation Management Agencies
(IMAs) sign seasonal contracts with Village Cooperatives. With World Bank financial support,
China and Turkey has adopted a similar approach known as Self-Irrigation and Drainage Districts
consist in the creation of financially autonomous Water Supply Corporations (WSCs) which sell
bulk water to Water User Associations. This new model has proven to be much more effective in
providing services and properly maintained infrastructure than conventional government irrigation
and drainage management. One of the main reasons for the adoption of that model has been the
fragmentation of irrigation management in the past based on administrative limits of townships,
counties, and prefectures leading to inefficient and uncoordinated management.

Groundwater management

3.68. Statistical results indicate that total number of exploited wells was about 19,448
wells, of which 79 percent were used for drinking, 18 percent used in agriculture, and the
rest were exploited for industrial, and agricultural extension and research purposes. It is to
be noted that the above number of wells at present is higher because of the continuous
drilling, the continuous issue of licenses and the illegal drilling of wells. The groundwater


                                                        40
resource has undergone severe depletion as illustrated by the serious drop in the ground
water table and the increase in soil salinity levels. Under these circumstances, the majority
of the population has resorted to digging privately owned/used shallow ground water wells
inside their dwellings, which poses serious health risks as the water extracted is highly
contaminated groundwater and would need to be properly treated before it can be safely
used domestically.

Research and capacity building

3.69. Continuing research and advancement in technology shall be promoted to address
issues in the water sector in a scientific manner. Innovations in water resources sector
should be encouraged, recognized and awarded. It is necessary to give adequate grants to
the update technology, design practices, planning and management practices, preparation
of annual water balances and accounts for the site and basin, preparation of hydrologic
balances for water systems, benchmarking and performance evaluation. It needs to be
recognized that the field practices in the water sector in advanced countries have been
revolutionized by advances in information technology and analytical capabilities. A re-
training and quality improvement program for water planners and managers at all levels in
KRG, both in private and public sectors, needs to be undertaken. The goal would be
therefore to provide a platform to build knowledge, capacity and a network of professionals
and practitioners in KRG, across a range of priority areas that might include:

      Sustainable water resources management policy, planning, institutions and
       incentives.
      Integrated urban water management (IUWM) including non-traditional water.
      Agricultural water productivity.
      Groundwater management.
      Closing water service gaps for the poor and for displaced populations.

Reliable and comprehensive water security indicators

3.70. Proper water resources management relies heavily on the availability of accurate
spatial and temporal information to provide the essential basis for sound management
decisions. Groundwater monitoring is of fundamental importance, especially when
groundwater resources are threatened by over-exploitation and quality deterioration.
Constant and accurate monitoring of water quality, water levels and water extraction in an
aquifer is a sine qua non of successful water management. No steps have been taken to
determine the following water security indicators:

      Water security plans including diversity of water supply for major cities such
       Dohuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah.
      Interdependence - Share of renewable resources from transboundary aquifer or
       river.
      Groundwater health – aquifer recharge rate relative to average annual withdrawals.
      Efficiency of agricultural water – water productivity in terms of GDP generated per
       cubic meter.


                                             41
      Inclusiveness - Service gap for sanitation.
      Health - Share of urban and industrial water treated.
      Financial sustainability - Weighted average of urban and agricultural water tariffs
       as percent of O&M costs.

                            D. SERVICES SECTOR REFORM

3.71. Services and services trade could play an important role in the growth and
development of the KRI, including to support its economic diversification efforts. Services
are essential inputs in any form of production, as well as a major component of the region’s
connectivity, hence a key determinant of KRI’s competitiveness and ability to join and
move up domestic, regional and global value chains. Services could also become an
important source of exports outside the oil and gas sector, along models in the region, and
provide jobs outside the public sector. For example, GCC countries have heavily invested
in services sectors such as retail and wholesale trade, tourism and hospitality, finance and
construction, which should contribute to more than 60 percent of their GDP growth and
jobs creations (McKinsey, 2015). Specific examples include the financial sector in Bahrain,
airlines and logistics in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, tourism in Dubai.

3.72. As a landlocked region of Iraq, the KRI is even more relying on services; this
situation could be turned into an opportunity. KRI has the potential to become a platform
for transit and services provision in the country and region, given that it shares borders
with large potential markets. In particular, services cross borders more easily than goods,
and the KRI could become a safe gateway for the provision of a large array of services in
other regions of Iraq, as well as abroad, from tourism to back office or professional services
outsourcing. This will require, however, that the KRI first removes a number of barriers to
services trade that remain in place. Provided that services trade mainly takes place at the
intermediary level and within global networks, protecting “infant” services industries
would have the opposite effect of that desired and exclude them from global trade flows.
In the services sector, given the importance of reputation and skills, one needs to become
importer first to benefit from intra-network transfers of all kinds (capital, knowledge,
know-how, technology) and build a reputation. It will also require (i) restoring some legal
certainty and security; (ii) adapting laws and regulations that are often more than 30 years
old and outdated; and (iii) building capacity (skills, standards and infrastructure).

3.73. Beyond the economic dimension, the reform of the regulatory framework and the
improvement of the services supply in the KRI will first and foremost benefit the overall
Iraqi population, given that major gaps exist, for example in the health or education
sectors, that result in Iraqi nationals seeking locally-unavailable services abroad—with
extra costs for both those consumers and the state (e.g., when medical procedures that are
not locally available must be sought abroad and the expense reimbursed).

3.74. Given the fiscal situation, the KRG will not be able to harness this challenge
alone: fostering foreign investment, encouraging private sector initiatives, and promoting
PPPs will be essential components of any policy aimed at developing a competitive
services sector. Private sector services companies in the KRI have been so far excessively



                                             42
focused on public procurement, caught in a vicious circle with delays in governmental
payments that resulted in an incapacity to invest and develop their capacities; these firms
have also been excessively opportunistic with a focus on higher short-term returns (e.g.,
boom in real estate) and no long-term vision and investment—only an opening and scaling
up of services firms will allow a concentration and specialization of the firms to reach
critical size and become competitive on global markets. Furthermore, these firms have been
excessively inward looking and did not explore the opportunities offered by foreign
markets.

3.75. In a number of services sectors, the KRG has drafted strategic plans in the early
2010s, which have not been implemented. In the tourism sector, for example, initiatives
have been launched, but the conflict has hampered short-term prospects for successful
development. This time off could be used to prioritize the reforms and focus on medium to
long-term investments, such as infrastructure, skills, or the quality of the tourism offer. The
oil and gas sector could also be used as a stepping-stone for diversification: local sourcing
and workforce development programs are in the pipeline and could help upgrading
domestic services and developing a competitive sector with some export potential. Health
services are also typically lagging, in spite of huge needs, both locally (e.g., oncology in
the southern regions of Iraq) and in the region. A holistic approach could be adopted that
links upgrading in the services (from clinics to laboratories) as well as the pharmaceutical
industry (generics). From professional services to retail, opportunities exist and need to be
better exploited, but require the state to play an incubator role.

A source of exports and economic diversification

3.76. Services trade, whether embedded in goods or stand-alone, represents an
important diversification, upgrading and growth potential that has remained largely
untapped. Iraq, along with many other MENA countries, remains too dependent on the
export of raw materials (oil and gas), confined at the bottom of the productivity chain when
emerging countries moved up the value chain (Müller-Jentsch, 2005). As illustrated below,
Iraq was an outlier in terms of services trade contribution to GDP in the region, with a
contribution in percentage half that of the MENA Region (16 percent), the Arab world (14
percent), and even fragile and conflict affected countries (13 percent). The margin for
growth is therefore important, and the KRI could be the front runner and driver of this
strategy.

The KRI will need to remove constraints to become an exporter of services

3.77. In Iraq, and even more so in the KRI, many restrictions remain in services sector.
GCC countries have heavily invested in services sectors such as retail and wholesale trade,
tourism and hospitality, finance and construction, and rely on services to contribute to the
essential of their GDP growth and jobs creations. Iraq (including the KRI) should follow
this path and some of the premises of this strategic move are already observed with an early
boom in real estate/construction and tourism/hospitality prior to the crisis. In KRI, some
restrictions remain on the establishment and practice of foreign professionals that should
be removed to unleash the potential of this sector and create local jobs and growth. These
include:

       In all professions: legal uncertainty (sometime conflicting requirements from
        different authorities, e.g., for tax exemptions or reporting schedules, or rules
        regulating the professions that may vary across Iraqi regions), nationality
        requirements, equivalence for diplomas, residency requirements for visas
       In the accounting/auditing sector: restrictions on the performance of audits by
        foreign firms and professionals (need signature of local auditor)—only advisory
        services; use of old accounting standards (need for double reporting that is costly
        for companies)
       in the legal sector: registration of foreign firms

3.78. Typically, in the KRI, international professional services firms help foreign
investors with their activities and relations with the government and tax authorities
(more than 90 percent of the clientele of the firms interviewed). While some of the firms
started with foreign staff only, they have progressively substituted expatriates with local
graduates (for example, Deloitte went from 100 percent foreign staff in 2011 to 36 percent
today). Most of them have a regional footprint with offices in Jordan, Dubai, and Lebanon.


                                                  44
Services development responds to the KRI’s specific needs in its difficult geo-political
context

3.79. The services sector offers greater perspectives for private sector employment than
any other sector, in particular for women and the youth. According to RAND (2014), the
KRI could expect the following three sectors to employ a substantial share of the workforce
and have above-average employment growth compared to the rest of the economy: (1)
construction; (2) transport, storage, and communications; and (3) wholesale and retail
trade. In OECD countries, services represent 75 percent of the jobs (with the highest level
of employment in the services sector for the 15-29 age group). Given the potential of
tourism in the KRI, it is important to note that the hospitality sector is the main source of
“first jobs” for low-skilled workers. The development of ICT services is a common factor
of increase of youth employment. With regards gender issues, two services sectors alone
(communication services and retail/hotels/restaurants) represent more than half of the jobs
held by women (52 percent compared to 33 percent of jobs held by men) (World Bank,
2011). The 2012 World Development Report (World Bank, 2011) suggested that increases
in female employment levels (but not male) between 1995 and 2005 were correlated with
increases in international trade and new opportunities in the services sector. In particular,
the report stressed that new ICT-enabled jobs in services (e.g., information processing in
banking, insurance, printing and publishing, and call-centers) were mainly taken up by
women, and that teleworking offered new opportunities for men and women to better
combine family and professional lives. In the KRI, the female participation to labor force
between the age of 35-44 is below 20 percent, compared to more than 90 percent for men
(RAND, 2014).

3.80. Services trade integration strategies could include spatial (regional) planning as
a policy objective. In Morocco, for instance, the Atlantic coast with the economic and
administrative capitals has traditionally been the economic driver of the country; it is the
objective of an ambitious spatial planning policy—backed by services trade integration
projects—to develop new growth poles: Tanger-Tétouan and Fès-Meknès as trade
platforms respectively with Europe and the Maghreb, Marrakesh and Agadir for tourism,
Ouarzazate for solar power (Ministère des Affaires Etrangères, 2006). Larger scale projects
(such as cross-border transport, energy and telecommunications networks) could allow the
construction of adequate infrastructure and the development of efficient and competitive
services available to a larger share of the population. Services trade, under all four modes,
could be used to serve spatial planning objectives. Tourism and transports, energy projects,
as well as construction and retail will be key to the harmonious development of the KRI.

3.81. Efficient services are needed to connect the region to the rest of the world. KRI
has a proximity to large markets that are in important need for services delivery. The KRI
could become a platform for transit and services provision in the region. In addition, the
KRI offers a safer environment than other regions in Iraq or neighboring countries. Thus,
it could become a safe gateway to Iraq and other fragile states in the region: services trade
is particularly suited to this type of remote provision. Due to problems with the transit of
persons in the region, however, the KRI will heavily rely on new technologies and



                                             45
telecommunications in particular—for take-off of trade under modes 2 (e.g., tourism) and
4, notable changes in visa procedures will be required.

Services trade as a source of economic diversification: looking beyond the borders

3.82. Efforts need to be made by the KRG to diversify the economy. This would entail
the setting-up of an export promotion agency, and the creation of incentives and export
support schemes, in particular for SMEs that facilitate access to credit or other financial
instruments. Dubai is used by many in the literature as a model for the region in terms of
diversification and use of services towards this end. However, a recent IMF report pointed
that “replicating the same model to create financial, trade, tourism, transportation, and
logistics hubs in a limited geographic region may be difficult for the whole country (UAE)
and its Gulf neighbors” (Callen et al., 2014). The KRI will have to compete with a number
of players in the region trying to diversify into the services sector. Lebanon, Jordan and
Turkey are also contenders. While some services are resource-specific, such as tourism,
competition in other services that can be delivered remotely will be based on quality and
price (including reputation and skills). A SWOT analysis has to be conducted in the
different services sectors to identify the potential of the KRI and inform its policy
decisions. In some sectors, like professional services, IT-enabled services, health, where
competition is regional or global, niches could be identified: in particular, language and
cultural affinities might help building a comparative advantage in some niches (e.g.,
development of content in Kurdish language, cultural/historical and religious tourism).

Promoting private sector and long-term initiatives

3.83. The excessive dependence on public procurement/spending drowns the region
into a vicious circle: the absence of payments of public orders results in cash flow
problems, which in turn affect the firms’ capacity to invest and become competitive.
Services firms that are not competitive cannot tap into new markets and increase their
dependency on public orders.

              Figure 3.4: Vicious Circle: Dependency on Public Sector

                               Incapacity to        Dependence

                                 clientele          procurement




                               Incapacity to
                                invest and          Absence of
                               become more          cash flows
                               comptetitive



3.84. Private sector development in the KRI is still at the embryonic stage. A small
number of conglomerates—often family-owned—have activities in a wide array of sectors.
This is somewhat characteristic of emerging economies, in particular in the MENA region.


                                               46
There are very few companies that are specialized in one services sub-sector only. Very
often, the entry in new services sub-sectors is motivated by quick returns on investment:
for example, the construction sector has boomed in the early 2010s but the prices have
since collapsed and many projects abandoned. Given the political situation in the region,
security services have, in turn, mushroomed. The challenge will be to turn short-term
business opportunism into long-term investments and capacity building—even more so in
a resource-rich country whose objective should be to maximize long-term returns.

3.85. Connection to international major services networks will have to play a major
role in KRG’s strategy. However, a number of vested interests remain and there is a diffuse
protectionist inclination (e.g., the idea that nascent industries or sectors should be
protected). For example in professional services, such as legal services, foreign nationals
or firms still face a number of barriers that should be removed. It is an essential condition
for the KRI’s economy to move from a model of family-owned business model to a
competitive and scaled-up services industry.

The role of the state as incubator

3.86. The state is excessively paternalistic, although some progress has been observed.
For instance, in the standards and conformity assessment, the government delegated its
powers to private companies—which is a good move towards greater efficiency.
Outsourcing and privatization of government functions should be encouraged (RAND,
2014). With regard private sector initiative, the State should play the role of an incubator
rather than a contractor or competitor.

3.87. Given the excessive number of civil servants, an issue to tackle would be the
conversion of public into private sector jobs. Some obsolete and non-competitive
industries are still run by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and should be updated and
privatized or abandoned with appropriate reconversion plans. A reconversion scheme
could be put in place as part of the public sector downsizing efforts (government and state-
owned enterprises) to help workers transition from public to private jobs. A number of
recommendations towards this end are made in RAND (2014) that include financial
severance packages (voluntary and involuntary separation programs), training and job
matching programs.

3.88. In addition, the Government could put in place structures aimed at facilitating
business and encouraging entrepreneurship. A number of key business climate issues
remain in the KRI that should be addressed (see RAND, 2014).

3.89. Start-up costs are lower in services that are mainly SMEs, and therefore
represent a serious hope for diversification and reduced reliance on the public sector .
For example, in the transition countries of Eastern and Central Europe, the SME sector has
been the largest creator of new jobs and the vast majority of these new enterprises were
small businesses. The Government of Iraq adopted for 2014-2020 a Private Sector
Development Strategy, which included a pillar on SME development. A number of
schemes exist to promote entrepreneurship and SMEs. In Kuwait, for example, where 95



                                             47
percent of national workers are public servants, and more than 90 percent of GDP is
generated by oil revenues, the government established a National Fund for SME
Development that is intended to build an inclusive, collaborative, and innovative ecosystem
for entrepreneurs. The SME Fund is due to finance up to 80 percent of capital for feasible
small and medium projects submitted by Kuwaiti nationals. Other incentives include the
creation of a business-friendly environment for SMEs and an entrepreneurship culture
development.

3.90. There is a need to develop greater synergy between the public and private sectors,
for instance in the context of public-private partnerships (PPPs) that could be further
developed. Among others, the IFC has been playing an advisory role as the KRG has
moved to expand and formalize PPP use in the KRI. The KRG intends to expand the use
of PPPs to accelerate the development of the region’s infrastructure and to improve the
provision of services for the region’s inhabitants. In line with recommendations from the
IFC, the KRG has been examining the experiences of Turkey, India, and Jordan in PPP
implementation and has been working to develop a specific law to regulate all forms of
PPP activity. In association with the Ministry of Planning, the World Bank Group has been
providing support to the KRG to develop a proper legal framework for PPPs that is tailored
to the Region’s needs and inspired by relevant best practices, success stories and
international guidelines (Lipson, Ismail Ali and Ala Al-Kazzaz, 2014). Furthermore, IFC
has arranged a US$375 million financing package for an energy sector project which will
provide electricity to millions of people In Iraq—particularly in the KRI, where a migrant
crisis has strained power infrastructure.

3.91. The government has made efforts to promote foreign investment, for instance
through the Board of Investment. The spillover effects of these investments could be
maximized through a legal framework encouraging technology and knowledge transfers.
In a number of services sectors, cooperation with foreign firms has helped building local
capacity and developing competitive services. For example, the Zagros Group developed
wind and solar energy projects with a German company, oil and gas product development
with a US company; Awamedica developed local pharmaceutical capacities with Swedish
management model and recent partnerships with European firms; STER Group developed
its competence in security services with a US company, and in building engineering with
a Dutch group. These partnerships and transfers of all kinds (not only financial, but
knowledge, know-how, technologies) should be encouraged through a more secure legal
environment for investors.

Reducing legal uncertainty and modernizing the laws

3.92. A recurrent complaint in the private sector is legal uncertainty. For instance, there
is uncertainty about exemptions that might be granted by one ministry and then denied by
another; uncertainty about taxes, rules on liquidity transfers; standards applied across Iraq
and the KRI governorates. The Investment Law, while revised in 2009, still needs
improvement. According to State Department (2015), “In the KRI, the KRG adopted a
Consumer Protection Law through its passage of Law Number 9 of 2010. In the KRI,
investors sometimes find it challenging to de-conflict seemingly opposing regulations from



                                             48
relevant stakeholder ministries and investment entities. The emergence of new regulations
with little advance notice, as well as requirements related to investment guarantees, have
also slowed projects. While the KRI does not stipulate that a local partner is necessary to
acquire an investment license, government officials sometimes encourage this practice.”

3.93. In many areas, laws have been inherited from the old regime and are obsolete.
Iraq (including KRI) would need to upgrade the laws and regulations of many services
sectors to meet international standards. The duality of standards and controls represent
important additional costs for business. This is the case for instance in the
accounting/auditing sector where old standards are applied and international firms applying
the IFRS are facing double reporting costs. The KRG is lagging behind the central
government in moving to these new standards. With regards standards and conformity
assessment, much progress has been made with the intervention of private companies;
however, a number of controls are still carried out by the administration (list of goods); in
addition, on food, obsolete regulations affect the development of the distribution/retail
sector, with a residual competence of the Ministry of Health, and a lack of harmonization
across Iraq and KRI governorates—for example, inspection requirements and the
regulation of expiration dates do not match international standards, raising the cost of
assessment.

3.94. The result of these obsolete regulations is the need to outsource/import services ,
for instance in the health sector (a central plan for accreditation of the health institutions
was adopted but not implemented, and clinics in Turkey benefit from a large inflow of KRI
patients looking for higher quality treatment), and certification or professional services
(laboratories in Turkey and Gulf countries). In the distribution sector, the obsolescence of
the laws result in smaller scale distribution/retail and higher prices with lesser quality for
consumers. Better regulation would result in greater services development opportunities in
the KRI and, eventually, services exports.

Building capacity

3.95. The KRI is facing a number of capacity problems in the services sector that need
to be remedied: these include both infrastructure and skills. This is the case for
certification, for example, where new laboratories would be needed and staff trained. This
could be done in partnership with the private sector. Similarly, in the health sector,
equipment is either outdated or new but not operational due to a lack of expertise among
medical staff. Investment in infrastructure stopped in 2015 as a result of the fiscal crisis,
while the KRG was still trying to upgrade health centers. The Kurdistan Medical Control
Agency has developed its capacities in 2013 but still needs additional experience and
upgraded facilities.

3.96. Related is the issue of skills and their availability. Curriculums should be adjusted
to meet the needs of modern services. This is the case for example in the health sector,
tourism, transports, or professional services. Some private initiatives have emerged, in
cooperation with foreign companies or universities, to upgrade the KRI’s education supply.
This is the case for instance in the health sector where the University of Kurdistan in Erbil



                                             49
has developed a joint program and curriculum with the University of Graz in Austria to
update the training of local graduates. The country is still lacking a number of specialists,
for instance in intensive care or oncology (PET scans have to be done abroad in spite of
existing machines in Erbil).

3.97. Participation to global services networks could contribute to the upgrading of
both hard and soft components of services competitiveness with a number of transfers
made within networks (technology, knowledge, and know-how). For example, in the
accounting sector, the “big four” that established in the KRI progressively substituted
foreign accountants with local graduates and trained them abroad to have them qualified in
international standards.

The movement of people

3.98. The movement of people is essential to the development of services: either the
consumer (so-called Mode 2 in GATS terms—for example tourism) or the service provider
(so-called Mode 4 in GATS terms—for example when a lawyer accompanies her client
abroad) might have to cross the border for the transaction to take place.

3.99. The current political situation and the refugee crisis affect the fluidity of cross
border movements of people, including within Iraq. Some private firms reported
additional costs associated with the difficulty to obtain visas. The recent refugee crisis has
exacerbated these problems, for instance with the removal of visa exemptions for Turkey.
Given the number of services transactions taking place between the KRI and Turkey (for
example for medical treatment abroad, construction or professional services), trade in
services is likely to be severely affected. On the other hand, since the KRI is a net importer
of most services, the new Turkish visa policy might contribute to reduce this deficit, for
example for patients willing to be treated in Turkey who will now seek treatment in the
KRI. This creates even more a sense of urgency with regards the need for local services
upgrading.

                                   E. TOURISM SECTOR

3.100. The KRI is well located next to important potential tourism markets: Turkey, Iran,
and other regions in Iraq. It can be reached by land or by air, with two international airports
in Erbil and Sulaimaniyah and 26 airlines flying to/from KRI. Its main assets are its
unspoiled mountain scenery and ancient archeological sites. Its cultural heritage is
important, ranging from music to arts and crafts, clothing, textiles, rugs, etc. The religious
tourism sector has also developed, attracting a number of tourists from around the world
(the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Affairs estimated at 1 million the number of
tourists who visited Islamic, Christian, Yezidi and Kakai sites at the tourism peak time).
The region also counts facilities for ski and hiking.




                                              50
The assets: A strong potential

3.101. Considered as the oldest inhabited citadel in the world, and estimated to be at
least 7,000 years old, the Erbil citadel has been placed on the UNESCO’s list of World
Heritage Sites in 2014. It is the only one of the four Iraqi sites that is not on the danger
list. The Citadel is a protected site under the legislation of Iraq and of the Kurdistan Region.
The authority in charge of its revitalization efforts, the High Commission for Erbil Citadel
Revitalization (HCECR), is working in a strategic partnership with UNESCO and other
agencies to conserve and rehabilitate the Citadel through programs of physical
improvements within the framework of detailed studies and plans that have been the basis
for the Conservation and Rehabilitation Master Plan for Erbil Citadel.

3.102. Often, the tourism potential of the KRI is not sufficiently exploited. For example,
little knows about the battlefield of Gaugamela that opposed Alexander and Darius and
changed the course of history. Many of the sites are hard to reach and lack the infrastructure
(access and hospitality, other services) necessary for the development of tourism. Tourists
are largely left on their own with too rare organized tours or excursions. The region is not
part of package tours that would attract tourists on a larger scale. Thus, the tourism potential
is largely untapped.

The current situation: A severe crisis with no signs of short-term recovery

3.103. Number of tourists are declining due to the regional conflict. Tourism in the KRI
has boomed at the beginning of the 2010s, reaching a peak-high of 3 million visitors in
2013. However, the war with ISIS that started in 2014 resulted in a dramatic drop in tourist
arrivals: -48 percent in 2014 and -27 percent in 2015.

3.104. Tourist arrivals from outside the region (Iraqi) have been most affected by the
conflict, with their number dropping from almost 2 million in 2013 to 753,000 in 2015.
Their share of total arrivals remained unchanged, however. By contrast, the share of foreign
tourists has been reduced by half, almost, from 19 percent to 11 percent, with their number
dropping from 559,000 to 120,000. Foreign tourist arrivals are now essentially limited to
business visitors, NGOs and international organizations or foreign officials.

3.105. Erbil remains the most visited region of the KRI, representing two-thirds of the
tourist arrivals. It was the region less affected by the crisis, benefiting from local tourism
in particular. By contrast, the Dohuk region has seen the number of its visitors divided by
more than 6 in two years.

3.106. Recent restrictions on visas (March 2016—as part of Turkey’s commitments vis-
à-vis the European Union to deal with the refugee crisis) are likely to increase the
problem of tourist arrivals, in particular in the Dohuk region where Turkish nationals
represent the bulk of visitors. Restrictions on the movement of people between KRI and
other governorates of Iraq have also dried out the main source of tourists in KRI (two thirds
are out of the region tourists).

3.107. This situation (combined with the drop in oil prices and the slowing down of
investments in the field) has resulted in a number of tourism projects being postponed .
In Erbil, the main international chains had plans to build luxury hotels. These included
Starwood (USA, two properties), The Address (Dubai), Marriott (USA), Radisson Blu
(USA), Kempinsky (Germany), Accor Sofitel (France), Grand Hyatt (USA). Constructions
and programs are now on hold or abandoned.

Development plans and reforms engaged

3.108. 2014 should have witnessed the consecration of Erbil as the Arab tourism capital,
with 4 million expected tourists, providing stability and security in a distressed region.
Previously, in 2013, the Ministry of Municipalities and Tourism, General Board of
Tourism, had adopted a Tourism Strategic Plan based on the following axes:

      The development of the administrative structure of tourism for sustainable tourism
       development management. The focus would be on structural requirements for
       sector development, including the strengthening of policy development, planning,
       marketing, media, and communication strategies. Also there is a need for the private
       sector to participate.
      The development of tourism sites and products. This includes the identification of
       tourism assets and promising sites for tourism and the development of tourism


                                                53
       products on the basis of groups (zones/clusters) in every Governorate. Assets
       include natural sites; from mountains, lakes, caves archaeological sites recreational
       areas, historical heritage and provincial centers.
      The improvement of quality in the tourism sector and its competitiveness. This
       includes the development of mechanisms for the overall quality and the adoption
       of international standards in tourism facilities and products. Additionally there is a
       need to encourage private sector organizations to develop and implement a quality
       management system.
      The development of tourism brand strategy. The tourism brand is the expression
       and competitive identity of the region. It is central to all marketing communication
       tools, and should be based on market research studies.
      The preparation of a tourism marketing strategy. This includes strategic
       positioning and mechanisms for communication, media, and education. The
       channels of communication include traditional and modern tools required to create
       an image of the activities and events geared to the target markets.
      The development of tourism education. This includes the development of tourism
       education and training based on current situation, programs and curricula
       development, educational institutions empowerment, and program identification.
      The state's role in the development and support of the tourism sector. This includes
       the role of government to enhance the attractiveness of tourism investment. By
       supporting the sector development via regulatory framework, legislation and
       programs to increase the attractiveness of tourism projects to investors and to create
       investment incentives.
      The environment impact and waste management. This includes guidelines for
       tourism institutions on proper waste management methods to reduce the impact of
       their activities on the natural environment.
      The development of infrastructure. This includes components for infrastructure
       development of road and transport networks, airports, electricity, water and
       communications in support of the region's economy and the tourism sector.
      The development and modernization of legislation, laws and regulations for
       tourism. This includes the preparation and development of legislation, laws and
       regulations that will support and strengthen the tourism sector with a focus on
       standards contributing to the development of projects, institutions and tourism
       facilities for investment, and environment quality management to sustain
       competitiveness.

3.109. Due to the crisis, the implementation of the Tourism Strategic Plan has been
delayed. The KRG has been very active in initiating parts of the strategic plan, including
the development of the Board of Tourism, the deployment of marketing efforts, data
collection, the establishment of a training center, and support to the private sector.
However, this could not counteract the effects of the crisis.

3.110. In parallel, the World Bank commissioned Roland Berger Strategy Consultants
to conduct a Rapid Tourism Assessment Scoping in the KRI (2014) that was organized
around three work streams and set of recommendations:



                                            54
       The first work stream promoted the concept for an enhanced operating license
        regime for travel agencies and tour operators that are key players in the tourism
        sector. It stressed that the legal framework as well as the process to obtain an
        operating license in this market segment posed a number of challenges in the KRI.

       The second work stream proposed a scheme for a quality certificate to be granted
        by the Board of Tourism in various segments of the tourism sector with a view to
        improve the overall quality of tourism companies and thereby to create a positive
        effect on the development of the tourism industry as a whole.

       The third work stream provided an overview of current regulatory constraints for
        private sector investments that are essential for the development and growth of the
        tourism industry (see table below). Given the horizontal nature of most of these
        measures, the table summarizes major challenges faced by the private sector.

                                  Clarification of land ownership and (re-)designation of land can be
                                   problematic.

Recommendations

3.111. In spite of the crisis, the Tourism Strategic Plan and the Roland Berger exercise
remain a useful tool and guidance for the KRG to develop its tourism potential . The
Government should therefore pursue its efforts to implement this plan. However, given the
political context, priorities should be reviewed. In particular, foreign tourists are unlikely
to visit areas close to regional conflict. Tourism within Iraq or with neighboring countries
will be affected by two adverse effects: the KRI will remain attractive as long as it will feel
safer than the rest of the country or region; on the other hand, restrictions on the movement
of people (due to the war and the refugee crisis) will continue to hamper the local/regional
tourism that represents the bulk of tourist arrivals in the KRI.

3.112. It remains, that the best prospects, in the short term, are probably for tourism
within Iraq (due to the relative stability and safety of the KRI compared to the rest of Iraq),
and efforts to promote tourism in the region should resume in Baghdad. The focus of
promotional activities led by the Board of Tourism should shift accordingly.

3.113. While tourism could play a major role in the diversification of the KRI’s
economy, the current crisis does not offer immediate prospects for recovery. The KRG


                                                    56
should therefore concentrate its efforts on long-term actions and investments, rather than
short-term marketing and branding strategies. These long-term efforts include the
development of tourism sites and products, infrastructure, education and quality. Programs
could be developed accordingly.

3.114. This should be done in partnership with the private sector, although investors
seem to have deserted the tourism industry in the region. Partnerships are essential, in
particular, to improve transport connections, the referencing of Kurdistan Region in major
tour operators’ catalogue, and the supply of hospitality services. Partnerships with
international organizations and the civil society should contribute to the rehabilitation of
major tourist sites, as illustrated by the work done in partnership with UNESCO at the Erbil
citadel. Infrastructure, education and the legal framework remain the prime responsibility
of the KRG (potentially in partnership with donors). Private initiatives could be encouraged
to develop a local supply of satellite services (guided tours, transports, arts and crafts,
restaurants and hospitality).

3.115. The KRG has started to invest in the elaboration of tourism statistics. These
efforts should be pursued, in particular with the objective of analyzing the tourism spending
in the region. The Tourism Satellite Account allows the measurement of the direct and
indirect economic impact of tourism and the design of tailored strategies to increase
tourism receipts. Technical assistance should be put in place to help the KRG adopt these
statistical methods.

                            F. ENERGY SECTOR REFORMS

3.116. The energy sector (oil, natural gas and power) is KRG’s most significant
economic sector. Oil accounts for more than half of GDP, whilst the gas and electricity
sectors contribute significantly to economic growth, job creation and the quality of life for
the Kurdish people. Securing the provision of reliable and efficient electricity supply in the
long-run is key for increasing private sector productivity, job creation and sustained
growth. The challenges that KRG faces in its energy sector are not only physical in nature
and economic and financial; they are also legal and regulatory and, more significantly,
policy and institutional—including the need to re-build and re-enforce institutions and their
technical and management capacity. These challenges are hampering effective strategic
management of the sector as well as planning, development and operation of its physical
infrastructure.

3.117. KRG’s energy sector, including electricity has suffered from decades of conflict
and sanctions that have left its institutions weakened and have resulted in chronic under-
investment and deterioration in infrastructure. This situation improved considerably
between 2005 and 2013 as the KRG adopted proactive policies and encouraged the private
sector to invest in oil and gas exploration and production (E&P), petroleum refining, and
independent power generation projects (IPPs), all of which saw tremendous investment in
these sectors. However, such successes were not followed up with sector reform and were,
in any case, set back when the current financial crisis commenced in 2014 affecting KRG’s
ability to pay its suppliers which slowed down private investment.



                                             57
3.118. Energy subsidies are becoming unaffordable. Most of the Government subsidies
for energy are used for purchase of liquid fuel, as the domestic gas sector is still not
producing enough gas to feed the power stations. It is now evident that improved electricity
pricing policies, which reflect market prices, are essential. For example, the economic
losses in the electricity sector are estimated around US$2.1 billion representing 80 percent
of the economic subsidies in KRG. The subsidies have become unsustainable with the
decrease on fiscal revenues, and increased defense spending.

Electricity Sector

3.119. Electricity sector remains vertically integrated, even as extensive private sector
participation has been achieved in power generation. The electricity sector is currently
under the jurisdiction of the KRG Ministry of Electricity (MoE). The Ministry operates as
a vertically integrated (generation, transmission and distribution) electric utility with three
distribution directorates in Erbil, Dohuk and Sulaymaniyah. The MoE currently directly
owns all transmission and distribution facilities, all the hydroelectric power plants and a
few older and very small thermal generation peaking plants. Over the last decade, the KRG
has successfully expanded installed power generation capacity through Independent Power
Producers. Installed generation capacity has expanded from lower than 500 MW in 2007
to higher than 5000 MW in 2015, and more than 90 percent of the generation capacity is
now owned and operated by the private sector.

3.120. Prevailing fiscal crisis is affecting the rapid expansion of generation capacity.
More than 97 percent of the generation capacity in KRI is owned and operated by
independent power producers (IPPs). With a series of IPP generation projects queued up
over the next few years, MoE had intended to increase the generation capacity from about
5000 MW in 2015 to more than 9,000 MW by 2020. However, given the impact of the
fiscal crisis since 2014 on both KRG investment budget and the appetite from foreign
investors, most new power generation projects have been put on hold or cancelled, with
only one additional IPP at Zakho expected to start construction in the near to medium-term.

3.121. Meanwhile, electricity demand in KRI is growing at a high rate. Electricity
demand has been growing at a double digit rate in the recent years and is expected to
continue growing at a rate of between 9 and 11 percent per year. This extraordinary high
electricity generation demand growth is not only a reflection of economic development and
the impact of absorbing 1.8 million IDPs and refugees, but is also due to high system losses
and low end-user revenue collections.

3.122. Despite rapid expansion in connections, there is a significant fall in supply
duration. Since 2007, there has been a rapid expansion in the connection of households to
the public electricity grid. Meanwhile, despite rapid generation capacity addition, supply
duration has been deteriorating such that 93 percent of households receive electricity for
more than 12 hours now, while it was as high as 22 hours prior to the refugee crisis. This
is in sharp contrast with the rest of Iraq, especially Baghdad, where more than three-
quarters of all receive less than 8 hours of electricity a day.



                                              58
3.123. The electricity sector’s challenges require policy and structural reforms. Poor
operational efficiency, high levels of electricity theft, and outdated network equipment of
the distribution sector are main contributors to the high distribution losses. Deficient
metering, billing and revenue collection processes are main contributors to the high
distribution losses. This is exacerbated by highly subsidized and low tariffs leading to not
only the sector’s poor financial performance but also the failure to improve the quality and
reliability of the electricity service. Improvements in power supply reliability and
availability would need to be complemented with improved revenue management systems
and non-technical loss reduction approaches. This would not only help reduce the sector’s
fiscal burden but also in turn would lay a foundation for electricity efficiency use as the
tariffs are regularly increased. Although technical losses reduction involves the use of
power systems planning and modeling tools and embarking on the related investments,
global experience suggests that non-technical losses are highly correlated with poor
management practices rather than ownership. Critical conditions for success in sustainable
reduction of losses in electricity distribution include: accountability, ownership through
participation, and enhancement of social development and equity principles.

                           Table 3.4: Electricity Sector Challenges in KRI
  Sector Challenge                                              Description
 Excessive losses         Total losses (technical and non-technical) are on the order of 30-50 percent, with
                          the estimate varying according to the source. This means that up to half of the
                          electricity generated does not translate to revenues, with dire consequences for
                          the KRG to recover its costs from the sector.
 High                     KRG MoE’s total annual operating costs (fuel and generation and other power
 generation cost          purchase agreement costs plus MoE operational budget) reached nearly US$3.5
                          billion in 2015.12 The main driver of these costs has been an over-reliance on
                          liquid fuels (e.g., diesel, light and heavy fuel oil) due to delays in developing
                          KRI’s natural gas resources at all levels, including extraction, processing and
                          pipeline infrastructure. Liquid fuels are roughly six times more costly than
                          natural gas (18 cents vs. 3.2 cents) and run at a much lower efficiency and output
                          factor.13 Approximately US$2.5 billion per year of excess cost was spent on
                          liquid fuels by 2015 prompting an MoE strategic shift in 2016 away from plants
                          without access to gas to those that have gas available
 Low efficiency           The existing fleet of IPPs were built using small, low efficiency ‘E -class’ turbine
 generation               technology in open cycle configuration (OCGT), which is very fuel-intensive
                          (32-34 percent efficient) compared to the newer, larger ‘F’ and ‘H -class’ fuel-
                          efficient turbines (38-42 percent efficient in OCGT increasing to 58-62 percent
                          efficiency in combined cycle (CCGT)). The KRG is gradually addressing this by
                          encouraging conversion of existing OCGT IPPs to CCGT (Erbil and
                          Sulaymaniyah) which will increase their efficiency to about 51-53 percent and
                          entering new power purchase agreeements which specify the larger, more
                          efficient ‘F-class’ technology (Zakho).
 Unsustainable            The total annual fiscal cost of the electricity sector excluding investment is about
 fiscal subsidies         US$3.25 billion (US$3.5 billion of total costs less US$250 million in revenue) at
                          present. This represents about 25 percent of the entire KRG budget.

 Inadequate             According to Ministry of Planning, less than US$200 million was budgeted in
 investment             2015 to finance critical investments in transmission and distribution. As a result
                        of delayed investments, the high voltage transmission grid could become
                        saturated and pose a bottleneck in delivery of available electricity. 14

                        could face the prospect of paying capacity charges under the growing number of
                        power purchase agreement contracts with IPPs.16

                        transmission and distribution grids is not achieved.

Electricity Sector Reform Objectives

3.124. The KRG MoE’s long-term goal is to address the electricity sector challenges in
a comprehensive manner in order to ensure adequate supply to meet the present and future
demand of all consumers across KRG at a competitive, fiscally sustainable cost. The long-
term goal would be attained through four immediate objectives:

    Contain fiscal burden of subsidies and losses;
    Improve electricity service delivery for consumers;
    Secure necessary investment for the transmission and distribution sector; and
    Step-away from government ownership of sector functions.

3.125. A strategy based on three pillars is proposed to address the immediate as well as
longer term challenges in the KRI’s power sector. The three pillars are as follows:

        Adopt an enabling legal, policy and regulatory framework based on clear roles
         and mandates with regard to policy, regulation, grid expansion, load dispatch,
         single buyer, generation, distribution, fuel provision, electricity trading, and energy
         efficiency. The framework would include a new electricity law, an independent
         sector regulator, unbundling of the vertically integrated sector, corporatization of
         sector entities and their eventual privatization. The Government would continue to
         shoulder the responsibility for policy and governance, apart from some crucial
         functions such as sector planning, investment approvals, international trading, load
         dispatch, and market oversight. The transition from a vertically integrated sector
         structure to a more distributed structure would require a step-by-step approach. This
         would include accounting and administrative separation of various businesses,
         establishment of a regulatory cell, and selective private sector participation (under
         regulation by contract) in the first phase. In a subsequent phase, the businesses can
         be carved out as separate corporatized entities, and finally out-up for full
         privatization.

   Obstacles include: (i) war damage to the Kirkuk-Mosul 400 kV line which prevents exports to the rest of
Iraq; and (ii) the lack of an international standard grid code which will prevent exports (e.g., from Zakho
IPP) to Turkey.

        Undertake crucial infrastructure investments to ensure adequate power
         availability, reliability and reduction of losses. Given the constrained fiscal
         situation, it is imminent that private sector resource induction would be required in
         all segments of the electricity sector. Private sector investments in high voltage
         transmission lines could strengthen connectivity across KRI, facilitating transfer of
         cheaper power from second stage of combined-cycle power plants. Further, high
         voltage networks can facilitate the evacuation of surplus power to the rest of Iraq
         as well as to neighboring Turkey. Electricity trade with neighboring areas would be
         crucially important in ensuring revenues from utilization of the excess generation
         capacity in face to fixed capacity charges. Indeed, the attractiveness of investments
         in electricity transmission (as well as gas pipelines) is likely to be significantly
         enhanced through trade agreements with neighboring areas. However, private
         sector investments in transmission and distribution need to be undertaken carefully
         to ensure that current sector performance attracts adequate private sector interest,
         as well as sufficient ramp-up in institutional capacity and legal-policy-regulatory
         framework to manage a complex ecosystem.

        Undertake measures to support performance improvements and accountability.
         This would include a systematic rationalization of electricity tariffs as well as a
         focused program for loss reduction and revenue enhancement. Based on a detailed
         assessment of commercial losses, the Government should develop a loss reduction
         and revenue enhancement program focused on consumer segments and geographies
         that account for the largest share of losses. While full privatization of the
         distribution business is a complex undertaking, loss reduction and revenue
         enhancement can be achieved through a well-structured contract with the private
         sector to manage billing and collection services.

3.126. The World Bank has initiated a Technical Assistance program to support the
KRG in the reform and performance improvement efforts over the near term, and lay the
foundations for the reforms and investments in the subsequent periods.18 Table 3.5
summarizes the prioritized energy sector reform options.

            Table 3.5: Electricity Sector Reforms and Performance Improvement
 1. Legal, Policy and Regulatory Framework
 High Priority: to be done in near term (1-2 years) and on-going
 Sector Structure: Conduct expert consultations to outline a new sector structure, including
 clarification of roles and mandates with regard to policy, regulation, grid expansion, load
 dispatch, single buyer, generation, distribution, fuel provision, electricity trading, energy
 efficiency, and demand side management.
 Electricity Law: Develop a draft electricity law and conduct consultations with relevant
 stakeholders. Present it to the parliament for legislation.


18
  The World Bank technical assistance program includes the following studies: (i) Tariff Rationalization and
Subsidy Reduction Strategy; (ii) Strategic Communication Exercise; (iii) Pathways for Private Sector
Participation in Transmission; and (iv) Pathways for Distribution Strengthening, Loss Reduction and
Revenue Enhancement.


                                                    61
Regulatory Cell within MoE: Establish and ring-fence a regulatory cell within MoE as a
precursor to an independent sector regulator. Develop tariff determination models and provide
training to regulatory cell members.
Ring-fenced Sector Functions: Within the existing structure, ring-fence generation,
transmission, distribution, trading and fuel supply businesses to function nominally as separate
entities. Segregate their assets, functions and manpower, structure transactions between them,
and foster separate energy and financial accountability for each.
Medium Priority: to be done in the medium term (3-5 years)
Independent Sector Regulator: Based on the statutes of a new Electricity Act, establish an
independent sector regulator. The regulator would develop regulations for tariff, performance,
and competitive bidding processes.
Corporatization of Sector Entities: Establish generation, transmission, distribution, trading and
holding entities as separate corporate bodies registered under the companies act. Establish their
board of governors, management as well as performance accountability mechanisms. These
corporatized entities may be privatized at a suitable stage.
Lower Priority: Reforms to be done in longer term (5-7 years)
Full Privatization of Sector Entities: Privatize sector entities after the legal and regulatory
frameworks have been promulgated, electricity markets have been established, and entities have
been corporatized.
2. Infrastructure Strengthening
High priority: to be initiated in near term (1-2 years) and on-going
(Implementation of activities likely to continue into the medium term)
Natural Gas Availability: Enhance the availability of natural gas and eliminate the use of diesel
for power generation. Resolve outstanding disputes in the gas sector.
Gas Pipeline: Design and initiate construction of a gas pipeline parallel to the existing oil
pipeline to connect gas fields in Central KRI with power plants in Eastern KRI.
Private Sector Participation in High Voltage Transmission: Enable private sector participation
in development of high voltage transmission networks. This would also enable adequate
transmission of nearly 4000 MW of additional capacity.
Private Sector Participation in Distribution: Explore private sector participation options to
attract investments as well as to improve commercial performance of the distribution business.
While full privatization may be difficult, initially billing and collection services could be
outsourced under robust contracts as a first step.
3. Performance Improvement and Accountability
High priority: to be initiated in near term (1-2 years) and on-going
(Implementation of activities likely to continue into the medium term)
Tariff Rationalization Pathway: Develop and implement a multi-year pathway and a strategy
for tariff rationalization. The approach could start with improved supply and cost-covering tariffs
for high-end commercial and industrial consumers.
Loss Reduction Plan: Design and implement a loss reduction plan. Based on a detailed
assessment of commercial losses, develop a loss reduction and revenue enhancement program
focused on consumer segments and geographies that account of the largest share of losses.
Medium Priority: to be done in the medium term (3-5 years)
Policy and Program for Demand-Side Management: Develop and implement a clear policy and
a program for energy efficiency, energy conservation, renewable energy, and demand side
management.

Natural Gas

3.127. Potentials are high for natural gas production. The KRG MNR estimates that KRI
could hold as much as 200 tcf (5.6 tcm) of natural gas reserves.19 The main discovered
fields that can contribute to production are Khor Mor, Kurdamir, Topkhana, Bina Bawi,
Miran and Chemchemal. Khor Mor is currently used for local gas supply to power stations
in Bazian and Erbil, while the goal for Kurdamir and Tophana fields is to deliver gas for
export and local use in addition to Bina Bawi and Miran. Chemchemal is not yet developed.
All of these developments are taking place in partnership with international operators.
There is also potential for production from yet-to-be-discovered fields.

3.128. Long-term production projections are optimistic. The IEA projects that KRG gas
production could reach 20-29 bcma by 2035.20 This would represent about a seven times
increase of current production. Although this can be an excessively optimistic scenario,
there are major opportunities for expanding gas production. Current gas production in the
KRI amounts to 3-4 bcma and is entirely for domestic use. Miran and Bina Bawi, the KRI’s
two largest discovered gas fields, could together produce 11 bcma, while Kirkuk and
Khurmala could add 2.5 bcma and 2 bcma, respectively, if currently flared gas is captured.
The expansion of Khor Mor could also add 5 bcma while Chemchemal could produce 6
bcma if a resolution of the dispute with Dana Gas is reached.

3.129. The KRG has set gas utilization priorities that emphasize satisfying domestic
needs for power generation and industry before moving on to possible exports . As a top
priority, the KRG plans to replace diesel and other liquid fuels with gas in all the KRI’s
power plants within the next two to three years. The first step in this direction was the 2013
signing of a landmark gas sales agreement with DNO (Norway) and its partner, Genel
Energy (Anglo-Turkish) covering supply from the Summail gas field to the Dohuk Power
Station. However, although the field was connected to the IPP in 2014 through a gas
pipeline that was built for this purpose, it was no longer capable of supplying sufficient gas
quantities due to inaccurate calculation of reserves. The pipeline, nonetheless, will be
incorporated into the future gas pipeline from central and south KRI to Turkey, and will
supply gas to Dohuk and Zakho IPPs as well.

3.130. Domestic gas demand will be influenced by different factors. Converting the IPPs
to combined-cycle operation will reduce gas demand growth for power generation.
Industrial use is expected to grow, primarily for cement industry. There is also room for
developing a gas grid for residential and commercial use in the future covering the major
cities. However, given the relatively small population and the geographical location, which
may be unattractive to large scale gas-based industries, the domestic market is likely to
remain modest.

3.131. With respect to future gas exports, Turkey is an important market for the KRI.
Turkey’s rapidly growing economy requires significant quantities of gas, which currently
represents one third of its primary energy consumption. Turkey’s Ministry of Energy and
Natural Resources estimates that between 2013 and 2023, the country’s demand for natural

                                                    63
gas will rise from approximately 45 bcma to nearly 70 bcma. The KRI intends to export 10
bcma to Turkey by 2019-2020 and to double the export to 20 bcma by the early 2020s.
This is expected to be through building a gas pipeline that will run parallel to an existing
oil pipeline, both of which were the result of an agreement that the KRG and Turkey
reached in 2013. However, the final plans and costs for the gas pipeline project have not
yet been finalized, and the current European gas price decline would affect the economics.
If agreement is successful, initial export volumes to Turkey are expected to be anchored
on development of KRI’s two largest discovered gas fields, Bina Bawi (7 tcf) and Miran
(4 tcf). Exports from these fields can potentially begin in 2018, commencing at 4 bcma and
ramping up to 10 bcma. The KRG could also export gas to federal Iraq given its geographic
proximity and the current high-priced gas import deal it has with Iran. Alternatively, the
KRG could increase its power generation and export electricity to federal Iraq and/or
Turkey.

3.132. To effectively manage natural gas opportunities, it is important to establish
proper conditions for attracting investments; advance natural gas production and improve
policy, legal and regulatory framework including pricing; develop gas infrastructure
including pipeline and end-user infrastructure; advance effective contractual and
commercial framework for future projects; and enable market conditions that provide
sufficient security/collateral to the O&G developers to allow them to secure financing/raise
funding for the necessary infrastructure. Growth markets for natural gas and derivative
products should be identified, including: domestic power generation; industrial use;
petrochemical use (such as fertilizer and ammonia); and other application.

Upstream Oil

3.133. Recently, KRG has experienced the two extremes of a boom-bust cycle. When the
KRG opened up exploration acreage to foreign investors in 2006, investor appetite was
strong, buoyed by optimistic estimates of undiscovered hydrocarbon potential, high oil
prices, and improvements in the political and security environment. Early drilling results
were positive, particularly for the first-mover companies that had taken the most promising
acreage. Large amounts of development capital flowed into the sector, and several projects
began commercial production. Field development plans by the various operators pointed
towards potential production levels of more than one million barrels per day. Over the last
two years, however, the business environment facing international oil companies (IOCs)
in Kurdistan has deteriorated across almost all fronts. Disappointing drilling and
production results have been encountered on some high-potential projects. Oil prices,
which exceeded US$100 per barrel for almost four years, have dropped to less than half
that level since late 2014. And IOCs have not been getting paid for much of their current
oil production because of the fiscal crisis. As a result, several IOCs have withdrawn from
KRI, and most of those that remain are deferring investments until commercial conditions
improve.

3.134. Nevertheless, despite deteriorating commercial conditions, there are still some
bright spots in KRI’s oil and gas sector. All of the large currently-producing oil fields
have further significant upside production potential. In addition, development of the 11 tcf
Bina Bawi and Miran gas fields will bring about improvements in fuel supply for domestic


                                            64
power generation and open up a significant new revenue stream in the form of gas exports
to Turkey. Between 2006 and 2013, the KRG entered into production sharing contracts
(PSCs) covering more than 50 exploration blocks. These blocks comprise almost the
entirety of the KRI. Twenty-eight IOCs participated. Early on, most participants were
small-capitalization, frontier exploration companies such as Genel Energy, DNO, Gulf
Keystone, Western Zagros, and Oryx Petroleum. Later on, major oil companies such as
ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Total also took exploration blocks. Following the award of
PSCs, exploration and development activity accelerated rapidly. From 2005 to 2013, oil
companies drilled over 160 wells, and total upstream capital investment —drilling plus
facilities construction—was an estimated US$4.5 billion (Wood Mackenzie).

3.135. Oil production in the region has increased very rapidly, growing from less than
10,000 barrels per day in 2008 to over 500,000 barrels per day in 2015 (Figure 3.8). The
majority of current production comes from three projects: the Khurmala Dome field,
operated by Kurdish company KAR Energy, the Taq Taq field, operated by Genel Energy,
and the Tawke field, operated by DNO. Total commercial reserves in the region are
estimated at 5.3 billion barrels (Wood Mackenzie).

3.136. The Kurdistan Crude Pipeline (KCPL), completed in late 2013, is the principal
export corridor for oil produced in the region (Map 3.2). The KCPL carries oil produced
from Khurmala Dome, Taq Taq, Tawke and the other KRG-administered fields plus the
NOC-operated fields in Kirkuk to the Turkish border at Fishkhabour, from where the oil
flows through the BOTAŞ-operated pipeline to the oil terminal and storage facility at
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea. For 2015, KCPL throughput has averaged 560,000
barrels per day, of which 413,000 barrels per day came from KRG-administered fields and




                                                 65
147,000 barrels per day came from the Kirkuk fields.21 The pipeline has a capacity of
around 700,000 but is being expanded to reach a capacity of 1 million barrels per day. 22
The SOMO-operated Iraq-Turkey pipeline is affected by damages caused by militant
activity.

3.137. KRI’s oil sector liabilities are mounting. The KRG entered into a number of pre-
paid oil sales contracts with oil trading companies. However, with the fall in global oil
prices and with a growing discount paid for KRI oil, the amount of oil delivered to the
trading companies at Ceyhan fell far short of the amount needed to repay the advances. As
a result, the KRG has accumulated debts with the trading companies totaling an estimated
amount of US$2.3 billion. Producers have responded by slashing upstream investment
which in turn will reduce future oil production capacity.

3.138. The KRI has two relatively large refineries: (i) Kalak, which is near Erbil and
operated by Kurdish company KAR Group (operator of Khurmala field), that has a capacity
of 100,000 bpd with a near-term planned increase to 185,000 bpd by 2018, and (ii) Bazian,
which is near Sulaymaniyah and operated by Kurdish company Qaiwan Group, that has a
capacity of 34,000 bpd with plans to increase to 100,000 bpd by 2018. DNO operates a
5,000 bpd refinery at its Tawke field, and there are many other small and basic ‘topping
plants’ that are operated by local companies. The KRI’s total refining capacity, with the
topping plants, is around 170,000-200,000 bpd. However, although the KRI currently has
a surplus of naphtha and heavy fuel oil, these refineries have technical constraints on the
production of light products such as diesel and gasoline, and therefore require additional
upgrades to satisfy local fuel demand. Moreover, the MNR’s policy is to close unlicensed
topping plants and consolidate others into larger units. It has also tendered for the
construction of three new refineries, which would together add 150,000 bpd of capacity, in
Sulaymaniyah, Dohuk and Erbil.

3.139. To make up the difference between current consumption and production from
local refineries, KRG imports petroleum products. KRI consumed approximately 250,000
bpd of petroleum products in 2014. In some instances, KRG conducted swaps wherein
crude oil is exported in exchange for imported refined products. Petroleum products are
subsidized in the domestic market. Therefore, the planned refining expansion, if carried
out efficiently, may lead to satisfying the local demand of oil products.

3.140. To effectively manage downstream oil opportunities and increasing the value-
added from domestic oil production, KRG will need to develop regulatory reforms with
a focus on:

      Contractual and commercial framework governing existing and future activities;
      Enabling conditions for attracting investment;
      Legal and regulatory reforms including pricing, subsidies, and fuel standards; and
      Enabling measures for increasing refining capacity (including refurbishment of
       existing units), optimization of import arrangements and fuel substitution.

Assessing the Effects of an Energy Subsidy Reform

3.141. The World Bank is currently conducting an Energy Subsidy and Tariff Reform
Study covering both Iraq and KRI that aims to estimate the economic effects of removing
energy subsidies. Initial assessments using a Computable General Equilibrium Model point
out that a removal of all energy price subsidies with full compensation to households can
result in a 37 percent reduction in government deficit (Griffin, 2016) (Table 3.6). This
simulation assessed the effects of setting the domestic prices of crude oil and natural gas
at the international reference prices and electricity tariffs at the cost recovery prices. The
simulation considers a scenario where all households are being compensated to keep their
real income constant.

Diversification within the hydrocarbon sector

3.142. Iraq (including the KRI) needs to diversify its exports outside the oil and gas
sector. The hydrocarbon sector, however, could serve as a stepping-stone for
diversification. Indeed, the sector attracts most of the FDI and, in turn, transfers likely to
help the upgrading of the economy. The immediate objective of the KRG should therefore
be to maximize the local benefits and spillover effects of FDI in the sector. This implies
the upgrading of the services sector to meet the demand and the level of standards required
my multinationals in the field. The Government has taken a number of initiatives towards
this end:

        With regards skills and workforce development, the KRG has encouraged local
         capacity building through various channels, including transfers of skills from
         expatriates to nationals, liaison with universities to produce graduates with
         adequate skills, scholarships and internships. These efforts were supported by the
         government as well as financial contributions of companies, and could be included
         in production sharing contracts. According to the Ministry of Natural Resources,
         the local oil and gas industry workforce has reached 76 percent in 2012, and its
         objective was to achieve 90 percent in 2016.

        The Government has introduced an online registration system for oilfield services
         companies (OSCs) wishing to be listed on approved vendors lists (AVLs). As of
         2016, this new registration system will apply for all the services companies willing
         to work for over 25 international oil companies (IOCs) operating under 40
         production sharing contracts (PSCs). This registration and list system ensures the



                                                    68
       evaluation of services providers (OSCs) on the basis of criteria such as corporate,
       financial, quality, health, safety and environment management, workforce
       development, or specific technical requirements. The KRG also funds development
       projects to help local OSCs build capacity and meet those standards. Once
       registered on the AVLs, services companies will receive invitations to tender
       directly from oil companies. The figure below gives an indication of the number of
       companies providing services to IOCs in the KRI.

          Figure 3.9: Services Provided to the Oil and Gas Industry in KRI

3.143. Despite these efforts, the contribution of the oil and gas industry to local
development has been considered unsatisfactory to date. The value created by the sector
to be retained in the region should be increased. The regulations have unspecific
expectations with regards local development contribution, open to alternate interpretation.
While a number of obligations and programs have been progressively put in place,
including the MNR’s workforce development program and the approved vendors list,
progress still needs to be made.

3.144. A holistic approach to the oil and gas sector’s development could be put in place.
A new policy document is being prepared by the MNR that addresses the issues of
workforce development, local enterprise development, and community development. This
initiative, to the extent it does not create unnecessary new burdens to trade and investment,
could be swiftly implemented. A number of programs exists to support local capacity
building in cooperation with the oil and gas companies. IFC, for instance, accompanied
similar reforms with its Business Edge program that helps upgrading local SMEs. The
holistic dimension of this reform is important: it is about being inclusive (e.g., skills




                                                69
developed in this context should also benefit other sectors) and embracing a wide spectrum
of reforms from university curriculums to export promotion efforts.

3.145. It is important to accompany these upgrading programs with diversification
efforts to reduce the dependence on oil and gas sectors. Once up to international
standards, local services companies could be incited to export and diversify their clientele
portfolio. It is essential to the long-term sustainability of the local services firms. So far,
this dimension is absent from the MNR’s plans.

3.146. It is also important to avoid that the procurement and local content rules become,
in turn an obstacle to FDI in the region. There is a thin line between incentives and
requirements that should not be crossed. Some countries have been too far in local content
requirements and have hampered the benefits of participation to global value chains,
unduly increasing the cost of procurement and reducing their attractiveness for investors.
Substitution will take place naturally because the cost of expatriates is always higher than
local staff; it cannot be forced, however, because the import of certain services or skills is
often a prerequisite to the transfer of skills to local staff. Services tasks are skill-intensive,
and one cannot circumvent the learning process. Lessons from the recent work on global
value chains and trade in value-added suggest that the ability to import competitive inputs
is a condition to export competitiveness. Thus, while substitution is desirable, it should
take place only when the local economy can provide competitive inputs. It is about creating
the right incentives and building local capacity, facilitating transfers from the lead firms,
and moving up the value chains.

                             G. REGIONAL CONNECTIVITY

3.147. The role of ICT and transport services is important in improving KRI’s regional
connectivity. Connectivity is a major issue in the MENA region. There are
complementarities to be realized from trade in IT services in addition to the benefits of
enhanced information and communication technologies (ICT) services as an enabling
platform for trade in other sectors. Combined with improved transport services, ICT can
help increase the overall enabling environment for KRI for enhanced economic cooperation
and trade integration in the MENA region. There is a large opportunity for
telecommunications services trade. With improved infrastructure and services, KRI has a
significant potential to become a transport and logistics hub for the whole region based on
its proximity to major markets and relatively safe geopolitical position.

3.148. Proposed reform measures will significantly benefit the whole Iraq and not only
the KRI, therefore improving connectivity is a win-win situation for the entire country.
The benefits could be easily achieved with better regional connectivity that mainly depends
on trade and transport facilitation at the border crossing points. The better connected region
through trade facilitation, customs modernization, regulatory reforms, and improvement of
all transport modes directly imply higher competitiveness for the entire country.




                                               70
                                    Transport Sector

3.149. KRI is well positioned and it can play a significant role in the regional
connectivity if it has a well-developed transport sector. KRI is located on the way from
East to West and from the North to the Middle East. Thus, trade between Iraq, Jordan,
Turkey, and Iran is currently going through KRI. If the network in KRI, as well as in the
rest of Iraq, is further developed, it can play an important role not only in regional trade
but also as an international route linking the Far East with Europe.

3.150. KRI plays a main role in transit transport for Iraq. Majority of imports at east and
north-east of Iraq is done through transit trade from the KRI. In 2014, top importers were
Turkey (37.3 percent of total imports), China (15.4 percent), Iran (12.5 percent), United
Arab Emirates (6.8 percent), Korea (4.9 percent), Italy (4.3 percent), USA (3.8 percent),
and Germany (3.3 percent). Map 3.4 presents trade volumes from Iraq’s borders. Transit
trade is a highly important business in KRI that employs many low-income workers, as
well as serving many sectors with inputs. Reforms that support transit trade will play to
KRI’s strengths as well as serve other parts of Iraq.

      Source: Transport Master Plan of Iraq (2014).

3.151. KRI, as well as the whole Iraq, continues to suffer from weak and under-
developed infrastructure sectors. The lack of a sectoral strategy, chronic underfunding,
weak institutions, and a conflict-affected environment compound the problem. Transport
infrastructure, an important enabler of private sector participation, lacks capital
investments to maintain basic standards in KRI. Similarly, effective transport institutions
are needed to deliver needed investments. Beyond investments, a fundamental sectoral
transformation is required within a sequenced program which supports the development of
a strategy and vision.

3.152. Over the past decade, KRI has invested in development of the transport sector.
New airports were constructed, regional and main road networks were upgrading, and rural
access to villages and remote communities was expanded. KRI also invested in building a
tunneling system to reduce travel distances, time as well as travel interruptions due to the
severe weather conditions especially in the northern KRI. Transport sector is managed by
two ministries, namely, Ministry of Construction and Housing (MOCH) which is mandated
with the management of the roads and bridges while Ministry of Transport and
Communication (MoTC) is responsible for formulating and overseeing transport services
policies and regulations related to roads, public transport, aviation and railways.

3.153. KRG needs a transport master plan to guide the development of the sector. There
is a Transport Master Plan developed for Iraq, but it does not cover deeply KRI. A specific
transport plan for KRG does not exist and authorities agree they need such a document as



                                                  72
a solid base for the development of the transport sector and its sub-sectors. Specific
guidelines are needed at the regional level.

Roads and Bridges

3.154. Institutional capacity, including management of the road network, is gradually
being developed. The General Directorate for Roads and Bridges (GDRB) under MOCH
has the overall mandate to plan, construct and maintain the primary, secondary and tertiary
road network while the road departments at the governorate and municipal levels oversee
such roles for the local roads. All road management duties remain the responsibility of the
GDRB including design, preparation of studies and supervision of works. The agency is
also responsible for the construction and operation of the axle-load control stations.

3.155. Due to the long years of isolation, GDRB lack human resources capacity to
effectively manage the road network. Staff have limited ability to plan, design, supervise
and enforce regulations. Over the past few years, basic road asset management system has
been developed and GDRB staff has been trained for overall road management. However,
international techniques to plan and manage the road network assets have not been fully
implemented and the systems are not regularly fed with data and updated. Some progress
was done in adoption and applying of international standards on procurement and
environmental and social safeguards.

3.156. Additional resources would be needed for road maintenance and construction.
Considerable investment was going into the regional highways in previous years and the
KRI seems to benefit from its position as connection point between neighboring countries
with the rest of Iraq and Iran. Investments in road construction and maintenance have been
impacted since 2014 with very little resources allocated. During the period between 2010
and 2013, KRG has made substantial investments in improving its road network allocating
about US$544 million to this sector in the three governorates. This investment included
about US$316 million for new roads construction and US$228 million for maintenance.
KRG’s investment in maintaining the main and secondary roads (5,800 km) until 2014
averaged about US$57 million annually while the needs are about US$60 million. This has
not created extensive maintenance backlog, but coupled with heavy traffic and reduction
of available funding for about two years, caused heavy burden for the aging network. It
also impacts newly built roads because routine maintenance activities have been
significantly reduced to emergency maintenance only or even disappeared. Road
maintenance is underfunded. Expanding road network requires a significant maintenance
budget. Without adequate maintenance, the expected value of the investments will not be
obtained. Additional damages to the road network are caused by the transport of oil and
gas trucking industry. Axle weight control has to be installed as well.

3.157. The ambitious roads program is falling behind schedule because of low capacity
of the road construction industry in terms of skills and equipment, and lack of financial
resources. The following map presents existing and planned transport corridors presented
in the Transport Master Plan of Iraq. In KRI, road network condition is deteriorating faster
than estimated due to rapid increase in number of registered vehicles, lack of financial



                                            73
resources, and lack of knowledge in maintenance and management practice. KRI Highway
Master Plan has not been followed due to the current security and fiscal crises. Thus, the
plan has to be updated or a Transport Master Plan for KRI needs to be developed for all
transport modes.

         Source: Transport Master Plan of Iraq (2014).

3.158. Institutional bottlenecks in the development infrastructure are mostly related to
the organization, jurisdiction, and lack of legislation—in particular for design,
maintenance and supervision. Law No. 3, adopted by the Kurdistan Parliament in 2007,
authorizes MOCH to perform construction permit, maintenance and design related services
by its own activities or through subordinated implementation agencies (GDRB in the case
of roads). Preparation of studies and designs is being done both internally (within GDRB
if expertise is sufficient) and externally (by hiring consultants). There are no other laws
and by-laws defining such activities. Manuals and specifications are the Iraqi ones.
Regulations on how to implement projects is originated at the Ministry of Planning (i.e.,
how to finance projects, and process of implementation). General conditions of contracts
are issued by KRG MoFE, however these are outdated, but still in use throughout Iraq.
MOCH issues permits, and there is a regional planning council that has to concur on this,
as well as other ministries before MOCH can act. Ministry of Municipalities and Tourism
deals with territory under boundaries of districts/municipalities. The Government collects
revenues and it is distributed according to needs and priorities, but the system of estimating
needs and prioritization is weak. Road user charging system does not exist, i.e., no
registration fees, no heavy transport fees, and no fuel levies or excise tax on fuel import or
retail price.

3.159. In freight transport, there are a number of challenges not allowing facilitation of
trade. There are three border crossing points for import and 13 for exports. Different
authorities (i.e., Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of


                                                 74
Health) are issuing licenses for exports and imports, and there is no uniform procedure.
Quality control is conducted by various institutions and there is no precise procedure. Cost
of license for import or export is too high. Ministry of Trade and Industry cannot
completely monitor re-exports. Taxes per kg of cargo have to be paid to the airport
authorities (around US$0.5-1.5 per kg). Taxes per seat of passenger flights have to be paid
to the Iraqi Airways, and the charge is US$15 for international passengers and US$5 for
domestic passengers. These charges are expected to increase in July 2016 to US$25 and
US$10 respectively.

3.160. Company registration and establishment is not difficult. Company licenses for
transportation are issued on the company name in the specific transportation sector, and
the requirements are related to the number of trucks, drivers, etc. Licensing taxes are
approximately US$200-300 on annual basis. There is almost no insurance provided by
freight forwarders, both for drivers, vehicles and freight. There is no real market for
insurances—premium rates are high.

3.161. There are some attempts to organize artificial city logistic, but it is not in use .
There are only a few places in Erbil where people try to distribute some freight, but these
locations are illegal. There are also some companies offering city logistics but this has not
been applied as there are no rules and legislation that forbid transporting of freight through
the city.

Public Transport

3.162. Inter-urban and inter-city public transport system operates on a very low level of
reliability and efficiency. Public transport system is underdeveloped with no clear
procedures. MOTC is responsible for development of public transport but the capacity of
the ministry is limited. There are three public transport syndicates in KRI, and each
governorate has its own responsible person for transport (head of syndicate). The proposed
public transport network is presented within Kurdistan Highway Master Plan. Transport
master plans for governorates have been produced and they are comprehensive, but KRG
does not have enough financial instruments to implement proposed measures.

         Source: Kurdistan Highway Master Plan (2010).

3.163. People use private cars as the public transport system is unreliable and frequently
delayed. There are no regular timetables for taxies, mini- and small buses—they start when
the bus is full. There are two bus terminals in Erbil and one of these terminals is new. It
was built based on the concession agreement with a foreign investor.

Air Transport

3.164. Iraq’s airspace is managed by Baghdad. Civil aviation sector in Iraq consists of
the General Establishments of Civil Aviation and Iraqi Airways. Aviation legislation is
managed by federal authorities for overall Iraq. ICAA is the only signatory of ICAO dating
back to 1947. In KRI, local air traffic controllers manage take-off and landing at the KRI
airports. The KRG MoTC lacks strong capacity in air transport despite it being of crucial
importance to the KRI with two international airports operational at Erbil and
Sulaymaniyah with a third planned for Dohuk. Sulaymaniyah Airport has almost reached


                                               76
limits and need immediate measures to be applied. Erbil Airport also requires investments
and a development plan for the planned airport expansion. Maintenance of infrastructure
is provided by the airport itself. Infrastructure is not in condition as it was previously due
to lack of funding. Pavements need a lot of attention soonest as they are deteriorating. The
financial issues are not the only obstacles for maintenance—additional challenges include
lack of labor and educated staff. Further, large number of cargo procedures cause delays
especially for imports.

3.165. Year 2015 has been a challenging for EIA as the conflict and concerns over
security in the region have seen suspension of airlines, change of traffic patterns, and
closure of airspace. EIA has remained fully operational and has recorded a modest growth
in passenger numbers of around 6.6 percent to 1,665,701 departing and arriving passengers.
On average, around 4,550 passengers arrive or depart Erbil each day. Average passenger
growth in period 2006-2013 was approximately 30 percent while in 2012-2013 it was 54
percent due to the Turkish Airlines and Gulf Airline flights. Turkish Airlines was, on
average, 80 percent loaded while it dropped due to crisis to 40 percent. Further decline in
passengers is expected as Turkey recently implemented visas. Previously, a traffic study
estimated a growth of 18 percent in air traffic, however it averaged 6.6 percent because of
crisis.

3.166. The fall in cargo tonnage in 2015 reflects the downward pressure on economic
activity in the region. Imports fell by 28 percent to 24,235 tons. Since the peak of 38,752
tons in 2013, cargo tonnage is down by 37 percent in 2015. Ground handling lasts for
approximately 24-36 hours, and it can be reduced with installment of new procedures for
cargo handling as there are many duplicated procedures. Additionally, there are significant
obstacles and delays in cargo clearance at the EIA.

Railways

3.167. The MoTC has not yet developed capabilities in the railways sector as it is still
under planning and currently there are no operational railways in the region. The railway
transport sector is elaborated only within the Transport Master Plan of Iraq.

3.168. With the development of transit rail link though KRI and short link in Iran,
railway connection to the Mersin port in Mediterranean Sea could be much shorter .
Short link to Turkey is necessary in order to bypass conflict area in Syria where the existing
railway line passes though. Currently, the main railway link connecting KRI to Western
Europe goes from Mosul, and this line further continues through Syria to Turkey, either
towards Mersin port (E-70 and E-97) or via Malatya to Ankara (E-70). Connection though
Iran could start from the closes railway station Mahabad, 290 km far from Erbil. This
railway station further connects to the main railway network via Tabriz. Links toward
China and Korea go through the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation countries.
The figure below presents existing and planned railway network in Iraq and within the
region.

Transport Sector: The Way Forward

3.169. The poor condition of the road network has significantly affected mobility,
particularly for the poor, and especially in rural areas. Most of the population is
inadequately serviced by unpaved roads with the impact falling disproportionately on
certain income groups. Support in improving road asset conditions and develop public
transport system on certain level will considerably increase access to health services,
education and job opportunities. Further, it will be a critical foundation for future regional
integration and increased trade in the sub-region.

3.170. There is a need to address immediate challenges within political realities, with
approaches that can improve over time. Transport corridor operations will require
infrastructure investments, trade facilitation and customs modernization. Given the fragile
circumstances and complex political economy context, an incremental and practical
approach anchored in a coherent program of immediate, medium, and longer term support
will be the way forward. The transport sector should immediately focus on the core issues
such as the following:

Trade & Customs

      Establishment of Regional Trade Facilitation Agency.




                                             78
      Establishment of regional working group with Turkey and Iran in order to discuss
       trade transit though KRI, and upgrade of main road transport corridor(s).
      Trade facilitation reforms at border crossings and a plan for logistic hubs.
      Technical assistance for overall Iraq, including the KRI, on customs reform and
       PPP introduction.

Licensing

      Establishment of the working group to uniform procedures for issuance of export
       and import licenses.

Transport Master Plan

      Development of a Transport Master Plan for KRG as a strategic document for
       development of transport sector and improvement of connectivity. Transport
       Master Plan has to provide prioritization for road network upgrade, and
       development of logistic hub network.
      Development of the new public transport system, separately for inter-urban and
       inter-city public transport.

International Standards

      Adopting international standards and practices for planning and programing,
       procurement, financial management, environmental and social safeguards,
       supervision, design and maintenance.

Education and Training

      Modernize curricula and address quality issues in transport sector training. Of
       particular importance is provision of basic skills for planning, design, maintenance
       and management of infrastructure as well as the logistics.
      Consult with Ministry of Education and Ministry of Higher Education to address
       skills gap.

                                        ICT Sector

3.171. ICT can drive KRI’s economic growth, enabling trade expansion and trade
diversification. ICT services help connect, innovate, and transform local trade regimes;
they create the necessary enabling environment for trade to flourish. Connectivity enhances
virtual platforms for outsourcing and offshoring activities. Innovation lends itself to the
development of new hybrid goods and services across industries by harnessing the power
of communication technologies. Transformation happens through the development of
digital platforms that can facilitate the administration of trade processes for businesses and
governments. ICT services have become an important foundation for trade competitiveness
in an increasingly connected world. Coupled with advances in transportation technologies
and logistics, ICT enables new organizational innovations in which industry supply chains


                                             79
can now span countries and borders, increasing global trade both within industries and
between them. KRG has the potential to benefit from enhanced regional connectivity.

Broadband infrastructure and service expansion

3.172. The broadband market in the KRI is showing relatively rapid progress compared
with the rest of Iraq, but there is still considerable room for growth. The adoption of ICT
and in particular the widespread use of high-speed Internet services, contribute to the GDP
growth, job creation and economic diversification of the KRI. The telecom market in the
KRI is a regional market, hosting a combination of regional and local operators that
compete and complement each other in the provision of voice and broadband services.
Fostering competition and the development of state-of the art telecom services, particularly
broadband, has a direct and indirect impact on the services sectors in the KRI as well as in
the rest of Iraq. The mobile broadband market in the KRI is relatively competitive, yet
service adoption is lagging behind. Currently around 30 percent of the KRI population is
using mobile broadband services compared to 15 percent in all of Iraq, over 60 percent in
Jordan, Turkey, and Egypt and over 100 percent in some of the Gulf countries. Fixed
broadband services, particularly over high-speed infrastructure, are also lagging behind
comparator regional countries. In sum, the broadband market in the KRI and in Iraq can
greatly benefit from more competition and the adoption of Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB)
infrastructure.

3.173. In the KRI, the Ministry of Transport and Communication proactively introduced
competition and private sector entry in the sector, yet going forward, the Ministry has to
tackle a set of constraints that are impeding further market development. The KRG
MoTC has licensed private operators in the fixed broadband market (outperforming the
rest of Iraq that keeps this segment under government control). These operators are
targeting the introduction of next generation, high speed fiber optic networks. However,
competition in the fixed broadband market remains limited and mostly controlled by two
providers: Allai Newrooz in Erbil and Kurdtel in Sulaymaniyah. In the mobile market, the
Ministry has licensed 4G spectrum, the newest wireless technology which is still not
available in the rest of Iraq, to deliver higher speed mobile broadband services. However,
the market is still not delivering the best in class broadband services to everyone in the
KRG and this is primarily linked to the following constraints:

   The monopolistic vertically integrated fixed infrastructure providers. Allai Newrooz
    in Erbil and Kurdtel in Sulaymaniyah, have monopoly over the fixed infrastructure in
    all the major cities. This dominance/monopoly constitutes a considerable barrier to the
    entry of new service providers at all levels of the broadband value chain. Competition
    in infrastructure and in service provisioning can bring about considerable benefits to
    the consumers as well as the economy and can lead to lower prices, better quality,
    innovative service and overall more mature markets.

   Restricted access to existing essential infrastructure. There are currently no
    regulatory tools to remedy for the dominance of the two fixed infrastructure providers.
    This is apparent in the limited number of alternative operators. The Ministry has
    devised price ceilings on wholesale and infrastructure services sold to other service
    providers. However this measure does not ensure the open access to essential facilities
    that fosters competition in services. Dominant operators are still likely to discriminate
    between their affiliated service providers and alternative new entrants.


                                                                               81
   Limited broadband infrastructure in remote areas. Broadband, and in particular fixed
    infrastructure appears to be limited outside of the main urban areas. This is a major
    limitation to the benefits that broadband can bring to the KRI. Expanding the fixed
    broadband infrastructure and the access at the local level. Therefore the development
    of a competitive, private sector driven expansion of broadband infrastructure should
    be coupled with financial and regulatory mechanisms to address the inevitable divide
    between urban a rural areas.

   Fragmented mobile market. Although a number of operators are offering competing
    mobile broadband services in the KRI, several factors limit the ability of operators to
    effectively compete regionally and nationally. First, the 3G operators, licensed by
    Communication and Media Commission (CMC), are not able to acquire 4G spectrum
    licenses in the KRI. Second, regional 4G operators cannot provide the service in the
    rest of Iraq, This suboptimal and fragmented market structure limits competition in the
    KRI and the rest of Iraq and hinders the expansion, maturity and innovation of both
    the regional 4G and the national 3G operators.

Policy Response

Fostering competition in the KRI market

3.174. To address these bottlenecks, the KRG should devise sector strategies along with
specific regulatory interventions that foster competition and address digital divide issues
through proactive policies. If these issues were addressed, the economic and social
opportunities achieved from the universalization of high speed Internet services would be
considerable and would have a transformative impact on the KRI. In this respect, an
overarching policy and a holistic approach to the development of the broadband market
can bridge the gap between the current situation and the policy aspirations of the KRG
development targets of stimulating private sector productivity, creating new jobs and
diversifying the economy. The MoTC, in cooperation with other government agencies can
develop a comprehensive KRG telecommunications policy and strategy to stimulate
competition in the broadband market and introduce open and public consultation with all
stakeholders. This strategy can be devised in cooperation with the central government
authorities to highlight the potential regional as well as national gains from fostering the
development of the telecom market in the KRI. In specific terms, the MoTC should plan in
the next three to four years to implement the following actions and strategies:

   Similar to the licensing of the two incumbent fixed operators, the KRG MoTC can
    introduce new facilities-based broadband operators. The KRG should open the
    opportunity for new private sector operators to lay infrastructure and provide service
    across the whole broadband vertical chain and on a regional basis rather than for each
    governorate. Priority should be given to new service providers at the access service
    layer.
   Devising a set of regulatory tools to encourage market entry, issue and implement open
    access regulations and address dominance and anti-competitive practices with priority




                                            82
    to non-discriminatory and transparent wholesale price regulation and wholesale
    reference offers.
   Designing new models of infrastructure supply using public private partnerships to
    expand fiber access and backbone networks beyond urban areas.
   Encouraging and regulating the sharing of infrastructure between telecom operators,
    between telecom and electricity networks and between telecom and transport. This
    would entail designing digital infrastructure maps as a tool to identify market gaps,
    issuing guidelines and regulations for infrastructure sharing among operators and
    coordinating with the Ministry of Electricity the terms and conditions of the use of the
    electricity transmission and distribution network to deploy fiber networks.
   Strengthening cooperation and agreements between the CMC and the KRG MoTC, on
    monitoring and regulating the 3 local mobile operators, in particular on issues related
    to frequency usage, interconnection, quality of service and pricing.

Market regulation and monitoring capacities of the MoTC

3.175. Progress in the expansion and the development of the regional broadband market
requires extensive market analysis and monitoring by the MoTC. The capacity in the
MoTC has not been translated into regular monitoring of the market and analysis of the
gaps in supply and demand. There are currently neither a baseline nor frequent analysis of
the telecom and broadband markets in the KRG. Moreover, cooperation of MoTC with
regional and national operators and the provision of market data and information can be
improved in order to give the MoTC a solid basis for devising sound and informed policies.

3.176. The MoTC needs to improve its technical and regulatory capacity. In the next
three years and as one of the major prerequisite for market regulation and interventions,
the MoTC needs to improve its technical capacity to monitor the market. The MoTC should
improve transparency by adopting a transparent and consultative approach to devising new
rules and regulations.

International connectivity market

3.177. Along with the south of Iraq, the KRI has a prime geopolitical location that
enables Iraq to become a hub for international connectivity. This geopolitical location
has the potential to serve the Internet markets of the GCC region and the International
traffic between Europe and Asia. Transiting international traffic through Iraq and the KRI
generates higher Internet capacity for the whole country at competitive prices, creates new
business opportunities for domestic investors and provides new jobs in infrastructure
deployment.

3.178. There is considerable interest among domestic and foreign investors in the KRI
as a regional hub for Internet traffic. Many sources have reported ongoing projects and
negotiations with international partners to expand fiber infrastructure from the submarine
cable landing points in Al Faw to Turkey and Iran via the KRI. However, the rules and
regulations for such infrastructure deployment projects are still obscure. So far, the KRI
MoTC has licensed four operators to provide international terrestrial connectivity through


                                            83
Iran and Turkey to provide international connectivity services to local users, but has no
official plans to leverage the position of KRI as a potential transit hub for regional and
international markets.

3.179. MoTC, in cooperation with central government authorities should strengthen
transparent licensing processes and develop a common vision for regional Internet
connectivity. The MoTC and the related agencies in the KRG can adopt a more transparent
approach to licensing infrastructure that transit Internet traffic through the KRI. A clear
vision can leverage domestic and international investors to bring about benefits to local
investors, more fiscal revenues, and better service to the consumer.

The Information Technology market

3.180. The IT market in the KRG is in its nascent stage. The IT market in the KRG is
characterized by low demand and low supply of IT services, such as software products and
networking, as well as IT enabled services such as business process outsourcing. Important
economic and social opportunities can arise from stimulating the development of this
market including job creation outside of the public sector, increasing the size of the services
sectors, and transforming the trade, logistics and energy sectors.

3.181. Low demand for local IT services along with shortage in skills appear to be major
constraints for the development of the IT market. On the demand side, there is weak
demand from big companies in oil, construction and telecom as they tend to develop their
own solutions or outsource to international IT companies. The Government has developed


                                              84
the KRG IT blueprint strategy which aims at digitizing government processes and services.
The full implementation of this strategy will help boost demand for IT services and
therefore help the market mature and expand. However, labor supply skills are constraints
to the development of this market: weak skills in languages, management and
communications are cited as important constraints for demand of local labor in IT and IT
enabled services. Finally, IT companies are failing to attract skilled labor and fresh
graduates have a considerable preference for jobs in the public sector.

3.182. The KRG needs to tap on the opportunity of the underserved Kurdish language
content market. Another opportunity for local entrepreneurs and investors rests in the
regional market for specialized entertainment, educational and localization of digital
content in the Kurdish language. The opportunity lies in the extended geographic area of
Kurdish speaking customers and the relatively low supply in this market. The Government
can incentivize academic institutions, NGOs, and the private sector to organize Hackatons
and application competitions to stimulate innovation. The government can also support
SMEs in this area.

3.183. A local IT strategy is needed to foster the IT market. To boost the development of
this market, the KRG should devise a local plan and strategy that brings together all
concerned government agencies and develop a long-term plan to address weaknesses in
supply and demand of IT services and the need to improve technical and soft skills. The
government can also partner with the private sectors, academic institutions and
international stakeholders to develop technology parks and innovation incubators.

The proposed recommendations, in particular those related to the broadband market and
international connectivity, can help the KRI, as well as the rest of Iraq, to foster the adoption of
advanced broadband services for the benefits of consumers and the economy as a whole. Therefore
their implementation should build on the synergies between the regional and national markets. This
may require in some cases coordination with the central government authorities. The below table
highlights the measures that should be implemented by KRG MoTC in the next four years, listed
in order of importance. All proposed policy recommendations are also summarized in the policy
matrix annex of this report. KRG authorities may rely on external assistance to implement these
reforms while strengthening the internal technical and institutional capacity of the MoTC.

  H. DIVERSIFICATION OF THE ECONOMY AND EMPLOYMENT CREATION OVER
         THE MEDIUM-TERM THROUGH PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

3.184. Over and above the restoration of peace and security, the achievement of
significant and sustained welfare gains will be predicated on economic growth and the
diversification of the economy away from oil. In Iraq, as in many other developing
countries, the heavy reliance on oil for growth, exports and government revenues also
occurs within the context of a narrow and non-inclusive power structure that privileges
‘short-term private enrichment over longer-term collective welfare enhancement.’23 As the
World Bank (2012) report highlights, the translation of natural resource rents into
development gains will require credible intertemporal commitment on the part of
government to both extractive companies and its citizens, as well as a more inclusive
process of decision making and public accountability so that resource rents are allocated
towards investments in service delivery and public good provision. To address the multiple
development challenges facing KRG, an expansion in job creation led by a diversified
private sector will be essential, which in turn requires a favorable investment climate, the
availability of finance on competitive terms, flexible labor market mechanisms and
institutions, and appropriate infrastructure.

                                                                         86
3.185. In KRG, there are opportunities for an expanded role of the private sector, if the
appropriate enabling environment is made available. It will be imperative for the public
sector not to crowd out the private sector in being able to compete for talent and business.
Rather, the key challenge for government is to put its significant revenues to efficient use,
making critical investments in health, education, infrastructure and regional development,
and in creating a well-targeted and comprehensive system of safety nets for the poor and
vulnerable (World Bank, 2012, Iraq PER). The creation of a large and diversified set of
jobs remains one of the fundamental development challenges for Iraq. Across the world,
poverty reduction is most often driven by an expansion in employment and increases in
labor earnings; and the private sector is usually the primary engine of job creation.

3.186. The large informal sector poses an important challenge. Streamlining registration
and licensing procedures will reduce the regulatory burden of entry into the formal sector.
Reform of the tax and regulatory regime can also encourage formalization and compliance
by small firms. Moreover, expanding the access to finance and business support services
will enable informal firms to compete in the formal economy. In the end, firms choose to
formalize based on a rational comparison of costs and benefits; and the formal economy
can grow when these benefits outweigh the costs.

3.187. There is a strong potential role for the private sector to play in partnership with
the public sector to enhance infrastructure quality and access, and this will require reforms
of the regulatory environment to attract adequate investment and greater use of public
private partnerships (PPPs) to address service delivery, especially as a stepping stone to
broader private sector led financing and provision of key services. When available, public
sector investment in infrastructure is not of adequate size and composition to act as a driver
of growth. In this context, FDI tends to be concentrated in non-tradables, thus
compromising export growth, and weak governance acts as a constraint to effective public-
private partnerships and, more generally, private sector development. Similarly, financial
sector reforms will be needed to expand access to competitive financing for private
businesses. Easing the regulations governing land and facilitating registration and the use
of property as collateral will also be important. The “resource corridor” approach holds
particular promise, especially as lessons emerge from other resource-rich economies. The
key idea is to use a set of complementary investments by international and domestic private
investors and the government to manage natural resource development in a way that
generates spillover activities. Of course, parallel interventions are necessary to maintain
security and promote an inclusive mode of natural resource development.

Private firms’ access to finance

3.188. Access to finance is regularly identified as a major constraint to doing business
in KRI. The underdeveloped financial and banking services, the inability of individuals
and companies to issue letters of credit, and the fact that services lag behind international
levels of development have led the private sector to abstain from dealing with
governmental banks.

3.189. To ameliorate this situation, the KRG needs to strengthen the rights of borrowers
and lenders by amending the securities laws to allow more flexibility in secured
transactions law by:

      Introducing the possibility of a non-possessory security pledges in a single category
       of revolving movable assets;
      Ensuring that non-possessory security pledges allow a general description of the
       collateral without requiring a specific description of the collateral;
      Allowing that a security right extend to future or after-acquired assets, and extend
       automatically to the products, proceeds or replacements of the original assets;
      Allowing for general description of debts and obligations in collateral agreements
       and in registration documents so that all types of obligations and debts can be
       secured by stating a maximum rather than a specific amount between the parties;
      Establishing a collateral registry that is computerized, unified geographically, and
       that is indexed by the name of the grantor of a security right;
      Developing a predictable priority system that would grant as high of a priority to
       secured creditors both inside and outside bankruptcy proceedings as possible; and
      Authorizing parties to agree on out of court enforcement of debt obligations.

Regulatory regime

3.190. The importance of high-quality business regulation is a key determinant of KRI’s
future growth rate. Improving the business environment is therefore essential for boosting
the growth potential of the economy. This underscores the importance of finalizing the
following legislative reforms:

      Drafting a new Competitiveness Law
      Drafting an Anti-Monopoly Law


                                                 88
      Drafting a Consumer Protection Law
      Amending the Industrial Zones Law
      Drafting a Social Security Law
      Drafting an Environmental Law

3.191. These should be written in accordance with international best standards and
good regulatory practices, through a coordinated effort with all relevant ministries and
private sector and civil society stakeholders.

Institutional coordination

3.192. It is important for KRG to identify a “champion of reform” that can take the lead
on some initial regulatory reform efforts. The current institutional regulatory framework
in KRI is fragmented. There is no single unit in charge of leading and coordinating
regulatory reform efforts. The “champion of reform” role, which has so far been undertaken
by the Ministry of Planning, could continue to be led by the ministry, although other
supporting institutions and processes will be also needed. It will be important to establish
working groups including representation from government agencies, and from the private
sector that will identify and discuss regulatory assessment and reform recommendations.

Diversifying in manufacturing

3.193. As the security situation improves, the KRG can encourage expanded production
of manufactures by improving critical infrastructure for manufacturing and by
enhancing security for the movement of goods through the KRI. KRI is host to a few
factories that were intended to supply all of Iraq, but security problems restricted access to
the rest of the Iraqi population. However, recent trade data (and satellite images) indicate
that substantial amounts of imports from Turkey are transiting through KRI to Southern
Iraq. Improvements in security should be of advantage to all sectors, and to Iraq as a whole,
given the volume of trade transiting between KRI and the rest of Iraq. A PPP may be used
to provide financing for private firms that would complete stalled infrastructure projects.
An initial step is to set up a supplier database with information about each firms’ capacity,
to provide to potential investors.

3.194. Encouraging foreign investment is particularly important as investors could
bring not only an infusion of capital, but also knowledge. To facilitate the transfer of
knowledge to local firms, KRG could also provide incentives for foreign firms to partner
with local firms, such as additional incentives for purchasing inputs from domestic firms.
Alternatively, KRG could facilitate connections between potential foreign investors and
domestic firms, and offer incentives to investors who are willing to provide technical
assistance to domestic firms.

           Box 3.5: Prioritization of Private Sector Development Reform Actions
A private sector-led economic growth and job creation agenda is critical for KRG to promote
economic diversification and sustainable economic development. The private sector is relatively
weak and nascent in a state-dominated oil-dependent economy. A multipronged strategy is required
to promote private sector development, which should include the following action items (but not
necessarily limited to):

High priority action items (within 6- 36 months):

       Pilot innovative entrepreneurship development program specially targeting the youth and
        scale up the interventions that seem most effective.
       Pilot firm-level support to improve firm productivity, product quality upgradation and
        innovation, and access to markets and scale up interventions.
       Promote an enabling investment climate covering necessary legal and institutional reforms
        based on the findings from Doing Business Study, Enterprise Survey, and other primary
        and secondary research.

Medium to long-term action items (3-5 years):

       Develop and implement an economic diversification strategy focusing on competitive
        sectors in KRI.
       Enhance the productivity of agro-business sector.
       Improve connectivity to global economy through strengthened trade and customs policy,
        procedures, and development of ICT and infrastructure.

              I.   BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND INVESTMENT REGIME

Investment climate

3.195. The overly complex regulatory framework suffers from duplicative and
overlapping regulations. This leads to an inefficient regime for doing business with high
cost for businesses, particularly for small enterprises. The regulatory system should be
thoroughly evaluated and reformed, and government officials should be trained in good
regulatory practices.

3.196. The Government should establish a rule-based open investment climate. Private
investors should have easy access to facilitating institutions; they should not see
government offices as controllers of specific privileges, but rather as the implementing
agency of a transparent and rule-based regime. The willing participation of the private
sector in the tax and regulatory system will allow Government to implement a pro-growth
policy.

3.197. Public and private sector trust can be enhanced through public-private dialogue
as a means to establish the main priorities of the private sector and the role of the public
sector in maintaining a constructive business climate. Public-private dialogue can explore
areas of agreement where constructive reforms can benefit both sectors.

Investment reform map

3.198. The KRG needs to identify current barriers to investment and determine whether
its current policy mix can be reformed to attract more FDI in a wider variety of sectors .
The KRG would benefit from a comprehensive FDI strategy. FDI can be a good source of
capital, know-how and technology. Foreign firms can provide jobs for local workers and
training that can help upgrade the skill base of the local labor force. They can also provide
links to a wider network of partners and clients. It will be useful if KRG undertakes an
investment reform map (IRM) process to assess the type(s) of rules and regulations that
can be reformed or instituted to best help KRG grow and develop, set priorities for reform
and create an action plan with concrete timelines. This reform map should focus on the
overall environment, allowing foreign businesses to seek and discover the KRI’s many
advantages.

3.199. Exports potential needs to be tapped and supported. Iraq has a very low level of
exports, much lower as a percent of GDP and particularly in terms of the number of firms
that export, than other MENA countries or other FCS states. This characteristic is
replicated—and magnified—in the Kurdistan Region. This issue was there even before the
security situation was exacerbated. This speaks to the need for assessing the regulatory and
administrative barriers to trade and to developing a strategy for attracting investment with
the capital, technology and networks to help KRI firms develop export potential.

Investment law

The Investment Law, KRG BoI, and Supreme Investment Council constitute much of
the legal and institutional structure of the investment regime in KRI. Currently, the law
provides very generous tax breaks for investors, but there is little information available to
assess whether these incentives align with the needs of investors, and of whether these


                                                        91
incentives are necessary—particularly compelling, given the fiscal state of the KRG. The
Government should create a mechanism to assess the utility of existing incentives and to
regularly reevaluate incentives to ensure that they do not have unintended, negative
consequences, such as limiting competition by favoring some types of companies, or
misuse of resources.

Training in settlement of investment disputes

3.200. An element that is demonstrably important for foreign investors is the existence
of a reliable dispute resolution mechanism. KRG is legally unable to sign investment
agreements; the international investment regime is determined in Baghdad. Since 17
December 2015, Iraq is a member of the ICSID Convention. Iraq is also signatory to seven
bilateral investment agreements, of which two are in force: Japan (2014) and Kuwait
(1966) and party to the Organization of Investment Cooperation investment treaty, League
of Arab States investment agreement, the Arab League investment agreement and the Arab
Economic Unity Agreement. It has signed a Cooperation Agreement in 2012 and has
established a TIFA with the United States (entered into force in May 2013). Iraq is not a
party to the New York Convention (the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement
of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958). Iraq has bilateral free trade area (FTA) agreements
with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Qatar, Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon,
Syria, Tunisia, Yemen, and Sudan. KRG BOI staff should be trained in ICSID rules and
norms and their implications for Iraq (including KRI), and should clearly advertise this
avenue to potential investors. Given its recent entry into ICSID, training in the international
settlement of disputes and, importantly, on dispute prevention, would be key.

Investment retention

3.201. An investment retention unit should be created. Much of current investment
worldwide is reinvestment, and efforts could be made to retain more existing investment,
even in the face of tough external challenges. The creation of a sub-unit for investment
retention within the BOI would be one step, to provide regular communication with
investors to assess needs, to prevent disputes (which can be very costly) and for capturing
lessons from existing investors to use to attract new and hopefully sustainable ones.

Investment promotion

3.202. KRG needs a strong promotion tool that can show potential investors its assets
and potential, explain procedures and the legal framework, and respond to questions in
a timely manner. KRG suffers several challenges in terms of attracting investors. Its
location within a conflict region is one clear challenge, as is communicating its relationship
with the rest of Iraq. The KRG BOI has a website aimed at investors that contains
information on potential investments in several major languages. Funding for the
maintenance of its Website has run out, however, and training programs have been cut.
Information is important to attract and inform investors, so it is essential to provide
resources to BOI for investment attraction; to update and revamp Website and to provide




                                              92
training for BOI staff (conditional upon offering internships and commitment to securing
internships and training in all new investments).

Board of investment

3.203. Investment Law gives BOI a wide range of responsibilities including “creating a
suitable environment so as to achieve economic development in the region and investment
strategies, plans, and policies and submit them to the Council for approval …” (Article
10/6). But, BOI interprets its mission very narrowly only to issue investment licenses for
projects with a project cost of US$1 million and more. This largely reflects its institutional
and technical capacity. Under Article 13 of the Investment Law, the chairman has the right
contracting persons inside or outside the region to perform tasks to achieve the goals of the
Board. This right has been rarely used.

3.204. Technical and monitoring capacity of the BOI is very limited. It does not have any
follow up and monitoring activity for investment projects and to learn from the
implementation process and improve the investment environment. Recommendations
include providing technical assistance improve BOI’s technical and administrative
capacity and establishing a one-stop shop in BOI.

Supreme investment council

3.205. The Investment Law also gives the Council broader responsibilities to improve
the business environment, but the Council focuses on only a few activities such as
monitoring BOI’s activities, approving the high visibility projects, and allocating free land.
The Council, which is chaired by the Prime Minister, has the potential of serving as an
effective high-level policy-making and policy coordinating body. This potential is not used.
Recommendations include:

      Restructure the Council and redefine its role as the highest policy making body
       dealing with investment climate and business environment supported by a
       technically capable and effective secretariat operating under the Council of
       Ministers.
      Merge the inactive Economic Council into the Supreme Investment Council.

Starting and closing a business

3.206. Enterprise surveys have identified burdensome bureaucratic procedures for
opening, running and closing a business as a private sector impediment . The legal and
regulatory environment for doing business is outdated and confusing, which is particularly
burdensome for smaller businesses attempting to navigate their way. Lengthy waits for
approvals for licenses to start up business, some needing approvals for multiple ministries,
is a key complaint, as is the cumbersome process of closing a business. Some private sector
entities also identified access to land as an issue.

as particularly cumbersome; Iraq ranks 154 out of 189 countries. In the country as a whole,
starting a business requires 10 procedures that take on average 29 days at a cost of 40
percent of per capital income. Compared to neighbors, as depicted in the Figure 3.14 below,
Iraq is the furthest from the frontier. This is replicated in KRI, where it takes 21 days to
obtain a construction-related permit and 73.4 days to obtain an import license in
Sulaymaniyah (in Baghdad getting an import license takes 15 days).

3.208. Entry barriers are particularly burdensome to small businesses, and data from the
Ministry of Trade and Industry indicates that the large majority of private firms in the
Kurdistan Region are small. Many firms are also informal, and the literature draws some
parallels between excessive regulations with respect to startup costs and informality and
corruption. Practices of the informal sector is the second most important business obstacle
to firms, according to the Enterprise Survey data, second only to insufficient electricity and
more of an obstacle than political instability. Figure plots the percent of firms in various
governorates of Iraq that cite informal sector practices as a main constraint.

Customs time and number of procedures

3.209. In Erbil, it takes 38 days for goods to clear customs and nearly half of all firms
use imported inputs. Reducing customs time through improving both hard and soft
infrastructure could be key, particularly if there is interest in developing export capacity
and attracting efficiency-seeking FDI.

Establishing a quality system

3.210. Special attention is needed to support internationally-recognized quality
certification. The Government should bolster quality system so that firms can be
internationally certified at home. Currently in the KRI, only 6 percent (of 179 firms)—


                                                       95
mostly in Erbil—have internationally recognized quality certification and less than 1
percent use technology licensed from international firms.

Matching workers skills to companies’ needs

3.211. The skills gap renders the outputs of the educational system incapable of meeting
and anticipating the private sector’s needs. There is a clear gap between the output of the
educational system (including graduates, research for personal promotions and
advancements, Master’s theses and PhD dissertations), particularly in sectors related to
production and administrative issues, and the actual skill needs of the region’s markets and
various economic sectors.

3.212. A number of mechanisms can help address this issue. KRG could establish a
public-private coordinating mechanism to survey market-based needs; coordinate training
programs (avoiding duplication of training programs by developing an umbrella
mechanism for the public sector to coordinate efforts to maximize results without taxing
resources); enlist firms, domestic and foreign, to train people through internships,
mentorships, apprenticeships, work-study programs, seminars; and partner with
universities, particularly business and technical schools as well as high schools. This could
lead to a longer-term skills training initiative that, by producing results, could increase the
prestige and desirability of working in the private sector.

Payment system

3.213. The most common complaint from business managers is the lack of a viable
banking and payments system. Beyond investments, the private sector is looking to
Government to establish and maintain a stable environment for private investors. While
such a system had existed before the economic crisis, private businesses feel unable to re-
establish it without public enforcement. Low confidence in the banking system creates high
transaction costs and a high share of cash payments. A high share of cash payments
eliminates critical information on the level of economic activity and encourages informal


                                              96
transactions. The Government needs to work with the private sector to support and secure
confidence in an efficient formal payment system among firms.

3.214. Collective agreement to re-establish vital institutions—such as the banking and
payments system—should be established. Public intervention and public enforcement will
be needed where no private agents feel they can secure a new payments system and ensure
enforcement of regulations that will be beneficial to all. Government will need to re-
establish trust in the banking system. Arrangements may be needed with the Central Bank
to ensure a lender-of-last-resort facility.

J. BUILDING STRONG PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS FOR ADVOCACY AND
                                              LOBBYING

3.215. Private sector development is a key objective for KRG, but there is a need for
“champions” to achieve this objective both in the private sector and in the Government.
Globally, strong business organizations, as self-help institutions, play an important role for
building a vibrant private sector. They identify the problems the private sector faces,
develop policy solutions, build coalitions, and organize effective lobbying activities to
influence public opinion and policy. In KRI, business organizations (together with their
partners in the Government—possibly in the MoTI) can become the champion of private
sector development.

3.216. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CoCI) is the main active business
organization in KRI. The main objective of CoCI is establishing business contacts
particularly in other countries rather than serving as an advocacy and lobbying body in
KRI. It lacks capacity to conduct economic and policy analysis, identify needs for the
private sector, and influence public opinion and policy.




                                                  97
3.217. CoCI has a strong bias towards trading in its policy stance. Industrial
development seems to be a secondary objective. This reflects the dominance of traders in
its membership. The main policy actions would be to:

      transform the region’s CoCI into a modern advocacy and lobbying organization,
       and
      set up a partner organization in the government.

3.218. Substantial technical assistance is needed to realize these actions. CoCI is in the
process of building partnership with Swedish CoCI to receive such assistance.

                                   K. TRADE POLICY

3.219. Improving KRI’s trade regime is a priority on KRG’s reform agenda. The current
regime (zero tariffs on all imports plus a 5 percent flat reconstruction levy on about half of
tradeables) was imposed by Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003. KRI’s un-weighted
average most favored nation (MFN) duty rate is 1.3 percent, one of the lowest in the world
(10.8 percent in Turkey and an average of 10 percent in all developing countries). A new
duty schedule was prepared in 2011. It has an average MFN rate of 12.3 percent and 12
non-zero bands. It has not yet been implemented partly because of strong opposition from
businesses engaged in trading (importers). If the Government decides not to implement the
new tariff regime, then it is advisable to introduce an import surcharge of 4-5 percent on
all KRI imports.

3.220. So far, very little progress has been made on WTO accession. Central Government
applied WTO for membership in 2004, however trade-related reforms that need to be
undertaken during the accession process are still pending. Iraq/KRI cannot take advantage
of technical assistance available at WTO and elsewhere, and improve and lock-in trade
reforms. It is recommended to speed up the negotiations and participate in negotiations
actively jointly with the Central Government to become a WTO member.

3.221. The customs system is prone to arbitrary decision, mis-declaration, fraud, and
loss of revenue. KRI has four customs posts. The customs administration faces many
problems including outdated procedures, segmented processes, excessive physical checks
and long delays, limited ICT capability and uncoordinated customs units, lack of
appropriate customs valuation, and very poor integrity and governance. Satellite images of
the number of trucks waiting for passage indicate that border procedures cause fairly
lengthy delays at the border. Plans have been made with the World Bank in the past few
years to reform the customs system but not yet been put in practice. Customs administration
is under central government’s jurisdiction according to Iraqi Constitution.
Recommendations include:

      Work with the central government to put in place a comprehensive reform and
       modernization program focused on adoption of international standards as well as
       investment in much needed customs infrastructure.
      In parallel, continue partial improvements in KRI’s border posts.


                                             98
3.222. This medium to long-term objective needs to be prioritized, sequenced, and
adjusted to evolving circumstances. It also needs collaboration of various ministries led
by the MoFE. Likely international partners include World Bank, World Customs
Organization, and UNCTAD.

3.223. KRG’s current system does not conform to international norms and procedures .
Also, KRG has no technical and institutional capacity to implement a modern system. This
poses a potential threat to public health, and a barrier to exports. Regulatory standards and
enforcement are critical to protecting the health of the KRI population. Within the context
of global trade, many countries seek harmonization of their own regulatory standards and
procedures with those of other countries such as the United States, for example related to
imported and exported food, pharmaceutical products, and medical devices. Regulatory
systems require establishment of standards, mechanisms for inspection/verification and
quality assurance, and mechanisms for enforcement. These should all be practical, efficient
and effective.

3.224. A number of improvements have been made in recent years including setting up
new sampling and testing laboratories in Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Dohuk, signing
agreements with Bureau Veritas, TUV, and Cotecna to carry out verification and issuance
of certification of conformity in countries of origin as well as check points at specified
borders. KRG has also drafted a new law to replace the old law, which has not yet been
sent to the Kurdistan Parliament. The Government should ensure that the system to be put
in place by the new legislation will include separation of standards setting, conformity
assessment and certification, and measurement and calibration functions; investment in
infrastructure and capacity building; encouragement of private laboratories; and
arrangement of mutual recognition programs with trading partners. It is also important to
seek technical assistance from the donor community to build the technical, physical, and
institutional capacity in KRI.

3.225. Export promotion is critical in non-oil sectors. In KRI, export of non-oil products
is negligible. This perpetuates heavy dependence on oil exports and inhibits employment
creation. There is export potential in a number of non-oil subsectors including unprocessed
and processed agricultural products, leather and leather products, petrochemicals,
pharmaceuticals, and construction material, but KRG has not taken any measure to take
advantage of this potential. Recommendations include:

      Prepare a comprehensive export diversification program, which would include
       setting up an export promotion agency, introducing export incentives such as
       duty/tax drawback, dedicated credit to exporters and loan guarantee schemes and
       trade insurance system to ease access to credit and reduce risks.
      Start implementing the four industrial city projects preferably in partnership with
       the private sector.
      Implement a single-factory export processing zones scheme until industrial city
       projects are completed




                                             99
3.226. Discussions are ongoing between KRG and Turkey to take measures to improve
the functioning of border posts and management of trade flows. Informal cross border
trade between KRI and Turkey is important and takes place in both directions either
through the border station (false declaration) or smuggling. Under- invoicing is a common
form of informal imports from Turkey. Close collaboration between KRG and Turkish
Government and between business organizations is needed to reduce informal cross-border
trade. Recommendations include:

      Establish on both sides of the border industrial centers to create employment and
       business opportunities. KRG can plan one of the industrial cities close to the
       Turkish border.
      Restructure fuel subsidies in KRI switching from general to targeted subsidies to
       narrow the price differentials with Turkey.
      Work with the Central Government to implement the customs reform.
      In collaboration with Turkey, strengthen border control system and open new
       border crossings to ease border traffic.

3.227. Economic and trade cooperation agreements are important to benefit from
regional opportunities. Iraq has a few regional and bilateral trade and economic
cooperation agreements. They are effectively defunct. Iraq has recently signed economic
partnership and cooperation agreements with the US, EU, UN agencies, Turkey, and Iran.
Agreement with EU has not yet been ratified. The agreements with the US, EU and UN
Agencies in particular have long lists of technical assistance clauses of which KRG does
not take full advantage of. Recommendations include:

      Press on Central Government for ratification of the EU agreement.
      Make every effort to take full advantage of the technical assistance clauses of all
       economic cooperation agreements not only to strengthen the trade policy, but also
       to improve the legal and institutional environment for the private sector.

       L. LABOR MARKET AND EMPLOYMENT PROMOTION PROGRAMS

3.228. KRG faces the daunting task to increase the size and dynamism of the private
sector where most future employment growth is expected to come from. The employment
challenge comes from the small size of the private sector, a fast growing labor force due to
natural population growth and geopolitical events, and weak policies at MOLSA.
Specifically at the labor market level, the activities of MOLSA can be considered more
appropriately to be pilots rather than programs while there is no centralized coordination,
even operational information, of these activities. The scant records of programs with
various international, regional and bilateral agencies that MOLSA keeps, suggest that
existing programs are not only of small scale but also ad hoc and they depend to a large
extent more on what donors are willing to support than what MOLSA can deliver within
the strategic priorities of the regional government taking into account the capacity of
MOLSA itself.




                                            100
3.229. The structure of the labor market in KRI has a number of unique features shaped
by the region’s history and the resulting economic and population characteristics . For
example, the urbanization rate is high. This has been partly the result of the destruction of
many villages and concurrent concerns about safety in rural areas. Moreover, urbanization
rates tend to rise during the ordinary course of development as a result of internal migration
of citizens in pursue of more economic opportunities in the cities—including higher wages
compared to those in agriculture. Urbanization coupled with the Government’s
commitment to education, including public subsidies to post-secondary education, have
raised education enrollments at all levels. The following statistics summarize the KRI’s
labor market and population dynamics:

        One-in-three of the residents in KRI are in school/college/university;
        Two-out of three are below the age of 25; and
        38,000 post-secondary education graduates of working age (with one-third of them
         being male) are out of the labor force24 compared to the nearly 100,000 officially
         unemployed of all education levels.

3.230. One major challenge in KRI is that the share of public employment exceeds that
of the private sector (53:47). The size of the public sector has been often and severely
criticized, especially in terms of discouraging job seekers to get a private sector job in the
hope that there will be employment also for them in a government post. However, nearly
two-thirds of public sector employment is in what one can label as largely non-discretional
sectors (such as defense and education).

3.231. The employment-to-population rate in KRI stands at 22 percent and is practically
the same as the average for the non-GCC Middle East.25 Looking from a household
perspective, the average household has 5.9 members of whom 4.6 (60 percent) are below
the age of 25, 2 (34 percent) are students, 1.3 (22 percent) are employed and 0.1 (2 percent)
unemployed.26 Figure 3.20 shows that one-in-three residents are in school, two out of three
are below the age of 25, and just over one-in-five employed.




24
   That is, they are “inactive” or “idle,” not even unemployed.
25
   The comparators are Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and Gaza and Yemen where the employment rate
averages 23 percent. See ILO/UNDP (2013).
26
   The information is derived from the 6 rounds of the biannual Labor Force Surveys (LFS) that sampled
nearly 40,000 households, 225,000 individuals and 50,000 workers.

3.232. The employment rate is very much affected by the very low labor force
participation rate of working age women (15-64) at 14 percent that nevertheless rises to
17 percent if students are excluded. The female unemployment rate is very high (at 21
percent overall and 51 percent for the female youth aged 15-24) compared to the male
unemployment rate (4 percent overall and 11 percent for the male youth). The female labor
force participation rate in KRI is indeed among the lowest in the Middle East (with the
exception of Saudi Arabia) though the female unemployment rate is similar to that in the
region (with the exception of Lebanon).

3.233. The rising educated unemployment in KRI is not unique though the speed at
which it rises is. The education sector in KRG had not been well developed until recently.
Its output has been largely absorbed by the Government either in the form of teachers or in
other government jobs. This trend is accentuating as KRG caters more for its own needs
and education institutions are being pressed into the service of the region. What might have
been small-scale provision for the elite is now expanding fast to serve the development
goals and individuals’ aspirations. In fact, the rate of growth of the education sector has
been prodigious, and this is manifested in the labor market as shown in Figure 3.23.

3.234. The increase in education eventually started rising much faster than the public
sector can absorb. This fast growth has led to the emergence of educated unemployment
as a potential challenge. Since a graduate often has the option of accepting a non-graduate
job, rather than be unemployed, it has also led to the issue of graduate unemployment, as
well as gender variances, as shown in Figure 3.24.

3.235. KRG is facing an employment challenge of large proportions even if one assumes
that there will be no significant increase in the annual numbers of job seekers (women,
IDPs, refugees and foreign workers hired at low wages on short term contracts). The
current annual population growth is about 140,000 (even without factoring in refugees and
IDPs) which corresponds to around 2.6 percent of the population. As current labor force
participation rates, this will also be the rate of growth of job seekers. Based on international
estimates of the impact of output growth on employment, a medium case scenario for KRI
suggests that for employment to increase annually by 50,000—a number that would
prevent unemployment from rising—would require future economic growth rates to be
consistently five percent or more per annum in the region. And if future workers were to
be absorbed predominantly by the private sector, the relatively small private sector would
need to increase annually by 10 percent or more. The backlog of inactive educated workers
plus the already educated unemployed and the increasing share of educated workers among
the job seekers means that others who join the labor market with basic—and worse, if


                                                                          104
lower—education may face bleak employment prospects, increased risk of poverty, and
continuing dependence on welfare benefits. In addition to specific policies for employment
and social assistance, policies would therefore be required that would raise “all boats” from
sound macro management to sectoral policies. Most future job seekers will be educated at
further and higher levels.

3.236. The KRG Vision 2020 seeks to create employment opportunities for the
population, and therefore increase self-reliance and reduce dependency on SSN. This
requires private sector growth and the employment therein. In turn, this requires job seekers
to be employable and employers to be able to attract qualified employees. The former
requires a good education and training system. The latter requires good policies. At present
the majority of the labor force is employed in the public sector that also serves as a de facto
SSN. This is draining the budget while it creates a duality compared to the private sector
where wages, benefits and conditions of employment are inferior to those in the public
sector. This is particularly evident in the case of women workers who tend to be employed
in the public sector or not be in the labor force at all.

Moving away from this unsustainable equilibrium requires measures to increase
education enrollments, improve the skill level of job seekers, and a reduction in the role
of Government as an employer. KRG aims at creating an effective labor supply of well-
equipped job seekers and skilled workers through the education and training systems and
market driven incentives. Despite the recent commendable increase in education
enrollment at all levels, especially at post-secondary education, a large share of young
people face the prospect of entering the labor market with little education. One-in-four girls
have dropped out by the age of 15 (compared to one-in-ten boys). And nearly one-third of



                                                105
boys and as almost 40 percent of girls are out of school before they complete secondary
education.

3.237. Existing workers need lifelong upgrading of their skills, especially in the current
era of changing production techniques and job turnover across occupation and sectors .
Investment in human capital does not stop at the end of the school cycle. New recruits
typically need some pre-employment or induction training. Internships and apprenticeships
are critical avenues for enhancing skills at the workplace. Such training will be demand
driven, that is, aligned with and sponsored by employers who will be prepared to co-fund
such training but also be made part of the institutional function of the organization.

3.238. KRG aims at increasing labor demand to accelerate employment creation among
its population, especially in the private sector. This part of the strategy requires a two
pronged approach. First, public administration reforms that would: (i) Downsize the civil
service; (ii) release funds for public investments; (iii) contribute to private sector growth
though better regulatory and legal framework to improve investment climate; (iv) decrease
the duality in the labor market and the educational credentialism that comes with it; and
(v) address training needs for private sector jobs. Second, rationalizing the public sector
and cutting government spending must go hand in hand with promoting private enterprises.
The aim will be to create a highly productive private sector.

3.239. KRG aims at developing an institutional framework based on timely data
analysis, well-designed employment policies, and constructive dialogue among the social
partners. KRG lacks the necessary institutions, statistics and mechanisms that are critical
for analyses, design and implementation of evidence-based measures, monitoring and
evaluation of policies all to be intermediated though a constructive social dialogue among
the stakeholders. A new labor law has already been drafted whose ratification will be
expedited after negotiation and agreement with the social partners. Similarly, a KRG Skills
Development Strategy is pending approval. And the implementation of a Regional
Employment Policy that was inaugurated in May 2015 is lagging.

3.240. Though no substitute for good economic policies and the creation of a healthy
private sector and an effective education system, active labor market policies (ALMPs)
can help, if properly designed. These include employment services, career guidance, job
counselling, labor market information system (LMIS), and support for SMEs. ALMPs can
be useful in countering education and labor market failures, mitigating costs arising from
unemployment by facilitating the reintegration in employment, and promoting efficiency
and equity. They can help reintegrate some groups, including the youth or the displaced
persons.

3.241. Related to this are necessary improvements in social dialogue and the regulatory
environment that would make it easier for businesses to operate and grow. This can be
facilitated through a consultative forum for labor, social and economic issues, and can be
called “Economic and Social Council” (ECOSOC). It can comprise elected representatives
from the relevant constituencies (public and private sectors, and civil society) who may
discuss challenges and advise the executive and legislative branches of government to
address these issues. All proposed reform actions are summarized in the policy matrix
attached as the annex of this report. The table below presents the prioritized timeline for
reform actions in labor market and employment promotion programs.

          M. CAPACITY BUILDING ON MACROECONOMICS STATISTICS

3.242. There is need for continuing capacity building on compilation of economic
statistics that organization such as RAND and UNFPA have started. Under the reform
roadmap framework, training will be provided to selected staff across ministries and the
KRSO. Capacity building will continue addressing the current limitations in grasping
statistical concepts, and techniques and in the understanding of macroeconomic, fiscal, and
social issues and policy.

3.243. Macroeconomic statistics should be improved to provide necessary information
for policy making and monitoring of economic developments in the region . Capacity,
resources (technical staff and electronic infrastructure), methodologies, organization, and
coordination related to data collection and the production of useful and reliable statistics
should be improved. Priority should be given to the systematic collection of production
data by economic sectors and data for the compilation of annual GDP by economic sectors


                                            108
and by main expenditure categories at current and constant prices, and the production of
high frequency indicators for key non-oil economic sectors. Labor force and employment
statistics should also be compiled at least twice a year to support analytical studies and
policies for the development of the non-oil sector and social protection. Much of this is
already being done via the Kurdistan Region Labor Force Survey and CPI calculations,
and the improvements suggested by RAND. The KRSO was also actively involved in the
2012 GDP calculation.

3.244. The Ministry of Planning KRSO would be provided with the resources required
to launch key economic surveys to support key statistics and indicators for agriculture,
manufacturing, construction, and selected services such as education and health, and
employment in the oil and non-oil sectors of the economy. Price statistics would further
improve the reliability of CPI calculations and the development of a Production Price Index
that could improve the compilation the GDP statistics by economic sectors.

     4. SOCIAL SECTOR REFORMS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

4.1. Today, KRI is facing a major social and humanitarian crisis. Adding to long-term
structural issues, the fiscal shock due to declining oil prices and lack of budgetary transfers
from the Baghdad Government, and the increased security spending due to the regional
conflict have had a significant impact on KRI’s economy and its ability to deliver public
services. The scale and speed of the displacement crisis make it challenging for the
Government to deliver basic services especially in the context of a fiscal crisis. In KRI, 1.8
million internally displaced people and Syrian refugees are confronted with numerous and
diverse needs. This is placing strains on the local economy and access to public services.
The Government needs resources and international partnership to address humanitarian
issues.

4.2. In addition to social protection reforms, KRG aims at protecting its human
capital by providing incentives for better health and education. Preserving human capital
requires creating fair opportunities to all. The Government’s strategy is to contribute to
poverty reduction by smoothing consumption and by promoting more equal opportunities
in terms of access to and use of education and health services. Furthermore, through a
rigorous social protection reform, the Government aims at protecting the current poor
population from the impacts of recent shocks as well as bringing social mitigation measures
to correct the potential impact of upcoming economic reforms on the vulnerable people.
Similar to the rest of Iraq, the implementation of the KRG pension system focuses on two
important aspects: i) design and implement a financially and fiscally sustainable, adequate,
equitable, and eventually unified pension system for both private, and public sector
workers; and ii) design and implement a non-contributory universal minimum pensions
(social pensions) in order to protect the elderly from falling into poverty.

     A.    SOCIAL PROTECTION REFORM TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE FROM
                            EXTERNAL SHOCKS

                                     Social Insurance and Pensions

4.3. Since the mid-1950s social insurance programs have been implemented in KRG.
Currently there are two social insurance schemes in KRG.

      i) Pensions scheme covering public sector employees, administered by MoFE, and
          covering the risks of old-age, disability and survivorship;
      ii) Social security scheme covering private sector employees, administered by
          MOLSA, and covering the risks of old-age, disability, and survivorship (i.e.,
          widows and orphans), health, and work injury.

4.4. In 2014, the total pension spending in KRG was estimated to be around ID 1.3
trillion (or 2.8 percent of GDP).27 More than 50 percent of the labor force in KRG is

   For overall Iraq, the total pension spending was estimated at around ID 9 trillion (or 3.8 percent of GDP)
in 2014.


                                                    110
covered by the social insurance (pensions) system. However, most of them are employees
in the public sector. In the private sector, around 84 percent of the labor force is not
covered. Also, around 50 percent of people above the age of 60 in KRG are currently
receiving pension payments (mostly retired public sector employees). The rest of the
elderly have to rely on informal care, or public transfers as social assistance (non-
contributory social safety nets). The main challenges on coverage of pensions and social
insurance are very similar in KRG and rest of Iraq. Less than 2 percent of the working age
population in overall Iraq is covered by the private sector pension scheme, and around 28
percent of the working age population is covered by the public sector pension scheme.

4.5. Both social insurance (pensions) schemes in KRG were designed as PAYG
contributory self-financed mechanisms defined-benefit system. In such a system,
pensions are calculated according to a formula based on wages, and length of service,
where current contributors pay for current beneficiaries. In the private sector, contribution
rates from wages are 17 percent, which are 12 percent from employers, and 5 percent from
employees (14 percent for pensions, 2 percent for work injury, and 1 percent for sickness
and maternity). In the public sector, contribution rates from wages are 19 percent which
are 12 percent for employer (Government), and 7 percent for employee (only pensions are
covered in the case of the public sector). The major difference between KRG, and the rest
of Iraq is that during the post-war period between 2003 and 2006, new retirees from the
two schemes in Iraq received “flat-emergency” pension payments instead of regular
pensions as computed according to the Social Security Law. Today, there are around 2


                                            111
million people receiving such pensions from that period directly from the federal budget,
while there are an increasing number of beneficiaries (currently more than 200,000)
receiving pensions from a pension fund, also Pay-As-You-Go Defined-Benefit (PAYG-
DB), that was created in 2006. In KRI, on the other hand, no pension fund was created and
public sector employees’ contributions are directly paid to the general budget, and pension
payments are directly paid by the general budget as well. Table compares public and private
sector pension schemes in KRI and the rest of Iraq.

4.6. The public sector scheme has currently a support ratio28 of three contributors for
each beneficiary (682,000 contributors vs. 246,639 beneficiaries). The private sector
scheme has a high support ratio of 120 contributors for each beneficiary (78,525
contributors vs. 652 beneficiaries). However, it is important to note that the private sector
scheme also pays more than 2,000 “end of service indemnity” payments per year to those
members who end a job contract but do not qualify for a pension.

4.7. The benefit formulas for pension calculations in both sectors have high accrual
rates by international standards (2.5 percent),29 and are based on last wages (the three
last wages in the case of the private sector scheme, and the last wage in the public sector
scheme). Qualifying conditions are different in both schemes. In the private sector the
minimum length of service is 20 years if the retirement age is reached (55 for women, and
60 for men), or 30 and 25 years of service for men and women respectively at any other
age, otherwise individuals can only receive a lump-sum payment, instead of a regular

year of service.

pension. In the public sector the minimum length of service is 15 years, the minimum
retirement age 50, and compulsory retirement age is 63, according to the law.

4.8. The current legislative framework for both schemes is not well defined.
Compliance in KRI and the rest of Iraq has been quite different although originally they
had in place the same legal framework. An amendment of Law 27 of 2006, which mandated
the creation of a fund, included as well the integration of the pension schemes for the public
and the private sectors in Iraq. A few steps have already been taken in this respect, and a
new Pensions Law was in place in 2014 in Iraq (Law 9/2014). However, such law does not
respect many of the principles based on international best practices, and Iraq is in the
process of undertaking amendments to the law. On the other hand, in KRI, there is partial
compliance with the previous Law 27, however no fund has been created. With respect to
the private sector pension schemes, in KRI and rest of Iraq, there is a partial compliance
(full implementation has never taken place) with the same law 1971 with minor differences
and amendments.

4.9. The current main challenges of the social insurance system in KRG can be
summarized in four points:

 (i)    Low administrative capacity of the social insurance schemes in KRG, which
        requires significant upgrading, and there is need for appropriate databases, record-
        keeping, and information technology systems. At this moment, the administration
        and assessment of the schemes is very difficult. Neither one of the schemes have
        adequate financial governance of administrative operations and social insurance
        benefits.

 (ii)   Based on the current design, the public sector scheme is financially not self-
        sustainable. In fact, today the revenues from contributions are already not covering
        the pension expenditures (in 2014, revenues from contributions were ID 1.1 trillion
        while pension expenditures were already ID 1.2 trillion). The private sector scheme
        is not yet in deficit given its large support ratio. However, it is financially
        unsustainable—in the long run, revenues from contributions will not be sufficient
        to cover pension spending. The scheme is also regressive (it penalizes low income
        earners in favor of high income earners). Unless some reforms are implemented, an
        increased amount of resources from the general budget will be required in order to
        maintain such schemes.

 (iii) The system is fragmented, the public sector scheme is more secure and generous
       than the private sector scheme and this creates distortions in the labor market,
       attracting more employees towards the public sector, and negatively affecting
       private sector development. Also, labor mobility is restricted by the current
       qualifying conditions of pension benefits, and the lack of pension portability rights.
       An individual working for the public sector would need to contribute at least 15
       years in order to qualify for a pension. If the individual leaves public service before
       this minimum length of service, such right is lost.




                                             113
     (iv) The system also suffers from incomplete coverage. While the labor force in the
          public sector is almost 100 percent covered, around 84 percent of the labor force in
          the private sector is not covered at all. Also, in the private sector the contribution
          density is low and irregular, and most contributors receive only returns of
          contributions and will never be able to qualify for a regular pension.

Policy Response

4.10. The Vision 2020 document indicates that reforms will include the creation of a
regional pension system that will be attractive for the growing private sector. The goal is
to design and implement a pension system that could provide a fair alignment between the
contribution rate, with retirement age, and pension benefits (based on length of service and
wages). Besides being adequate, the system needs to be financially sustainable, as well as
economically and administratively efficient (particularly allowing public sector employees
to move easily to the private sector).

4.11. KRG’s strategic direction involves reforms in two areas: The first strategy will
reform current social insurance system towards integrating public, private, and other
pension schemes (occupational). This strategy will address the main challenges of
administrative capacity, pension system designs, and fragmentation. The second strategy
will design and implement: i) conventional and alternative mechanisms to expand social
insurance coverage; ii) social pensions; and iii) an Unemployment Insurance (UI) program.

4.12. KRG aims at reforming current social insurance systems towards integrating
public, private, and other pension schemes. The strategy is to design a new pension system
(including disability, survivors and old-age programs) that will respect the principles of a
well-designed pension system based on international best practices. While there is no single
best way of structuring a public pension system, the choice is by no means arbitrary, and
any proposed reforms will be: (i) considered with respect for the KRG’s enabling
conditions and capacities; and (ii) evaluated using generally accepted principles of pension
reform developed from international best practices. Such principles include adequacy,30
financial sustainability,31 and coverage, but also fairness, economic and administrative
efficiency, affordability, as well as predictability. The system will cover both private and
public sector employees. Other current special schemes in KRG (such as occupational
schemes for university professors) will also be considered under the same umbrella.

4.13. Implementation of this strategy will result in considerable cost savings,
particularly in the medium and long-term.32 In 2014, revenues from contributions in the

30
   Benefits are adequate when they (i) provide sufficient income to protect participants from falling into
poverty in the event that they become disabled or after they have retired and (ii) provide a reliable mechanism
for smoothing consumption between a participant’s working years and his or her old age.
31
   A pension system is sustainable only when it has the capacity to pay current —and future—benefits over a
long horizon under reasonable assumptions without shifting substantial burdens to future generations and
without having to cut benefits, increase contributions, or change qualifying conditions. This can only be
accomplished if pension systems are designed and periodically tweaked using careful actuarial modeling.
32
   A pension scheme involves long-term promises, and consequently the full effect of any reform will also
be in the long-term.


                                                     114
public pension sector scheme in KRG represented around ID 1.1 trillion, while pension
spending represented already more than ID 1.2 trillion. The scheme is already in deficit.
Considering that the number of contributors (civil servants, and military) has been
increasing from 444,350 in 2008 to more than 680,000 in 2014, the implicit pension debt
(pension promises to contributors, and pensioners) has also been considerably increasing.
In the absence of any reform, the current annual pension payments of more than ID 1.2
trillion (to less than 300,000 beneficiaries at the moment) is expected to exponentially
increase. In the absence of reform, pension spending is expected to increase to more than
ID 3 trillion in less than five years, which would represent a deficit of the pension scheme
of more than ID 2 trillion. In the medium and long-term, pensions spending and deficit are
estimated to increase even further. The cost savings of implementing the strategy could
represent between ID 2 and 5 trillion in the short term, more than ID 10 trillion in the
medium term, and more than ID 20 trillion in the long term. These cost savings in the
pension system could be used for other deserving programs in KRG, such as health and
education. The implementation will also result in a clear understanding of a transparent
financing mechanism of the pension system. Public and private sector employees will have
the same pension rights and consequently this new pension system implemented under this
strategy will eliminate some of the current obstacles to labor market flexibility.

4.14. KRG aims at designing and implementing conventional and alternative
mechanisms to expand social insurance coverage, and social pensions. As indicated in
the Vision 2020 document, the new pension system will be attractive to the growing private
sector. Currently almost 85 percent of the labor force in the private sector is not covered
by any type of pension scheme, while almost 100 percent of the labor force in the public
sector is covered. In this respect the objective of this strategy is to expand coverage in the
private sector. The strategy is to expand coverage beyond the current 16 percent of the labor
force in the private sector to ensure old-age income security for all.

4.15. Implementation of this strategy in KRI is expected to result in an increase of
thousands of contributors from the private sector. The implementation is expected to
result in an increase of the number of people receiving pensions above the age of 65. More
than 100,000 people above the age of 65 that are currently not receiving any pension will
be receiving one when this strategy is implemented.

4.16. KRG aims at designing and implementing an unemployment insurance program.
One policy priority indicated in the Vision 2020 is the development of a comprehensive
unemployment insurance system. This system will protect individuals from unexpected job
loss, and will raise the security of working in the private sector.

4.17. The KRI population benefits from a number of schemes that could be classified
as non-labor income. The PDS, cash transfers, remittances (internal and external), Zakat
in addition to the government subsidies on some basic commodities and services represent
the main social safety net schemes. While labor incomes account for 58 percent of the total
income of the bottom 10 percent in KRI, its share falls to 42 percent for the bottom 10
percent living in the south of Iraq. At the same time, ration or PDS transfer receipts as a
source of non-labor income are also smaller in KRI, accounting for less than 20 percent of
non-labor incomes on average, and 42 percent of non-labor incomes among the bottom
decile. The relatively low share of ration transfers in KRI is compensated by relatively high
shares of pension and capital income. Overall, pensions make up between 22 to 30 percent
of average non-labor incomes, but are roughly half as important for the bottom 10 percent
of the consumption distribution. The PDS budget allocated for KRG for 2015 amounts to
approximately US$357 million (assuming 17 percent of the Iraq total PDS budget for 2015
of US$2.1 billion). The PDS is almost universally distributed. Based on the results of the
IHSES 2007-2012, the PDS reaches 98 percent of the total population (about 5.4 million)
then it is expected that an amount of US$68 is allocated per beneficiary. It is important to
note that the distribution is not dependent on the size or the poverty level of the household.
The share of recipients of the PDS who are poor is shown in Figure 4.3.

4.18. MOLSA provides limited institutional care for the elderly, orphans, and
physically and mentally handicapped children and adults. In 2014, MOLSA maintained
a number of facilities, including kindergartens, orphanages, institutes for the disabled,


                                                   117
 elderly homes, and cooperative society workshops—which altogether served
 approximately 7,691 individuals,33 as shown in Table 4.4. However, many of these
 facilities lack essential equipment and supplies and are not designed to promote
 independent living or integration into society. In view of the limited number of
 beneficiaries and the restricted scope of work of these facilities and programs, their effect
 on the livelihoods of households and beneficiaries is practically negligible.

 4.19. MOLSA is the main agency in charge of providing unconditional cash-transfer
 (UCT) assistance in KRG. This program uses categorical targeting in channeling cash
 assistance to specific groups that are considered vulnerable. The eight categories eligible
 for the UCT through the SSN Department are: (i) orphans; (ii) married students; (iii) those
 with disabilities caused by aging; (iv) those with disabilities caused by illness; (v) the blind;
 (vi) the paralyzed; (vii) families of the imprisoned and missing persons; and (viii) the
 unemployed. The Women’s Social Care Department covers categories, including children
 of divorced women, divorced women, widowed women, and disabled women. The total
 financial assistance by beneficiaries is presented in Figure 4.3. Prior to 2012, a financial
 assistance of ID 30,000 per household was given monthly. In 2012, this allowance was
 increased to ID 150,000 per household, and in 2014, a total of 191,482 households were
 benefiting from both family and disability allowances.

4.20. The categorical targeting of MOLSA does not consider the poverty line nor the
size of the household leading to high leakage and inequity. The transfer of ID 150,000 is
allocated to beneficiary households regardless of size of the households or its poverty level,
which increases considerably the risk of exclusion and inclusion errors.34 As for the cash
transfer for disability cases, these are provided based on a medical report issued by a
specialized commission. This is subject to some controversy, as reported by MOLSA
officials. The medical reports leave ample room for interpretation thus the continuous
variations and increased number of disability beneficiaries without any consideration for
either poverty line or household size. The UCT’s use of broad social categories instead of
more effective targeting mechanisms to determine eligibility (such as Proxy-Means Testing
or geographical targeting) explains why the majority of the poor do not benefit from this
program as shown in Table 4.5.

4.21. In looking at the distribution of the population of KRI per quintile, and by
plotting the number of beneficiaries from the UCT in each of the quintiles, it is noticed
that a considerable percentage of beneficiaries are distributed in the richest quintiles. As
shown in Figure 4.4, only 11.3 percent of the population in the lower consumption quintile
(i.e., the poorest) are receiving cash transfers from MOLSA. The right panel shows that
UCT expenditures benefit a significant share of households in the richest quintiles. It is
evident that the UCT program suffers from weak coverage—many poor households are not
benefitting and leakage (many rich households do benefit).

  Exclusion errors refer to excluding eligible (i.e., below the poverty line) households, while inclusion errors refer to
inclusion of ineligible households in the cash transfer program.

4.22. At the same time, the implementation modality differs between governorates. The
distribution of beneficiaries from MOLSA assistance per governorates is seen in Figure
4.5. Though using the same laws and regulations, the processing differs between
governorates in terms of collecting applications from households expressing interest to
benefit from the UCT, the use of Information Technology, processing for eligibility,
selection of beneficiaries, receipt of transfers, and monitoring and evaluation.

4.23. The discussion on adequate targeting and distribution of beneficiaries per region
comes in line with the work undertaken by the World Bank in looking at the poverty
map. The poverty map is a tool that combines the strengths of the household budget survey
and population and housing census to estimate poverty rate at small level of geographical
disaggregation. That is why looking at poverty alleviation and targeting are inter-linked.



                                                       120
The distinction between poor area and areas where the poor live is an important issue and
this is where targeting comes into application. That is why the most obvious use of poverty
maps is for targeting of antipoverty programs. Based on the 2012 Household Survey data,
the World Bank report “Where are Iraq’s Poor: Mapping Poverty in Iraq” highlighted
that:

   1- Sulaymaniyah has the lowest rates of poverty in all of Iraq. In more than two-fifths
      of its Nahiyas, estimated poverty rates are 2 percent or lower, and all but two
      Nahiyas have headcount rates of less than 10 percent. However, the number of
      beneficiaries from MOLSA unconditional cash transfer program is very high.
   2- In Dohuk, the overall poverty rates are low and roughly 6 percent. Estimated
      poverty headcount rate at the Nahiya level range from 3 percent in some Nahiyas
      to 10 percent in others. However, the largest number of poor persons are in two
      Nahiyas: Dohuk qada center (10,600) and Zakho qada center (11,600). These
      Nahiyas are the largest in terms of population in Dohuk. The data looking at number
      of beneficiaries for the UCT reveals otherwise that Dohuk has the lowest numbers.
      This raises questions about the selection methodology and stresses once more the
      need to reconsider the techniques used for targeting.

4.24. The role of social workers has weakened due to the changes of laws and
instructions, and lack of sufficient staffing. The process of raising awareness of
communities to the program, filling in applications, guiding households through the
application all the way to follow up and case management need to be done by trained and
dedicated social workers. The role of social workers as part of the administrative structure
of MOLSA existed at one point in time, but the changes in laws did not observe well the
function. Again, in view of regional differences and the uneven availability of resources
and assistance, the role of social workers has been maintained in Dohuk to a certain extent,
unlike other governorates. Social workers in Dohuk do still follow up on households’
annual updates. In Erbil and Sulaymaniyah, however, households are expected to take the
initiative to come into MOLSA offices to fill in their annual update. This remains
occasional without any proper means for follow up or validation. That is why the number
of households who enter the system and those who are expected to graduate for any reason
remains unknown, leading to an additional burden on the resources needed for the program.

         Figure 4.6: Total Number of Beneficiaries from the UCT (left axis), and amounts
                              transferred 2010-2014 (ID million)




4.25. On the implementation level, the transfer amount increased from ID 30,000 to
ID 150,000 in 2011 and kept the same since then. The amount of monthly cash transfer
remains very close to the poverty line defined informally for KRI at ID 142,000. The
spending in 2014 on the cash transfer programs amounts to 1.3 percent on non-oil GDP
which is considered relatively high yet only 11.8 percent of the poorest quintile benefit of
UCT.

4.26. Looking at poverty necessitates a broad perspective that touches on human
development in general bringing the dimensions of both education and health . These
two factors are directly linked to the definition of social protection. In KRI, poverty levels
show disparities across regions, as well as urban versus rural areas. In education, The
results of a UNICEF study show that the number of out –of-school children- of age ranging
between 5 and 14 years) has reached 127,115 in KRI (69,989 girls and 57,126 boys).35 This
dimension of school exclusion shows that there are gender-specific differences. On the
health front, although there is considerable reported variability across the governorates,
neonatal deaths (<1 month of age) account for about one-third of all infant (0-11 months
of age) deaths (1,270 of 3,833), and infant deaths account for about two-thirds of all under-
five child deaths (3,833 of 5,776, 66 percent). The infant mortality rate (27.09 per 1,000
live births) and the under-five child mortality rate (40.83 per 1,000 live births) in KRI are
considerably higher than comparators.36

4.27. The absence of citizen engagement goes in parallel with lack of a communication
plan for MOLSA. Citizen engagement is defined as a two-way interaction between citizens
and governments or the private sector, which give citizens a stake in decision-making with
the objective to improve intermediate and final development outcomes. In addition,

participatory mechanisms are important to make governments and service providers
accountable. It is a form of participatory feedback and monitoring by beneficiaries and
communities. MOLSA programs are not designed to account for any feedback. Households
are not well aware of the social programs, the conditions for eligibility, and how the
selection process of beneficiaries is done. A separate initiative at Dohuk, where the SSN
department with assistance from USAID, has been able to develop a system of data
collection and uses technology made available to the public to ensure a proper follow up
and feedback from beneficiaries. However, a Grievance Redressing37 mechanism was not
put in place in the initial design of the program. Complaints could be submitted but no
uniform processing has been established.

Policy Response

4.28. KRG Vision 2020 states “Our aim is to improve living conditions of the poor,
address the causes of poverty and foster upward mobility. Our goal is also redesigning
our programs so that by 2020, assistance is targeted to those in need and creates
economic opportunities for all.” The current situation in KRI requires reformative efforts
to get aligned with the aims of the Vision, including enhancing social care services.
Implementation the Vision 2020 will be supported through principles of better targeting,
better care, and overall inclusion. This is in line with the strategic directions of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy set by KRG in 2009.

4.29. The KRG Social Protection Strategic Framework suggests the initiation of a
targeting methodology that sets up the poverty line to determine eligibility for financial
assistance. The process would generate a database that could be adopted in the reform of
the PDS if it is intended to limit the distribution to the lowest quintile of the population as
determined by the targeting methodology (Proxy Means Testing and geographical
targeting). The process will go in parallel with what the GoI had initiated by first adopting
a new Social Protection Law that brings in best practices in targeting and case management.
This had helped the clean-up of the database and reduced considerably the rate of exclusion
and inclusion, and set up the way for the application of new parameters. Along the same
lines in KRI, it is expected that the suggested programs to initiate targeting for the cleaning
of the current database using poverty line as a parameter, as a first step, is expected to
reduce exclusion errors and reach more of the estimated 12 percent of the population who
live below the poverty line.

4.30. KRG will adopt poverty levels as a dimension in the selection of beneficiaries
from social assistance program. This will allow KRG to have a broader perspective in
linking vulnerability to the economic variations which in turn affects the livelihoods and
consumption of all. Household welfare levels will be the determinant of whether eligible
for assistance or not. Adequate targeting mechanisms allow for adequate coverage thus
greater impact in more equitable and effective manners.


37
   A Grievance Redress Mechanism is a system by which queries or clarifications about the project are
responded to, problems that arise out of implementation are resolved and grievances are addressed
effectively.


                                                123
4.31. KRG will restructure its social care services to meet the objectives of providing
planned coordinated and effective services with a systematic outreach to beneficiaries.
Social assistance programs at MOLSA suffer fragmentation and lack of coordination. This
has implications in terms of limited and scattered coverage, and increase in the likelihood
of inclusion and exclusion errors, weak referral systems and limited awareness among staff
and beneficiaries about other programs and benefits which become key obstacles to
children’s, families’ and communities’ access to essential benefits and services.

                           B.       EDUCATION SECTOR REFORMS

4.32. The progress made in the KRI in the past decade has been commendable. The
success in the KRI education sector should be attributed to the Government’s commitment
to upgrade the education provision system in its governorates. The KRI Government is
committed to implementing educational reforms of inclusive and quality K-12 education,
relevant secondary education and transparency and accountability in education provision.
The reforms are formalized in the Vision 2020, a policy reform roadmap that was also
aligned with Iraq National Education Strategy (INES 2011-2020) of quality curriculum and
improved teaching to prepare students for the demands of the global knowledge economy.

4.33. The increase in the number of education institutions has helped KRG respond to
growing demand for education. The region established 2,200 K-12 schools during 2003-
2012. In addition, the number of tertiary education institutions increased from 3 in 2003 to
28 in 2015. Furthermore, net enrollment rates for post-primary education have increased
substantially between 2007 and 2012 in KRI, from 48 to 61 percent at the intermediate
level, and from 23 to 38 percent at the secondary level.38 In order to further improve the
school environment, the government plans to have libraries, laboratories and introduce
technology use in classrooms for students to enjoy cutting edge learning. Moreover, to
diversify student learning interests and improve perception of schools among children as a
fun learning place, the schools should offer extracurricular activities, such as sports, arts,
theater and music beginning in the primary level.




38
  The education system in KRI now consists of two tiers (primary and secondary) instead of the three tiers
(primary, intermediate and secondary). However, the new two tier system has not been fully implemented.

     Source: World Bank, "Poverty, Inclusion and Welfare in Iraq, 2007-2012."

4.34. Education in the KRI has been steadily improving, but much remains to be done.
In 2007, KRI’s working age population was much more likely than that of the rest of Iraq
to be illiterate or have less than primary education. In 2007, for instance, the share of
working age adults in KRI with less than primary education was 23 percentage points
higher than the national average of 34 percent. However, outcomes have been improving
over time and the deficit is being gradually bridged. Those 30 and above (in 2012) started
out with much higher levels of illiteracy and incomplete primary education relative to Iraq
and lower completion levels of education. In contrast, the pattern is reversed for those age
29 and below. These young people are much more likely than their counterparts to have
higher levels of education.39

4.35. School infrastructure needs to be improved. The education system has expanded
access rapidly in the past decade, nearly doubling the number of students from 2003 to
2013 (Vernez et al, 2014). However, expansion of the school system has not kept pace with
demand for school spaces. With the influx of IDPs and refugees into the KRI, school
crowding and infrastructure shortages have likely worsened. Many schools—in particular
in rural areas—lack key basic infrastructure. Potable water and sewage connections are
missing in a quarter of all KRI schools (40 percent of rural schools). Both construction of
new schools, as well as improved water and sanitation for existing schools remain key to
improving access to education.

  Gross enrollment rates in KRI are above 100 percent even at the intermediate and secondary levels, the
highest in the country. Moreover, net enrollment rates for post-primary education have increased
substantially between 2007 and 2012 in the KRI, from 48 to 61 percent at the intermediate level, and from
23 to 38 percent at the secondary level. The large differences between gross and net enrollment result from
the KRG’s overreliance on holding children back in school when they face acade mic troubles. In 2012, only
70 percent of children passed 9th grade, and 40 percent passed 12th grade.

4.36. Due to increased demand, further steps need to be taken to improve infrastructure
and the quality of the education system. School infrastructure and education quality are
closely linked in the KRI. The number of Kurdish kindergarten students grew by 50 percent
over a five-year period (2005-2010), as the Ministry of Education put emphasis on making
schools for this grade level more available. In terms of education services, both elementary
and high schools are within easy reach everywhere, particularly in KRI, where elementary
and high schools are reachable within 6 and 10 minutes respectively. According to the data,
student enrollment nearly doubled from the 2003-2004 to the 2012-2013 academic years
(Figure 4.8). Similarly, both the number of students and the number of schools doubled or
close to doubled during that same time period. Due to increase in the birth rate and the
KRG’s commitment to universal basic education for both boys and girls, enrollment in KRI
schools is projected to increase approximately by 69,000 to 111,000 students annually over
the next decade or so (RAND and KRG Ministry of Planning 2014). Therefore, while
schools are within easy reach the increased demand for education has caused increased
crowding, reliance on double shifts, and a school infrastructure shortage.

4.37. Insufficient instructional time, exacerbated by double shifts, is another problem
for teachers. Teachers in KRI schools do not have enough hours in the school day to fully
cover the new curriculum. This problem is exacerbated by a shortage of school buildings
that forced many schools to teach in shifts due to increased number of refugee and IDP
students, further reducing instructional time in classes. Many schools have had to
implement two or more shifts, and some schools have had to begin sharing a building with
another school, which is affecting quality of teaching and learning. KRI children in double
shifts receive 539 hours of instructional time in grades 1-6 (in comparison with the OECD
average of 794 hours) and 595 hours of instructional time in grades 7-9 (in comparison


                                                  127
with the OECD average of 892 hours). Much needs to be done in this area to tackle
insufficient instructional time due to overcrowding, multiple shifts, and lack of school
facilities. One solution to this problem (until there is adequate supply of school buildings
to reduce the double shifts) is to increase the number of school days from 170 to 190 per
year.

4.38. KRG is dedicated to reforming the education sector. Important reforms already
implemented to date include development of an upgraded curriculum, mandatory education
up to grade 9 (as previously mandatory education was through grade 5), the requirement
that teachers have a bachelors degree (the previous requirement was for two years of
tertiary education), and more. Furthermore, to simplify the education system, the
government divided the education levels into two instead of three categories: basic and
secondary levels only. The basic level, also the compulsory level, consists from grades 1-
9 and the secondary level now includes grades from 10-12. However, the two tier system
has not been fully implemented in all the schools in KRI. The Government has developed
implementation strategies for educational priorities. The priority to ensure equal access of
K-12 education has been emphasized and action has been taken to increase enrollment and
access in KRI governorates’ schools. There has been a plan to build, staff and equip 9000
new classrooms in the next five years. Since 2014, the government added special
Kindergarten classes to existing primary schools to accommodate increasing early
childhood education demand in the region. The KRI government did recognize the diverse
school age population and responded by introducing teaching in Arabic, English along with
the existing Kurdish language instruction. Also in the beginning of 2016, the government
rolled out a pilot in 100 schools to introduce, math, science and English classes at the
primary level. The teachers responsible for teaching these subjects have been trained in
English language teaching.

4.39. To offer quality education, the Government is improving the formal
qualifications of teachers. While up to 60 percent of the teachers in KRI have received
some training on the new curriculum, it has still been insufficient. The minimum
qualification of teachers has been upgraded to a four years bachelor’s degree from a two
years diploma. New universities have been set up under the Ministry of Higher Education
to offer a four year teaching degree to prospective teachers. In addition to universities, three
new teacher training institutes have been set up in the respective governorates in KRI. In
2015, the Government in collaboration with the University of Birmingham, offered 70 local
instructors a four-month teacher training opportunity in UK with daily sessions of 150
minutes each. Furthermore, efforts have also been made for continuous in-service
professional development of teachers at a newly established teachers training institute
(Professional Development Centers) in Erbil.

4.40. Another important action plan within the provision of quality education priority
is the revision of the outdated curriculum. The respective ministries in KRG rightly dealt
with the curriculum problem by adopting a phased approach to curriculum revision and
development to be implemented across K-12. In collaboration with the UNICEF and EU,
the government also revised the outdated, ‘learning for testing’ curriculum with more
‘learner-centered,’ play based curriculum. In order to ensure that quality curriculum is



                                              128
taught by trained professionals, the government plans to establish a Quality Assurance
Directorate within the Ministry of Education. The aim is to oversee the performance of
students and assess their learning capacity to better prepare them to compete in
international assessments, such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science
Study (TIMSS). Furthermore, to establish student performance benchmarks, the
government needs to update and implement the Education Management Information
Systems (EMIS) to identify, gather and analyze data on select student performance
indicators over time. The Government can also explore opportunities to forge public private
partnerships to establish and administer student assessments that can bring student learning
assessments at par with assessments in international schools. Therefore, to develop suitable
PPPs in education arena, government officials need to improve their own capacity in
identifying private parties and developing successful PPPs.

4.41. To ensure inclusive and quality education reforms from preprimary to grade 12
the Government recognized the policy priority for increased accountability and
transparency. The Government plans to develop clear roles and responsibilities within the
ministries, especially within Ministry of Education. In a similar vein of clear
responsibilities, government aims close collaboration within ministries and school
management and grant more autonomy to schools to promptly address day to day issues.
In 2011-2013 government with the support from British Council piloted revised school
standards for principals and teachers. Also lines of communication between school
management and parents should be open. Even within this policy action, the use of EMIS
can be beneficial to assess school performance through performance indicators that can
channel parent feedback into improvement of education provision.

4.42. Following the development of a solid education foundation, the Government’s
next priority is to improve the capacity and quality of secondary level TVET. The
Government plans to establish an independent Technical Vocational Education and
Training (TVET) Governing Council to study the trends in local and international job
markets, coordinate between employers and education institutions to offer new and
innovative TVET options to secondary level students that include practical workplace
experiences. The Government also recognized the need to educate students on the
importance of relevant post-secondary TVET training to stay competitive in the job market.
The PPPs between the Government Council and the major private corporations could help
schools align the curriculum and train secondary school TVET graduates with skills sought
after in the private sector rather than to rely solely on the public sector for limited work
opportunities.

Putting in Place an Effective Technical Vocational Education and Training Program

4.43. An adequate skill pool is a prerequisite for private sector development. Private
sector employers are increasingly emphasizing ‘hard’ or technical skills, as well as ‘soft’
skills such as customer service and teamwork. Supply for this pool comes from the formal
education system, which includes general or regular education (basic, secondary, and
postsecondary) as well as TVET (secondary and postsecondary). In KRI, both the general
and TVET systems face significant challenges in terms of access (adequacy of facilities)
and quality (curriculum and teacher training). Employers cite gaps in both technical and


                                            129
non-technical skills, thus, these institutions are not providing for adequate supply in the
skill pool. For example, a 2012 RAND survey of business establishments in the KRI found
that the most difficult occupations to hire into include technical occupations (37 percent of
employers cited this deficit) and sales and customer service (25 percent), the later
emphasizing more ‘soft skills.’ In KRI, TVET programs should be designed to provide the
occupational-specific technical training, but also provide students with onsite job
experience through internships and other direct linkages to promote practical experience
and development of soft skills that can only be honed on the job.

4.44. Labor market indicators point to a skills deficit and skills mismatch as being one
of the problems in KRI. According to the 2011 Iraq Business Enterprise Survey, 34 percent
of the firms interviewed in Iraq identified inadequacy of skills in the local labor market as
a constraint, which is almost 13 percentage points higher than the average in the MENA
region and 7 percentage points higher than among all countries. Furthermore, the RAND
survey of business establishments found that 40 percent of employers indicated that
graduates of secondary schools are poorly or very poorly prepared for work, and 25 percent
of employers indicated that graduates of postsecondary institutions were not prepared for
work (Constant et al., 2014). Among the deficiencies cited including lack of experience,
lack of educational qualifications, and lack of appropriate skills.

4.45. There are three main types of TVET education in the KRI. The first is provided
by the Ministry of Education, which oversees secondary-level vocational education. Until
recently, there has been little investment in these schools in terms of curriculum
development, teacher training, and facilities upgrades, and that has contributed to a few
students wanting to attend these schools. With the help of GTZ and RAND, the Ministry
of Education prepared a restructuring program for formal technical education.
Implementation of the program has not yet started because of lack of funds. The second
type of TVET are the postsecondary TVET institutions, which fall under the auspices of
the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHESR). There are both two-
year technical institutes and four-year technical colleges that offer a range of degree
programs and specializations. These institutions draw on graduates from both secondary
vocational and secondary general education schools. The third source of TVET
programming is overseen by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MoLSA), which has
retraining centers in six areas in KRI. These programs are geared for adults who have not
completed their basic or secondary education, or require retraining to improve their human
capital for the job market. These centers are not adequately equipped for skills-
development and face a number of critical constraints such as outdated curricula and
teaching methods; inadequate number of trainers with the right skills; poorly equipped
physical facilities and inadequate equipment; no involvement of private companies in the
program (apprenticeship, internship, on-the-job-training); and no after training follow up
and placement services. These centers will need to be part of a broader strategy of
improving TVET in the KRI to meet the skill needs of the private sector, and will be an
important tool to provide opportunities for job seekers to obtain training that will improve
their job prospects.

4.46. Strengthening the education and vocational training system in partnership with
the private sector and curricula reform to better reflect the technical skills sought by the


                                            130
private sector will be important in bridging the skills gap and expanding employment in
the private sector. Traditionally, the pay, hours and benefits premium earned by public
sector employees relative to those who work in the private sector inhibit the ability of the
latter to attract and retain talent. The most urgent and significant need is to strengthen the
secondary TVET system run by the Ministry of Education and adult training run by the
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. It is also important to sustain the improvements in
both the general secondary and postsecondary system and develop strong linkages to
employers. This will require substantial technical assistance, planning and coordination
that could be better put together under multi-donor funding.

4.47. Secondary, postsecondary, and adult training TVET requires close coordination
between multiple stakeholders including the MoE, MOHESR, and MoLSA, as well as
employers, to ensure there is consistency across standards and the development of
pathways for career development and progression that expand the options for students to
transition into the labor market or continue into postsecondary education. RAND has
developed a roadmap to implement improvements in TVET including a recommended
governance structure, upgrading the curricula and instructor skills, and putting in place a
mechanism to guide students beginning in late basic education and continuing into
secondary education to advise students about their options and means to achieve their
professional goals (Constant et al., 2014).

4.48. There are a number of donor-supported TVET programs in KRI funded by
UNIDO, ILO, SIDA, and GIZ. However, they are designed and implemented
independently with different curriculum and teaching methods without any coordination
and relation with the government’s own programs. These programs should be rigorously
evaluated, and a cost benefit analysis conducted. Early evidence from observation studies
suggest that the outcomes appear to be limited and the costs high. Effective coordination
of these programs at the MoP is necessary for more productive use of scarce donor
money.40 Transforming the existing TVET structures into a modernized system requires a
holistic, collective and coordinated reform efforts, in close collaboration within and across
concerned line ministries as well as donor partners and education stakeholders. In order to
prevent mismatch between the TVET graduates’ skills and labor market’s demand, it is
essential that the TVET reform to be viewed and tackled within a comprehensive sector
reform framework.

4.49. The table below presents the prioritization of proposed reform actions in the
education sector.

                                C.       HEALTH SECTOR

4.50. Despite improvements during the last decade, the health sector in the KRI is
facing major challenges. The influx of 1.8 million IDPs and Syrian refugees has placed
an additional burden on the system, particularly in the areas where these populations are
concentrated. All KRI residents are eligible for care that is nearly free of charge in public


                                              132
hospitals and primary health care centers, but these hospitals and centers are often
overwhelmed, fall below international norms for quality, and deliver services inefficiently.
Almost all physicians work only a fraction (usually less than fifty percent) of the 30 hours
per week they are contracted and paid for in the public sector before leaving for their private
office practices (this is known as “dual practice”). Most primary care is delivered in a
comprehensive network of primary health care centers (PHCs) which are located
throughout the region. Basic preventive and curative services are not always provided due
to insufficient numbers and qualifications of medical professionals, and absent or non-
functional equipment (e.g., basic laboratory equipment; dental chair or x-ray machine for
dentist). Although there are some very small co-pays for public sector health services,
almost all health care is financed by the KRG budget.

4.51. KRI witnessed improvements in health status as evidenced by achieved progress
in infant and child mortality, immunization coverage and under five nutritional status,
but concerted efforts are still required to maintain gains and realize further
improvements. Infant mortality was estimated at 28 deaths per 1,000 live births in the KRI
in 2011, contrasting with the 32 deaths per 1,000 live births registered in overall Iraq.
Similarly, child mortality averaged 32 deaths per 1,000 live births in the KRI, while the
general child mortality rate for Iraq was estimated at 37 deaths per 1,000 live births. With
respect to immunizations, around 47 percent of children in the KRI had received all
recommended vaccines in 2006. This percentage increased to 64 percent by 2011. As to
childhood nutrition, indicators for the percent of children under-five years in the KRI who
suffer from under-weight, wasting and stunting are 7, 5, and 15 percent, respectively. The
latter two indicators are comparable to figures for the rest of the country—but the
prevalence of stunting in the central and southern regions of Iraq is significantly higher—
around 25 percent of children under the age of five. Overall, stunting, as a measure of child
nutrition, has declined faster in the KRI than the rest of Iraq.41

4.52. KRI is going through a demographic and an epidemiological transition which is
having an impact on the ability of the health sector to respond to changing and
increasing health demands. Such transition is typically characterized by decreasing birth
and premature death rates, aging of the population, and transition from predominance of
communicable, maternal and child diseases toward increased prevalence of non-
communicable diseases. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases,
malignancies, and kidney diseases are the main causes of mortality in the Region in need
of targeted monitoring and prevention efforts. On a positive note, KRI residents can access
public hospitals relatively quickly—on average only 19 minutes away. As with education,
there is evidence of progress but much remains to be done to strengthen the health system
and rebuild a cadre of trained health care and medical professionals. One of the most acute
needs is for enhancing the professional training, stature and responsibilities of nurses (at
all three levels of training) across the region.

4.53. Health expenditure in the KRI followed a positive trend in the 2008 – 2011 period.
The increase in expenditure was over and above the inflation rate and the growth in

                                                  133
population, resulting in a real increase in the per capita health expenditure. Recurrent per
capita health expenditure in this period increased by 45 percent from US$76 to US$110.

4.54. Public spending on health relative to total government spending in the KRI
stands at 5.5 percent, which compares favorably to that of the national aggregate for
Iraq. According to the latest National Health Accounts (NHA) data for Iraq, public sector
health spending out of the total public sector spending in 2008 was around 4.8 percent. In
comparison, in the same year KRI recorded a 5.5 percent on health spending. These
percentages are comparable to comparators in the MENA region but lower than levels in
OECD countries. The available NHA data also indicates that total health spending as a
percentage of GDP in the whole of the country was around 3.3 percent—and the per capita
health spending level was US$137. Out of total health expenditures, 74 percent was from
public sources and 25 percent from private sources, and 1 percent represents donor
assistance.

4.55. Health service delivery and health financing is mostly public with some private
participation and investment. Public sector services are administered by the Ministry of
Health in Erbil which owns and operates a large network of primary and secondary health
care facilities with no or nominal contributions paid by the households. These facilities are
financed through general revenues and follow traditional line-item budgeting processes.
The MoFE approves an annual allocation for Ministry of Health services and all employees
are salaried staff under civil service guidelines. Alongside the public sector, investment in
private health facilities across the region is also present. These facilities are financed
largely by direct out-of-pocket payments.

4.56. While the health workforce has been increasing, the sector still faces shortages
in human resources and has not reached its targets. For example, there are 0.7
physicians/1000 population compared to 2/1000 target; 0.1 dentist/1000 population
compared to 0.5/1000 population target; and 1.1 nurses / 1000 population compared to
2/1000 population target. A 2012 RAND report found that growth rates and delivery



                                                134
efficiency that by 2020 the KRI would need almost a 20 percent increase in physicians to
maintain the present physician-to-population ratio.

4.57. The growing inflow of Syrian refugees and internally displaced Iraqis into the
KRI in the 2012-2014 period has imposed substantial strains on the health sector. The
convergence of a massive influx of IDPs and a protracted budget crisis in 2014, in
particular, has tested the ability of the KRG to respond to the growing health needs of the
refugee and IDP populations. This influx of refugees has resulted in resurgence of polio
(after 14 years of polio free status) and other infectious diseases affecting the local
population (e.g., leishmaniasis). While the KRG health system and health indicators are
generally better than the rest of Iraq, sustainability of providing good quality health
services for an increased population is beyond the KRG’s capacity. Contrary to
expectations, recurrent health expenditures did not increase in response to the Syrian
refugee nor IDP crises. Both have negatively impacted per capita health spending on the
host community. The loss of these financial flows at a per capita level for the host
community in the KRI has potential implications for overall health system performance,
including equity and responsiveness of the system. While external donors have striven to
support the KRG in managing the impact of these effects, a significant amount of financial
resources is still required to restore stability to the health sector and to enable the KRI
health authorities to cope with influx of the displaced and provide quality services for all
KRI residents. In a World Bank assessment of the impact of the Syrian crisis on the health
sector in KRG, results indicated that in a low influx scenario, the total stabilization cost for
the October 2014 – December 2015 period adds to a little over US$339 million, which
translates to nearly US$362 per refugee/IDP. Importantly, this stabilization cost is assumed
to go on top of the expected annual health sector budgets of 2014 and 2015 had the
budgetary crisis not occurred.

4.58. Since 2010, the Kurdistan Regional Government has been working closely with
the RAND Corporation to help guide reform of the health care system in KRI. The
RAND work assisted the Government assess and analyze key health sector issues, dialogue
with health leaders on policy options and provided recommendations for phased
implementation in multiple areas such as financing, primary care, and quality. Some of the
key health sector challenges identified by RAND are the following:42

        Insufficient public spending on health to adequately meet the current demand for
         health care, especially with the increased influx of IDPs.
        Limited revenue generation due to low patient co-payment and contributions in the
         public sector.
        Lack of data and capacity at the Ministry of Health to implement financing reforms.
        Limited hospital management capacity, outdated facilities, and equipment.
        Inadequate and inefficient staffing.

4.59. Moving forward, in 2013, the Ministry of Planning prepared its 2020
development vision which addresses the challenges and articulates a vision for health
sector focusing on the following key areas: (i) adopting a sound health financing system
centered on social health insurance, (ii) improving the availability and quality of clinical
services, (iii) promoting preventive services, and (iv) improving public sector
management, regulatory and policy capacity.

4.60. Against this background, the agenda for health sector reform in the next few
years has been prioritized by the MoH in the following key areas:

      Strengthening primary health care including providing a basic package of essential
       services and increasing focus on preventive services. In May 2012 the Minister of
       Health defined this package of services for each level in the primary care system.
      Health financing reform aimed at moving from the current budget-based system to
       an accountable health service, as well as exploring the feasibility of moving towards
       social health insurance (SHI) system, supplemented by private insurance, along
       with an organizational structure to manage the system.
      Addressing the dual-practice phenomenon among physicians working in both the
       public and the private sector and revise provide payment based on pay-for-
       performance mechanisms.
      Strengthening the use of data for decision making through the expansion and use
       of the management information system to help guide management decisions aimed
       at improving quality of care.
      Improving the quality of health services and patient safety by pursuing international
       accreditation standards for health care facilities.
      Strengthening regulation and public private partnership: Instituting a policy
       framework for private sector participation in health financing/insurance and/or
       service delivery.

 D.      HOSTING FORCIBLY DISPLACED PERSONS FROM SYRIA AND THE REST
                               OF IRAQ

4.61. The Kurdistan Region currently hosts majority of Iraq’s internally displaced
population. Along with refugees from Syria, the KRI is hosting the internally displaced
population that is large relative to the size of the hosting community and its economy by
any measure. The KRG’s approach towards these forcibly displaced populations has been
quite generous. Refugees from Syria, upon registration with UNHCR, become eligible to
the right to residency and work. A similar policy is in place for IDPs. The majority of
displaced persons live outside camps. The management of camps is gradually being handed
over to government agencies such as the Erbil refugee council. There is no restriction on
movements into and out of camps, and services to the camps (land, water, and electricity)
are provided by the KRG. The Government’s High Committee of Needs Assessment faced
this issue under the leadership of Ministry of Planning through Immediate Response Plan
1 and Immediate Response Plan 2 in 2014 and 2015. The Ministry then followed up
programs with UN agencies to deal with these issues.



                                            136
4.62. The prolonged nature of the regional conflict and the large scale of the influx
put pressure on Government to deliver public services. The fiscal crisis is affecting the
Government’s ability to provide basic services to the increased population. The KRG has
not been able so far, leverage international support and assistance, to help address
economic and social development issues linked to refugee and IDP influx. Supporting the
government in making the case for greater international support will relieve some of the
immense pressure on service delivery, and competition for jobs, housing, goods and
services in a struggling economy.




                                          137
                            5.      ACCOUNTABILITY

5.1. Institutional capacity and governance weaknesses are at the root of many of
Region’s development challenges. Therefore, establishing strong Public Financial
Management institutions and systems is a necessary priority to enable governance and
accountability. This is in line with the KRG’s 2020 Vision’s “Putting Government to Work
for the People” pillar, particularly the components related to effectiveness of the
government, budget administration and transparency reform.

5.2. A first step is the development of a medium term macro-fiscal framework
(MTFF) for the KRG, based upon regularly updated assumptions of sustainable oil and
other revenues. In due course, this could be developed into a simple top-down medium
term expenditure framework (MTEF) which would provide the main spending agencies a
more reliable picture of their resource envelopes over the medium term. A MTFF would
also help the authorities better manage the reduction of arrears and, in due course when oil
revenues improve, set aside resources for a Regional Stabilization Fund to cushion future
volatility in oil prices or GoI transfers.

                A.      PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REFORM

Restoring annual budgeting and accounting

5.3. The foundation of a strong PFM system in any jurisdiction is ensuring that
budget estimates are prepared regularly, submitted to the legislature for approval,
reported and accounted for in a timely way, and published. For various reasons—the need
to put KRG on a war footing to counter the encroachments of the ISIS, the breakdown in
the traditional system of revenue transfers from Baghdad along with central approval of
spending plans, the collapse of oil prices, and other political factors—the KRG has not had
a published annual budget for the past three years. Instead of spending against legally
appropriated budget heads, the KRG has operated, in effect, a non-transparent cash release
budget system, in which arrears in some areas (such as the wage bill and payments to
suppliers and contractors) have been allowed to accumulate, to free cash for urgent security
related spending. On the revenue side, oil exports have been sold forward, and it is unclear
how proceeds have been banked and accounted for. Formal budgeting rules have, in effect,
been set aside, and informal PFM practices have proliferated. When, for an extended
period, there is no annually approved budget, everything becomes off-budget and control
systems break down.

5.4. The first step for KRG is re-establishing annual budgets and accounts, based
upon the authorization of spending, in the sectors for which the KRG has constitutional
responsibility, by the Kurdistan Regional Legislature. In the short run, this likely means
renewed emphasis to the existing Iraq budget laws and regulations, in the longer term, it
will be necessary to review and revise the existing legal framework to make it consistent
with the special status of the KRG. In the latter context, there is a need to align the legal
framework for PFM with current country-wide moves to decentralize spending
responsibility to sub-regional levels of government (as anticipated in the Vision document


                                            138
and provided for in recent GoI laws), together with a system of fiscal transfers from the
KRG central budget, and greater revenue raising powers for governorates and districts.

Budget preparation and execution

5.5. Once the basic discipline of annual budgeting has been re-established, attention
can be paid to improving the quality of budgets. Strengthening the planning tools of the
budget is essential to enhance its credibility and effectiveness. At present, there is no
systematic process for aligning sector expenditures with strategic priorities. Budget
requests do not appear to reliably reflect strategic priorities within sectors, or more broadly
across sectors. The lack of budget predictability makes it difficult for ministries to
effectively plan and implement programs that are policy based rather than unconnected
projects.

5.6. Budgetary tools for monitoring spending need to be strengthened. At present, in
the absence of regular approved and published budgets, information sharing from the
MoFE with line ministries is not systematic and these ministries often lack reliable data on
the availability of funds and therefore cannot commit expenditures in a timely fashion.
With no published annual budget, consequential factors affecting budget execution in the
KRG include: low credibility, lack of transparency, accountability and predictability, weak
reporting, no monitoring and evaluation processes, and upstream and downstream
constraints on capital and recurrent expenditures. No Treasury Single Account (TSA) is in
place at either the national or the local governmental levels. Cash management is required
to ensure that the government has sufficient cash available to meet its financial obligations
as they fall due, and to invest temporary surpluses to generate interest income. There is no
mechanism in place to sweep/reverse sweep overnight balances held by budget units in
various government bank accounts into a main TSA. The bank accounts of the Government
ministries and agencies are currently maintained with state-owned banks (Dasemya
previously called Al Rafedain, and Sarhldan previously called Al Rasheed) and used to
receive MoFE cash releases and to make payments for budget expenditures.

5.7. To monitor arrears and commitments, a system needs to be put in place.
Currently, an effective system of commitment control and reporting does not exist, which
is important to control arrears. There is an urgent need to implement a system of
commitment control and reporting that will enable the MoFE to monitor commitments
made by spending units. In turn, this is dependent on regular annual budgets approved by
the KRI legislature, without which a commitment control system cannot function.

Accounting and reporting

5.8. KRG needs better accounting and better reporting, which provide the information
necessary for improved decision-making and for accountability, which in turn will lead
to more effective use of public resources. Public sector entities and their stakeholders need
to understand the full, long-term economic impact of their decisions on financial
performance, financial position and cash flows. This context creates a direct challenge to
governments to improve management of resources and report high-quality information to
their stakeholders (i.e., citizens, parliament, donors, investors and financial markets). There


                                             139
is an urgent need to enhance the quality of accounting and financial reporting in KRG.
Therefore, a gap analysis of financial statements against, in the first instance, existing Iraq
PFM laws and regulations, and, after that, international reporting standards is warranted.
The main objective of this gap analysis would be to help implement more effective public
financial management in KRG through better quality accounting and financial reporting.
This gap analysis would attempt to compare the prevailing government accounting in KRG
with both national and international standards to identify the specific differences so as to
charter a transition path for adoption in the future. This diagnostic tool for gap analysis
could later be used by all stakeholders for any further research or decision on
harmonization of government accounting system in KRG with international standards. This
will entail benchmarking financial reporting and auditing practices in KRG, their
regulatory framework, and accountancy professional development, against international
standards and practices. Having qualified, competent and experienced accounting and
auditing professionals would also be a key element in supporting MoFE and line ministries.
Therefore, the general accountancy development would be needed together with a specific
accounting training plan and identified areas of improvements that would effectively
benefit the KRG context. Related to this is a need to look at accounting systems, the extent
to which they are automated and coordinated with the development of an IFMIS for the
GoI as a whole.

5.9. There is an urgent need to develop a well-designed CoA with comprehensive and
consistent segments notably for economic and functional classification. The system of
classifications of government transactions has to fulfill several critical functions, including
assessment of the economic impact of these transactions, policy formulation, resource
allocation, performance management, and accountability. This should be facilitated
through the development of a comprehensive Chart of Account (CoA) with specific and
distinct segments to allow these multiple purposes, before moving forward in the Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) and program budgeting reforms. The
main segments of a modern CoA are economic, administrative, and functional. Additional
segments are added according to specific needs (i.e., programs, geographic, and source of
funding). Traditionally, budget preparation has been essentially a yearly incremental and
bottom-up exercise. The current budget classification framework contains weaknesses and
does not allow deriving directly the main and common analytical measures of fiscal policy
which leads to reducing comprehensiveness and consistency of the analytical framework.

Internal controls and internal audit

5.10. For the internal controls to be effective in KRG, procedures should be clear,
predictable and standardized. Oversight and internal controls are carried out within each
spending unit by internal auditors. A recent assessment of internal financial control
function was conducted by an international consultancy firm financed under the World
Bank-funded Public Financial Management Reform Project achieved in August 2013 at the
federal level in Baghdad. Owing to the fact that KRG internal control systems are built on
the same structure of procedures as at the federal level, the recommendations of this study
are pertinent. The assessment reported a need for the development of a holistic public
internal control strategy across the entire public administration to establish complimentary



                                             140
roles for the various control-related institutions and activities and to reflect the objectives
of this strategy in primary and secondary legislation.

5.11. The internal audit function, which is also a vital part of a PFM system and core
to a country’s accountably framework, is not functional and appears to be fragmented
and quite ineffective. The current scope of internal audit function is similar to that of a
financial controller, where ex-ante verification is performed by the internal audit
department before payment is made to the beneficiaries. There is little or no internal audit
focused on systems monitoring. The verification covers all expenditures, including salaries
earned centrally in the respective ministries. The internal audit function is almost
exclusively restricted to the compliance and regularity of transactions. Internal auditors do
not produce a regular report highlighting the findings and conclusions during the period of
review or the identified issues and risks except when they are requested specifically to
provide assurance on certain issues. In the first instance, the non-functioning of internal
control systems in the KRG is likely due to weakness in system design and staff capacities.
However, other experiences show that internal control systems languish where there is
absence of demand for timely and relevant internal audit reports. This in turn is a product
of weak overall accountability for efficient and effective use of public resources. The
Vision goal of a modern KRG PFM system points to a need to look at the incentives of
senior managers and the overall ethics of stewardship of public resources in the KRG. And
the starting point for strengthening internal control and audit is a published and
comprehensive budget.

                     B.      PUBLIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

5.12. Public investment can be an important catalyst for economic growth, but the
benefit of additional investment depends crucially on its efficiency. With regard to public
investment, the KRG, through its Ministry of Planning, has developed its Kurdistan
Development Management System (KDMS) which when fully functional will provide an
online mechanism for submitting, reviewing, approving and/or rejecting project requests
submitted by different bodies such as Ministries and Governorates. The KDMS will
facilitate fast, harmonized, and transparent processing of requests, but also effective
coordination of efforts among different stakeholders, and efficient tracking and monitoring
of all development activities within the KRI. In this way, mainstreaming the KDMS will
go a long way toward achieving the Vision goal of matching investment budget spending
to KRI priorities in a cost effective way.

5.13. Despite significant progresses made by KRG in a recent past with regard to the
strengthening of its Public Investment Management (PIM) system, there are a few
remaining issues to be tackled from now: 1) Inconsistent/informal planning with line
ministries: While most factors (such as the need by the population, and feasibility of the
project) are taken into consideration when submitting projects to the KRG MoP, the
process often is not formal nor consistent; 2) Limited information to inform project
selection: To be able to conduct appropriate project selection, the MoP requires sufficient
information on project costs and potential benefits, and to ensure they are consistent with
the policies the KRG has adopted for the sector in question. However, historically the line



                                             141
ministries have provided only limited information to the MoP, and that information was
often inconsistent and incomplete; 3) Low execution rate: In recent years, the execution
rate for public investment projects in KRG has remained low. The four-year average of
execution rate was 36 percent in 2009 - 2013; and 4) Low levels of ex-ante and ex-post
evaluation: Effective pre-project appraisal and post-project assessment can help ensure
projects are designed and implemented effectively. However, there is relatively little
evaluative information collected on capital investment projects in the KRI. Also, there is
very little ex-post evaluation conducted in the region. The General Directorate of Capital
Investment Projects has developed a strategy to address the above mentioned challenges
and has prepared a roadmap for implementation that needs to be redefined based on the
following key objectives.

5.14. The proposed PIM Roadmap for KRG covers the following phases:

       PIM/PPP Framework: The objective is to establish a public investment/PPP
decision process to cover project prioritization (based on cost-benefit analysis and
expenditure efficiency), financing modalities (e.g., on budget or through PPPs) and
continuous monitoring of the fiscal affordability of all projects. In order to move forward
on improved public investment/PPP framework, strong collaboration between MoP and
MoFE will be considered as highly critical. The adoption of a formal system of public
investment/PPP project appraisal will provide the basis and conditions for KRG to forward
only those initiatives that are demonstrably the most economically and socially attractive
for society. Such a system would allow for the transformation of “investment ideas” into
“public investment/PPP projects,” and, afterwards, into “public investment/PPP
decisions.” This kind of system would be designed to put projects through the project life
cycle, starting with the identification of a project idea, concept, and ending with the final
handover to operations and the ex-post evaluation stage.

      3-Year PIM Action Plan: The main objective will be to strengthen the existing KRG
PIM System (PIMS) as a comprehensive set of concepts, techniques, standards and
methodological procedures, and as a uniform information and document depository and
management system for the formulation, preparation and evaluation of projects. This action
plan will be implemented in line with five preliminary recommendations, namely:

    First, develop and apply agreed criteria for deciding on KRG’s pipeline of
     investment projects. The initial action will be browsing through the KRG portfolio
     of projects in order to make investment decisions. This action will focus on
     completing the best projects rather than initiating new ones and on ensuring funding
     for recurring subsequent costs (operation and maintenance). At the same time, the
     KRG MoP and MoFE will review all projects that are not disbursing in order to
     identify implementation bottlenecks, address them, or reallocate funding elsewhere
     if the project is deemed irredeemably stalled. Based on integrated cost-benefit
     analysis of projects, a PIM working group will then prioritize those projects that
     are not yet included in the updated “Building the Kurdistan Region of Iraq / The
     Socio-Economic Infrastructure” (2012 SEINA).




                                            142
    Second, improve capital project design, appraisal, selection and budgeting. This
     action would be aimed at ensuring the use of standard criteria in project screening.
     To improve the procedures for capital project design, integrated project appraisal,
     selection and budgeting, it would be recommended that general technical guidance
     for ex-ante evaluation be developed based on a multi-phase evaluation process. A
     comprehensive Handbook for Economic Appraisal of Public Investment Projects
     will be developed for the design, costing and integrated evaluation of public
     investment projects with the inclusion of applied case studies.

    Third, use specific sector guidelines and templates to build a framework for the
     design of projects, from their appraisal to their selection and inclusion in the
     budget. This action would involve strengthening strategic planning across the
     Government and especially in those sectors responsible for large public
     infrastructure. It would be recommended that a variety of project appraisal
     methodologies be drafted as soon as possible, including guidelines, instructions and
     templates. Among other things, it would be recommended that specific
     methodologies for Economic Appraisal of Public Investment Projects be developed
     in some key sectors.

    Fourth, improve implementation and monitoring of public investment/PPP
     projects. The objective of monitoring and ex-post evaluation would be to determine
     the efficiency and efficacy of investment initiatives through a feedback structure
     with management controls and measurements of the short, medium and long-term
     results of projects. The PIM working group will monitor closely the performance
     of public investments and report its findings to the Parliament.

    Fifth, develop capacity building and training. The implementation of a fully
     functioning PIMS would require skilled staff and training of existing civil servants.
     It is unlikely that these changes can happen contemporaneously across all line
     ministries, and other public agencies, and as a consequence, decisions would have
     to be taken about which sectors to focus on first.

5.15. The strengthening of the PIM system is conducted in KRI and the rest of Iraq
which will bring significant benefits to the whole country. It is expected joint capacity
building training courses for government officials from federal and regional levels will be
organized in 2017, and an Integrated Bank of Projects will be established in 2018. The
proposed short-term and medium-term PIM system actions are summarized in Figure.




                                           143
                                 Figure 5.1: PIM System Actions




5.16. In addition, the development of a MTFF (and in due course a MTEF) will help
planners manage the size of the PIP in the coming years, by reference to the likely
availability of total budget resources, and the need to have sustainable balance between
investment, the wage bill and other categories of spending. Furthermore, in reviewing the
existing stock of projects which have started but have now stalled for lack of funds, it may
be necessary to perform triage, permanently cancelling projects where justification is weak,
costs have escalated to unreasonable levels, or design is fundamentally compromised.

                                C.      PROCUREMENT REFORM

5.17. Public procurement is pivotal to public trust in governance and is considered to
be one of the barometers for the quality of public administration, making it a priority
reform area for KRG. Public procurement is a key aspect of public administration that
links the public financial system with social and economic outcomes, and as such is a major
determinant of the quality of community services and infrastructure, and the effectiveness
of the government. This function cuts across almost all areas of planning, program
management, and budgeting. Weaknesses in public sector procurement remain a significant
barrier to sustainable development in many countries as it invariably reduces development
outcomes and lead to high cost of doing business that, in turn, deter rapid private sector
development as well. Various studies show that government procurement accounts for a
substantial proportion of Gross Domestic Product (15-20 percent or more in most
countries).43 In developing countries, public procurement in one form or another accounts

for 40-50 percent of government expenditure.44 Prior to the fiscal crisis, KRG had a large
procurement level. In 2013, Iraq approved a US$120 billion budget and around US$10
billion of supplementary budget. Government spending of US$52 billion was under public
procurement and KRG’s share was around US$9 billion. This figure is a rough proxy for
the magnitude of public procurement in the Kurdistan Region before the crisis.

5.18. Civil society’s increasing demand for greater results and a more efficient public
service delivery can be met through procurement reforms. Strengthening procurement
systems and utilizing modern tools such as PPP, are increasingly viewed as one of the most
significant priorities in many countries for delivering services, improving the investment
climate, and facilitating private sector-led economic growth. It has been recognized by the
OECD (2007)45 that “public procurement is the government activity most vulnerable to
waste, fraud and corruption due to its complexity, the size of the financial flows it generates
and the close interaction between the public and the private sectors.”

5.19. Public procurement continues to remain as one of the most problematic areas for
overall Iraq including the KRG. This is constantly criticized by local citizens and
international organizations. However, on a positive note, some positive developments has
been undertaken by the federal government such as: i) Standard Bidding Documents
(SBDs) has been developed, piloted and disseminated, to be mandated in July 2016; ii)
implementation manual has been prepared and published on the Ministry’s website; iii)
training strategy was prepared, and in collaboration with universities training programs
started to build capacity of procurement professionals. In parallel; other positive
developments in the Kurdistan Region took place in line with KRG Vision 2020 of
‘effective, transparent, trusted and honest government.’ KRG MoP launched in March
2013 a self-assessment of public procurement, followed by extensive stakeholder
consultations. Figure 5.2 presents the self-assessment, conducted by the Inter-Ministerial
Committee (IMC) with the support of the World Bank, confirmed existence of major
weaknesses along the four pillars (left) and the associated 12 indicators (right graph) of
OECD-DAC WB assessment tool. To address those weaknesses, a clear need for
modernizing the public procurement system was identified.

5.20. The Government is taking steps to reform the procurement system . The self-
assessment exercise and stakeholder consultation led to MoP adopting a comprehensive
and multi-faceted reform program, one that would reflect positively on the performance of
the government function in all sectors. The future of public procurement system in KRG
as a vision by the IMC led by MoP can be summarized in Figure 5.3 below.

             Figure 5.3: The Future Public Procurement in Kurdistan Region




5.21. The Government has a clear plan to reform the public procurement system on
the way forward. The KRG adopted revisions of public procurement legal framework by
issuing of consolidated and modern Public Procurement Regulations in February 2016
which is expected to become effective in July 2016. Other positive steps taken by the
Government in this regards include: i) completion of readiness assessment and


                                            146
development of a roadmap for e-procurement, and ii) development of draft SBDs for
construction works, pre-qualification, goods and consultancy services. As a minimum, the
following actions are envisioned to continue with the reform of public procurement system
in the region:

         Finalizing and mandating the SBDs to improve transparency and accountability in
          the mobilization and use of public resources;
         Finalizing and enacting the annex of procurement regulation in “procurement under
          public private partnership;”
         Finalizing and issuing of the explanatory notes on the new procurement regulations;
         Building the capacity of public and private sectors on the new regulations and use
          of SBDs; and
         Further enhancing the transparency in public procurement through preparation for
          a phased approach e-procurement system starting with the establishment of a Single
          Portal Website and Information System.

5.22. The top priority of the policy recommendations would be to ensure the proper
implementation of the newly enacted procurement regulation in 2016. The
implementation of the new public procurement regulations will be done through (i)
strengthening the policy unit functions and resources; (ii) establishing a complaint
mechanism system; (iii) finalizing and issuing of the explanatory notes on the new
procurement regulations; and (iv) issuing the Doing Business with KRG under the new
procurement regulations, and developing a toolkit for the private sector companies. The
World Bank will continue its support to modernize and reform public procurement system
in Iraq, including the Kurdistan Region, under the new loan of Public Financial
management (PFM) Institutional Development and Capacity Building Project. The new
PFM project will support the transition and proper implementation of the new legal
framework as well as enhance transparency and modernize the public procurement system
in the Kurdistan Region.

                                    D.      AUDIT REFORM

5.23. The KRG Board of Supreme Audit (BSA) is assessed to be underdeveloped and
underperforming and in urgent need for a long-term capacity building program.46
Supreme audit institutions are the lead public sector audit organization and one of the key
players in the public governance system. By ensuring that money is well spent, these audit
institutions can contribute to national development and the fight to reduce poverty. The
KRG BSA provides overall guidance for maintaining a system of internal controls and
conducts the external audits after the implementation of the budget. There is an urgent need
to modernize KRG external audit practices of the BSA that faces a number of challenges.
One of the main challenges is the ineffective institutional structure because of the existence
of two BSA structures: one in Erbil covering Dohuk and Erbil Governorates, which is
mandated to audit MoFE's reports; and the second structure in Sulaymaniyah, which only
covers the Governorate of Sulaymaniyah. There is a need to upgrade BSA’s auditing

practices in order to meet sound international standards. It is critical to improve the level
of collaboration with BSA Baghdad and exchange of expertise, which would improve the
external audit function in the whole country. Also BSA is advised to move forward with
twinning arrangements with regional and international auditing institutions to help building
its capacity and knowledge of regional and external experiences. Furthermore, staff
capacity requires enhancement.

5.24.   In order to modernize the KRG BSA external audit practices, significant reforms
are required. These reforms include: i) enhancing the legal and institutional framework,
its link to the parliament, the legislatures, and the executive (Government and its
administration authorities) to ensure strong, independent, and effective audit institute and
limit opportunities for inappropriate interference in the organization’s work; ii) improving
KRG BSA governance structure and organization to enable the institutions to meet all of
its mandates in efficient and effective manner; iii) gradually implementing international
standards of financial, compliance, and performance audit with related audit
methodologies; and iv) providing capacity building for staff at all levels. It is also necessary
for the KRG MoFE to follow up on BSA findings, and ensure that remedial action is taken.

         6.      INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND JUDICIAL
                             OVERSIGHT

6.1     Institutional development and governance are the key drivers of growth by
providing incentives to accumulate physical and human capital.47 Indeed business
transactions take place under the institutional framework that establishes the rules of the
game. If rules are not implemented properly and interest groups capture the enforcement
capacity of the state, incentives for rent seeking, not production, are created, resulting in
poor productivity and a low standard of living. There must be institutions that can provide
checks and balances for the players in the economy, both public and private which requires
a functional and independent judicial system.

6.2     The importance of an enabling environment where entrepreneurial activity is
rewarded cannot be overemphasized. In fact, in all modern market economies the
fundamental mechanism that drives growth is massive ongoing restructuring; the main
issue is ensuring that the institutional environment can support such a process. If this
process is continuous, then TFP will be high, and living standards can be improved on a
sustained basis. In poorly governed societies, productivity is miserably low. This is an
economy-wide issue, and the Government will maximize its efforts to create the conditions
for market institutions and improve governance, which is a prerequisite for new
investment.

6.3      International experience shows that sustaining economic growth is much more
difficult than starting it and that sustained growth depends on institutional reforms .
Institutional reforms need to be seen from a broad perspective of governance affecting the
entire economic system and hence economic growth. Major policy reforms and evolving
legal framework of KRI are very much part of this process of institution building. As shown
by the experience of successfully developing middle income economies, the full
effectiveness of first generation reforms, such as, privatization, and other sectoral reforms
depends on parallel institutional reforms, such as legal and judiciary, property rights, and
rule of law. Experience has also shown that there are a variety of institutional arrangements
and there is no simple universal way to transform first-order economic principles into
unique policy packages. This process tends to be context-specific and is heavily influenced
by a given country’s political institutions, and other mechanisms which resolve conflict of
interest among various groups, and ultimately by political power. In addition to
determining growth potential, economic institutions have an impact on other important
factors, including the distribution of resources in the future. Hence, economic institutions
influence the size of the pie, the national income, as well as the division of pie among
different groups and persons in a given country.

6.4   KRG has been adopting laws and regulations to support the development of
foundations of market institutions and much of its economic performance over the long

  See recent work as reviewed by Jones and Vollrath (2013) and Acemoglu (2009) corroborate Levine and
Renelt findings and ask the question: what determines the accumulation of capital, investment, and the
accumulation of human capital education or skill acquisition?

term will depend on developing these effectively. Turning to specific market—sustaining
economic and political institutions—which are likely emerge out of the interactive process
described above over time, the following taxonomy could guide the discussion and give an
account how far KRG has come along and needs to go along these dimensions of
institutional development. In fact, relatively speaking, KRG has been having a stable
government and enjoying political stability in the past few years and hence it can push for
institutional development policies as presented in Figure 6.1.

6.5      Recently created oil fund supports institutional development and if properly
designed it could also be an effective economic management tool. In early April 2015,
KRG enacted the Oil and Gas Revenue Fund which authorized the Cabinet of Ministers to
establish a Board with the objective of providing transparent public reporting of earnings
from exports, refined products, and oil company bonuses within the framework of the
KRG’s oil and gas contracts, the Kurdistan Oil and Gas Law no 22 of 2007 and the Iraq
Constitution of 2005. Within this framework, oil earnings may be allocated for five
different areas; (i) KRI’s annual budget; (ii) capital spending; (iii) oil infrastructure; (iv)
environmental protection; and (v) a “future generation’s” wealth fund. The Fund will be
audited according to international standards. At the same time it is important, to ensure that
utilization of the Fund is within the framework of MTFF and avoid fragmentation of
sources of spending.

6.6    Enhancing competition and new business creation is part of institutional
development. Even if all productive assets are held privately, an absence of competitive
markets impedes resource allocation and interferes with the use of resources in the most


                                                          150
productive ways. For this reason, monopolies and uncompetitive behavior need to be
monitored. KRG will adopt appropriate regulations to deal with these factors so that
incumbents in the market do not block the entry of businesses. Simultaneously, the
Government will nurture the creation of new businesses to increase competition as well as
output. KRI has inherited a legal framework that is based on Iraqi socialist system and there
is a need for major reforms in this area. Regulatory policies are key determinants of short
to medium term growth. The World Bank’s 2015 Doing Business Report provides a cross-
country analysis of regulatory policies and best practices are labeled as “the frontiers” and
this can provide guidance to the KRG economic policymakers.

                   7.       IMPLEMENTATION MODALITIES

7.1     KRG will implement the economic reform roadmap through an inclusive and
inter-ministerial process in participation of all stakeholders. The implementation will be
overseen by Ministry of Planning with close partnership from the Prime Minister’s Office.
The reform actions will be conducted and delivered by assigned Government officials from
line ministries under the leadership of senior KRG officials. Given this reform roadmap’s
all-encompassing aims, the KRG’s Council of Ministers (COM) will retain overall
authority for overseeing and coordinating participation and action from the ministries and
Government offices involved, and the Secretary of the Steering Committee will track
progress. Rather than the entire COM, the KRG could consider including only those
ministers who will be responsible for implementing this roadmap. Because of the all-
encompassing nature of the roadmap, such a subset is likely to include most ministers.

7.2     During the process, consultations with relevant Government offices, private
sector representatives, civil society members, and other stakeholders will be conducted.
Consultations and focus group meetings will be carried out with these groups at all stages
of the roadmap implementation. Task forces will be created for each reform sector
composed of relevant Government officials and international partners. The reforms actions
will be implemented in partnership with international organizations. In the medium-to
long-term, reforms will be delivered by the Government in collaboration with development
partners, in selected areas, through a combination of various tools including technical
assistance, capacity building, analytical work, knowledge sharing, and project financing.

7.3     For economic and social development of the KRI, this economic reform roadmap
will represent Government’s umbrella roadmap combining input from all groups in the
Government. The steering committee and task forces would engage the Council of
Ministers when appropriate.

7.4    To operationalize Government’s reforms, a coordination structure will be put in
place to facilitate implementation of economic reform actions. This will help
development partners to interact with public and private sector counterparts for the purpose
of supporting specific actions in various sectors. The Government will develop a
mechanism with a coordination structure presented below. Task forces and special
committees will report implementation progress to the steering committee, and the steering
committee will brief the executive authority through the Secretary. The steering committee
will meet on the relevancy of the topic. Each task force will prepare a detailed terms of
reference presenting how specific reforms will be implemented and in what timeframe. A
budget will be make available to the Secretary for overseeing the implementation of the
roadmap.

                         Task Forces and Special Committees
        Composed of implementation teams from public/private sectors and IFIs

The modalities of engagement will entail six components:

1. Provide support and guidance to task forces to implement reform actions.

2. Technical assistance for implementation to government line ministries.

3. Analytical work: Additional targeted analytical work in identified reform areas

4. Investment and infrastructure projects: The implementation of the investment projects
   in some sectors such as ICT; transport, customs and logistics; and energy would

   translate into investment projects to be funded by the WB, IFC, the private sector and
   other development partners.

5. Advocacy with non-government stakeholders including private sector and development
   partners. The objective is to contribute to building support and partnerships in reform
   areas through regular meetings with key stakeholders.

6. A communication strategy will be developed to generate greater awareness and
   understanding of the need for economic reforms. All steps of reform will involve
   communication with different stakeholders:

          Internal Communication.

          External Communication.

          Communications tools and products: Multiple communication tools will be
           utilized, including print (Kurdish, Arabic, English), radio, visual and social
           media.
