Executive Summary
An effective and efficient monitoring, evaluation and reporting system is an essential component of any
climate change (CC) strategy and is especially important where policy-makers are still at an early stage
in developing their understanding of what exactly makes a good strategy for CC mitigation and
adaptation. In support of the Climate Change and Low Carbon Green Growth Program of Romania
(LCGGP), the World Bank has prepared the current report with the aim of helping the Romanian
Government to operationalize the strategic path chosen by the country for implementing its National
Climate Change and Low Carbon Green Growth Strategy 2016-20302 (NSCC) and the associated 2016-2020
Action Plan for Climate Change (APCC).
There is currently no comprehensive system in place for monitoring and evaluating the NSCC and APCC,
but Romania does have the foundation of a system for the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of public
policies. This includes some relevant institutional arrangements and M&E activities for existing CC-related
policies and measures, notably those derived from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, plus the requirements for EU Member States regarding the
monitoring and evaluation of the EU-level climate and energy package and the Europe 2020 goals for a
smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
It is recommended that the Romanian government should build upon current obligations for M&E of
public policies, whilst recognizing that the M&E system initially established for the NSCC and APCC for
Romania must not be considered as static, but rather as an on-going continuum that will evolve, expand
and improve over time. It is also important for the Romanian government to understand that the M&E
system should go beyond the systematic collection, analysis, assessment and reporting of data and other
relevant information on the progress and performance of the proposed NSCC and APCC. The M&E system
should facilitate continuous learning by policy-makers and other key stakeholders in order to underpin
the long-term development of the knowledge and understanding needed to better design, implement and
deliver future CC strategies and action plans for Romania.
The report highlights some key weaknesses in institutional capacity for CC-related M&E and identifies
several sector-specific examples of areas for improvement. Overall, the national system for monitoring
GHG emissions appears to be complete, although it is not yet functioning as smoothly as it could (e.g.
there are problems with the management of data quality) and includes some poorly defined indicators.
However, there is currently little focus on evaluation nor experience of monitoring and reporting
arrangements for CC adaptation – a significant lack of capacity that needs correcting as soon as possible
to meet EU reporting obligations for the period of 2014-2020.
Relatively few countries have comprehensive CC-related M&E systems for all policy sectors at the
national level, but there are numerous examples of good practice in specific sectors, such as health and
energy, which are relevant to Romania. The report usefully reviews international good practices for the
M&E of CC strategies and action plans under the headings of General good practice; Green Growth good

practices; Special considerations for CC adaptation (including the selection of indicators), and; European
examples (including short case studies on relevant M&E practices from Germany and France).
Whilst it is well beyond the scope of the report to extend the review of good practice to all potentially
relevant evaluation methodologies and approaches, the authors provide a chapter dedicated to outlining
a solid, yet flexible, evaluation framework that is consistent with existing Romanian, EU and UNFCCC
principles.
In order to facilitate the necessary learning processes for policy-makers and other key stakeholders it is
recommended that the Romanian government adopts a “theory-based” approach (in conjunction with
the OECD DAC criteria) as the evaluation framework for the NSCC and APCC. The theory-based approach
follows an iterative process of design, evaluation, and redesign based on lessons learned about whether
specific interventions are successful or not, why they succeeded or failed and how they can be improved.
Clear and simple guidance is provided by the authors on the key steps in theory-based evaluation; the
principles for developing indicators (with specific reference to indicators for CC adaptation); the need for
indicator monitoring plans, and; the importance of independent verification. The OECD DAC criteria are:
relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability. They provide a framework with which to
organize evaluations. However, the degree to which a specific criterion is addressed, as well as which
method is used to assess the appropriate indicators, will depend on the stage of implementation as well
as the evaluation objectives.
The report concludes with numerous additional practical recommendations for development of a
simple, affordable and cost effective M&E system for the NSCC and APCC. These recommendations are
grouped into 4 categories:
1. General recommendations

       Begin elaborating the M&E system before the implementation of the NSCC and APCC;
       Agree and communicate on the purpose of the M&E system with clear objectives and a
        development strategy;
       Define the basis and procedures for an Integrated regular review and revision (every 3-5 years) of
        the strategic objectives and institutional arrangements into the M&E system
       MEWF ensures the key evaluation results are channeled to higher levels (e.g. including prim-
        minister), and civil society and public.
       MEWF to ensure a fully synergetic effort with other reporting processes, e.g. UNFCCC reporting
        and Mechanism Monitoring Regulation on policies and measures.
2. Recommendations for improving institutional arrangements
       The Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests (MEWF) should have overall responsibility for
        the M&E system, following provisions of GD 775/2005, with specific tasks delegated to the Public
        Policy Unit (PPU) of the MEWF. In achieving such tasks, the PPU collects information on policy
        implementation, NCCC provides analysis and MEWF implements the outcome;
       The MEWF must ensure adequate financial resources for the operationalization and on-going
        expansion of the M&E system;


                                                                                                          8
      The MEWF must ensure that adequate human resources with appropriate knowledge and skills
       are committed to M&E activities, including adequate capacity and competence in the PPU to deal
       with CC issues;
      Ensure specialized MEWF experts participate actively and thoroughly in national, EU and
       international processes, and gain working experience with other technical bodies/ evaluation
       experts/int’l organizations;
      Where appropriate, institutional capacity should be increased by using the expertise of third
       parties;
      The PPU should develop a Monitoring Plan defining all relevant institutions, sources of
       information, frequency of data collection, evaluation procedures, frequency of reporting,
       consultation on evaluation reports and procedures for amendment of the NSCC and APCC, and
       promote it by the appropriate legal instrument;
      Communication and information exchange (including a clear and efficient process for data
       sharing, including by online means) must be established and maintained between all
       governmental entities associated with the M&E system, civil society and public;
      All institutional arrangements must be kept up-to-date with the regular reviews and revisions of
       the M&E system.
3. Recommendations for developing a solid evaluation framework
      M&E has to be reinforced by strengthening the CC&A aspects of Strategic Environmental
       Assessment (SEA) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and include in M&E reporting the
       macro-level indicators currently used for reporting under UE and UNFCCC;
      Engage stakeholders early and often using national and institutional networks, including the
       proposed Climate Partners Network (CPN), by providing them the opportunity to give feedback in
       written form, by organizing meetings and workshops etc. such as to give input on local priorities,
       indicators development, and the information on impacts of implementation of policies.
      Pay special attention to the monitoring and evaluation of actions for CC&A from NSCC and APCC;
      Use third parties for evaluation in order to ensure independence, impartiality and no conflict of
       interest; also for verification for measures where external verification is important;
      Link to other CC&A reporting EU and UNFCCC process by performing evaluations of the NSCC and
       APCC on a regular basis (e.g. produce a comprehensive evaluation report every 2 years); Deepen
       the evaluation culture of the MEWF and promote active learning as an integral part of the
       evaluation framework in order to realize the full potential of M&E activities and
       recommendations;
4. Recommendations for reporting

      Optimize reporting to meet the different needs of different agencies and organizations as much
       as possible without unnecessary additional effort;
      Submit evaluation reports directly to the National Commission on Climate in order to benefit from
       their expertise and feedback.

1. Introduction

    1.1. Importance of M&E to Implementing the CC Strategy
As public expenditure increases for any form of policy intervention it becomes essential to ensure that
the resources committed to the intervention are used as fully, effectively and efficiently as possible .
This basic principle is even more important in a policy field such as strategy-making for climate change
(CC) where policy-makers are still at an early stage in their understanding of what exactly makes a good
strategy for CC mitigation and adaptation, yet have limited resources. Under these circumstances,
learning what interventions and actions work well (or not) and for what reasons is critical.
One of the most important tools for continuous learning used by policy-makers and other key
stakeholders is the structured and on-going process of evaluation, which provides a means to judge
whether policies and related actions are meeting the intended purposes and provides feedback on
outcomes and consequences to inform future efforts.
Evaluation of the national CC Strategy and Action Plan will be a critically important process in Romania.
It will require pragmatism (what is possible to monitor and evaluate, and what is not within current
constraints?) a clear sense of purpose with defined roles, responsibilities and accountability. But it will
also have great potential to: i) enhance understanding amongst policy-makers and other key stakeholders
of the country’s climate change risks and vulnerabilities, and; ii) help identify approaches that are cost-
effective in reducing those risks3, as well as reducing GHG emissions.


    1.2. Key Concepts
For the purposes of this report, evaluation can be defined as the systematic and objective measurement
and assessment of progress and performance of an intervention. Broadly, there are two principal
purposes for evaluation, both of which are relevant for a national climate change strategy:
     1. Transparency and accountability: Document the status of implementation of activities/outputs
        as well as what was achieved (outcomes, impacts) facilitating reporting and holding responsible
        entities accountable for positive or negative performance. It helps to ensure that the CC Strategy
        and Action Plan remain “on track” by immediately identifying and correcting any short-term
        deviation from their objectives and planned interventions.
     2. Continuous improvement: The continuous learning through systematic enquiry into what the CC
        Strategy and Action Plan have achieved facilitates understanding of successes and failures and
        their causal factors in order to better design and implement future strategies and action plans.4
Indicators are typically used as part of an evaluation strategy for a policy to help monitor or document
progress. The indicator data can also facilitate reporting to meet national and international requirements

as well as to engage the public, such as to address environmental problems, to inform public debates, or
to gain support for and legitimize policies.
A national climate change strategy typically consists of goals, which are further articulated through
objectives/broad policies and (quantifiable) targets. These objectives would then be met through the
implementation of actions (e.g. policy instruments and programmes, sectoral activities) which could also
then result in projects that implement measures, for example.
Verification is used to ensure that selected reported information is accurate and complete. There are a
range of verification techniques. Verification can be as simple as internal validation strategies and cross
checks to confirm data is entered as intended or involve comprehensive third-party verification by
accredited verifiers, such as is already used for the EU ETS, for key indicators or where sources are
uncertain.
Specific evaluation approaches and the relevant indicators to monitor and the verification strategy for
them must be tailored to the situation, addressing the appropriate scale, population, and sectors
involved, while linking across different scales to provide the appropriate feedback.5 While this report
focuses on the national goal and policy level, there are many different types of M&E that would feed into
a national system.

loop of a comprehensive evaluation system.

1.2.1.    Terminology
Evaluation is a broad field and the terminology used also varies depending on the context and primary
purpose. The following overlapping concepts and associated acronyms are used in this report:

                                                                                                        11
        E = Evaluation
        M&E = Monitoring and Evaluation
        M&E and Reporting = Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (sometimes abbreviated as MER)
        MRV = Monitoring (or Measurement), Reporting, and Verification
        MRAV (or MRVA) = Monitoring, Reporting, Accreditation (of verifiers) and Verification
        EM&V = Evaluation, Measurement (or Monitoring), and Verification
This report uses M&E and Reporting to refer generally to the systems needed to support a national climate
strategy to acknowledge that external reporting requirements will be a major driver in system design.
However, a comprehensive system would incorporate all of these concepts.


    1.3. Design Elements of an M&E and Reporting System for Implementing the
         Climate Change and Green Growth Strategy
M&E and Reporting systems addressing a national climate change strategy and action plan should be one
important piece of a broader national M&E and Reporting strategy. Also, while there are similarities in
topics and sectors addressed, each national climate change strategy is unique, representing the priorities
and opportunities most relevant for that country. Therefore, the M&E and Reporting strategy needs to
be tailored to national circumstances and priorities. Yet, the data collection for key metrics needs to be
transparent enough to facilitate comparisons and/or aggregation with data from other countries. The
overall M&E system should also be capable of capturing local, regional and national information and
responses to NSCC and APCC measures, both positive and negative.
M&E and Reporting Systems are on a continuum that will evolve, expand and improve over time.6 Even
the most comprehensive systems that exist today began with more modest origins. Their development is
a multi-stage process where the breadth, rigor, level of detail, and degree of consistency and linkages with
other systems evolves. For example, early stages may focus on meeting minimum requirements, while
middle stages increase the scope, coordination, and begin applying common stringent methodologies,
and late stages of the continuum are characterized by addressing all major themes with a high level of
coordination between relevant authorities using consistent, stringent, and transparent methodologies
that can be easily compared/aggregated with data from other national systems.
An effective M&E and Reporting system requires considerable time and resources, therefore building
on existing principles and practices is highly recommended, as is integrating the principle of continuous
improvement over time. There is no need to “reinvent the wheel” where existing M&E systems are
functional or under development, and have the potential to be generating valid data.

Romania’s M&E and Reporting strategy addressing climate change issues would be expected to address
the following overlapping topics:
      Requirements at the UNFCCC level, such as for national inventories, national communications,
       biennial reports, and emission reduction pledges for commitment periods (e.g. intended
       nationally determined contributions (INDCs) for 2020-2030);
      Requirements at the EU level, both those that role up to EU-level UNFCCC reporting as well as
       those that serve other needs, at a minimum addressing:
           o GHG emissions for all relevant sectors and sources;
           o Related public funding in-country, EU-level, and international;
           o Related sustainable development and CC&A benefits or costs (e.g. economic, social,
               health, other environmental);
      National policies and actions addressing mitigation, adaptation, or support, as prioritized.
       Examples: building code, appliance standards, renewable feed-in tariff, public transit policy
A well-designed and organized M&E and Reporting system for Romania will:
   a) focus on the results and outcomes of implemented CC mitigation and adaptation activities, whilst
      also taking account of the fact that other processes (e.g. autonomous adaptation) will be taking
      place alongside these interventions;
   b) ask the right questions at the right time and ensure all relevant stakeholders are involved in
      seeking the answers;
   c) ensure that the right data is being collected at the right time and in the right place during and
      after implementation of the CC Strategy and Action Plan;
   d) optimize M&E and Reporting efforts by organizing all work so that it is easily implemented with
      appropriate resources for the collection, analysis and reporting of relevant data and information;
   e) systematically review all data and information collected to generate appropriate responses and
      feedback for the necessary adaptation of the CC Strategy and Action Plan.

2. International Requirements for Climate Change M&E
   and Reporting
Romania’s monitoring, evaluation, and reporting (M&E and Reporting) of strategic climate change
objectives should expand upon and integrate the required monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV)
efforts for GHG mitigation and climate change adaptation at the EU and international treaty level.
MRV of national efforts to tackle climate change through mitigation and adaptation actions are required
in both the international and EU context, with supranational factors significantly influencing the existence
and design of the MRV systems. There are strong links between the Policies and Measures adopted at the
national level and the requirements of the international agreements/regulation and national strategies.
The most significant international obligations derive from the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. EU Member State (MS) requirements relating to the
EU-level climate and energy package and related initiatives as well as the deepening evaluation culture at
the EU level are also important drivers.


    2.1. The UNFCCC Requirements
As a Party to the Treaty creating the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the
1990s, Romania has experience with meeting its commitments to submit the following to the UNFCCC:

        Emissions inventories (National GHG Inventory): cataloguing current and historical emissions
         trends7
        National communications (NC) 8: comprehensive reports including emission trends as well as
         information on a country’s mitigation and adaptation efforts, submitted every four years, and
        Biennial reports (BR): outlining progress in achieving emission reductions and the provision of
         financial, technology and capacity-building support to other countries, submitted every two
         years.
Adaptation reporting requirements are included in the NC in a dedicated section addressing three areas:
expected impacts, vulnerability assessment, and adaptation measures. Objectives and targets are
designed and established at national level, as there is no specific international requirement, so far.
The GHG Inventory, NC and BR are also submitted to the European Commission, which compiles
information from all MS and reports at the EU-level to the UNFCCC. The specific requirements for MS are
described in the EU Monitoring Mechanism Regulation, discussed in the next subsection.


7
  Most parties, including Romania, use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines that describe
methodologies for estimating emissions and Good Practice Guidance that details quality assurance and control
procedures for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as a foundation for their reporting, located here:
http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp. The European Commission, together with European Environment Agency, provide
additional guidance for Member States, see here: http://www.eea.europa.eu.
8
  Approximately every 4-5 years, depending on the reporting schedule agreed in decisions at Conferences of Parties.
Decision 9/CP.16 calls for submission of the seventh NCs on 1 January 2018.

                                                                                                                15
2.1.1.     The Kyoto Protocol
The Kyoto Protocol under the UNFCCC is a binding agreement, ratified by Romania in 2001. Under this
agreement, 37 countries and the European Union (EU-15 for 1st and EU28 & Iceland for 2nd commitment
period) committed to:

         Binding national emissions targets and international monitoring and reporting requirements to
          verify the achievement of these targets9, and
         National inventory systems with more specific requirements10 than those required by UNFCCC
          and penalties for non-compliance.11
For the second commitment period (2013-2020), agreed through the Doha Amendment, Romania is part
of EU’s assumed a target of 20% GHG emissions reduction, compared to 1990 levels, to be fulfilled
jointly with the EU and its member States.


    2.2. The European Union (EU)
The EU has established its implementing framework for its low carbon development strategy and
associated policies, called the EU climate and energy package, which evolves and expands over time.
Current versions of the related EU legislation focus on efforts to reach 2020 goals, yet the EU Commission
is currently discussing a package to reach 2030 goals. The four key components of the 2020 goals package,
each with associated reporting requirements, include12:
        EU Emissions Trading System updates, covering around 45% of the EU's greenhouse gas
         emissions13;
        Effort Sharing Decision addressing sectors not covered in the ETS, such as housing, agriculture,
         waste and transport;
        National Renewable Targets, and the related Renewable Energy Directive and required National
         Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs);
        Establishing a legal framework to facilitate carbon capture and storage.
While energy efficiency was not directly addressed in the formal 2020 climate and energy package, there
is related legislation, centering on the Energy Efficiency Directive and the related Energy Performance of
Buildings, Energy Labelling and Ecodesign Directives. For example, the Energy Efficiency Directive requires
MS to develop National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs) that set out estimated energy
consumption, planned energy efficiency measures and the improvements individual EU countries expect
to achieve. NEEAPs are to be updated every three years.



9
  Romania’s target under the Kyoto protocol was an 8 % reduction of GHG emissions between 2008 – 2012, relative
to 1989 levels.
10
   The additional requirements to comply with the Kyoto protocol are addressed in the EU Monitoring Mechanism
Regulation and are summarized here:
 http://unfccc.int/national_reports/reporting_and_review_for_annex_i_parties/items/5689.php
11
   In 2011, Romania was temporarily suspended from participation in the Kyoto market mechanisms.

                                                                                                            16
In addition, there are complementary initiatives at the EU-level addressing, for example: reducing F-gases,
promoting innovative technologies and developing climate change adaptation strategies. Most, if not all,
of these topics would be expected to be incorporated into Romania’s Climate Change Strategy, as
relevant, in addition to locally-driven measures, and should be addressed, as feasible, in the M&E system.
At the EU-level, climate and energy package achievements are being monitored following the
internationally-agreed compliance framework, the cornerstone of which is the EU Monitoring Mechanism
Regulation outlining requirements for Member States (MS), and is evaluated with assessments through
the European Semester as well as through in-depth evaluation of specific elements.

2.2.1.     EU Monitoring Mechanism Regulation
The current version of the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) entered into force on 8 July 2013
and specifies the reporting rules on GHG emissions to meet requirements arising from current and future
international climate agreements discussed above for GHG Inventories, NCs and BRs, as well as for key
components of the EU climate and energy package which relate to the required reporting for national
policies and measures (PAMs).14 15
It aims to improve the overall quality of data reported as compared to earlier versions, help the EU and
Member States keep track of progress towards meeting their emission targets for 2013-2020 and facilitate
further development of the EU climate policy mix. The current MMR also introduced new elements, such
as reporting of:
        Member States' and the EU's low-carbon development strategies;
        Financial and technical support provided to developing countries, and commitments arising from
         the 2009 Copenhagen Accord and 2010 Cancún Agreements;
        Member States' use of revenues from the auctioning of allowances in the EU emissions trading
         system (EU ETS). Member States have committed to spend at least half of the revenue from such
         auctions on measures to fight climate change in the EU and third countries;
        Emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF);
        Member States' adaptation to climate change.16

2.2.2.     EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)
Under the EU ETS (Directive 2003/87/EC), operators of covered installations and aircraft must annually
report their greenhouse gas emissions, based on the monitoring plan specifying their emissions
monitoring methodology, to the national competent authority. The monitoring reports generated by the

   Information on the EU climate and energy package can be found here: http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/package
15
    Readers should note that much of the EU climate legislation was approved earlier than related international
agreements were concluded, and then is updated periodically. Therefore, it is important to check whether there are
any updates on the EU Commission website or with another reliable source.
16
   http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/g-gas/monitoring

                                                                                                               17
operators must be verified by a third party, before being submitted. Data reported include activity data,
emission factors, specific parameters, oxidation factors, total emissions, and uncertainty.
MS have to report annually on arrangements for the allocation of allowances, the operation of registries,
the application of the monitoring and reporting guidelines, verification and issues relating to compliance
with the Directive and on the fiscal treatment of allowances. The directive also requires MS to ensure
covered installations and aircraft operators monitor and report emissions in accordance to the EU ETS
Monitoring and Reporting Regulation (Commission Regulation 601/2012) to the national competent
authority.
Specific monitoring and reporting provisions for companies related to emissions from installations
covered by the EU ETS are covered by separate implementing legislation not addressed in this document.17

2.2.3.     Progress towards 2020 targets: Assessment through the European Semester
The progress of each MS towards meeting the "20-20-20" targets of the climate and energy package is
assessed every spring as part of the annual Europe 2020 policy coordination exercise, known as the
European Semester. The assessment is based on MS' National Reform Programmes, plus the projections
of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported under the MMR.
MS progress towards meeting their national emission target for 2020 under the Effort Sharing Decision
and their national renewable energy target for 2020 under the Renewable Energy Directive are assessed.
On the basis of its analysis the EU Commission can propose specific recommendations to MS to help
strengthen the mainstreaming of climate action into broader economic policies.18

2.4.     Additional EU Evaluation Requirements linked to Funding

There is ongoing internalization of the obligation to evaluate not only at the EU level but also at MS level,
in part prompted by requirements for structural funds and the use of Regulatory Impact Assessment
within the EU legislative bodies and the national ones, as well as the horizontal and bottom up transfer of
knowledge and practice through other MS, and the network of Evaluation Societies in Europe.19, 20
This institutionalization of an evaluation culture has intensified since 2013, when the EU Commission
published the guide for evaluating social and economic development (EVALSED).
In 2015, the EU Commission published Better Regulation Guidelines to cover the entire policy cycle from
initiation to evaluation, and provides MS with a toolbox with additional guidance on specific elements,
including how to carry out an impact assessment, conducting stakeholder consultations, and information
on methods, models and assessing costs and benefits.21 Within the general culture of evaluation, each
funding stream also typically has an associated evaluation framework and tailored requirements.22
Therefore, in addition to these requirements, the Romanian government is likely to be subject to more
M&E requirements relating to implementation of components of Romania’s NSCC and APCC over time.

2.4.1.     Tracking climate action spending
Climate action is a priority for the EU and the EU has agreed that at least 20% of its budget for 2014-2020
– as much as €180 billion − should be spent on climate change-related action23. To achieve this, mitigation
and adaptation actions will be integrated into all major EU spending programmes, including Operational
Programmes (OPs) for cohesion policy, regional development, energy, transport, research and innovation
and the Common Agricultural Policy (European Structural and Investment Funds). These are expected to
be linked to reporting discussed above in various Action Plans.
Progress towards reaching the 20% spending objective will be monitored annually using a common
tracking methodology integrated into methodologies for measuring performance of all EU programmes.
The climate tracking methodology for climate related expenditure is adapted from an OECD methodology
(the ‘Rio markers’) to provide quantified financial data, reflect the specificities of each policy area.
Expenditures are marked in one of the three categories:
        Climate related only (100%);

EU MSs have an obligation to report on climate spending under the five European Structural and
Investment (ESI) Funds according to this methodology as defined in EU Regulation No 215/2014 24.

2.4.2.     Climate actions mainstreamed in the 2014-2020 EU Operational Programmes
All MS – including Romania - are obliged to report on climate spending under the five European Structural
and Investment (ESI) Funds using a methodology defined in EU Regulation No 215/2014. In addition, each
Operational Program (OP) must incorporate an indicator framework that captures the targets, outputs
and results of climate action (mitigation and adaptation) for the priorities and measures in the OP.
The EU Regulation 215/2014 establishes two deadlines for reporting of climate spending and other
performance indicators under the five European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds for 2014-2020. MS
must report on the achievement of their “indicator milestones” by the end of 2018 and the achievement
of their “indicator targets” by the end of 2023.

3. Current Status of M&E and Reporting of CC Mitigation
   and Adaptation Actions in Romania
There is no comprehensive M&E system in place for monitoring NSCC and/or APCC, but Romania has
the foundations of a system for M&E of public policies upon which it can build. To date, there is little
evaluation activity outside EU requirements associated with funding of specific initiatives. There is a
general framework for M&E of all public policies, not only those relating to climate change. An M&E
system for climate change mitigation and adaptation is to be developed through this current project.
However, a foundation for setting-up the M&E and Reporting system for the NSCC and APCC does exist
in the form of the institutional arrangements for monitoring and evaluating existing policies and
measures that are reported according UN and EU requirements.
In Romanian public administration there is a strong culture of reporting to the upper levels or to the
financing entities, mostly for conformity purposes, not for continuous improvement or learning .
Typically, these actions are primarily descriptive, reporting only the existence of activities, not evaluating
the success or efficiency of them. The systems for collecting data are yet not coherently and systemically
organized, and evaluation activities are in early stages of development and can be improved.
Overall, M&E and Reporting of public policies is not yet comprehensively or consistently performed,
this may be due to the lack of specialized personnel, clearly-defined M&E methodologies and/or lack of
political will to improve the systems. For example, according to the World Bank’s Functional Review of
the Environment, Water and Forestry sector published in 201125:
      “There is no systematic monitoring and evaluation system for the sector as whole, but only
      a patchwork of different information systems in different agencies heavily focused on
      administrative processes, inputs and outputs, and driven by reporting requirements for
      different EU directives (e.g., Water Framework Directive, Nitrates Directive, National
      Reform Program) and responding to the European Commission requests”.
CC&A expertise is extremely limited at the operational level, which impacts all aspects and levels of CC
policymaking and the capacity for future planning. While the concept of CC is somewhat known, the policy
implications for each sector are not. Climate change forums and platforms are missing at the regional or
local levels in particular, and there are no exchanges of good practices between stakeholders. Thus any
accumulated expertise is not shared or maintained.
Successful strategies for cross-sectoral issues like CC requires functional intra-institutional
communication at the national level. Effective trans-sectorial policy coordination is unfortunately lacking.
Sectoral issues with CC implications will be considered solely on criteria used by the authority responsible
for the sector, rather than attempting to work in synergy with the Strategy. Furthermore, the information

needed to make these decisions in an integrated way is frequently only available to the sectoral authority,
with no easily available channels for communicating it efficiently to other relevant authorities.
Romania has technical experts but not sufficient capacity for policy analysis. The Romanian GHG
Inventory and Registry are reporting on GHG emissions in Romania and the functioning of the ETS scheme.
However, this is not sufficient for making decisions regarding the impact of new policies. The type of socio-
economic information needed on LULUCF, for example, cannot be based simply on CO2 emissions or
removals levels. There is little cross-sectoral
information and expertise on evaluating it.                        Enabling an Evaluation Culture

GD 775/2005 includes a framework for M&E of public policies. The action plan for each PP must provide
details on M&E for that PP. The PPUs are required to prepare monitoring reports based on a suggested
template provided by GD 775/2005 as per a schedule that is to be established by the proposed PP. The
monitoring reports must provide details on:

        Institutional changes resulted from the implementation of the PP;
        Changes of the situation of the target groups, during the implementation and upon completion
         of implementation of the PP;
        Implementation costs;
        Whether deadlines were met and how well the content in the Action Plan for that PP was
         covered;
        Delays in implementation of actions and reason for delays.
At a minimum, monitoring reports must include an:
        Assessment of the results ;
        Assessment of costs and comparison of estimated with registered costs;
        Assessment of conformity with the contents of activities and deadlines.
The activities necessary to complete the monitoring reports may be subcontracted to other entities
(including private).

3.1.1.     Evaluation Culture
In response to GD 870/2006, an evaluation awareness campaign was conducted and a National Strategy
for Evaluation (NES) was developed in 2006 addressing the 2007 – 2013 time period, under the Phare-
funded Technical Assistance for Programming, Monitoring and Evaluation project28.
Prior to development of the NES, the awareness campaign29 held conferences on evaluation for targeted
groups focusing on the utility of evaluation, EU requirements and international evaluation experiences.
The campaign also distributed a booklet highlighting good practices for evaluation with examples from
other EU MS that is still relevant today. Many of the principles in the booklet are reflected in this report.30
The NES focused on developing an evaluation culture rather than systems. Planned activities included31:

        Evaluation guidelines, procedures and standards and ethics codes;
        Developing competences – establishing evaluation curricula, training activities;
        Setting up professional networks;

         Association for the Development of Evaluation in Romania, however it is not clear how active this
          association is currently.33

3.1.2.      New Regulations
Recently, the Romanian Government approved GD 398/201534 for the establishment of institutional
framework for the coordination and management of European Structural and Investment funds (ESI) and
for ensuring the continuation of the institutional framework for the coordination and management of
structural funds 2007 – 2013, in response to EU requirements discussed in Section 2.4.1. Tracking climate
action spending. GD 398 /2015 will be enforced as of September 3, 2015.
GD 398/2015 provides the institutional framework as well as the role of institutions involved in
coordination, management and control of ESI funds and structural instruments 2007 – 2013 and 2014 -
2020.
Also, this GD establishes the responsibilities of each institution when/if involved in the coordination
management and control of EU Funds in different Programs implemented in Romania. The Ministry of
European Funds (MEF) has overall coordination, monitoring and evaluation responsibilities with respect
to the EU funds used in Romania. The MEF also prepares monitoring reports for the EU Commissions.
Monitoring of the operational programs will be performed by monitoring committees, which are set-up
in accordance with the Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.35


     3.2. Monitoring and Evaluation of Climate Actions
There is not yet a comprehensive M&E system in place for monitoring NSCC and/or APCC. The first
Romanian NSCC and APCC was set-up in 2005, to cover the 2005 – 2007 time horizon, and related to the
EU accession and the necessity of adopting the EU ETS regulation as well as to the expected enforcement
of the Kyoto Protocol and did not include special M&E provisions or dedicated institutional arrangements.

Romania’s most recent National CC Strategy, adopted in 2013, reflected Romania as an EU MS. It proposed
developing indicators and an M&E system as a part of the APCC, which is being developed in this project.
A foundation for setting-up the M&E system for the NSCC and APCC exists in the form of the institutional
arrangements for monitoring and evaluating existing policies and measures that are reported according
UN and EU requirements – these include the GHG monitoring and reporting system.
Yet, Romania has few effective tools for assessing the impact of CC policy. Romania does not have
procedures for assessing the socio-economic impact of GHG emission reductions measures or the impact
other sectoral measures have on overall GHG emissions.
Stakeholder consultation will be critical, however there are few existing frameworks in place. The creation
of the Climate Partners Network (CPN) would provide a nexus of CC knowledge as well as a link between
public and private stakeholders. The CPN can serve as a “nexus of CC knowledge” and a critical tool for
ensuring that “CC decision making is transparent and evidence-based”.


  3.3. GHG Monitoring and Reporting Institutional Arrangements
In Romania, climate change related regulation and reporting are administered by the Ministry of
Environment, Waters and Forests; therefore, it holds responsibility for preparation of GHG-related
summaries and reports to the EU Commission/EEA and UNFCCC, as summarized in Table 2 and as
described in more detail in in Section 2 above.

Romania’s GHG monitoring and reporting (& verification) system is used for the national GHG inventory
and related statistics; the Romanian Registry for the EU ETS, which is integrated in the European Union
Registry for Emissions Trading; reports under the Kyoto Protocol; submissions of National
Communications and Biennial Reports to the UNFCCC; submissions under the EU Monitoring Mechanism
Decision; as well as for tracking of individual policies.

3.3.1.     Findings on Institutional Arrangements for M&E and Reporting of GHG emissions
The system for monitoring GHG emissions seems to be complete, but there is room for improvement.36
As found in the output A2.3 report, a serious impediment to effective CC action is that CC is fundamentally
a cross-sectoral policy implemented by the MEWF, which has authority over only a fraction of the relevant
issues. When a policy is put into place there have been no available tools for monitoring performance, as
in the case of housing stock energy efficiency programmes.
The institutional arrangements include participants form all socio-economic areas (from Ministries to
research entities and to economic operators) and administrative levels (from the national government
level to the local level). However, the relationship between government institutions does not demonstrate
proactive participation on any side:

  Also refer to other reports in this series, such as output 2.3, “Building Institutional Capacity for Implementing the
National Climate Change Strategy in Romania”.

                                                                                                                    29
         The data providers are not necessarily concerned about the quality of the information provided.
         The MEWF could improve communication regarding the results of the monitoring and informing
          stakeholders about conclusions of the evaluations performed and/or evolution of GHG emissions
          in a sector.
These operating relationships also should be improved, allowing the information to circulate more freely,
so that the data providers understand the importance of the process and the results, as well as the
importance of their contribution. For example, the MEWF could seek to more deeply understand the
priorities and concerns of different stakeholders, and then tailor communications regarding relevant
evaluation planning, and also draft communication strategies, such as leaflets and summary reports,
during and after evaluations that provide details on next steps to utilize evaluation findings.
There are several sector-specific examples of areas for improvement. The individual policies and
measures promoted in the GHG emitting sectors (energy including transport, agriculture, waste
management) are rarely monitored and accounted for in a bottom up approach.37
Different Agencies and Entities (e.g. ANRE, OPCOM) keep statistics in the fields for which they are
responsible (Energy: e.g. guarantees of origin, green certificates, etc.), yet there is no clear link between
their databases and the national effort for monitoring GHG emissions, which is a lost opportunity.
The indicators and responsibilities are incomplete. The appropriate indicators and responsible
institutions are not always clearly defined for the named policies and measures for GHG mitigation. For
example, a PAM implemented in the Transport sector promoting the use of biofuels does not specify the
responsible institution and there is no indicator to be monitored.38 From a pool of 49 PAMs, only 14 have
quantitative indicators mentioned, and those are only address GHGs (CO2, CH4, etc.).


     3.4. Adaptation Monitoring and Reporting Institutional Arrangements
To date, there have been only a few reporting requirements on CC adaptation as compared to mitigation.
The Romanian institutional arrangements for CC adaption designate the MEWF as the responsible entity
for both designing the adaptation policy and monitoring its effects. The local Environmental Protection
Agencies (EPAs), which report to the MEWF in regards to climate change, are the enforcing bodies at the
different administrative levels. Extreme events monitoring is performed by National Meteorological
Administration (ANM) and National Administration of Romanian Waters - “Apele Romane” (NARW).
However, due to the recent evolution in the EU policies39, the relevant Romanian ministries must now
include objectives related to climate change adaptation in their strategies and set up appropriate
monitoring and reporting arrangements.


37
   e.g. GD 882/2004 National Strategy on the heating supply of localities via district generation and distribution
systems, Law no. 220/2008 transposition of the RES directive, National Strategy on Waste Management and the
National Waste Management Plan (Official Journal no. 954/18.10.2004) etc.

   GD 935/2011 promoting the use of biofuels.

   The EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change (COM/2013/0216 final) and the Technical guidance on integrating
climate change adaptation in programmes and investments of Cohesion Policy [SWD(2013) 135] lists requirements
with respect to the 2014 - 2020 financial framework.

                                                                                                               30
 3.5. National Sustainable Development Indicators
It is recommended that the NSCC take advantage of relevant indicators addressed in the National
Sustainable Development Strategy, which is overseen by the NIS. The current indicators relating to
climate and GHG emissions are as follows:

       GHG emissions distributed per sectors         Energy consumption per inhabitant

       Share of RES electricity in the total         Income from taxes for the use and

4. Examples of International Good Practices for M&E and
   Reporting
Evaluation is a huge field with a long history and volumes of literature. 40 Also, there are numerous
different methodologies, depending on the purpose and characteristics of whatever is being evaluated.41
This section focuses primarily on providing examples of good practices for M&E and Reporting at the
national goal and policy level. It also touches upon standardization strategies to facilitate aggregating
information from other levels (e.g. sectors, programs, or projects).
Regarding M&E and Reporting examples for climate change issues internationally, monitoring systems for
GHG emission levels from national inventories under the UNFCCC are typically the most advanced, with
M&E for mitigation policies or GHG emission reductions associated with those policies also common (e.g.
energy efficiency or renewable capacity).42 M&E for indirect emission reductions (e.g. capacity building or
adjusting a legal framework to facilitate emission reductions)43 or other characteristics of mitigation
actions (employment or resource use impacts) are less common, and addressing adaptation is still rare.
Typically, the existing M&E and Reporting systems allow countries to determine if they are meeting
emissions reduction targets, but do not sufficiently incorporate more comprehensive evaluation
principles that would allow them to identify the most effective and resource-efficient policies.44
Few countries have comprehensive evaluation strategies for all policy sectors at the national level, yet
there are numerous examples in specific sectors, such as education, health or energy. Also, stakeholder
engagement and feedback processes are increasingly being incorporated. The evaluation framework
section provides more background on good practices for evaluation more generally.




40
   Such as evaluation activities for development aid, energy, health, public policy and governance as well as more
recently for climate change mitigation and adaptation at the national level to meet UNFCCC requirements.
41
   It is beyond the scope of this document to detail all of the different evaluation strategies and methodologies for
policies and programs that could feed into a national climate change strategy. Interested readers should see for
example: Global Environment Facility, 2015, Good Practice Study on Principles for Indicator Development, Selection,
and Use in Climate Change Adaptation, Monitoring and Evaluation; Wörlen, 2013, Guidelines to Climate Mitigation
Evaluations; Stern, 2012, Broadening the Range of Designs and Methods for Impact Evaluations.

     4.1. General Good Practices for M&E and Reporting
While there are similarities in topics and sectors addressed in the good practices and examples provided
below, each national climate change strategy is unique, representing the priorities and opportunities most
relevant for a particular country. Therefore, the M&E and Reporting strategy needs to be tailored to the
characteristics of that national climate change strategy and other local characteristics, priorities, and
capacities.
Yet, there are common themes and issues that have resulted in the following general good practices that
follow roughly sequential, but overlapping steps45, 46:
Overall

         Plan for an incremental staged approach that improves/expands over time.
         Allow sufficient time to develop systems, as there are several stages many of which involve
          engaging stakeholders or obtaining information or action from other entities.
         Tailor the system to local objectives, priorities, circumstances and capacities.
         The level of effort should generally be proportional to the usefulness/need. Carefully balance
          potentially competing principles (e.g. completeness and accuracy) with feasibility while
          prioritizing transparency and comparability (at least within EU). Consider a cost-benefit analysis
          of different options.
         Leverage or adapt existing institutions and systems, including using common reporting formats
          for reporting, as feasible. Also share knowledge. This also helps maximize compatibility while
          minimizing double counting or unintended gaps.
         Preserve institutional memory -- have sufficient documentation and training to address staff
          turnover.
         A decentralized/integrated structure like an inter-ministerial committee can facilitate
          coordination.
As policy/intervention is being defined
         Begin designing M&E and Reporting systems as early as possible, typically during the policy design
          phase.
         Define scope of the M&E and Reporting, sample questions include:
              o What are the minimum reporting requirements?
              o To what extent should the system track secondary or unintended impacts (positive or
                  negative) noting that sustainable development co-benefits can actually be larger for
                  climate actions47?
              o What local circumstances/priorities are relevant to incorporate?

     For approaches for addressing co-benefits, see for example the CDM Gold Standard at
http://www.cdmgoldstandard.org, and the Social Carbon Standard at http://www.socialcarbon.org.

                                                                                                              33
            o What existing institutional arrangements are already in place or can be easily adapted?
       Assess the relative priorities for evaluation and assessing effectiveness and facilitating continuous
        learning as opposed to simply tracking.
       For a new intervention, develop the initial logic framework identifying expected inputs, activities,
        outputs, and outcomes with milestones -- describe how one can tell if the expectations for each
        phase/milestone have been achieved.
       Assess the potential legal or political mandate necessary to support M&E and Reporting (e.g.
        assigning responsibility to a ministry or expanding the scope of national accreditation body).
       Begin mapping out and synchronizing timetables for finalizing the strategy and developing
        systems as well as ongoing data collection, compilation, different levels of reporting to ensure
        there is enough time for each stage, update in future stages as needed.


Once the policy/intervention components are clear (but ideally before implementation)
       Clearly define institutional structures and assign clear roles and responsibilities, building in
        sufficient capacity, resources, as well as authority and accountability.
       For a new intervention, update the logic framework/diagram and expectations for each
        phase/milestone, identifying potential indicators (both key performance indicators as well as
        other indicators). Use focus areas and subcategories as necessary or helpful to ensure
        comprehensive coverage of all relevant topics. Once priorities and concerns are identified,
        address the level of evaluation desired for each phase.
       Carefully assess which indicators are most relevant for current needs; weighing different options
        as needed. Sample questions include:
            o What are the options for indicators for each topic?
            o What is the expected level of effort, including frequency of collection for each proposed
                 indicator?
            o What are the relevant existing data sources? What new or improved/altered sources
                 would be needed?
            o What inconsistencies in definitions across different sources are there?
            o What are the appropriate baselines for each indicator?
As soon as practical (ideally still before implementation)

       Specify the approach to evaluation, including monitoring indicators.
       Address verification, accreditation of verifiers, and enforcement, as appropriate for each
        indicator; for example, some countries in the EU require third-party verification for GHG and
        financial (spending/cost) impact indicators but not for other issues such as adaptation and co-
        benefits, and not for other stages (e.g. inputs, activities).
       Ensure the appropriate legal or political mandate necessary to support M&E and Reporting is in
        place.
       Develop a knowledge management strategy that includes mapping information flows between
        institutions and other stakeholders.



                                                                                                          34
          For responsible parties, engage in capacity building, drafting protocols, and ongoing information
           exchange.
          Engage external parties as relevant (e.g. independent evaluators, or technical experts to help
           develop monitoring protocols or provide training).


     4.2. Green Growth Good Practices
This subsection is primarily adapted from the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) chapter of the Green
Growth Best Practice Initiative’s 2014 report, entitled Green Growth in Practice Lessons from Country
Experiences.48 A green growth strategy is similar to and includes the national climate change strategy
concept Romania is developing; therefore, the good practices identified in the report are directly relevant
and incorporate many of the concepts presented above.
GGBP authors found that effective M&E increases government accountability, enhances public trust,
improves stakeholder engagement, and facilitates learning. It plays a crucial function in development
planning, and consequently has a key role to play in ensuring the effective design and implementation of
green growth plans, policies and interventions.
Good practice M&E systems are designed around targeted strategic objectives and intermediary results,
as determined by the theory of change of the intervention. These factors then should determine the
indicator selection, institutional arrangements and the strategies for communication and engagement
with stakeholders. In practice, all of the components must come together to make an effective M&E
system that enables decision makers and stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of interventions and
in time, leads to greater ambition and impact.
The current report provides recommendations addressing three common themes for successful M&E
strategies, each of which is discussed below. Authors note how recent green growth efforts are, and the
long time frame required by M&E systems to reach final results and demonstrate durability, therefore the
findings are preliminary, based upon currently available information from countries across the globe.

4.2.1 Indicators
M&E systems for green growth typically develop indicators directly linked to the goals and objectives at
early stages of the strategy to facilitate monitoring. Authors assume that progress will be communicated
to with the general public to create enthusiasm and build trust as well as meet reporting requirements;
they offer the following core recommendations for indicators:

          Incorporate indicators that cover relevant economic, environmental and social objectives to
           provide a complete and integrated picture. Indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), have
           long provided a focus for economic policy making. Now, governments need indicators that
           supplement conventional indicators, such as by addressing green job creation, resource efficiency
           — material resource efficiency and productivity as well as human welfare.



48
     http://www.ggbp.org/

                                                                                                         35
         The OECD developed a framework of headline indicators (OECD, 2011) focused on the socio-
         economic context and characteristics of growth, environmental and resource productivity, the
         natural asset base and economic opportunities and policy responses. The Czech Republic,
         Denmark, Germany, Korea, and the Netherlands have all produced green growth indicators
         following the OECD framework.

        Combine a small number of headline indicators to facilitate easy communication for the public
         with more detailed indicator sets measuring specific outputs and outcomes that facilitate
         tracking underlying changes as well as meeting reporting requirements. Sectoral indicators are
         needed to assess key sectors and progress towards specific targets. There are a range of
         supporting methods and frameworks available relating sectoral performance and impacts,
         including indicators for the new international Sustainable Development Goals, System of
         Environmental Economic Accounts (SEEA)49, Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem
         Services (WAVES), and Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB).

         Using common themes across international, national, and local levels allows comparison of trends
         and patterns. It may be possible to use the same metric at all levels, yet often indicators
         meaningful at the national level may not be relevant at the community level. It is also important
         to confirm that the scope is consistent or at least compatible. For example, the UNFCCC applies
         the national principle (all emissions on the national territory) whereas the SEEA applies the
         residence principle.

        Draw on existing frameworks. Indicator sets such as Sustainable Development Indicators (so
         called post 2015 SDGs)or National Development Indicator sets can be framed for green growth
         purposes (OECD, 2011) and also help maximize synergies. Frequently, these national goals and
         indicators take into account national situations more effectively than universal or international
         goals and indicators. It is possible to frame national development indicators to allow for M&E of
         addressing climate change.

4.2.2. Institutional Arrangements
Having the appropriate institutional arrangements in place is critical for a smooth and efficient system.
System developers should establish institutional arrangements tailored to local circumstances that are
accountable, transparent, clear, integrated and built upon existing arrangements. Key institutional
qualities include legitimacy, relevance, transparency, inclusivity, flexibility, and reliability. The report
recommends to:




49
  Currently, a Task Force on the United Nation level, has in duty to establish a key set of climate change-related
statistics and related indicators based on the SEEA. For more information, go to:
http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/display/climate/Climate+Change

                                                                                                               36
   Ensure the relevant institutions responsible for M&E are accountable and that the institutional
    arrangements are transparent. Institutional arrangements need to maintain independence and
    autonomy to ensure accountability (Holvoet et al., 2012, Morra-Imas and Rist, 2009). For example,
    intergovernmental organizations like the World Bank, United Nations Development Programme
    and the Global Environment Facility, all have evaluation offices that report directly to the
    organizations’ governing body rather than operational management.

    Robust institutional arrangements are crucial for M&E to impact policy. They need to be
    sustainable and resilient in the face of political or other shocks – and efficient in terms of use of
    human and financial resources.

    Professional associations such as the American Evaluation Association, the German Evaluation
    Association and the International Development Evaluation Association have developed codes of
    conduct and evaluation standards that can be used as tools to ensure a minimum level of
    reliability, independence, and methodological rigor.

   Establish clear roles and responsibilities. Government units and other essential actors should also
    be involved in M&E. Clear roles and responsibilities can assist in sharing the burden of
    implementation when addressing issues that cut across different departmental mandates and
    jurisdictions. Whether centralized or decentralized, ensuring co-ordination and alignment
    requires particular clarity on the roles and responsibilities within the M&E framework (Morra-
    Imas and Rist, 2009; Casas et al., 2012; and Lopez Acevedo et al., 2012).

    All actors need to know whom to go to for what information. For example, the Australian National
    Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Scheme, provides clear mandatory requirements for
    industrial organizations to report their emissions through the government’s Clean Energy
    Regulator, which replaced a patchwork of voluntary industry surveys and programs (Department
    of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, 2012; ANAO, 2013).

    The institution in charge of CC M&E needs to have influence, authority and capacity. For example,
    South Africa’s government-wide M&E system is implemented by the Ministry of Performance
    Monitoring and Evaluation, and reports to the President. Through this process, it was highlighted
    that R&D investment targets were being missed repeatedly, forcing the Minister to take action to
    rectify problems. This example suggests that operating M&E systems out of a central agency or
    office with decision-making authority and from a position of limited operational involvement can
    be effective.

   Harmonize with existing M&E systems. Ensuring M&E arrangements are harmonized with
    existing M&E systems is important for efficiency and sustainability.




                                                                                                      37
        New policies and reforms take place in the context of existing institutions. Therefore
        harmonization and alignment are critical to avoid duplication, maximize efficiency (Lopez et al.,
        2012), and reduce costs (Holvoet et al., 2012). The M&E system should build on existing data
        collection systems and integrate CC M&E requirements into existing systems to avoid the risk of
        duplicative or parallel systems.

        In South Africa, the system has been effectively incorporated into M&E requirements of most
        public sector departments. However, a key challenge was getting ministers to work together.

        Integration is also important for avoiding reporting fatigue amongst the responsible organizations
        (Boyd et al., 2012). Existing institutional structures were utilized for green growth M&E in
        Australia. To support harmonization across existing requirements, a streamlining protocol was
        agreed by national, state and territory governments in 2009 (ANAO, 2012).

        While integration is important, for an M&E system to be viewed as fair and objective it must also
        ensure independence, such as data verification by an outside entity or impact evaluation by an
        independent third party. For example, the Sujala Project in India determined that embedding the
        M&E structure within the entity managing the controversial project would not be seen as
        sufficiently objective and trustworthy. Instead, they employed an independent government
        statistics agency and a reputable external M&E organization with a multidisciplinary team (Raju
        et al., 2010). This was seen as important to ensure that data systems remained independent and
        robust and the findings and suggestions from the M&E program were respected and acted upon.

4.2.3. Communication and Engagement
To maximize usefulness and stakeholder support and engagement, M&E results must be communicated
regularly and the level of detail tailored to each audience group. It is important to share information in a
timely and audience-appropriate manner using communication methods, messengers, and channels to
target and engage green growth relevant stakeholders with often divergent interests.
Using communication and reporting mechanisms to facilitate the flow of knowledge, information and
resources throughout the process can provide clarity on the scope, roles, and progress achieved, (UNDP,
2009) therefore strengthening stakeholder buy-in and acceptance of M&E results. Authors recommend:

       Actively engage stakeholders at every stage to help improve buy-in from local stakeholders,
        which improves accountability. Engage key stakeholder groups, adapting engagement strategies
        for government (such as finance, planning, and environment ministries) and other actors (such as
        businesses and investors, citizens and communities) and disseminate M&E results promptly.

        Engaging and informing stakeholders are intrinsic to effective M&E, especially for complex
        agendas which have consequences for stakeholders’ livelihoods and well-being, and can increase
        its legitimacy (GGKP, 2013). CC policies are best served by inclusive, participatory approaches that
        capture both social and environmental impacts of policy implementation (AfDB, 2012).



                                                                                                         38
       Target communication methods to diverse stakeholders. The language, messengers, and
        communication channels for M&E results should be credible and appropriate. Headline indicators
        are suitable for the public via the mass media, while more detailed statistical data via technical
        reports are best for specialists.

        Involving high profile or influential figures in public announcements concerning the implications
        (economic and others) of climate change or environmental degradation can be a powerful way of
        raising public awareness and cultivating a sense of urgency (Regehr et al., 2007). Common
        language and data visualization are useful for communicating complex results to public audiences.

       Create ongoing feedback loops. M&E processes can create communication channels between
        planners and stakeholders, which should be two-way, creating feedback loops for stakeholders to
        provide feedback to the M&E process itself, as well as on the M&E results. Feedback loops
        strengthen transparency, help ensure indicators and data are interpreted and used correctly and
        ensure decision makers understand the implications to act on them (GGKP, 2013).

        Formal on-going involvement of stakeholders can enable ownership and learning and have to be
        built into program and project management processes to ensure effective involvement of
        stakeholders (UNDP, 2002). Stakeholder committees can provide an important advisory,
        monitoring and watchdog role (Deaton, 2010).


  4.3. Special Considerations for Climate Change Adaptation
M&E for adaptation is the assessment of progress made in implementing initiatives that directly or
indirectly affect the level of climate resilience. There is vastly more international experience with M&E for
emissions reductions and mitigation actions which is more deeply integrated into other subsections.
Therefore, this subsection highlights recent findings regarding adaptation to ensure they have solid
foundation as well, as they face unique challenges. For example, there is a new dimension of uncertainty.
Adaptation efforts aim at addressing future climate variations and impacts along with current
development needs. The long time horizons inhibit assessing the effectiveness of adaptation activities. No
universally applicable indicator exists, rather context-specific indicators are required to measure
reduction in vulnerability or other proxies for the success of adaptation in all the different sectors affected.
This means systems need to be robust enough to be useful, but also flexible enough to allow for
recognizing the unanticipated outcomes from adaptation and climate resilience drivers or responses.
Adaptation M&E can build on experience from different sectors and disciplines, such as tools and
indicators from environmental monitoring, environmental impact assessments, cost-benefit analysis, and
M&E approaches for disaster risk reduction as well as general evaluation principles.
So far, M&E of adaptation has primarily been at the project-level, often using results-based monitoring
frameworks of donor and technical cooperation organizations. The majority of M&E and Reporting
activities has been conducted by climate funds, such as the Adaptation Fund, the Global Environmental



                                                                                                             39
Facility (GEF), and the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) and by countries that have
implemented such systems through their National Strategies and Action Plans. (Dinshaw, A.et al, 2014)
A recent study is Climate-Eval’s “Good practice study on principles for indicator development, selection
and use in climate change adaptation M&E”. The authors analyzed several frameworks with different
characteristics noting that adaptation is not an outcome in itself, yet existing indicators may be
repackaged so that they describe adaptation progress and resilience to climate change. GIZ noted in
“National Monitoring and Evaluation of Climate Change Adaptation”, adaptation plans should address:

        How does climate change evolve? Which climate change impacts require most attention?
        Which CC adaptation activities are being implemented in our country? Who does what?
        Are these activities in line with our national adaptation and development goals?
        Are we on the right track in order to achieve national adaptation and development goals?
        How much money is being spent on adaptation activities and is it spent effectively?
        Which sectors, regions and social groups benefit from these adaptation activities?
        Do adaptation interventions actually reduce vulnerability of climate-sensitive sectors and highly
         vulnerable groups?
        Which CC adaptation approaches work and which do not? Under which conditions and why?

4.3.1.     Selecting Indicators for Adaptation
This section summarizes several good practice principles in selecting indicators identified in the Climate-
Eval study,50 which are complementary to the good practices outlined in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 above:
                Combine and complement indicators. Different indicators and indicator types should be
                 seen as complementary. At the output level, indicators can be a mix of both qualitative
                 and quantitative to assess whether or not a goal was attained. Yet, too many indicators
                 can burden the agency and interfere with implementation.
                Participatory processes are particularly relevant and should be used to inform indicator
                 selection. M&E designers need to consider the diverse drivers of vulnerability and
                 resilience, recognizing that societies, communities, and households are not homogeneous
                 and climate change will affect groups differently, leading to different adaptation
                 responses. Interests, priorities, levels of power, capacities, and access to resources may
                 vary dramatically. Stakeholder consultation can (a) help define the focus for indicators;
                 (b) clarify the methods of data collection and evaluation; (c) frame what ‘success’ points
                 are according to beneficiaries; and (d) promote shared ownership and transparency.
                Indicator sets should be engendered. Initiatives must reflect perspectives and priorities
                 of women and other disadvantaged populations for long-term sustainability and success.
                Data sources for indicators should be sound. Robust M&E requires reliable data,
                 appropriately calibrated, e.g. Indicators should consider if of data is easily available.

                Be clear on what is measured. Clear indicator definitions are essential to support data
                 collection and analysis; avoid poorly-defined, vague, or impractical indicators.51
                Indicator sets should also capture the enabling environment in which adaptation takes
                 place. The logical framework should be designed to capture changes in the larger context.


     4.4. European M&E Examples
Evaluation is well-established in many EU MSs, including Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK.
Examples from the Netherlands and Italy illustrate key messages at different points on the spectrum.52
The Netherlands
In the Netherlands, a distinction is made between ex ante evaluation, ex post evaluation and
organizational evaluation. The emphasis is strongly on ex post evaluation, which accounts for 70% of
evaluations carried out in the Netherlands. Evaluations historically have focused on three questions:53
      1. What do we want to achieve? -> Have we achieved what we intended?
      2. What will we do to achieve it? -> Have we done what we should have to achieve it?
      3. What will be the cost of our efforts? -> Was the cost what we had expected?
There was a switch from purely “financial accounting” to “policy accounting” and they now include result
indicators which allow the performance to be analyzed. Other lessons learned include:
      •   The main policy objectives should be evaluated on a regular basis;
      •   Those politically and administratively responsible should be informed about evaluation outcomes;
      •   Within Ministries there should be a clear division of responsibilities for evaluations.54
Italy
When the Italian Department for Development and Social Cohesion Policies (DPS) set out to increase
capacity to evaluate development programs in the 1990s, they faced several challenges. The DPS initially
relied on the EU framework for evaluations of Structural Funds to help build evaluation capacity.55
This was an easy first step for MS to take because the EU framework offers an established body of
regulations, guidelines, and methodological indications on which to build national and regional capacity.
However, initially neither the general public nor the administration perceived the value of evaluation for
local purposes. Other lessons learned from Italy:

   Good examples of indicators with guidance is provided by the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund in its Core Indicator
Methodologies (AFB/EFC.14/6; 2014) and in its Results Framework and Baseline Guideline Document
(AFB/B.14/Inf.6; 2011)

     •   Development of national guidelines and activities to create evaluation capacity within public
         agencies (such agency self-assessments and setting up evaluation units), builds the knowledge
         base of evaluation.
     •   Evaluation training should be provided to all public bodies.
     •   Restricting entry to the evaluation market of Structural Fund interventions, and emphasizing
         large-scale contracts, makes the quality of the evaluation product poorer, as there is less
         competition, particularly from small specialist evaluation firms.
     •   Agencies that see evaluation guidelines as a blueprint, adopting them in only a mechanical way,
         rather than to make them meaningful in the context of their activities, does not create the
         ownership necessary to fully benefit from evaluation. Participation in technical forums, and
         discussions about the potential and limits of evaluation with the evaluation community facilitates
         “togetherness” among the commissioners and evaluators in the whole evaluation process.56

4.4.1.     Case Study: Climate Change M&E and Reporting Practices in Germany
German context for Monitoring and Evaluation
Germany has a well-established evaluation culture, particularly as it relates to ex ante and ex post
estimation of impacts; and there are numerous research institutes, NGOs and private providers that
supplement and complement the activities performed directly by government staff. There is less emphasis
on evaluation of processes, efficiency and continuous learning, though it is sometimes included.
M&E and Reporting for Mitigation
Germany has committed to aggressive emission reduction goals at 40% below 1990 levels by 2020,57 and
adopted the Climate Action Programme 2020 in late 2014 to address mitigation, which incorporates
Germany’s energy transition strategy, or Energiewende.58
The Climate Action Programme has several components with quantitative GHG targets as well as several
soft, cross-sectoral measures, for a total expected reduction is about 82 million tCO2e. Implementation is
the responsibility of the Government and the Ministry of Environment who is to produce an annual
monitoring report incorporating the findings of the triennial progress report required under the energy
transition regulation.
As this initiative is relatively new, there is only partial information on the monitoring plan and indicators;
therefore, the remainder of this section focuses on the earlier Integrated Energy and Climate Programme
(IEKP), implemented since 2008, and other policy instruments59.

   Energy Concept (adopted in 2010 and which provided a clear long-term trajectory to reduce emissions by 80-95%
by 2050 and specified renewable energy and energy efficiency targets) & energy transition laws – the German
Energiewende (adopted in 2011).

                                                                                                             42
Under the IEKP, monitoring was divided among the responsible ministries and agencies and was
coordinated jointly by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Economics and Technology. In an
interesting example, as part of the indicator development process, designers performed a qualitative
assessment of each policy/measure to determine if it was appropriate to monitor with indicators at that
time. An extract of the qualitative assessment addressing the Building sector is presented in Table 5.
So far, two monitoring reports have been published by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and
Energy (BMWi). The most recent, in April 2014, concludes all measures are correctly implemented and
generating the expected results.
The German government also frequently conducts formative or summative evaluations, or hires third
parties, for specific programme elements of the overall strategy60.

M&E and Reporting for Adaptation
Germany adopted the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change61 in 2008. The National Action
Plan on Adaptation proposed actions in 15 sectors and implementation and monitoring responsibilities
are shared between the national and federal state levels.

The M&E framework for adaptation focuses on impacts and response indicators matched to 15 action and
cross-sectional fields prioritized in the German Adaptation Strategy. Characteristics of the indicator
system are (Schönthaler et al., 2010):
i)       It displays climatic impacts and adaptation responses, considers cause-effect-chains, and is
         accepted by experts;
ii)      It can be implemented on the basis of existing data; using broad stakeholder engagement to
         facilitate the identification and application of a wide range of data;
iii)     It reflects available knowledge on the impacts of climate change and the effectiveness of
         adaptation measures by government departments as well as by non-governmental institutions
         and organizations;
iv)      it is open for regular review in response to evolving climate change knowledge and emerging
         political priorities;
v)       it links up with other indicator systems; and
vi)      it facilitates linkages with monitoring and reporting at the EU and the Länder level.
The Adaptation Strategy calls for an M&E framework, the objective of which is not to evaluate the
effectiveness of national adaptation initiatives, but rather to generate lessons and to facilitate mid-course
adjustments of the adaptation approach. The evaluation framework consists of three components62:

        Vulnerability assessment: a descriptive evaluation of progress made on adaptation to climate
         change. The assessment will be forward-looking, drawing on timely climate projections as well as
         information from relevant government entities on their awareness of climate change and of
         complementary adaptation measures.
        Indicator-based assessment: an examination of past and present adaptation initiatives in 15
         action and cross-sectional fields in the Adaptation Strategy. This will be based on an Indicator
         System approved by the federal government. It will also include an assessment on e.g. the level
         of investment in adaptation initiatives and how effective established information portals are.
        Evaluation of the Adaptation Strategy: an evaluation of the extent to which ongoing or planned
         government initiatives address the projected risks and opportunities from climate change.

4.4.2.    Case Study: Climate Change M&E and Reporting Practices in France
French context for Monitoring and Evaluation
As in Germany, France has established an evaluation culture marked by the institutionalization of
evaluation as part of the landscape of public policies though the focus is different. This movement started
with science and technology, which, compared to other public policies, went through a specific
institutionalization process. For French policy makers there has long been a continuum between
“evaluation” and “advice”, as reflected in a set of advisory bodies whose are important in shaping and

understanding of evaluation, and the importance given to indicators. Research institutions, universities,
programmes, and agencies are central to the French experience in evaluation.63
Traditionally, Romania’s institutional arrangement are influenced by those of France.
M&E and Reporting for Mitigation
France has established a goal in the 2005 Energy Policy Orientation Law for a four-fold reduction of GHG
emissions by 2050. A mitigation action plan is updated every other year to feed into EU and UNFCCC
requirements for National Communications.
In 2013, the French Government issued an energy efficiency action plan, in relation with the GHG
mitigation actions. This plan envisages measures in the following sectors: transport, residential-tertiary,
industry and energy generation, agriculture, forestry, waste, exemplary role of the State, Business, and
Research. Policies and measures were proposed in the following sectors: Cross sectoral policies and
measures, Transport, Residential – Tertiary, Public administration, Energy, Agriculture and forests, Waste,
Public awareness, Information and Education and Industry. Table 6 provides a partial listing of the policies
and measures categories for transport as an example.
The monitoring system is well established and monitored information is centralized at the level of Ministry
of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy.

M&E and Reporting for Adaptation
France adopted a National Adaptation Strategy in November 2006 addressing the following:
         Develop scientific knowledge                            Use of legal instruments
         Strengthen the observation system, and                  Encourage voluntary approaches and
          ensure its operation on the long term                    dialogue with private stakeholders

Based on the Strategy, the first French National Adaptation Plan includes for 19 topic areas and one cross-
sectoral theme resulting in a set of 84 actions expressed in over 200 measures. To facilitate monitoring,
an action sheet outlines the five or six actions and relevant measures. These actions can be broadly
categorized as i) production and dissemination of information, ii) adjustment of standards and regulations,
iii) institutional adaptation, and iv) direct investment.
Monitoring is performed continuously using indicators defined for each measure and there is annual
reporting by the Observatoire National sur les Effets du Réchauffement Climatique (ONERC) within the
Directorate General for Energy and Climate (DGEC) based on indicators defined in the Plan.
Evaluation is performed by an Evaluation Committee comprised of civil service representatives tasked
with implementing the Plan, representatives from the Grenelle Environment Monitoring Committee
specializing in adaptation issues, and representatives from the scientific community.
A mid-term evaluation in 2013 concluded that implementation for most of the measures is on track.

5. Evaluation Framework & Indicator Development
It would be impossible to appropriately cover all relevant evaluation methodologies and approaches in
this document, instead authors provide a solid yet flexible evaluation framework that is consistent with
existing Romanian, EU and UNFCCC principles.
In contrast to monitoring, which involves collecting data over time, climate policy evaluation uses data to
answer specific questions about policy implementation, effects, or related issues. Outcome or impact
evaluations seek to identify the effect of a particular policy, programme, intervention, or investment.
Evaluations may assess policy effectiveness vis-à-vis environmental impact, cost, or other qualities.
Evaluations can be qualitative or quantitative or both. They can be on an ex-ante or ex-post basis, and can
occur as one-off efforts or on a periodic basis throughout the lifecycle of a particular policy effort. 64
M&E and Reporting for climate change requires pragmatism and a clear sense of purpose. They should
‘look’ both downwards and upwards, so that national decisions are informed by sub-national experiences
and nations are able to share their progress effectively with the wider international community.


     5.1. Evaluation Principles
The EU, as well as Romania, have adopted the OECD DAC criteria, which provides a framework to be used
during any evaluation: relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability65. (See
Table 7) The OECD DAC criteria and associated indicators are not necessarily examined in every evaluation,
rather the criteria as well as the methods are adapted according to the stage of implementation and
evaluation objectives. The multi-annual programming has allowed an “evaluation cycle” to develop, which
“follows” the progression of the intervention.
The method chosen to evaluate a policy instrument or policy package is of vital importance in ensuring its
transparency. A professional evaluator will look at the intervention, and propose a feasible evaluation
methodology based on the policy objectives and stage of implementation, as well as the specific
evaluation goals, budget and resources available.
Standard evaluation methodologies include beneficiary surveys and implementation staff interviews, case
studies, stakeholder consultations as well as more technically-based approaches such as cost benefit
analysis, econometric analysis, macro-economic modeling and regression analysis.
While evaluation can be carried out by the implementing organization, it is strongly recommended that it
be carried out by a party external to that unit to maintain sufficient independence to ensure the integrity
of the evaluation and results ultimately reported. In addition, specific technical expertise or experience
with the evaluation methods needed may necessitate involving external parties.

External parties could be, a central evaluation unit in that entity or centralized at a higher government
level, and/or external experts, such as professional evaluators and research institutes. If the decision is
not already dictated by an overall evaluation policy, it should be determined on a case-by-case basis,
reviewing the specific evaluation questions, scope, target group, costs and sensitivity.

  Evaluation                                                  Meaning
   Criterion
 Relevance         The relevance of an activity is the extent to which its stated objectives and
                   implementation plan correctly address the identified problems. Changes in either the
                   nature of the problems originally identified, or in the circumstances - whether physical,
                   economic, institutional or policy, etc. - in which the activity takes place, can render the
                   action no longer relevant to the problems it was set out to tackle.
 Efficiency        The efficiency criterion concerns how well the activity has used the available resources
                   toward the intended results. It addresses value-for-money issues, that is, whether
                   similar results could have been achieved more by other means at lower cost in the
                   same time.
 Effectiveness     The effectiveness criterion concerns whether the activity achieved its objectives set
                   during the programming phase. The key question is what difference the activity made
                   in practice, as measured by how far the intended beneficiaries really benefited from
                   the products or services it made available.
 Impact            The term impact refers to the extent to which the benefits received by the target
                   beneficiaries had a wider overall effect on larger numbers of people in the sector or
                   region or in the country as a whole.
 Sustainability    The sustainability criterion relates to whether the positive outcomes of the activity at
                   purpose level are likely to continue after external funding ends, and also whether its
                   longer-term impact on the wider development process can also be sustained at the
                   level of the sector, region or country


     5.2. Theory- based Evaluation
It is recommended that Romania follow a theory-based approach for evaluation frameworks for specific
interventions as it facilitates an iterative process of design, evaluation, and redesign based on lessons
learned. The theory-based approach has several benefits over other approaches: 66
         It facilitates evaluation of the whole policy implementation process, not just in one stage, such as
          examining only initial inputs or final impacts (i.e., realized energy savings).

                                                                                                                  48
        Through the development of indicators for each step in the implementation process, the
         “successes and failures” can be determined to the greatest extent possible.
        By applying this approach, evaluators not only learn whether policies are successful or not but
         also why they succeeded or failed and how they can be improved.
It is possible for a significant gap to emerge among policy adoption, implementation, and ultimate effect,
due to gaps in implementation (for example, lack of compliance and enforcement) or changes in external
drivers (for example, macroeconomic trends or fuel prices that differ from what had been expected). 67 A
theory-based evaluation approach is one proven method for identifying the specific point(s) where the
policy implementation chain is not performing as expected.
The following sample questions are intended to be illustrative rather than prescriptive or exhaustive
examples of the types of questions that can be addressed through a theory-based evaluation. In
evaluating the success or failure of the policy, what was the contribution of:68
        Transparent decision-making?
        Financial accountability?
        Quality of stakeholder engagement?
        Intergovernmental coordination?
        Effective tracking?
        Enforcement of compliance measures?
In addition:
        How could lessons learned from this assessment be applied to other policies to improve
         implementation?
        What do the findings suggest for strengthening the functioning of the executive departments or
         agencies that have been studied?
        Should the policy be reviewed?
        What key lessons should be integrated into the policy implementation to improve the quality of
         outcomes?

5.2.1.     Steps in a theory-based evaluation
For theory-based policy evaluation, the evaluator establishes a plausible theory on how a policy
instrument (or a package of instruments) is expected to reach the policy goals, and who is expected to
take action at which point in time. (For sample policy instruments, see

through ultimate direct and indirect impacts.69 (See Figure 2).

Figure 2 General policy Input to Impacts Chain




This mapping is then incorporated into a logic model which facilitates matching indicators to specific
objectives and the broader goals. This general process provides a solid foundation for many levels and
types of evaluations, and is applicable for any sector or strategy. The general steps are as follows:70
     1. Define and characterize the policy instrument or package, e.g. goals and targets, implementation
        period, targeted groups, the active agents and the actions they perform, budget, whether it is
        new or an evolution of an existing policy, linkages, synergies or overlaps with other policies and
        any other relevant information specific for that policy.


Map out the policy implementation process, addressing all cause–impact relationships and all
assumptions on the way, i.e. how the policy instrument will reach its target audience and achieve the
intended impacts, including the relationship with other policy instruments. This process can be high-level
or very detailed, depending on the circumstances. However, it needs to be robust enough to facilitate
clearly mapping potential indicators to related objectives in the next step, while accounting for
uncertainties or assumptions. Ideally, the policy makers have already clearly described the intended
process, and which actor is expected to do what.
    2. Table 8Table 9 provides sample mapping of intermediate effect indicators to policy instruments.

     3. Translate the information into a logic framework organized into at least three levels policy goals
        – objectives – and potential indicators for each stage, of implementation, as appropriate, i.e.
        inputs, processes/activities, outputs, outcomes, impacts (direct and indirect). The OECD DAC
        criteria as well as the SMART indicator concepts are particularly relevant at this stage. For each
        assumed cause–impact relation, an indicator can be drawn up to “measure” whether the cause–
        impact relation actually took place and to “measure” whether the change (or part of the change)



69
   Terminology and specific definitions vary, but this is linked to the concepts of “causal chain”, and “theory of
change” for example.

                                     equal to its actual emissions, and allow permits to be traded among
                                     sources. These are also known as emissions trading programs, emissions
                                     trading systems (ETS), or cap-and-trade programmes.

  5.3. Principles for Developing Indicators
The indicators selected should actually be effective at their function. Indicators are quantitative or
qualitative variables associated to a target value used to show whether the objectives of an action have
been achieved. To be relevant, indicators must mirror final or intermediate objectives of an action.
Monitoring is the assessment of the indicator value, which can then be compared with the objective. The
process of selecting indicators and setting targets for these indicators can be helpful in validating whether
the desired objectives of a policy instrument are realistic.



                                                                                                          52
Logical framework analysis addressing the different stages of implementation of the policy instrument or
policy package provides a good basis for developing indicators:71
        Progress indicators track the implementation status of policy implementation activities and
         outputs. Progress indicators may also relate directly to impact indicators if the impact is assessed
         on the basis of certain milestones being reached. For example, the number of efficient lighting
         products distributed could be a progress indicator where the activity is a target for EE lamp
         distribution. This indicator is also an input to estimate the GHG impacts. Progress indicators help
         demonstrate implementation effectiveness and funding efficiency for specific activities.

        Impact indicators track the outputs and impacts of the policy instrument, referred to as outcomes
         in the logical framework analysis. Outcomes could be short-term changes (learning: awareness,
         knowledge, skills, motivations), medium-term changes (behavior, practice, decisions, policies) or
         long-term changes (consequences: social, economic, environmental etc.). Normally, the long-
         term outcomes are referred to as impacts. In the context of climate change, two relevant impacts
         are achievement of sustainable development goals and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
         For GHG reductions, the indicator is the amount of GHG emissions. In the case of sustainable
         development, the goals and potential benefits of implementing the policy are a good starting
         point for identifying appropriate indicators. Indicators could be either quantitative (MW of RE
         capacity created) or qualitative (such as the successful enforcement of EE appliance standards).

5.3.1.     Criteria for Indicators
Good practices almost universally recommend using SMART criteria to develop indicators, while bearing
in mind the trade-off between price and precision. SMART is defined as follows:
1. Specific: indicators should be defined precisely, so there is no room for interpretation, whether the
target has been achieved or not;
2. Measurable: it is possible to assess the value of the indicator during or after the implementation of the
policy instrument;
3. Achievable: the target associated to the indicator can be realistically reached by the policy
implementation activities within the set timeframe;
4. Relevant: the indicator is helpful in showing whether the desired outcome has been achieved;
5. Timely: the indicator specifies the timeframe for reaching the target set.
For a specific measurement methodology, the following principles should be adhered to when assessing
tradeoffs between different options:

Countries.”http://www.namapartnership.org/-

                                                                                                          53
        Accuracy: measurement should be as accurate as the budget will allow and aligned with the use
         of measurement results in evaluating outcomes and impacts. Accuracy trade-offs should be
         accompanied by increased conservativeness in making estimates and judgements. Further,
         accuracy should be determined taking into account the significance of the outcomes and impacts.
        Completeness: measurement methodologies should cover information related to all the effects
         of policy implementation activities. Some outcomes and impacts, such as GHG emission
         reductions, will be estimated from measured data. In such cases, the documentation should
         clearly outline the process and procedures for estimating outcomes and impacts (emissions
         factors of electricity production, for example), as well as other measured data used for estimates.
        Conservativeness: estimates and measurements should be made so as to err on the side of the
         conservative reporting of outcomes and impacts. The principle of conservativeness should be
         applied to situations in which either measurement or estimating have a high level of uncertainty
         or in which a high level of accuracy of measurement or estimating is not cost-effective. The
         measurement methodology should expressly identify the uncertainty in measurements and
         include procedures for choosing conservative values. The estimation methodology for an
         indicator defines the data to be measured.

5.3.2.     Considerations on Indicators for Climate Change Adaptation
Approaches for adaptation and climate resilience are less developed than for mitigation actions. M&E and
Reporting for adaptation typically focuses on the outcomes of implemented adaptation activities, i.e. how
effectively they respond in practice to reduce identified risks and enhance climate resilience. It is
important to closely monitor and evaluate responses to avoid potential maladaptive developments.
Match approach to ultimate objective. While for some objectives and adaptation options core indicators
(for process and outcome) can be established, it might be appropriate for others to focus on an aggregate
assessment. For risk reduction measures, an overall risk assessment may be more suited than, for
example, for measures aimed at increasing people’s awareness.72
Engage stakeholders and experts. When defining an indicator set for adaptation, broad stakeholder
consultation can help target the information generated towards prioritized adaptation needs and filling
existing information gaps. Stakeholder consultation can start with the national/local authorities
responsible for adaptation and climate change.73

Sectoral experts knowledgeable about the projected climate change risks and vulnerabilities can play an
important role in identifying suitable indicators. Further, collectors and holders of national data
understand what aspects of adaptation can be measured, what historical data are available, and what
information is likely to be collected in the future. The contribution of data collectors to such consultations,
however, will be contingent on them having a basic understanding of adaptation.

Anticipate the unintended and unexpected: The M&E approach should be sufficiently flexible to explore
the unintended and unexpected as this may be where the most important adaptation lessons are learnt.74

5.3.3.    Macro-level indicators for climate strategy progress analysis
Whenever feasible, the indicators relevant for the implementation of the APCC associated with the NSCC
should also map to the macro-level indicators used to assess the overall progress toward the
implementation of Romania’s low carbon development and green growth strategy to ensure the
consistency and synergy with country’s and official reporting on climate change. These macro-indicators
support policy making at the national level, aid in comparison and understanding of the differences
between other EU Member States. The macro indicators should be integrated with those required and
reported under the MMR reporting See Annex III for a list of annual indicators from 525/2013/EU and
other UNFCCC related reporting, such as the annual level and trend of GHG emissions in the National GHG
inventory report, National Communications and Biennial Reports.

5.3.4.    Quantifying Indicators
The indicator quantification could be undertaken either directly (measurement) or indirectly (estimation)
using a variety of techniques. For example, the data to be quantified could either be directly measured
(e.g. in estimating GHG emissions reductions from implementing a policy to promote wind energy, the
amount of electricity produced through wind-power plants can be directly measured at the wind-power
plants established as a result of the policy), collected through survey methods based on sampling
techniques (e.g., for estimating GHG emissions reductions from the use of EE lights, data on the number
of hours the lamps are used could be obtained through a survey of appropriate samples of installed CFLs),
or collected from secondary sources (e.g., the emissions factor for a grid could be sourced either from
registered CDM projects or estimated using information available in public documents).75

5.3.5.    Responsibilities for Data Collection
The implementing entity in the government is typically responsible for ensuring that data are measured,
stored and reported in accordance with procedures by those responsible for undertaking measurement.
Responsibility for specific data collection activities would depend on the type of activity. For example, for
a policy to implement EE measures in the cement industry, measurements of fuel consumption, the
emissions factor for fuel and output could be undertaken by participating cement plants in accordance

with the established procedures. Government entities responsible for collecting statistics could also be
involved in collecting data by integrating data collection formats in its regular data collection activities. 76

5.3.6.      Indicator Monitoring Plans
For each indicator it is important to develop a monitoring plan as monitoring approaches should always
be laid down in written form at a high level of detail to ensure that the same approaches are used over
time, thus facilitating comparability of data over time. 77 The monitoring plan should address:
         Definition and overall approach, e.g. accounting principles to be used and whether ex ante and/or
          ex post data is needed
         Data collection methods and procedures, indicating the agencies responsible for the existing
          indicators
         Sources of data (either existing data sources or additional data collected specifically to monitor
          the indicators)
         Overall monitoring period (at least including the policy implementation period) and data
          collection frequency
         Units of measure
         Baseline or status quo, as relevant
         Methodology: whether the data are measured, calculated or estimated; if a measure is calculated
          or estimated, how uncertainty will be accounted for. Also address calculation assumptions
         Methods for generating, storing, collating, and reporting data on monitored parameters (this
          would include who is responsible and could range from generating a simple table to uploading
          information to a real-time web platform)
         Procedures for internal auditing, quality assurance, and quality control (QA/QC)
         Any other relevant information.
      The monitoring plan needs to be feasible. For example, data should be collected with as high a
      frequency as is feasible for that indicator and be appropriate in the context of monitoring objectives
      as determined by the decision makers considering data availability, without creating undue burden.


     5.4. Verification
The overall verification approach must be defined, addressing which information should be verified and
at what level of independence. Verification strategies seek to ensure that selected reported information
is accurate and complete, and are also on a continuum of rigor and complexity. Verification also plays an
important role in facilitating implementation by highlighting areas where no further attention is needed

technical resources.78
Independence is a key issue in verification. Whatever the strictness of verification might be, the entity
performing the verification should be independent from the entity providing the data to be verified. This
is necessary to avoid conflicts of interest. 79
Generally, verification for each metric should involve, at a minimum, internal plausibility checks, which
could then be supplemented by review from a disinterested but knowledgeable staff from the same or
related entity. A middle option is compliance to a national or international standard with or without
verification, the most complex from an implementation
perspective is third-party verification by accredited verifiers, Sample Levels of Verification

The verification strategy ultimately must be defined for each              party with formal accreditation
indicator/metric as determined by EU or international
requirements or by Romania itself (if considered necessary). For
example, third party verification is used for The EU ETS, where independent verification ensures that
companies are accurately reporting their emissions. And related data. However, verification strategies for
entire classes of indicators, such as those relating to GHG impacts may be handled the same way, e.g. if
third-party verification by accredited verifiers is needed then the Romanian government would authorize
the existing National Accreditation Body, the Romanian Accreditation Association (RENAR) to develop an
appropriate accreditation path for entities that wish to become accredited verifiers. Internal validation
strongly recommended as a minimum for all indicators for the NSCC and APCC.
In many cases, countries prioritize by assigning more stringent verification on the areas with the highest
relevance and/or greatest risk of error or uncertainty in the beginning, and expanding over time. At a
minimum, any data collected from parties that may have an interest in manipulating the results should be
subject to third-party verification. For example if Romania must spend a great deal on adaptation
strategies, the Romanian Government may find it important to third-party verify the measurements
describing conditions and/or that responsible parties are in fact taking the actions/ achieving the results
they claim.
It is noted that, where both top-down and bottom-up approaches are implemented for similar areas, they
can be used for validation purposes, e.g. top-down data might be validated using the bottom up figures,
but unlikely to exactly match.80

6. Discussions and Recommendations for Romania
An effective and efficient M&E and Reporting system is an essential component of any CC Strategy and
is especially important where policy-makers are still at an early stage in developing their understanding
of what exactly makes a good strategy for CC mitigation and adaptation.
As discussed in Section 3, there is no comprehensive M&E and Reporting system in place for monitoring
NSCC and/or APCC, but Romania has the foundations of a system for monitoring and evaluation of public
policies upon which it can build. Although, to-date, there is little evaluation activity outside EU
requirements associated with funding of specific initiatives, whilst the general framework for M&E and
Reporting of all public policies that has been inconsistently implemented.
A specific M&E system addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation is to be developed through
this current project.
Overall, the system for monitoring GHG emissions seems to be complete and operating normally, though
it can be further improved. The institutional arrangements and operational relationships need to be
improved and roles and responsibilities better clarified. The appropriate indicators and responsible
institutions are not always clearly defined for the named policies and measures for GHG mitigation.
Databases from different agencies and entities could also be linked to increase efficiency. Also existing
legal requirements need to be fully and consistently implemented.
As a relatively new area of interest for the Romanian policy, the M&E and Reporting system for CC needs
to:
     ●   Be useful for all partners
     ●   Be simple and cost-effective, affordable and practical:
             ○ Avoid duplication of efforts
             ○ Use data for multiple purposes, as feasible
             ○ Ensure that users can obtain data
             ○ it is based on a manageable number of indicators
     ●   Recognize that different interventions need different time scales
     ●   Allow meaningful interpretation of data over time
     ●   Have the flexibility to respond to changing priorities
     ●   Incorporate the principle of continuous improvement along a continuum
Recommendations to the Romanian government for developing a simple, affordable and cost effective
M&E system for the NSCC and APCC are set out below. 81 These are clustered into 5 main groups. Firstly,
there is a summary of the key recommendations which have been highlighted in the main body of the
report. These are followed by a rich set of additional practical recommendations under the headings of:

       Recommendations for improving institutional arrangements
       Recommendations for developing a solid evaluation framework
       Recommendations for reporting


  6.1. Key recommendations from the report
The M&E and Reporting system for the NSCC and APCC should be built on components of the existing
M&E system and, as much as possible, on the current activities of institutions already involved in
monitoring.
An effective M&E and Reporting system requires considerable time and resources, therefore building on
existing principles and practices is highly recommended. Furthermore, the M&E system initially
established for the NSCC and APCC must not be considered as static, but rather as an on-going continuum
that will evolve, expand and improve over time as linked to long term framework of low carbon
development strategy and green growth.
Indicators currently monitored by the NIS, ANRE, OP Management Authorities, and other entities should
be used for monitoring of the NSCC and APCC to the extent feasible to maximize synergies. Other relevant
indicators, are derived from the requirements of EU reporting in the MMR and funding framework (2014
- 2020) also related to UNFCCC reporting. New indicators can be proposed as necessary. The MEWF
should facilitate and ensure a fully synergistic effort with other reporting processes, e.g., Low Carbon
Development Strategy, UNFCCC reporting and the MMR.
A thorough analysis should be performed in order to identify the indicators proposed for the NSCC and
APCC, and the indicators monitored by the NIS and/or other agencies/ministries. Differences may appear
both in the names and calculation method of indicators, however these can be negotiated so that a
consistent and accepted method is agreed, thereby allowing their use for multiple purposes. A working
procedure between the main actors involved (i.e. NIS, MEWF etc.) can be adopted in order to ensure all
stakeholders use a consistent approach. All work on the identification, development and / or adaptation
of indicators should involve a process of stakeholder consultation.
Evaluation of the NSCC and APCC should use a theory-based evaluation approach incorporating the
OECD DAC criteria, specific evaluation methods and indicators need to be tailored to the individual
policy instrument or policy package.
The theory-based approach facilitates an iterative process design, evaluation, and redesign based on
lessons learned. The theory-based policy evaluation method has several benefits over other evaluation
methods since it facilitates evaluation of the whole policy implementation process (not just one stage);
through the development of indicators for each step in the implementation process, the “successes and
failures” can be determined to the greatest extent possible, and; by applying this approach it is possible
to not only learn whether policies are successful or not, but also why they succeeded or failed and how
they can be improved.




                                                                                                       59
  6.2. Additional general recommendations
Begin elaborating the M&E system before the implementation of the NSCC and APCC.
It is advisable that elaboration of the evaluation approach, including identification of indicators, starts
before or in the early implementation phase of the NSCC and APCC so that there is a possibility for
collecting relevant and necessary data for the monitoring process. For example, the Strategic
Environmental Assessment (SEA) procedure may be a good moment for developing and for refining
indicators either by generating new ones or by using existing indicators.
Agree and communicate on the purpose of the M&E system with clear objectives and a development
strategy.
Before mapping-out out a plan (see below) to develop and implement a monitoring, evaluating and
reporting system it is important to agree and communicate on its purpose. There are numerous reasons
that might drive M&E efforts, including a need to account for public funds; to learn what works (or not)
and why; to track progress; ensure equity and social justice; or to measure efficiency and effectiveness.
All are valid, although be aware that tensions (as well as synergies) can develop between them.
Integrate regular reviews and revisions (e.g. every 3-5 years) of the strategic objectives and institutional
arrangements of the NSCC into the M&E system from the outset.
It is recommended that procedures for regular review and revision of the strategic objectives of the NSCC,
plus the status of the institutional infrastructure for implementing the NSCC and APCC, are fully integrated
into the M&E system at the design stage. The timing of review / revision may be connected to the
schedule for preparing evaluation reports, but they are not the same process and should be considered
separately.


  6.3. Recommendations for improving institutional arrangements
Overall responsibility for monitoring, evaluation and reporting of the NSCC should be given to the Public
Policy Unit (PPU) of the MEWF.
Governmental Decision no. 775/2005 provides the general framework and basic indications for the M&E
of public policies, including the obligation to create a Public Policy Unit (PPU) dealing with policy
formulation and monitoring in each Ministry and State Agency.
The MEWF PPU, assisted by the Climate Change Department, should interact with other specialized units
within the MEWF and the NCCC in order to aggregate the necessary information from responsible
institutions in accordance with a Monitoring Plan (see below and the diagram in Annex 1). In order to
undertake this work, the PPU must ensure it has enough internal or acquired competence with respect to
climate change monitoring and reporting. The MEWF should ensure that the key results of evaluations
are channeled to higher levels, up to and including the prime-minister, as well as civil society and the
general public, as appropriate. Every 2 years, an in-depth analysis of both macro indicators and National
Action Plan specific indicators should be performed by PPU with support of NCCC, and MEWF.




                                                                                                         60
The MEWF must ensure adequate financial resources for the building, operationalization and on-going
expansion of the M&E system.
This not only includes ensuring funding (i.e. financial resources) for dedicated staff, but also for the
necessary stakeholder engagement, review, knowledge exchange and outreach activities, which could
include workshops, consultation meetings, as well as preparing, printing and publishing reports, leaflets,
and newsletters). This also includes broader evaluation activities, collecting stakeholder feedback on the
evaluation reports and adjusting the Strategy and Action Plan over time. These resources can be allocated
either through the Environment Fund Administration (EFA) or directly through the budget of the MEWF.
The MEWF must ensure that adequate human resources with appropriate knowledge and skills are
committed to M&E activities, including adequate capacity and competence in the PPU to deal with CC
issues.
This includes having adequate numbers of staff dedicated exclusively, or primarily to monitoring,
evaluation and reporting activities, who have the appropriate knowledge and training. Any problems with
high staff turnover should be addressed since this can significantly limit technical capacity and
competence.
Staff training programs are essential. For example, MEWF experts performing environmental impact
assessments have to-date only touched on CC in minimal ways, as issues of general context. Many have
considerable knowledge of environmental concerns, but fewer are aware of CC risk and impact
assessments. Therefore specialized training, perhaps financed by the ESI Funds, will need to be made
available to ensure that relevant CC indicators, etc., are selected for all projects and programs. The MEWF
could also consider support for work experience with international organizations (e.g. MEWF to support
secondments in international organizations like EU, UNFCCC) or bilateral or twining with other
governments.
Relevant MEWF experts should actively engage in international networks for sharing knowledge and
experience with other technical / evaluation experts.
Active engagement with international networks and the activities of the EU and other intergovernmental
bodies is a great way for MEWF experts to keep abreast of the latest developments and innovations, to
avoid duplication of effort and improve working inefficiency. Such networking should be encouraged and
supported by MEWF senior management as a critical part of their staff’s professional development.
Where appropriate, institutional capacity should be increased by using the expertise of third parties.
MEWF does not currently have enough staff competent in CC-related issues and in the short to medium-
term (whilst capacity is being built) should not hesitate to use external expertise where appropriate /
available.
The PPU should develop a Monitoring Plan defining all responsible institutions, sources of information,
frequency of data collection, evaluation procedures, frequency of reporting, consultation on evaluation
reports and procedures for amendment of the NSCC and APCC.
It is important that the Monitoring Plan defines the beneficiaries of all reports, as well as the process of
collecting the feedback of the stakeholders on the evaluation reports and the process and schedule for


                                                                                                         61
reassessment of the NSCC and APCC. This feedback may be collected both in writing and through
workshops organized and led by the MEWF.
Communication and information exchange (including a clear and efficient process for data sharing) must
be established and maintained between all governmental entities associated with the M&E system.
There is a need for increased communication and data / information exchange between relevant
government entities at all governance levels to improve system functioning and proactively address any
weaknesses. This will be particularly important as the M&E system expands and is also compatible with
the broader needs, as highlighted in the NSCC, for the Romanian government to: i) establish a well-
functioning, automated communication system for early warning announcements about climate-related
hazards, such as floods, droughts, landslides and wildfires, and; ii) develop a consistent approach and
dedicated database for monitoring and assessing the damage associated with these hazards.
There is an urgent necessity for updating, upgrading and strengthening the communication network
between all responsible agencies and authorities – an investment which will serve multiple purposes since
fast data acquisition and processing is essential to support decision-making, damage assessment,
monitoring, evaluation and reporting – as well as the on-going creation of a consolidated knowledge base
of climate-related risks and impacts on a national scale.
All institutional arrangements must be kept up-to-date with the regular reviews and revisions of the
M&E system.
Conduct periodic reviews of system needs and update legal frameworks, roles and responsibilities,
resource allocation, and knowledge management as necessary. Ensure a systematic procedure for
integrating additional components into the M&E system.


  6.4. Recommendations for developing a solid evaluation framework
M&E can be reinforced by strengthening the CC aspects of SEA and EIA.
The European legislation on impact evaluation provides a solid basis for identifying relevant CC indicators.
In fact the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU, which is to be transposed by 2017, clearly establishes climate change
impact as one of the factors to be monitored. SEA legislation has similar provisions.
However, while the new legislation is being transposed a provision will need to be added to the current
impact assessment legislation which would require the owner of the strategy/program/project to assess
the GHG emissions projections and climate change hazards while considering the
development/investment alternatives and the possibility of adopting a more CC friendly option. By adding
this provision, the Government can contribute to enhancing CC awareness at all levels (business, public
authorities, civil society) and ensure consistent financing and monitoring for CC projects.
Since the majority of projects funded by the ESI Funds will go through EIA or SEA they will, for the period
2014-2020, need to monitor CC indicators relevant for each individual project. Romanian ESI Funds
managing authorities will need to ensure that guidelines for EU Operational Programmes include a
reference to the need to monitor CC indicators identified through the impact assessments, as well as a
channel for the data to be aggregated.


                                                                                                         62
Engage stakeholders early and often by providing them the opportunity to give feedback in written
form, by organizing meetings and workshops etc.
Consultation and feedback need to become an integral part of the M&E system and are essential for
ensuring transparency and accountability to the general public and wider stakeholder community.
However, public consultation and feedback processes also require staff and budget resources, as well as
support by senior management and the other actors involved. It is advisable that the MEWF creates a
budgetary line for the evaluation process and for collecting and analyzing the feedback (either directly or
through the EFA) and that it allocates the necessary human resources to manage the process (either
through the PPU or through the Climate Change Direction Unit). Feedback may be received either in
writing or during the workshops/meetings of the stakeholders. Based on the feedback received, the PPU
of the Ministry should propose any updates / modifications necessary for improving implementation of
the NSCC and/or APCC.
A key principle will be to engage stakeholders early and often. The SEA procedure offers one opportunity
for broad public consultation involving the highest level of the authority managing the programme and
groups of future users of the system, as well as the main suppliers of information, which are the different
institutions who implement the actions in the field. Their participation is likely to ensure that the system
is pragmatic because they are familiar with the practical possibilities and limits of data collection.
Creation of the Climate Partners Network (CPN) will provide a formalized channel of communication
between key stakeholders and national authorities for making CC policies, including the NSCC and APCC,
more responsive and effective.
Pay special attention to the monitoring and evaluation of actions for CC adaptation.
Romanian legislation currently makes no provision for the monitoring of actions for CC adaptation, despite
the fact that the country’s first Adaptation Plan was established in 2008. The foundation for M&E of
mitigation actions is, on the other hand, much better established. MEWF should therefore give particular
attention to monitoring and evaluating the adaptation components of the NSCC and APCC, including close
liaison with Ministries responsible for monitoring investments in adaptation under the 5 EU Operational
Programmes (the Regional Operational Programme, Large Infrastructure Operational Programme,
Human Capital Operational Programme, Administrative Capacity Operational Programme, and
Competition Operational Programme) financed by the 2014-2020 ESI Funds.
Adaptation requires people to act. The M&E of CC adaptation will inevitably involve some form of
engagement with the efforts and initiatives of local communities and businesses. If local authorities are
encouraged to make use of available funding for preparing and implementing local adaptation strategies,
then they must also be supported with the monitoring, evaluation and reporting of these actions.
Use third parties for evaluation in order to ensure independence, impartiality and no conflict of interest.
In accordance with international good practice it is recommended that all evaluation activities should be
undertaken by external third parties (based on the OECD DAC principles) in order to ensure independence,
impartiality and avoid conflict of interest. Since Romanian regulation permits this, the necessary
resources should be made available.


                                                                                                         63
Perform evaluations of the NSCC and APCC on a regular basis (e.g. produce a comprehensive evaluation
report every 2 years).
Evaluation is recommended to be performed on regular basis with a comprehensive evaluation report
produced at least every three years during the implementation of the strategy. The frequency of the
evaluation reports may be connected with the frequency of reporting to the UNFCCC and/or EC. For
further specific recommendations on reporting see below.
Deepen the evaluation culture of the MEWF and promote active learning as an integral part of the
evaluation framework in order to realize the full potential of M&E actions.
A broad commitment to full and effective evaluation of the NSCC and APCC should be encouraged at all
levels of government and amongst all relevant stakeholders. Fostering a real “culture of evaluation” will
help to fully utilize the M&E and Reporting system potential and take advantage of the feedback to
increase effectiveness and better target resources. Take heed of the Italian example in Section 4 and take
ownership of the M&E and Reporting system and incorporate mechanisms to provide the feedback the
Romanian government seeks, in addition to meeting external requirements. Also, expand capacity
building and protocol development and actively engage in knowledge exchange. Regain the momentum
that was lost from previous efforts.


  6.5. Recommendations for reporting
Optimize reporting to meet the different needs of different agencies and organizations as much as
possible without unnecessary additional effort.
The revised M&E and Reporting system will need to respond to multiple needs. It is in the interest of the
MEWF to ensure multipurpose monitoring and evaluation and associated reporting. The MEWF (as well
as the General Secretariat of the Government) submits regular reports to the UNFCCC and to the EC.
Therefore it is recommended that the monitoring system is designed in such a way so that it ensures data
consistency and comparability across the different needs, while allowing access to reliable sources of
verifiable information. This will also reduce incremental increases in reporting efforts.
Submit evaluation reports directly to the National Commission on Climate Change (NCCC) in order to
benefit from their expertise and feedback.
The NCCC should receive the outputs of the M&E and Reporting system and be involved in reporting. In
order to benefit from the expertise acquired by the National Commission on Climate at national level, it
is recommended that the evaluation reports are submitted to this Commission in order to get feedback
and to the General Secretariat of the Government for formal approval and follow-up of policy
implementation. Also, the results and recommendations of the reports must be shared with all the
stakeholders involved in implementation and in monitoring of the NCCC and APCC, asking for feedback
and implementation of corrections/corrective actions, if the case. Evaluation reports or parts of the
evaluation reports are to be published on the MEWF website.
The process and allocation of responsibility among government agencies for M&E and reporting are
presented in Annex 1. Suggested indicators for Romania’s APCC are included in Annex 2.


                                                                                                       64
7. Concluding Remarks
The Romanian National Strategy on Climate Change and Low Carbon Green Growth and the CC Action
Plan (which are under developing) must aim to for practical yet effective M&E and Reporting activities,
building upon and improving the existing systems and current activities of the institutions involved that
provides valuable and accurate data to better report on the targets established and assess policy
effectiveness. An effective and efficient M&E and Reporting system is an essential component of any CC
Strategy and is especially important where policy-makers are still at an early stage in developing their
understanding of what exactly makes a good strategy for CC mitigation and adaptation.
In support of the LCGGP, the World Bank has prepared this report with the aim of helping the Romanian
Government to operationalize the strategic path chosen by the country for implementing its NSCC. After
reviewing the current CC-related obligations and M&E and reporting systems in Romania as well as
international best practices, authors identified and highlight opportunities to further strengthen the
institutional capacity and evaluation framework for CC-related M&E.
The Romanian government should build upon existing obligations for CC-related policies and measures to
develop a simple, affordable and cost-effective M&E and reporting system for M&E the NSCC and APCC
that evolves, expands and improves over time. To ensure a robust framework, the M&E and Reporting
system should clearly define goals, indicators, responsibilities and communication strategies. It should
facilitate continuous learning by policy-makers and other key stakeholders in order to underpin the long-
term development of the knowledge and understanding needed to better design, implement and deliver
future CC strategies and action plans for Romania.

The Public Policy Unit (PPU) of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests (MEFW) will be the main responsible institution for monitoring. This annex provides suggested indicators for monitoring the activities in the Action Plan
for Climate Change for Romania. It is organized into the following subsections:
     Macro level indicators, according to 525/2013/EU, also known as the Mechanism for Monitoring and Reporting (MMR) and from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) regarding national
        adaptation plans.
     Glossary of acronyms.
     Mitigation tables by objective for Energy, Transport, Industry, Agriculture and Rural Development, Urban Development, Waste Management, Water, Forestry.
     Adaptation tables by objective for Agriculture and Rural Development, Drinking Water and Water Resources, Human Environment (Infrastructure and Urban Planning), Transport, Industry, Energy, Tourism and Recreation,
        Forestry, Biodiversity, Public Health and Response Services in Emergency Situations, Public Education and Awareness Raising, Insurance as an Instrument to Adjust to Climate Change.


        Macro level indicators, according to from the MMR (525/2013/EU) and UNFCCC technical guidelines on adaptation

There are several existing indicators that can also serve as macro level indicators to monitor the implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy. The most suitable indicators may be those already reported by Romania under
the European Union (EU) and UNFCCC, as provided in Regulation 525/2013/EU on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and for reporting other information at national and Union level relevant to
climate change. The following indicators extracted from its Annex III, Table 1 are relevant:

        Total CO2 intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
        Energy-related CO2 intensity of GDP
        CO2 emissions from passenger cars
        Number of kilometres by passenger cars
        Energy-related CO2 intensity of industry
        Specific CO2 emissions of households
        CO2 intensity of the commercial and institutional sector
        Specific CO2 emissions of public and autoproducer power plants.

Pending the ability of the monitoring entity as well as the availability of information, the indicators presented in Tables 2 an 3 of the MMR may also be used.

Adaptation objectives can be monitored using indicators from: Table 5 of the National Adaptation Plans: Technical Guidelines for the National Adaptation Plan Process (UNFCCC LDC Expert Group, 2012, pp.47) available at:
https://unfccc.int/files/adaptation/cancun_adaptation_framework/application/pdf/naptechguidelines_eng_high__res.pdf
