World Bank Group Management Comments

Management welcomes the Learning Product of the Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG), Learning from IDA Experience: Lessons from IEG Evaluations. Management
appreciates the active and collaborative engagement with IEG during the
preparation of the report, which provides important inputs for the IDA18
Replenishment discussion. In response to the final Learning Product, management
wishes to make the following comments.


Coverage and Scope



This report presents a useful summary of relevant IEG evaluations in the recent past.
While it is not a comprehensive review of IDA’s performance or effectiveness, and
draws, for the most part, on projects and programs carried out before IDA16, many
of the observations made still warrant continued attention. Management appreciates
the report’s recognition of the follow-up actions taken and progress made in many
areas.

Because of the report’s coverage and time lag, some caution is needed in interpreting
the findings and applying the lessons for the future. For example, recent lessons
from climate change are based on a limited number of reports; many evaluations
cover both IDA and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
countries; and there are no recent evaluations for some key sectors (e.g., water). In
several cases conclusions seem to be drawn from a small number of projects—for
example, the lessons on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in fragile
and conflict-affected states (FCS) come from one project, and those on the Crisis
Response Window are based on two projects.

IDA Thematic Areas

The five thematic areas covered by the report—gender equality, climate change,
FCS, crisis response, and inclusive growth—are fully aligned with the World Bank
Group’s corporate goals and priorities, and have increasingly been at the forefront of
its attention. This institutional commitment and effort are reflected in, among other
things, the recent reorganization that elevated these cross-cutting areas,
development of a Bank Group-wide gender strategy, and greater emphasis on FCS
and crisis response in resource allocation decisions.



                                                                                   xiii
MANAGEMENT COMMENTS


Management fully agrees with the need for “strategic choice” at both the corporate
and country levels to determine the relative importance of these themes in each
context. The new country engagement framework—whose the Systematic Country
Diagnostic and Country Partnership Framework add increased rigor and a
systematic approach to the Bank Group’s country-led business model—is focused on
informing the client and the Bank Group in making such strategic decisions.


Managing for Results



The report notes that the World Bank Group has comprehensive self-evaluation
systems that “adhere to relevant good practice standards” and are “as good as or
better than those in comparable organizations,” but that the systems and incentives
are focused more on accountability than on performance management or learning.
While management agrees there is room for a more balanced approach, given the
inherent tension between the accountability and learning objectives, it may not be
feasible or realistic to expect one instrument to serve all objectives equally. For
instance, accountability is and will remain a critical function of the Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR). Learning, while it can be enhanced through
the ICRs, could also be accomplished with other activities, such as impact
evaluations and other voluntary reviews. Hence, in reforming the ICR approach,
management will explore options to maximize learning while maintaining the ICR’s
accountability function.

Management agrees with the report’s conclusion that the Bank Group’s current
results monitoring systems and incentives have room for improvement, and is
already taking steps with a view to deepening the results culture and using the self-
evaluation systems more strategically for knowledge and learning. Management has
been undertaking a number of activities, and plans to further intensify its effort, to
strengthen the focus of the institution on results in the following areas:

      (i) improved results measurement and reporting, with stronger links among
          project, country, and corporate levels (e.g., the ongoing Core Sector Indicator
          reform, the planned ICR reform, and updates of the Corporate Scorecards
          and IDA Results Measurement System indicators in line with the Sustainable
          Development Goals (SDGs))

      (ii) strengthened capacity in results measurement and monitoring and evaluation
           (M&E) (e.g., various activities through the Results Measurement and
           Evidence Stream, enhanced training in results and M&E); and

   (iii)     improved guidance and knowledge management for results and M&E
        (e.g., strengthened guidance, good practice notes, and knowledge-sharing
        tools and network).

Finally, as the report notes, the importance of country capacity and M&E systems
cannot be understated. More effort is needed to enhance them, especially with a
view to monitoring progress against the SDGs.

1. IDA and the Special Themes
At the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September 2015, world
leaders endorsed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), an ambitious agenda to
end poverty, promote prosperity, and protect the environment. The recent IEG
report for the Addis Ababa conference on financing for development underscores
the potential for a historic shift in the understanding of development (IEG 2015a).
Developing countries are taking a stronger stance in the trajectory of their own
development. The group of stakeholders is expanding to include a growing number
of countries that have become donors bilaterally or through multilateral
development banks. The private sector is increasingly involved as a key partner in
providing solutions and finance. The voice of citizens and civil society has been
more deeply integrated into the conversation.

As the world’s largest provider of financial resources to the poorest countries, the
International Development Association (IDA) was a cornerstone of the global effort
to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It will continue to play a
key role for attaining the SDGs by 2030. The 18th IDA Replenishment (IDA18) will
be negotiated in the context of significant changes in the direction of international
development and of an evolving World Bank Group. Meanwhile, change is in the
air within IDA itself: its non-concessional borrowing policy is being reviewed and
updated, and options for broader IDA reform are under consideration by the Board,
with the Development Committee agreeing to take a medium- to long-term view of
the future of the Bank Group and its role in the international financial architecture
(World Bank Group 2015).

Within this changed and changing context of development goals, emphasis, modus
operandi, and resource implications, the Bank Group, and IDA in particular, will be
under increasing pressure to deliver results. Numerous IEG evaluations address
issues that are relevant to IDA’s development impact. Although most of these
evaluations transcend the IDA16 and IDA17 effectiveness periods and are not
targeted at IDA specifically, they contain relevant information on what has and has
not worked when the IDA special themes were addressed. In line with the
commitment to learning from the past, this synthesis report presents findings from
recent IEG country program, thematic, and project evaluations, learning products,
and relevant follow-up information from the Management Action Record (MAR), to
help inform the discussions for IDA18.



                                                                                    1
CHAPTER 1
IDA AND THE SPECIAL THEMES
Through a desk review without engaging in new research, this report brings
together insights from recent IEG evaluations relevant for IDA and IDA countries. It
is not an evaluation of IDA performance, its progress in relation to the
replenishment commitments, or its effectiveness in addressing the special thematic
issues. Instead, it aims to offer evaluation evidence, based on past Bank Group
experience, on what has worked for delivering results in IDA priority areas. Recent
Bank Group initiatives are noted, but not elaborated on because their effectiveness
has yet to be evaluated. As the focus of the report is on IDA, interventions by
International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA) are not discussed independently, but only in the context of their
interactions with IDA.


IDA Commitments and Resource Mobilization
Like other international financial institutions (IFIs), IDA replenishment
commitments fall under four main categories: institutional effectiveness; financial
management or financial instruments; operational reforms to strengthen policies,
strategies, or portfolio performance; and results management, including monitoring
and evaluation. Comparing the number and composition of these commitments,
there is a convergence among the IFIs in the total number of commitments in the last
replenishment cycle (i.e., around 50), and IDA stands out for being able to pay more
attention to operational commitments than most comparators. This focus has
increased even further in IDA17 (figure 1.1). The operational commitments at IDA
and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) were related to
implementation of the strategic priorities, while at the African Development Fund
(AfDF) many of the operational commitments related to preparation of new policies
and strategies. IDA has been effective in designing its commitment matrix in a
manner that furthers its strategic and operational objectives.

The replenishment volume for IDA17 increased by 5.5 percent from IDA16 (table
1.1). While total donor contributions decreased marginally by 1.7 percent, given the
size of IDA resources, they are still more than twice as large as the other three IFIs
together. Moreover, donor countries contributed 50 percent of the IDA17
replenishment, which is a much larger share than donor contributions to the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) and IFAD. Among the IFIs, only AfDF 13 received a
larger share from donor countries. The larger share of ADF’s resources is now
coming from reflows. This has encouraged the Asian Development Bank to rethink
how it mobilizes and leverages its ADF resources, resulting in a merger of the
balance sheets of ADF with its ordinary capital resources in order to increase the
volume of concessional funding it will be able to provide to its low-income recipient
member countries on a sustained basis.

IDA Special Themes
IDA first introduced special themes in 2005 with IDA14 to “reinforce the
effectiveness of IDA assistance in ensuring lasting reduction in poverty and making
progress toward the MDGs” (World Bank 2005). The recommendations of the IDA14
report centered on private sector led growth, debt sustainability and grants, results
measurement, and working together at country level. During the IDA15 discussions,
it was realized that despite some progress, many MDGs were likely not to be met in
South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. In this context, IDA15 focused on the agency’s
role in the global aid architecture to achieve results at the country level (IDA 2008).
Within the special themes of global aid architecture, country-level effectiveness, and
fragile states, IDA defined its support for climate change actions, debt management,
gender outcomes, results measurement, and harmonization and alignment.

The IDA16 discussions took place in the aftermath of the global food, fuel, and
economic crises. As IDA countries faced new and growing challenges, delivering
development results became an overarching theme for IDA16, with crisis response,
gender, climate change, and fragile and conflict-affected states (FCS) included as
special themes (IDA 2011). IDA’s Results Measurement System (RMS) would be
expanded to track IDA’s operational and organizational effectiveness. IDA17
maintained the strong focus on results of the previous IDA replenishment periods as
well as the special themes of gender equality, climate change, and FCS (IDA 2014).
More attention was paid to IDA’s results delivering and monitoring mechanism, and
inclusive growth was added as a fourth special theme “given its centrality for
achieving the World Bank Group goals.”

Although the various special themes evolved in response to the pressing issues over
time, there has been high continuity in IDA’s overarching goal of achieving

development impact through a strong focus on results measurement and
partnership as well as special attention to gender equality, climate change, FCS, and
broadly shared economic growth. These areas are consistent with the Bank Group’s
twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, and with the
SDGs. As such, they will continue to be important for IDA going forward.


Bank Group Support in IDA Special Thematic Areas
The Bank Group has incorporated the IDA special themes into its country strategies
to a varying extent (table 1.2). For example, nearly 90 percent of the 64 Bank Group
country strategies1 approved for IDA countries in FY12–15 have some discussion of
gender issues in the country context, and half of them provide detailed analysis
either in a dedicated section of the main strategy document or in an annex. Analysis
of specific gender challenges in the country is less common. Almost all of the
strategies reflect gender on a cross-cutting basis in stated objectives and contain
indicators to measure progress.

For climate change and inclusive growth themes, although over 80 percent of the
strategies define objectives or outcomes in these areas, they are not always guided
by an analysis of the issues and the specific challenges in the country, nor followed
up with measurable indicators to track Bank Group performance. This lack of
follow-up is a recurring finding from IEG country and thematic evaluations that is
discussed in Chapter 2. Box 1.1 offers an example of how the special theme of
climate change is addressed systematically in an IDA country program.

IDA AND THE SPECIAL THEMES

    Box 1.1. Treatment of Climate Change in Mozambique Country Partnership Strategy FY12–15

    The Mozambique FY12–15 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) takes as its starting point
    the government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy, the overarching theme of which is inclusive
    and broad-based growth. It has three pillars: (i) competitiveness and employment; (ii)
    vulnerability and resilience; and (iii) governance and public sector capacity.
    An analysis of climate change and natural disaster is provided under the Country Context
    and Development Agenda section of the CPS that draws on earlier economic and sector
    work (World Bank 2010). The analysis notes that Mozambique ranks third among African
    countries most exposed to risks from extreme weather events in the form of floods,
    cyclones, and droughts. In regional projections, climate change is expected to increase the
    frequency and magnitude of weather events.
    Under Pillar II of the CPS, climate change mitigation and adaptation activities are
    introduced as an important new business line. Broader environmental concerns are also
    evident across the other pillars: agriculture, water, and energy under Pillar I and
    promoting of greater contribution of wildlife conservation to the economy under Pillar III.
    IDA support will be rooted in a programmatic Development Financing Policy (DPF) series
    to support policy reforms for mainstreaming climate change throughout the policy-
    making process and a coordinated approach to planning. The DPFs are intended to
    complement the portfolio of investment projects co-financed by the Pilot Program for
    Climate Resilience, a newly established Climate Investment Fund. By FY15, operational
    follow through includes nine projects totaling $292 million that have a particular, explicit
    emphasis on climate change.
    IFC will implement private sector components under Building Africa’s Resilience to
    Climate Change, a pre-pipeline advisory services program that will channel $10 million in
    funding to catalyze private sector investments to enhance climate resilience across all
    economic sectors with a focus on agriculture and forestry. The IFC Mozambique Forestry
    program will provide advisory services to develop sustainable private forestry
    investments and to take advantage of potential carbon offsets.
    The results matrix defines two outcome indicators under Pillar II: (i) adaptation to climate
    change and reduced the risk of natural disasters; and (ii) accurate weather information
    system available to stakeholders in 70 percent of Central and Southern regions on at least
    a 12-hour basis (from 0 percent in 2010 to 70 percent in 2015). It also defines four related
    milestones for measuring project outputs.

With regard to FCS, what is most surprising is that about 20 percent of Bank Group
strategies in FCS countries (FY12-15) reviewed for this exercise, did not have any
kind of analysis of fragility, violence, or conflict to frame the ensuing strategic
objectives and support programs. Although more than half of the strategies have
specific conflict-related objectives or actions, the expected outcomes are not
identified for close monitoring in the results matrix. Out of 26 country strategies for

Portfolio Performance in IDA Countries
The 2014 and 2015 reports on Results and Performance of the World Bank Group (IEG
2015b and IEG 2016) note an improvement in the performance of Bank Group
country programs in IDA for both FCS and non-FCS countries. As measured by
outcome achievement, the performance of IDA lending projects in IDA is catching
up with those supported by the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) (see figure 1.2) (IEG 2016). Nevertheless, IDA country program
performance remains below that of IBRD (by over 25 percentage points) and
portfolio performance in IDA FCS is on a downward trend after an earlier
improvement.

Projects in IDA countries are different from IBRD projects in many respects. They
are typically smaller, less likely to involve development policy lending, less likely to
be programmatic, more likely to operate in a volatile environment such as a crisis or
disaster, and more likely to be implemented where there is less local capacity (table
1.3). Empirical analysis carried out for RAP 2013 looked at entry risks and outcome
achievement in Bank projects (IEG 2014). It found that less risky projects tended to
have better outcomes, but 46 percent of the sampled investment projects had
substantial or high entry risks. This was driven by IDA countries, especially FCS,
where entry risks averaged 69 percent (versus 43 percent for IBRD-only countries).
In choosing to fund more projects in IDA than in IBRD countries, the Bank may be
less risk averse than often perceived. This finding suggests it is important that the

RAP 2014 undertook an in-depth analysis of the continuous decline in quality at
entry (a key correlate of overall performance) and quality of supervision (IEG
2015b). It finds that well-designed projects tend to draw on past lessons at entry,
have effective risk mitigation measures, and adopt appropriate objectives and
Results Frameworks. During project implementation, the propensity to solve
problems, facilitated by regular missions, determines the supervision quality of
Bank projects. These findings suggest that the success of Bank projects depends
critically on factors within Bank management control. RAP 2014 also echoes the
findings of earlier reports in the series regarding the perennially poor ratings for
monitoring and evaluation: 30 percent and 29 percent rated substantial for FY08–10
and FY11–13, respectively.2

Focusing on the typically better performance of larger operations than smaller
projects, RAP 2015 found that mid-course corrections matter more than project size
(IEG 2016). That is, project performance has more to do with what happens during
the course of project implementation—such as addition or cancellation of funds—
than with the initial size of the project. Therefore, although project size and
development outcome ratings are correlated, better performance associated with
large projects may reflect the practice of directing additional resources to projects
that are performing well during implementation (and discontinuing those that are
not).3 This is consistent with the findings of a recent IEG report on additional
financing (AF) (IEG 2015a), which finds that projects with AF had relatively better
overall outcome ratings compared with the rest of the portfolio.4 Lower project
outcome ratings were associated with turnover of the task team leader, regardless of

higher Country Policy and Institutional Assessment ratings (a measure of institutional

2. Evaluation Findings in IDA Thematic Areas
Many IEG evaluations offer lessons that are relevant to one or more IDA special
themes. While all the country program evaluations (CPEs) and the Project
Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs) selected for this synthesis report target
IDA countries,1 IEG’s thematic evaluations do not always distinguish between IDA
and IBRD specific issues. Nevertheless, it is important to note that strategies and
operations in IDA and FCS countries are often subject to the same factors that
impact the success of those in IBRD countries. More generic issues are at play across
the portfolio around how the Bank Group does business that need to be taken into
account as well as factors that fall more sharply into focus in the context of IDA and
the special themes. Moreover, because IDA countries, especially FCS, often have
weaker institutions than their IBRD counterparts, the issues tend to be accentuated.

To the extent that evaluations are designed to be ex-poste assessment of completed
programs and projects, findings from recent IEG evaluations are based on Bank
Group experience prior to IDA 16 and 17 for the most part. Some of the challenges
identified in these evaluations may have been, or are being, addressed by the Bank
Group in one form or another. This synthesis report notes many of the new
initiatives, but overall, is not in a position to comment on their effectiveness. As
development is a long-term endeavor, the lessons distilled from IEG evaluations
remain valid and deserve continuous attention. Finally, although this synthesis
report is based on a comprehensive review of all recent IEG evaluations relevant to
IDA, it is not a comprehensive review of the IDA special themes. The evidence gaps
point to where Bank Group and IEG attention is need in the coming years.


Inclusive Growth
IDA17 introduced the special theme of inclusive growth in support of the Bank
Group’s twin goals. Focusing on building the knowledge base and tools for
understanding country specific constraints to inclusive growth, IDA committed to
devote special attention to job creation, financial inclusion, public financial
management, and natural resource management as a way to promote inclusive
growth. Since then, efforts have concentrated on making the theme central to
country strategies and filling knowledge gaps. Some important aspects of inclusive
growth, such as gender, are dealt with separately.

Over the last decade, IEG evaluations have paid increasing attention to the issues of
inclusive growth and poverty reduction. They offer lessons on three types of


                                                                                    11
CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
interventions that aim to (i) enhance youth employment; (ii) promote financial
inclusion and provide targeted support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs);
and (iii) develop agriculture and natural resource sectors. These topics are taken up
in several IEG thematic evaluations and all of the CPEs to some extent. The overall
results are mixed with some moderate success but mostly hard earned and valuable
lessons. This conclusion is not unexpected given the challenges presented by many
IDA countries that have achieved limited progress toward poverty reduction despite
solid growth.

IEG’s evaluation of the poverty focus of country programs calls for greater attention
to the mix between indirect poverty interventions (inclusive growth) and direct
poverty interventions (basic services and social safety nets) (IEG 2015a). It also
highlights the need to comprehensively address poverty data development and
reporting in the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and country policy dialogue.
To this end, the evaluation suggests that the Bank should advocate and support
sustainable improvement of the capability of national statistical agencies, take a
stronger lead in strengthening mechanisms for quality and transparency of poverty
data, motivate country compliance, and regularly disseminate data. The Bank
should also ensure that its poverty diagnostic work incorporates relevant social and
political dimensions of poverty analysis and offer actionable priorities for policy
interventions. Finally, explicit evaluation protocols for piloted interventions are
needed to capture lessons for future scaling-up and to ensure evaluability at project
inception.

ENHANCE YOUTH EMPLOYMENT
IEG’s evaluation of youth employment programs found that “although youth
employment is addressed in the education, social protection, and labor strategies, it
is not recognized as an issue in most country strategies, even where youth
unemployment is serious” (IEG 2013). This finding is confirmed by the limited
attention paid to the issue in Bank Group country programs. Among the eleven
CPEs reviewed, only in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Liberia, and Timor-Leste did youth
employment receive any attention, and with the exception of Liberia, none reported
promising results (box 2.1). A comprehensive approach was missing in the Bank’s
youth employment programs—most projects included isolated interventions, and
collaboration across sector teams is limited.

                                                     EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS

 Box 2.1. Youth Employment Interventions in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Liberia, and Timor-Leste

 In Liberia, the Bank Group supported basic education under the Education for All
 Initiative and assisted vocational and technical education through the Youth Employment
 and Skills Project. The Human Development, Sustainable Development, and Private
 Sector Development teams collaborated on several studies to inform the government’s
 youth empowerment and employment strategy. This was followed up with a technical
 assistance project in FY13 to assist the government in designing concrete interventions in
 these areas. These activities helped to expand employment to absorb the unemployed or
 under-employed youth, who include a large number of ex-combatants, which in turn
 helped Liberia manage social tensions, conflict, and political instability.
 In Bolivia, the Bank had a clearly articulate strategy to increase the percentage of low-
 income youth in urban and peri-urban areas with regular employment and improved
 labor incomes, but the interventions did not lead to expected results for several reasons.
 The Bank carried out a series of activities that included a poverty and vulnerability
 analysis, Social Safety programs to assess the roles of subnational agencies, a mapping of
 existing programs, and technical assistance to national and local governments to help
 implement the Social Protection strategy, and a Youth Employment Program for Urban
 Areas. However, as the government continued to change and interest in supporting local
 governments waned, the Bank’s potential for impact declined as well. Although these
 analytic and advisory activities and technical assistance efforts evolved into financial
 support for the Investing in Children and Youth Project, the impact was not realized.
 Such concerted efforts were less evident in other IDA countries. In Afghanistan, the Skills
 Development Project was the main intervention for addressing employment issues. While
 the project was analytically sound and responded to concerns of youth unemployment,
 reduced employment prospects for Afghan citizens, and re-enrollment of children in
 school, it suffered from the challenges of coordinating across 11 ministries and
 implementation problems from staff turnover and shortcomings in government
 leadership.
 Similarly in Timor-Leste, although Bank Group goals included temporary employment
 creation, particularly in rural areas, and engagement of alienated youth in productive
 community-based activities. Except for planned economic and sector work on youth, the
 country assistance strategy included no projects to address specific concerns of youth or
 flaws in education. Instead, youth issues were to be mainstreamed in all of the Bank
 Group‘s other activities planned over the period, which meant, in effect, little was done.
 Source: IEG (2011b, 2012b; 2013a; 2015a).



At the project level, the evaluation found the Bank’s lending portfolio for youth
employment to be relatively small and include mainly skills development and
school-to-work transition projects.2 Some operations included interventions to foster
job creation and work opportunities for youth. Few youth employment projects
were implemented by multisectoral teams even though youth employment is a
multisectoral issue. The limited experience in this area means evidence on what


                                                                                              13
CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
works in youth employment is scarce. The Bank’s few impact evaluations on youth
employment examined short-term effects, found limited positive results, and did not
calculate the cost-effectiveness of interventions. This calls for strong diagnostics to
inform policy and program design for youth. More recent analytical work, such as
that by Christopher Blattman and Laura Ralston to evaluate a number of programs
on youth unemployment in fragile states,3 provides a base to bridge the knowledge
gap.

The evaluation identified several factors that contribute to success, including a
comprehensive approach with participation of the private sector, complementary
interventions (e.g., combined training with job search and placement assistance,
rather than isolated interventions), and monitoring and follow-up of individual
participants. Programs that combine smoothing the transition from school to work
with work-based skills development were found to be most effective for youth
employment and earnings, although the applicability of this model to developing
countries with a large informal sector and rural areas is limited. In high-
unemployment environments, wage subsidies, skills training, and job search
support are of little impact; and demand-side interventions are needed. For
example, in rural low-income areas, where most youth are active in agriculture and
nonfarm employment or self-employment in the informal sector, stimulating the
market for the growth of farms, nonfarm household enterprises, and rural
agribusinesses is essential. The Bank and IFC could further support the expansion of
rural and urban jobs in these sectors.

The paucity of data limits the ability to assess the impact of Bank Group support to
youth employment. Few projects included tracer studies to track the subsequent
employment history of youth or provided information on youth as a beneficiary
group. Hence there was a critical need to support government to collect labor
market outcome data for youth in relevant surveys, monitor the employment
situation by age groups, and use the relevant statistics to inform country strategies.

PROMOTE FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND TARGETED SUPPORT FOR SMES
These two themes are intricately related. A significant portion of Bank Group
interventions to support SMEs has focused on improving their access to finance, and
this is usually done in tandem with financing through microcredits or providing
microfinance.

IEG’s evaluation on financial inclusion finds that the Bank Group “contributed
significantly to progress in financial inclusion globally and in client countries” (IEG
2015b). In particular, the Bank Group reached a substantial share of the microfinance
industry and contributed to the sustainability of microfinance services. Moreover,

                                                                                    CHAPTER 2
                                                     EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
Bank Group resources devoted to advancing financial inclusion were not only well
aligned with countries’ needs, targeting countries with low inclusion rates, but also
reflected patterns of over-indebtedness, providing advisory and knowledge work
rather than with funding to markets at risk of over-indebtedness.

However, the link between access and usage is not automatic, and that between
finance and poverty reduction is neither certain nor well understood. To ensure that
improved financial access translate into financial inclusion and poverty alleviation,
the Bank Group needs to clarify its approach on financial inclusion by making it
more evidence based and comprehensive, focusing on financial services with
benefits for the poor and specifying when and how to use subsidies. Critical to its
work is how the Bank Group systematically finds and replicates innovative delivery
models that lower transaction costs and improve financial inclusion. An
appropriate, holistic, and systematic diagnostic tool4 is important, as are country-
level strategies for financial inclusion to guide its work. As it experiments with new
ways to achieve the envisaged universal access goal, it is of particular importance to
have in place a well-established M&E system that takes account of Results
Frameworks established in country financial inclusion strategies and follows a
practical and cost-effective approach to improving measures of beneficiary impact.
Finally, this very recent evaluation finds that the Bank Group needs to strengthen
partnerships by advocating clear strategies, Results Frameworks, and M&E
arrangements.

Nine of the eleven CPEs reviewed discuss financing or other types of support for
SMEs. Some of the objectives pursued in this regard were limited to studies to
understand the problem; in other cases specific lending programs were provided.
The results were mixed with over half of the CPEs reporting some degree of
unsatisfactory performance (box 2.2). IFC has played a leading role in these areas.

 Box 2.2. Microfinance in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bolivia, and Liberia

 In Afghanistan, the Bank Group’s interventions in the microfinance sector completely
 transformed the sector. Its early activities supported the microfinance industry and
 improved knowledge of the financial sector. The Bank Group took a two-pronged
 approach: the Bank provided lending and non-lending technical assistance to transform
 the local microfinance institutions and help them achieve operating self-sufficiency; IFC
 invested in a commercial bank that specializes in micro lending which provided an
 additional mechanism for mobilizing funds and delivering microfinance services. The
 Bank also invested in the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan to
 create an apex organization that finances and monitors microfinance institutions in
 Afghanistan, while IFC also provided advisory services for developing the sector by
 helping establish the First Microfinance Bank of Afghanistan (FMBA) with an initial

CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
 investment of $1 million. The FMBA is now the leading microfinance bank in the country
 and highly regarded in the banking sector through its continued and improving financial
 performance.
 Such a two-pronged approach was also adopted in Bangladesh, where efforts by the Bank
 to extend the country’s “unique and pioneering microcredit system to the poorest" was
 supported by two projects, including the Learning and Innovation Loan—Financial
 Services for the Poorest. The Bank’s effort was hailed as innovative and very successful,
 and efforts to scale up the model were underway. Meanwhile, IFC worked with
 commercial banks to increase their lending to SMEs, although direct attribution to IFC
 activities is difficult.
 Bolivia has a vibrant and mature microfinance market, but a relatively small number of
 SMEs and rural producers have access to it. The Bank and IFC used several tools to help
 expand financial access to that market. The Bank conducted two studies to explore ways
 to provide collateral and a financial sector review to provide input to the government’s
 reforms. IFC explored various forms of intervention to expand SME and rural finance.
 However, most of these efforts had no follow-up because the government was not
 interested, the clients did not need IFC resources, or insurmountable regulatory obstacles
 existed.
 In Liberia, the Bank Group focused on microfinance to support financial sector
 development. An IFC Advisory Service project conducted a pre-feasibility study on
 microfinance and recommended revisions to the banking law and related regulations.
 This led to IFC investing in a new microfinance bank, the Access Bank Liberia, and
 providing technical assistance that enabled the bank to develop good practices in
 microfinance. IFC's work addressed the lack of access among a large segment of private
 businesses, and the process introduced innovations in the microfinance market by using a
 private commercial bank as the funding and delivery mechanism.
 Source: IEG (2009b, 2012b; 2013a, 2015a).



Overall, these evaluations highlight the importance of having in place a managerial,
accounting, and financial capacity in the countries where the Bank Group wants to
support SMEs and microfinance. They point to the fallacy of overestimating demand
for credit given the high transaction costs of borrowing through Bank Group
supported financial intermediaries. Having a coherent strategy and complementary
interventions by different Bank Group institutions enhances the delivery of results.
On the other hand, poor understanding of the political and market conditions
threatens the Bank Group’s efforts to promote financial inclusion.

With regard to targeted support for SMEs, IEG’s evaluation finds that how SMEs are
defined establishes their relevance to the Bank Group’s twin goals, but the literature
offers little guidance on the actual efficacy of the most common forms of targeted
SME support, either for direct beneficiaries or, more broadly, for markets and
economies, much less the appropriate sequencing and complementarities of

interventions (IEG 2014a). For SMEs to be a meaningful category of enterprises, they
should be differentiated from others by the way they experience particular policy,
institutional, or market failures, or the way they benefit the economy and the poor.
Targeted support for SMEs needs to be firmly rooted in a clear, evidence-based
understanding of how the proposed support will sustainably remove the problems
that constrain SMEs’ ability to contribute to employment, growth, and economic
opportunity.

As revealed by the evaluation, the World Bank lacked an institutional definition of
SMEs,5 leading to project-specific definitions that lacked solid links to the
underlying rationale for assistance. The commitment level of the World Bank SME
lending portfolio was low in IDA countries compared to upper-middle-income
countries, which raises questions of its relevance for reaching the frontier and
building markets and market institutions where they are weakest. In addition, the
lack of institutional consensus on a range of questions (e.g., what constitutes an
SME? when it is appropriate to support them? what forms it will take? how it relates
to systemic reform? what constitutes success? and how it will be monitored and
evaluated?) have resulted in missed opportunities. The CPEs reviewed provide very
few examples of successful targeted support for SMEs (box 2.3). The Bank Group is
taking actions to address some of these issues. For example, IFC and the Jobs Group
are developing tools for including jobs data in the administrative data collected by
banks.


 Box 2.3. Targeted Support for SMEs in Bolivia, Mongolia, Mozambique, and Zambia
 In Bolivia, there was no well-articulated Bank Group strategy for private sector
 development in general, partly because of a strenuous relationship between the Bank
 Group and the government. Although IFC rightly focused on SMEs and explored various
 ways to support local businesses and income generation opportunities for indigenous
 communities, most of the interventions never went beyond the pilot stage with little
 broader impact.

 In Mongolia, Bank support increased the amounts of term lending available to SMEs, but
 the mismatch between the SMEs’ need for long-term assets and their access to only short-
 term loans was not solved. IFC’s investments contributed to improving access to finance,
 especially for micro, small, and medium enterprises. This included a trade financing
 facility in the cooperating banks, although the facilities were reportedly underused due to
 scant demand since IFC’s funds were more expensive to use. In addition, Bank lending
 and analytic work appeared to have been operating independently of each other rather
 than developing synergies, yielding poor overall results.




                                                                                           17
CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
 In Mozambique, the Bank program successfully provided some business extension
 services to SMEs and some technical assistance to strengthen a couple of government
 agencies, but its line of credit faltered and had to be altered to allow larger firms to
 borrow. IFC’s direct support to SMEs was unsuccessful in most cases because of the small
 firms’ lack of management, accounting and financial capacity and know-how. As a result,
 only a limited number of SMEs were supported, mainly through Advisory Services, thus
 failing to achieve the goal of developing capacity among a large group of local SMEs.

 In Zambia, Bank Group efforts to promote SMEs were largely unsuccessful. They
 continued to focus on lines of credit that were not in demand because they did not
 address the underlying issues of creditworthiness and collateral. High yield on
 government bonds and imposition of interest rate caps also restrained lending to SMEs.
 IFC extended support for local SMEs to improve their operations to meet the procurement
 requirements of multinational companies, building on its successful pilot in Konkola
 Copper Mines. Training was provided to 170 SMEs, but only one out of five participating
 multinational companies replaced imports of goods with local products supplied from
 SMEs.

 Source: IEG (2011a, 2015a,c, d).



There is one relevant PPAR that assesses the performance of the Enterprise
Development Project in Mozambique (IEG 2014a). It finds that in post conflict
countries with weak institutions and serious capacity constraints, a programmatic
approach rather than a single project with multiple components could have
provided opportunities to learn from each phase as inputs to designing the next.
Moreover, matching grant programs for business services can potentially be an
effective way of providing incentives to firms, although such programs have to be
well managed to be successful. On the other hand, credit line operations that are
designed solely to increase the supply of funds do not increase sustainable access to
finance if other institutional, legal, and regulatory constraints to financial sector
development are not addressed.

DEVELOP AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCE SECTORS FOR POVERTY REDUCTION
IEG’s agriculture and agribusiness evaluation notes that, following a strategic shift
in the 1990s in its approach to agricultural development, many Bank-supported
rural projects adopted community-driven development (CDD) models in which
agricultural production was one of many priorities (IEG 2011b). This trend was
particularly pronounced in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where the share of rural
projects focusing explicitly on improving agricultural growth and productivity was
the lowest. IFC had relatively little engagement in agribusiness in SSA because of
difficult business environments, a shortage of indigenous entrepreneurs, small size
of the potential investments, lack of access to markets, and the discouraging

experience of working directly with small-scale sponsors. Inconsistent client
commitment and weak capacity limited the effectiveness of Bank Group support in
agriculture-based economies, while constraints on staffing (e.g., decline in
agriculture-related skills and analytic work, especially in some of the poorer IDA
countries) and limited internal coordination within the Bank Group were also found
to have hurt outcomes. Financial sustainability was further constrained by
insufficient government funding and the difficulty of maintaining agricultural
services and infrastructure.

To meet the worldwide demand for food and reduce poverty, particularly in the
poorest developing countries, the evaluation suggests greater effort is needed to
connect sectoral interventions (e.g., among transport, finance, and agriculture) and
achieve synergies from public and private sector interventions; to build capacity and
knowledge exchange; to take stock of experience in rain-fed agriculture; to ensure
attention to financial sustainability and cross-cutting issues of gender,
environmental, and social impacts and climate; and to better integrate Bank Group
support at the global and regional levels with that at the country level.

Management agreed with IEG recommendations, noting that several recommended
actions had been initiated after the IEG evaluation period. The MAR indicates that
the recent Bank Group reorganization has the potential to improve collaboration on
agribusiness across relevant departments and institutions as well as the movement
of technical staff to ensure better matching of technical specialists with demand. IFC
reports increasing investment in SSA through a more coordinated approach with
Financial Markets, Infrastructure, and Bank activities. In addition, expenditure on
analytical work in agriculture-based countries has increased, an Action Plan was
prepared in FY15 to improve quality of knowledge activities, and progress in South–
South knowledge exchange continues. On the other hand, it is not clear how the
newly instituted M&E review mechanism differs from the review mechanisms in
place prior to the reorganization for improving the M&E framework in agriculture
interventions.

Inclusive growth is one of three interrelated focus areas for IEG’s evaluation of
resource-rich developing countries (RRDCs) (IEG 2015e). Drawing from four CPEs
(Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Zambia), the evaluation finds that the
implications of resource revenues for poverty reduction and social development are
not qualitatively different in RRDCs from those in other developing countries but
often manifest themselves with particular intensity. In this context, the evaluation
suggests Bank Group programs should pay special attention to: (i) a consistent
poverty focus, especially in the upward swing of the resource cycle when RRDC
governments can become complacent about whether the benefits of growth are


                                                                                      19
CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
reaching the poor; (ii) fiscally sustainable and well-targeted social transfers because
RRDC governments are often under pressure to support cash transfers that are
poorly designed and do not meet their objectives; (iii) improved quality in education
and skills development to ensure that the investment in human development will
have a significant impact on productivity, competitiveness, and poverty reduction;
(iv) engagement with the rural poor to avoid the development of a dual economy
where a relatively prosperous urban economy coexists with a rural sector that is
stagnant, and where poverty is concentrated; and (v) a special focus on the
environmental implications of extractive industries through effective regulations
and monitoring.

Addressing a key constraint to growth and poverty reduction, IEG’s evaluation on
electricity access finds that given the scale of the challenge and associated targets to
which the Bank Group is committed (through the Sustainable Electricity for All
initiative and the SDGs), it should move from a predominantly project-by-project
approach—which lacks the scale and speed to achieve universal access by 2030 in
low-access countries—to a far greater use of a sector-wide organizing framework
and process for mainstreaming the sustained engagement needed for implementing
rapid access scale-up (World Bank 2015). The new strategic framework and country
plans, and the Bank Group’s operational engagement going forward should be
informed by the core principles and strategic drivers underlying best practice
programs, which are systematic implementation of national electricity access,
enabling sector policies and regulation, commercial viability of service providers,
affordability of connections costs for the poor, and overarching government
commitment and leadership.

In practice, the Bank Group has often targeted agriculture and rural development
for poverty reduction in its country programs (box 2.4). These examples show that
support for rural activities and agriculture and provision of affordable credit are the
most direct way to enable improvements in the income of the poor. To ensure that
positive outcomes are associated with poverty reduction programs, country
strategies should address governance and, in some cases, budget leakages and
corruption. Finally, all poverty reduction strategies and programs must specifically
include monitoring of poverty reduction impacts.

 Box 2.4. Poverty Reduction Interventions in Bank Group Country Programs in Afghanistan,
 Bolivia, Cambodia, Liberia, and Uganda
 In Afghanistan, the primary drivers of the rural economy are the massive donor
 expenditures, which provide significant short-term employment for many rural people,
 and the illicit opium industry that provides substantial cash income to small farmers.

                                                    EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
 While rural poverty reduction suggests a positive effect on livelihoods, results are uneven,
 reflecting varying support levels across provinces.
 In Bolivia, the Rural Alliances Project was the anchor of World Bank assistance for
 agriculture and rural development. In designing the program, the Bank listened to
 government officials and drew from its experience with what farmers needed to succeed.
 By targeting poor farmers with productive potential instead of the poorest farmers
 without such potential, the Bank was able to separate social assistance programs from
 income-enhancing programs, thereby showing how effective the latter can be in reducing
 poverty and improving living standards in a sustained manner, even in traditional
 agriculture.
 In Cambodia, agriculture is the most important sector for sustaining economic growth
 and alleviating poverty, but budgetary expenditure on agriculture and rural development
 was low. Hence additional budgetary support by the Bank could have enhanced resources
 for these sectors, while sustained macroeconomic stability and economic growth are
 prerequisites for reducing poverty.
 In Liberia, the Bank’s interventions in the forest sector did not adequately take into
 account the intended beneficiaries’ needs and capacity, including their ability to make a
 deal and monitor the actions of logging companies. As a result, little gains accrued to
 them. A new strategic framework for growth is needed and its pro-poor focus could be
 enhanced by integrating the role of indigenous communities and civil society in the
 design of interventions.
 In Uganda, IDA’s economic and sector work helped the government put poverty
 reduction and social development at the center of the country strategy. By documenting
 service performance and expenditure leakages, IDA helped the government, civil society,
 and its own team recognize the importance of service delivery and governance for
 poverty reduction. Besides two programs with explicit poverty reduction objectives, an
 agricultural sector adjustment credit proved to be a potent poverty eradication instrument
 because the associated coffee and cotton marketing reforms raised the incomes of poor
 farmers. Nevertheless, much higher or more broadly based growth is required for a more
 rapid decline in poverty.

Gender Equality
Over the past few years, the Bank Group has made steady progress in moving the
gender agenda forward. Concrete actions include the creation of the Gender Labs,
the production of an increasing number of impact evaluations, the preparation and
implementation of Regional Gender Action Plans, and the development of a new
World Bank Group Gender Strategy. These efforts have brought greater focus on
gender issues at various levels; however, the results of that increased attention are
not yet evident.



                                                                                             21
CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
RAP 2015 provides a detailed analysis of the system currently in place for promoting
gender integration into Bank Group strategies and operations (IEG 2016). It finds
that the Bank has implemented several recommendations from the 2010 IEG gender
evaluation (IEG 2010a),6 including the institutionalization of gender reporting
systems (e.g., a gender flag at project design); intensified efforts to produce gender-
disaggregated data and impact evaluation evidence; and progress in strengthening
results and accountability mechanisms (e.g., gender tracked in IDA Results
Frameworks and Corporate Scorecard). Nevertheless, the increased attention to
gender issues at corporate level has not necessarily translated into more coherent,
outcomes-focused gender integration in practice, and poor measurement persists.

GENDER IN IDA COUNTRY STRATEGIES
IDA country strategies have a greater level of gender integration than those for
IBRD countries. Among the country strategies completed in FY12–14, 40 percent
reflected gender in an objective or a pillar; of the 559 strategic objectives pursued in
these country strategies, five directly focused on gender (rather than on a cross-
cutting basis) and all five instances are associated with an IDA country. Recent IEG
CPEs for IDA countries confirm a high level of attention to gender issues in Bank
Group country strategies: nine out of eleven IDA CPEs note that gender equality
was addressed in some way. Such attention in IDA country strategies coincides
with, or reflects, the fact that almost all these strategies were developed in the
context of the MDGs, which called for improvements in this area (e.g., increasing
schooling of girls or electing women to parliament). Also, since 2000, the Bank's
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) began to capture gender
equality as a factor for allocating resources across IDA countries.

Nevertheless, the Bank has found it difficult to mainstream gender interventions in
general. In some cases, Bank interventions achieved positive results. In others, the
efforts produced mixed outcomes, or the recognition of gender issues in the country
strategies was not followed up with adequate support programs (box 2.5).

 Box 2.5. Gender Interventions in Nepal, Bolivia, and Zambia

 In Nepal, IDA support focused more on economic than social inclusion, but contributed
 substantially to bringing social inclusion issues to the center of the development strategy.
 It accomplished this by raising awareness and understanding of the issues, and by
 supporting critical measures such as equal access to education, civil service diversity and
 Poverty Alleviation Fund targeting based on gender, caste, and ethnicity. Progress on
 access and equity was considerable, and the efforts were especially effective in education
 as well as for a large number of health outcomes and health care services utilization.

 Nevertheless, very little progress was made in education quality, and despite
 improvement, huge inequalities remain in education provision.
 In Bolivia, Bank Group strategies paid increasing attention to gender issues over time, and
 a number of Bank credits incorporated gender in their project design and results
 measurement. The attention to gender was manifested most explicitly in the interventions
 on maternal and child health, but the expected outcomes were not achieved as the health
 projects failed. Most of the Bank’s interventions in agriculture and rural development had
 a gender dimension and produced good gender results as the projects succeeded overall.
 Although IFC executed several advisory services projects that targeted women
 entrepreneurs, most IFC projects did not explicitly incorporate gender dimensions, even
 when working with indigenous and farming communities as well as small and medium
 enterprises, by including gender-disaggregated data for project beneficiaries, or tracking
 project impact on women.
 In Zambia, successive country strategies have recognized the magnitude of gender
 inequalities in the country, noting the specific challenges faced by women in health,
 education, labor force participation, agriculture, and access to land. However, it is not
 clear how this recognition is translated into operations. In the agricultural sector, for
 example, women do most of the farm work, but do not have control over or access to
 resources; yet the emphasis on gender disparities has not been translated into an
 increased focus on women in agriculture. A gender review in 2012 recommended that
 project design make better use of analytical work to incorporate country and sector level
 gender issues, especially in infrastructure and water sector projects. It also pointed to
 education and gender-based violence as two areas where gender relevant work was
 absent. More recent sector interventions are better at integrating gender aspects, but the
 lack of a gender-targeted approach makes it challenging to address and track gender
 based outcomes.

RAP 2015 finds that even when country strategies address gender issues, they do
not clearly define the goal of gender integration or the rationale for the proposed
approach (IEG 2016). In particular, when gender is treated as a “cross-cutting” issue,
as is most often the case, few strategies adequately explain what that designation
means operationally. In some cases, treating gender as cross-cutting becomes a
means to avoid articulating a clear rationale and elaborating a results chain for the
(undefined) gender goals. Consequently, the gender indicators in most country
strategies are intermediate in nature and derived from existing operations. They are
insufficient for monitoring gender outcomes.

To effectively address gender issues, gender must be an integral part of IDA country
programs, as is currently envisaged in the SCD/CPF process and the new Gender
Strategy. To this end, it will be necessary to have a detailed gender analysis at
country and project levels that allows for an assessment of the differentiated impact

of the proposed strategies and actions on men and women as well as boys and girls.
This may require prior technical and analytical work to ensure the availability of
reliable data, the inclusion of relevant voices in design, and buy-in for proposals.
The findings from the analysis should inform IDA’s country strategies and project
design, with ongoing consultation throughout the life of the strategy and project to
ensure that it is delivering as intended. Attention is needed to integrate gender
across key sectors and address marginalized communities, not simply where women
have traditionally worked.

GENDER IN IDA OPERATIONS
At the operational level, RAP 2015 finds a frequent inclusion of at least some
discussion of gender-related issues in project documents, but the rationale for their
presence is often not apparent (IEG 2016). Typically, project documents forego any
analysis of the relationship between the gender elements included and project
objectives. In fact, the current “gender flag” system may have inadvertently
supported the implicit notion that gender should be relevant for all Bank Group
operations. The lack of explicit discussion of gender relevance to main project
objectives may have led to important gender dimensions being overlooked. Several
IEG thematic evaluations provide examples of such missed opportunities (box 2.6).

 Box 2.6. Gender in IEG Thematic Evaluations

 The systematic review of impact evaluations of social safety nets (SSNs) and gender finds
 that interventions almost inevitably produce gender-differentiated impacts whether those
 impacts were expected or not (IEG 2014d). However, the Bank’s SSN projects rarely
 capture these impacts by expecting the unintended consequences and incorporating the
 impact of gender differences at the design stage. Most projects include limited discussion
 of intra-household dynamics and the gender-relevant context of the supported
 intervention. Gender is often missing from monitoring and evaluation frameworks, except
 for tracking female beneficiaries, and this is observed even in projects that include an
 extensive discussion of gender and have incorporated that discussion in project design.
 There is also evidence that SSN interventions can contribute to empowering women, if
 only economically, although more evidence is needed to determine whether
 empowerment should be an explicit goal of Bank projects.
 The early childhood development (ECD) evaluation finds that synergies have not been
 established between the Bank’s work in gender and ECD despite the evidence of a nexus
 between women’s economic empowerment, girls’ education, and the development of
 children through quality childcare. An internal structure does not yet exist to coordinate
 sectoral interventions and capitalize on opportunities. When cross-sector coordination
 occurred, it was based on staff initiative rather than organizational practices. The lack of
 childcare is often a constraint on female participation in the labor force, but the Bank has

 not been prominent in supporting childcare (World Bank 2015; O’Sullivan and others
 2014).7
 The investment climate evaluation by IEG (2015j) finds that explicit targeting of women
 entrepreneurs is not common, even in projects that more directly impact small
 entrepreneurs and act on constraints more likely to impact women (e.g., reforms dealing
 with registering property, land administration, permits, tax regulations, agriculture,
 licensing, access to land, and property rights). Many of the projects that target women
 entrepreneurs are small in size and mostly focused on capacity-building, which treat
 women as participants of training or consultative working groups rather than as
 entrepreneurs (or potential entrepreneurs).

On the other hand, some IEG project level evaluations offer insight on what works
to promote gender equality in Bank operations. They point to the need to inform
project design with analysis of the likely impact on women’s welfare, women’s role
in society, their special needs, and the local context. Box 2.7 presents some positive
examples of integrating gender consideration into project design and paying
attention to gender impact monitoring.

 Box 2.7. Examples of Informing Project Design with Analysis of Potential Gender Impact

 The Rural Electricity and Renewable Energy Development Project in Bangladesh had a
 gender-informed design by including analysis of the likely impact on women’s security,
 income generation opportunities, and knowledge via access to radio and television (IEG
 2014b). It had indicators for measuring gender outcomes, such as the number of hours
 that girls study at night, access to news by women, improved reproductive health, and
 increased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency
 syndrome (AIDS) information and awareness. An associated technical assistance project
 helped build the client’s administrative and project implementation capacity by
 developing a monitoring and evaluation framework and a methodology for evaluating
 socioeconomic and gender related impacts on electrification projects.
 The Fadama II Project in Nigeria was grounded in a deep understanding of context and of
 what motivates people in order to change behavior (IEG 2014c). The project design was
 informed by relevant analytical and technical work, including a gender assessment. The
 project’s social guidelines encouraged the formation of marginalized groups (e.g., youth,
 widows, physically challenged, people with HIV or AIDS) as a way to ensure that their
 voices were fully heard and that their interests were reflected in local development
 planning. Five years after project close, female participation in local economic
 development planning increased, but greater attention to women’s specific needs is
 required as there is evidence to suggest that women (and other vulnerable groups) were
 often not able to afford or obtain the assets they needed, or that the equipment they
 acquired was being operated by hired hands who benefited more from the assets than the
 women themselves. To address this, the project’s mid-term review recommended


                                                                                                25
CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
 lowering the beneficiary contribution for women and vulnerable groups, but the
 recommendation was not taken up for the next phase of the project.
 The National Social Action Project (2003–10) and the Food Crisis Response Development
 Policy Grant (2008-09) in Sierra Leone also point to the need to pay special attention to
 women’s particular needs in order not to compromise the effectiveness of a cash-for-work
 program targeted at them (IEG 2013b). In this instance, women’s participation could have
 been improved through inclusion of more projects other than roads (where physical
 strength is a primary attribute for the job), or activities more suitable for women (fetching
 water, gravel, cooking, etc.), and arrangements for childcare.
 Sources: IEG (2013b; 2014b,c).



There is a need to design an M&E system that allows for full reporting on gender-
related outcomes. RAP 2015 finds that most projects with gender indicators were in
education and health and the indicators selected tend to measure access or coverage
rather than quality (IEG 2016). Very few indicators measure gender dimensions of
employment and entrepreneurship, or of agricultural and rural development, while
indicators of voice and agency are essentially absent. The drawbacks in the Bank
Group’s M&E framework, especially with respect to gender monitoring, are
highlighted by IEG’s evaluation of electricity access (box 2.8). Specific gender targets
are needed, although this does not necessarily require adding multiple indicators or
gender disaggregating all existing ones, but rather identifying the key indicators that
can be monitored to assess the distributional impacts of the intervention.

 Box 2.8. Gender Monitoring in Bank Group Support to Electricity Access

 The evaluation finds that attention to welfare and gender-related outcomes of electricity
 access interventions appears to be increasing in Bank projects and with satisfactory
 impacts. However, most projects limit themselves to tracking the “number of female
 beneficiaries (percent),” and there is a long way to go for welfare and gender impacts to
 be mainstreamed in IDA and IBRD electricity projects. To improve key performance
 indicators for gender, the evaluation calls for: (i) a clear definition of beneficiaries versus
 users, since they may be different groups; (ii) tracking of outputs and outcomes, not only
 headcount figures; and (iii) measures of outcomes.

 Source: IEG (2015f).




GENDER IN FCS CONTEXT
Gender issues in FCS are often even more acute than in other IDA countries. Women
are more vulnerable to gender-based violence and often face greater economic
burden than in more stable societies. IEG’s FCS evaluation (IEG 2014c) finds that the
Bank has been relatively effective in mainstreaming gender in FCS within the health
and education portfolios and in CDD projects, but has not responded adequately, or
in a timely manner, to conflict-related violence against women (box 2.9).
Consequently, a significant increase in school enrollment of girls was evident in
many FCS countries, and gender-related health indicators also showed significant
improvement. However, most assistance strategies did not address gender-based
violence or constraints affecting the economic empowerment of women. Most of the
demobilization, disarmament, and reintegration programs were not gender sensitive
and provided disproportionate benefits to ex-combatants rather than the victims of
violence. Gender analysis has often been delayed.

 Box 2.9. Gender Interventions in Afghanistan, Liberia, and Nepal

 In Afghanistan, there was a concerted effort in the IDA strategy to reverse the gender
 exclusionary policies of the Taliban. Because ownership of gender issues was an integral
 part of the country program, they were addressed systematically through support for the
 country's National Solidarity Program objectives on gender equality and a Transitional
 Support Strategy. The Bank adopted programs that involved community groups in
 making gender-related decisions. Although women’s voices are yet heard, they have a
 seat at the table. Although access to microfinance has not yet empowered women
 economically, it enhanced their social status. Substantial results have been achieved in
 terms of service delivery (e.g., women’s access to health services and girls’ access to
 schooling) and increased economic and social opportunities for women.

CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
 However, the relevance of the Bank’s analytical work on gender was compromised by the
 fact that the Country Gender Assessment and other gender-related analytic and advisory
 activities were prepared entirely by Bank staff and consultants. Inputs from the
 government were limited, which means weak country ownership. Moreover, the
 assessment did not provide clear guidance, which reduced its usefulness both for the
 Bank and the country. Only after funds were obtained from the Bank’s Gender Action
 Plan was an effort made to operationalize the assessment’s recommendations.
 In Liberia, the Bank’s strategic objectives included gender equality in a broad sense, but
 the design of its assistance focused narrowly on women’s economic empowerment. The
 strategies identified gender-based violence as a serious problem affecting women and
 girls, but provided no assistance. Without alleviating the threat of physical assaults, the
 objective of women’s economic empowerment was compromised. Gender sensitive
 design appeared in more recent Bank projects.
 Nepal was a notable exception where a grant from the State and Peacebuilding Fund was
 used to finance a Peace Support Project with a gender-sensitive approach providing cash
 benefits to widows of conflict-affected families who are particularly burdened and
 disproportionately affected as a consequence of war. A thorough gender analysis also
 enabled Nepal to address gender inequality in livelihoods programs, local government
 programs, and parliamentary participation.

The evaluation recommends that in FCS countries, programs addressing gender
issues be more responsive to the conflict context. This would involve timely gender
analysis to assess the effects of conflict and violence, and implementation of
measures to address conflict-related violence against women and legal constraints
against women’s engagement in economic activities. In particular, the Bank should:

        Frame country strategies with assessment of the nature, dynamics, and
         impact of conflict on women to help prevent and mitigate adverse effects;
        Increase women’s involvement in post-conflict efforts, such as peace
         processes, to improve program design and implementation;
        Collect gender-disaggregated data for monitoring program results;
        Target female-headed households for income generation, employment, and
         human development programs after the conflict ends; and
        Prioritize services for medical and psychosocial conditions and legal,
         education, and livelihood needs to overcome the effects of violence.


Climate Change
IDA countries are especially vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.
IDA17 requirements to screen the entire IDA portfolio for climate risks represent a

                                                                                CHAPTER 2

major achievement and a good first step toward helping countries better assess and
prioritize their risk mitigation needs. Other efforts, such as developing an approach
to measure socioeconomic vulnerability at the national level, multisectoral
investment plans and projects, and a streamlined set of comparable indicators to
measure climate resilience are also positive moves.

In recent years, IEG undertook three evaluations of the Bank Group’s support for
climate change and related issues such as water, natural disasters, and
environmental sustainability. Together, they provide a way forward for engaging
effectively at the country level to pursue energy policy reforms, low-carbon
development, and climate change adaptation. The evaluations emphasize the need
to take a systemic view for assessing interventions’ impacts and alternatives.

Focusing on greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector, the first IEG
evaluation (IEG 2009b) offered four recommendations for the Bank: (i)
systematically promote the removal of energy subsidies; (ii) emphasize policies that
induce improvement in energy efficiency; (iii) provide incentives to address climate
change issues through cross- sectoral approaches; and (iv) invest more to improve
metrics and monitoring for motivation and learning at the global, country, and
project levels. Bank management accepted and substantially implemented these
recommendations.

To promote low-carbon development, IEG’s second evaluation (IEG 2010b)
concluded that the Bank Group needed to leverage its resources to support four
interlinked actions: (i) place greater emphasis on large-scale, potentially catalytic,
and energy efficiency scale-up and improve coordination between the Bank and IFC;
(ii) foster technology transfer and identify innovations that have potentially high
returns; (iii) enhance the delivery of its guarantee products by improving policies,
procedures, incentives, flexibility, and skills for the deployment of the products; and
(iv) measure its projects’ economic and environmental impact during execution and
after closure for feedback and learning (IEG 2010b). Much progress has been
achieved with regard to the Bank’s guarantee instruments, but progress in the other
areas is partial. Renewable energy is receiving far more emphasis than energy
efficiency, which has potentially higher returns. For instance, in contrast to the Clean
Technology Fund for IBRD countries, which finances both renewables and energy
efficiency, the Scaling-up Renewable Energy Program does not support energy
efficiency measures in IDA countries. This is a missed opportunity.

To focus the Bank Group and its development partners on climate adaptation
results, IEG’s third evaluation (IEG 2012b) suggested to develop reference guidelines
for incorporating climate risk management into project and program design,


                                                                                       29

appraisal, and implementation; test territorial and national-level measures of
adaptation-related outcomes and impacts for inclusion in an improved Results
Framework; and pilot approaches to better assess the costs, benefits, sustainability,
and impact of activities with presumed resilience benefits. It also called for support
to improve client countries climate monitoring services and information sharing
within and between countries. IDA has initiated support for improving hydromet
systems in several IDA countries (e.g., Malawi and Ethiopia). There has been
continued progress on mainstreaming climate risk screening, although it is too soon
to tell whether this screening is leading to improved project design. The
development of a national level resilience metric represents a shift toward an
outcome-oriented approach. However, the efforts so far appear to focus more on
adaptation to current climatic conditions and less on preparing vulnerable countries
for the climate change they are likely to face in the future. This is especially
important for low lying coastal areas that will be increasingly at risk from rising sea
levels.

At country program level, few of the CPEs reviewed pay a significant attention to
the subject— climate change issues were touched on in only four of the eleven
countries (box 2.10). This lack of climate change consideration in IDA country
strategies may be partially explained by the fact that the evaluated country
programs cover the period FY87–13, before climate change was identified as a
priority area for IDA assistance. In these country strategies, climate change and
disaster risks are a small part of the Bank Group’s overall country program. All the
Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs) prepared/under preparation, on the other
hand, have incorporated climate and disaster risk in their programs.

 Box 2.10. Managing Climate Change Impacts in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Mongolia, and Zambia

 In Bangladesh, consecutive IDA country strategies included general objectives to improve
 disaster management capacities and called for an increased emphasis on mitigating the
 climate change effects in donor programs to protect the interests of the poor, especially in
 view of the expected impact of climate change on dry-season water availability. However,
 the Bank was remiss in not following up more proactively by matching its assistance to
 strategy objectives. Although climate change was a threat to which the country is highly
 vulnerable, it was not adequately addressed in Bank Group programs.
 Bolivia’s topography makes it highly vulnerable to climate change. There has been
 increased frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, such as those associated with El
 Niño and La Niña as well as glacier retreat. Bank Group strategies targeted climate
 change and disaster risk management. The assistance, however, was small. It contributed
 to building institutions and organizations, including laws required to protect the
 environment and to deal with natural hazards, but it has had little impact on reducing the
 overall environmental pressures. Continued forest losses have reduced biodiversity and

 the potential for carbon sequestration and now constitute the largest source of greenhouse
 gas emissions in Bolivia.
 In Mongolia, IDA strategy identified a wide range of internal and external risks that
 could jeopardize development outcomes, including factors such as climate change and
 weather variability. Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme winters
 (dzuds) that typically cause significant losses of livestock herds in some areas. To further
 improve pasture management and reduce herder’s vulnerability to climate shocks, the
 Bank is supporting the Emergency Disaster Management Program, which builds capacity
 at the National Agency for Meteorology, Hydrology, and Environmental Monitoring to
 institutionalize and fully deploy a livestock early warning system. The program also
 pilots an emergency feed and fodder production system to help reduce the impact of
 dzuds on rural livelihoods. This system has provided accurate forecasting of weather
 conditions and has become a major source of information for the herder community.
 Zambia is very sensitive to recurrent floods and droughts, which are likely to increase in
 scale and frequency with climate change. The latest CPS incorporates climate variability
 risks as one of the vulnerability factors for poverty reduction. However, building
 resilience to climate change, which had been promoted under an Emergency Recovery
 Project, was subject to a lengthy eight-year gap when no progress was made. Meanwhile,
 forest degradation and deforestation was not addressed and continued unabated. Under
 the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience began a
 two-phase program to address Zambia’s climate vulnerability in such areas as agriculture,
 energy, food security, forestry, health, water, and wildlife. The self-evaluation by the CIF
 suggests that there was progress in mainstreaming climate risks and opportunities within
 a number of sector strategies. An important institutional set-up that came out of this
 activity is the Secretariat for Climate Change under the Ministry of Finance. The overall
 effect, however, is not clear due to a lack of information.
 Source: IEG (2009b; 2015a, c, d).



At project level, an IEG evaluation on agriculture and agribusiness concluded that
Bank projects had the potential to improve the readiness of countries to deal with
the effects of climate change on agriculture (IEG 2011b). In particular, focused
analytical work could be important in helping clients identify the direct links
between agricultural production and climate change, a rising priority across
countries.

IEG’s project level evaluations have identified several good practice examples for
addressing environmental issues. For example, global initiatives like the
Biodiversity and Agricultural Commodities Program and the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiatives responded to the need for major economic sectors to
address negative externalities associated with their activities by supporting the
development and implementation of voluntary global standards. The disaster risk
management projects in the Caribbean and Guatemala addressed the risk of adverse

CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
natural events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and excess rainfall by providing
immediate funds to allow governments to respond to a natural disaster. The
Weather Index Insurance projects in Kenya and Rwanda aimed to address the risk of
smallholder farmers sliding back into extreme poverty as a result of crop damage
caused by adverse weather conditions. By reducing risk to farmers, the projects
aimed to increase farm investment and income, ultimately improving food security
and reducing poverty.

Taking into consideration the complexity of climate change issues, the main lesson
to emerge from the CPEs and the thematic evaluations is that Bank Group strategies
must be implemented through concrete projects that are monitored and followed up
in order to produce positive results. Especially when capacity building is required,
too small a level of assistance generates weak thrust. Lessons from IEG project level
evaluations are relatively limited and refer to addressing environmental issues in
general, but with resonance in the climate change context. These include: (i) when
tackling climate change issues that, by their nature, require long term engagement, it
is necessary to plan programmatically over time and to limit processing
requirements; (ii) programmatic approaches may need complementary technical
assistance and other support to address fundamental constraints; and (iii) donor
harmonization has trade-offs—while it can help to provide a unified platform for
sector reform, it has the risk of reducing the flexibility of programs and posing
significant challenges without prior investments to build country capacity for donor
coordination.

In the context of limited IDA resources, the Crisis Response Window (CRW)
provides a supplementary channel of funding when the financing needs exceed the
IDA allocations for the country, as in the case of the $80 million assistance provided
to Vanuatu to help recover from cyclone Pam. The CRW, as designed, is expected to
be used to rebuild infrastructure to an enhanced resilience standard. Relief efforts
after a shock often present a policy opportunity to strengthen institutional capacity.
A small investment, particularly in small states, whose IDA allocations are very
small, could help build country capacity and better prepare them for risk
management of future shocks, or for donor coordination, harmonization, and co-
financing of concessional climate finance.


Fragile and Conflict-Affected States

achieved in some areas and identifies gaps and lessons for future actions (IEG

effectiveness in FCS during 2007–12, when IDA identified support to FCS as a
strategic priority, and as a result of these efforts, portfolio performance in IDA FCS
had improved since 2001, with the gap between FCS and non-FCS IDA countries
being closed. More recently, fragility assessments are being undertaken more
frequently, enhancing IDA’s ability to address fragility and conflict drivers within
the Country Partnership Frameworks in FCS. The procurement policy has been
revised, and the revised framework is being implemented. Stronger partnerships are
reported with nine Joint Implementation Plans prepared in FCS by Bank Group
institutions. An exceptional allocation for “turnaround” regimes has been
introduced, although no countries have received funding from the exceptional
allocation midway through IDA17.

Bank Group engagement in FCS is a long-term agenda with many challenges and
constraints yet to be overcome. On organizational effectiveness, there have been
efficiency gains in the interval from concept note to disbursement, which is 16
months in FCS compared to 21 months in FY15 in IDA (IDA 2015). Operationally,
there has been a noticeable drop in the self-evaluation score for satisfactory
implementation in FCS, which reflects the extent of confidence among task teams
about implementation effectiveness. IEG’s evaluation had commended the World
Bank for recognizing that operations in FCS need more support, and for allocating
higher administrative budgets for project preparation and implementation support
in FCS. This positive trend was not sustained: average project implementation
support cost to IDA FCS operations declined in FY14, and the gap with non-FCS
IDA countries grew further in FY15.9

One key lesson from IEG’s evaluation was that the classification system to identify
FCS countries was inadequate since it was based on CPIA indicators of past policy
and institutional performance.10 While governance is highlighted in these indicators,
conflict and violence risks are not. The threshold defining FCS status was
determined in the early 2000s when conflict was concentrated among poor countries
with very weak institutions. Consequently, countries like Sri Lanka, which suffered
several decades of conflict but had higher CPIA ratings, was never classified as FCS.
The Bank Group’s strategy can be seriously affected by whether or not the existence
of fragility and conflict risks are recognized (box 2.11).

 Box 2.11. FCS Classification and Bank Group Country Strategies for Nepal

 After Nepal’s conflict intensified in 2001, the Bank did not move to classify Nepal as an
 FCS. Instead, the Bank’s focus was predominantly on long-term development and poverty
 reduction, and Nepal’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment remained above 3.0.
 As a result, the Bank’s then nascent toolkit for engaging in FCS was not applied and most

 of the Bank’s strategy objectives were not achieved. Nepal was classified as FCS only after
 the peace agreement was signed and United Nations peacekeeping was initiated in 2006.
 Subsequently, the Bank became more responsive to conflict risks and even financed a
 project to help conflict-affected communities.
 Source: IEG (2011g).



A second lesson was that in the absence of systematic analysis of fragility, conflict,
and political economy risks, country assistance strategies lacked tailoring to fragility
and conflict drivers. Although the Bank was responsive to FCS with reconstruction
programs in the early years after conflict, strategies often lacked realism in the
medium-term and did not have contingencies based on political economy and
conflict risks to adjust objectives and results if risks materialize. Assistance to Timor-
Leste is one such example (box 2.12). In many FCS, fragility risks were treated as a
secondary issue instead of a cornerstone for developing a longer-term strategy to
exit fragility.

 Box 2.12. Fragility Risks and Bank Group Country Strategies for Timor-Leste

 As an FCS, Timor-Leste has received one of the highest levels of financial support on a
 per capita basis. Yet, poverty increased during the period of the largest aid inflow.
 Learning from the experience in other FCS countries, the Bank's CAS correctly
 underscored the importance of aligning interventions with the political realities and the
 institutional capacity constraints in the country. The principles of engagement focused on
 results on the ground, country ownership of the development program, effective
 partnership with other donors, and the efficacy of good communication. Over time,
 however, the Bank's program lost focus and overemphasized long-term institutional
 objectives, placing very little emphasis on short-term interventions that would yield
 immediate benefits to the population. This led to a diminution of program relevance, a
 loss of country ownership, and safeguard violations, all of which affected strategy
 outcomes.
 Source: IEG (2011b).



A third lesson came from the Bank Group’s success at the operational level.
Although Bank Group projects in FCS were more resource intensive, enhanced
financial and staff resources and greater managerial attention led to rapid
improvement in FCS portfolio performance and closing of the gap with nonfragile
IDA countries. Deployment of senior staff at country level,11 made possible by
human resources reforms in 2007, allowed relatively rapid scaling up of programs in
a low capacity environment. Other key determinants of better operational quality
included increased budget allocations to meet the higher cost of doing business in

                                                                                  CHAPTER 2
                                                   EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
FCS, introduction of simplified procedures and implementation mechanisms to
address capacity constraints, and greater reliance on partnerships and support for
national programs in FCS. In Afghanistan and Liberia, for example, the Bank
adjusted for capacity constraints by introducing an outsourcing model to deliver
health services in partnership with civil society organizations.

A related lesson was that Bank Group support for state-building needs to be
sustained through careful sequencing, prioritization of long-term reforms, and a mix
of predictable, programmatic budget support, investment projects, and technical
assistance. This message was reinforced by the PPAR for the Programmatic Support
for Institution Building in Afghanistan, which referred to the need to tailor efforts to
local context in institution building activities and highlighted the importance of
empowering senior government officials (via analytical work and parallel technical
assistance) to determine and direct administrative reforms, public financial
management, and other institutional processes (IEG 2013c). The Afghanistan
Reconstruction Trust Fund was used effectively to finance investment projects
complemented by predictable budget support in the form of an incentives program
to encourage policy and institutional reforms. This judicious mix of instruments and
financial modalities significantly increased the effectiveness and impact of IDA
investments. The PPAR for Investing in Social Capital in Sri Lanka, although not
classified as an FCS, highlights the importance of continuity of engagement and the
programmatic approach that involve multiple stages of lending require iterative
analysis of national priorities, particularly in areas or countries affected by fragility
or conflict, for achieving results in FCS (IEG 2015h).

A fifth lesson emerged from the use of CDD programs, which are useful for short-
term assistance to local communities, but in the absence of a mechanism to ensure
sustainability their long-term viability is at risk. As shown in the examples in box
2.13, what is appropriate for conflict-risk management needs to evolve into more
sustainable institutional systems when the short-term crisis is over.

 Box 2.13. CDD Programs in Afghanistan and Nepal

 In Afghanistan, the National Solidarity Program has been an effective delivery
 mechanism to mitigate conflict by allocating funds for small-scale schemes identified by
 local communities. However, the Community Development Councils were not linked to
 local government organizations, and there were no incentives for their sustainability
 beyond the implementation of the schemes. An impact evaluation showed high interest at
 mid-point but interest in the Councils waned once the schemes were completed.
 In Nepal, the Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) was effective in providing grants for short-
 term schemes and revolving credit grants to poor communities in the conflict-affected



                                                                                         35

 districts. However, it had no linkages and synergies with the microfinance industry.
 Representatives of microfinance institutions expressed concern that a large portion of PAF
 loans were not effectively targeted and were distorting the microfinance sector by
 damaging the discipline and sustainability of established Savings and Credit Groups.
 Source: IEG (2011g, 2013a).



A sixth lesson was that inclusive growth and job creation were difficult to achieve in
FCS. The Bank provided targeted support for short-term jobs through CDD and
public works programs. Support for long-term jobs focused on investment climate
reforms, which are necessary but not sufficient for private sector development, given
infrastructure and capacity constraints. To be effective, an inclusive growth and jobs
strategy would need to be based on a cross-sectoral approach consisting of
prioritized interventions that take advantage of potential synergies across the Bank
Group

The final lesson was that resources matter. Other than FCS countries that are well
endowed with natural resources, most FCS tend to be dependent on donor
financing. Due to the constraints of performance-based allocation criteria for IDA,
the global shift in aid flows toward fragile states was not matched by IDA during
IEG’s evaluation period, and despite the large volumes of exceptional post-conflict
allocations to Afghanistan, Liberia, Sudan, and Timor-Leste, FCS received less aid
per capita from IDA than other low-income countries (LICs). This was in contrast to
the increased share of overall official development assistance to FCS, largely because
of increases in bilateral assistance to FCS. In this context, multi-donor trust funds
could be a source of additional finance, but also play a central role in donor
coordination, policy dialogue, and institution building. Recent changes in the IDA
resource allocation framework has reportedly led to an increase in FCS allocation
(IDA 2015).

To enhance the relevance and effectiveness of its assistance to FCS, the evaluation
recommended that the Bank Group adjust its strategy, approach, and product mix.
Specifically, the Bank Group should (i) develop a more suitable and accurate
mechanism to determine FCS by integrating indicators of political economy and
conflict risks within the current system; (ii) tailor country assistance strategies better
to FCS and monitor fragility risks to make strategic adjustments, when necessary;
(iii) increase support to reform-oriented FCS for state capacity building at national
and subnational levels through predicable budget support, TA, and investment
lending; (iv) develop and implement a plan for institutional sustainability of CDD
programs; (v) ensure that gender-oriented programs in conflict-affected countries
are more responsive to the conflict context and address gender-based violence and

                                                                                 CHAPTER 2
                                                  EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
legal constraints on economic empowerment of women; and (vi) develop a more
realistic medium- to long-term framework for inclusive growth and jobs in FCS and
ensure synergies across the Bank Group. This would also imply adaptation of IFC
and MIGA business models, risk tolerances, and product mix to be responsive to the
special needs of the private sector in FCS.

Bank management agreed with and committed to implement these
recommendations, and integrated several of them into IDA17 commitments. Actual
implementation is in early stages of planning and design, which has not yet been
integrated within operations and therefore not been evaluated. This appears to be
the case for the analytical tool being prepared to develop an inclusive growth and
jobs strategy, the planning being done to implement measures for institutional
sustainability of CDD programs, the trust-funded pilots to address gender-based
violence, and the work initiated to revise the criteria for FCS classification. In
comparison, the work on fragility assessments appears to be more advanced. This
could serve as a useful instrument to integrate fragility and conflict risks in the
design of country assistance strategies and programs and help monitor those risks.

Two recent trends—increased population displacement and the horizontal spread of
fragility and conflict to middle-income countries (MICs)—have increased the
relevance of the lessons from IEG’s FCS evaluation. While some of the issues are
beyond the range of IDA interventions, the fragility challenges they face suggest that
analytical and operational lessons learned from IDA-eligible FCS countries may well
be relevant for these non-IDA fragile situations. What is evident is that these trends
have exposed the underlying fragility in several apparently stable and economically
thriving states and made the need for fragility and political economy analysis
critical, not just for countries classified as FCS but for neighboring countries and
even for MICs at risk.


Crisis Response
In the post-crisis context of IDA16 discussions, a dedicated CRW was establisehd to
facilitate IDA countries’ timely access to additional resources in response to the
impact of severe economic and food crises and natural disasters. Since then, nearly
half of the resources set aside for the purpose have been utilized. IEG has reviewed
two of the 27 CRW-funded projects and found one satisfactorily achieved its
objectives and the other not, while both faced high risk to development outcomes.

Several IEG thematic evaluations have looked at the Bank Group’s crisis responses
to natural disasters, global financial crisis, global food crisis, and other humanitarian



                                                                                        37
CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
crisis. The evaluation brief on natural disaster response of the World Bank and
others (IEG 2011c) found that although the short-term response to disasters tended
to draw most attention, work done during the pre-disaster phase (in relation to
disaster response and post-disaster phases) in terms of institution and systems
building could ensure a simpler and more effective response during a given disaster.
This echoes the findings of an earlier IEG evaluation (IEG 2006), which showed that
efforts at reducing risks and increasing preparedness within national development
strategies of countries prone to disasters could deliver substantial gains in the
effectiveness of the response when disasters occur.

During the disaster response phase itself, the evaluation brief pointed to the need to
(i) keep project design as simple and realistic as possible, and streamline procedures
for quick delivery; (ii) base project deadlines on a specific analysis of likely post-
disaster (rather than “normal”) capacity; (iii) consult with a wide range of
stakeholders (including the poor and the private sector) while focusing on rapid
development and processing of interventions; and (iv) begin the longer term process
of developing disaster preparedness, being cognizant of the longer term financing
and implementation commitment involved. Post-disaster, recovery efforts that
involved developing the capacity of existing (or new) institutions and community
driven approaches could be very effective, while housing reconstruction programs
that implicated homeowners and required adequate grievance and complaint
mechanisms worked better than purely contracted arrangements. The need for
flexibility and strong M&E arrangements was also emphasized.

IEG’s two evaluations of the global financial crisis found that Bank Group lending
increased to unprecedented level in response to the global economic crisis (IEG
2011e, 2012e). Three factors contributed to the Bank’s readiness: knowledge of
poverty impact, long-term relationship with country authorities, and IBRD’s
inherited financial headroom. In comparison, IDA’s additional financial support was
more modest, reflecting an inelastic envelope and performance based resource
allocation. In particular, the evaluations found that it was vital for the Bank to
continue country engagement, policy dialogue, and analytic work in key areas (e.g.,
in financial sector) to maintain expertise. This would help the Bank Group anticipate
crises, play a proactive role in providing early warnings and alerts to clients and to
the broader international community, and be ready to act quickly (e.g., Mongolia,
see box 2.7).

More guidance was needed in the use of instruments and policy conditionality of
crisis operations. In this regard, a review of the Bank’s overall financial position
could usefully include a review of its financial products, assessing the flexibility for
price adjustments on standard loan products during crisis and the usefulness of


38
                                                                                 CHAPTER 2
                                                  EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
explicit countercyclical loans (e.g., greater spread, shorter maturities). To protect the
vulnerable during crises, the evaluations found that Bank interventions reached a
small number of formal workers by scaling up unemployment insurance and the
structurally poor through cash transfer programs, but left a “missing middle” of
transient and near poor unprotected. This highlighted the need for the Bank to
progress toward the adoption of a system-wide approach to social protection and
risk management beyond social safety nets to ensure that data and programs be
available to cope with crises.

Finally, the role of IDA in the Bank’s resource-mobilization activity was emphasized:
while IDA fast-tracking helped to speed the processing of eligible operations, it was
no substitute for increased resources. Although MICs were more affected by the
crisis given their greater global linkages, LICs were far less able to bear the costs of
the crisis and thus needed more Bank proactivity on their behalf.

IEG’s global food crisis evaluation generated a number of sobering conclusions and
recommendations about IDA-supported crisis response programs (IEG 2014d). First,
operational resources (budget and staff) were not expanded sufficiently for program
preparation and supervision to match the increased and accelerated volume of
operations. This highlights the need to ensure that country-driven food crisis
response programs have adequate administrative budgets to facilitate effective
preparation and supervision of food crisis mitigation operations. Second, the Bank
acquiesced with, or supported, policies and actions that were inconsistent with its
own food crisis-related policy advice or were not aligned with the country context.
This pointed to the need to develop quality assurance procedures for food crisis
response programs. Third, several food crisis operations exclusively supported
programs for longer-term resilience, many of them in agriculture, with no
component to address the immediate effects of the crisis (e.g., Afghanistan and
Timor-Leste, see box 2.14). The evaluation recommended that IDA better target
those most vulnerable to a food price crisis (especially children under two and
pregnant and breastfeeding women) with adequate nutrition interventions in their
mitigation programs.

CHAPTER 2
EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS



 Box 2.14. Crisis Response in Afghanistan, Mongolia, and Timor-Leste

 In Afghanistan, two relatively small operations—the Food Crisis Response Project ($8
 million) and the Avian Flu Project ($5 million)—were completed, but only the first was
 able to achieve its objectives. The main impact of IDA funding was to increase the scope of
 an ongoing irrigation rehabilitation program, but its impact on food prices in the short
 term was negligible because the activities were planned to take two years.
 Mongolia was badly affected by the Asian financial crisis of 1998. In 2008–09, the Bank
 reacted promptly to realign its portfolio to help the government cope with the global
 economic crisis. This involved shifting the majority of new IDA resources to development
 policy credits and intensifying its analytic and advisory activities to deliver real-time
 policy advice. The Bank’s economic updates started during the crisis and was initially
 produced monthly, then quarterly, and now biannually. Although specific outcomes
 cannot be attributed to them, they were considered valuable contributions and provided a
 significant input into the general economic analysis and debate in Mongolia. As the
 economy rapidly recovered from the global crisis, however, the impetus for implementing
 the newly adopted laws and pursuing the reforms collapsed, and the policies introduced
 in the wake of the crisis were not implemented.
 In Timor-Leste, while the Bank (and other donors) did well to avert a major food crisis in
 the years following 1999, the interventions in later years focused unduly on adopting
 frameworks and laws that did not necessarily translate into improvements in productivity
 or incomes in the rural sector. Enforcing full compliance with the Bank‘s fiduciary
 requirements caused serious delays in Bank project implementation, including projects
 that were meant to provide immediate short-term benefits to the poor and where speedy
 implementation was essential. These delays also negated the other efforts of the Bank to
 respond to crisis situations and accelerate project preparation and approvals.
 Source: IEG (2011b; 2013a, and 2015c).



Given that data scarcity was acute for most LICs, few recipient countries assessed
the impact of food crisis on the poor, and most projects did not specify actual and
expected program “coverage” to assess the likely contribution of the project to the
population most in need of assistance. This called for greater IDA effort to work
with client countries and development partners to identify practical mechanisms
(including indicators) for monitoring nutritional and welfare outcomes and impacts
of food crises and mitigation programs, and work with them to implement those
mechanisms and report the results. There was also a need to ensure that food crisis
response components, processed as re-structured projects, additional or
supplemental finance operations, include appropriate M&E arrangements.

                                                                                    CHAPTER 2
                                                     EVALUATION FINDINGS IN IDA THEMATIC AREAS
The food, fuel, and financial crises of 2008–10 underscored the urgency of
developing Social Safety Net (SSN) programs in all countries. IEG’s SSN evaluation
pointed to the need for the Bank to engage consistently during stable times to help
countries develop SSNs that address poverty and protect the poor and vulnerable
from individual and systemic shocks (IEG 2011e). Stronger demand for SSN support
in MICs led to significantly stronger engagement there than in IDA countries.12 The
two most common constraints for Bank support, particularly in LICs, were weak
country institutions and inadequate data. Throughout the decade, the Bank’s
lending, analytical, and capacity-building support for SSNs were significantly more
concentrated in MICs than in IDA countries, and this may have perpetuated the
latter’s low level of attention to SSNs. Countries that had developed SSN programs
or institutions during “stable times” were better positioned to scale up—and the
World Bank was better able to help them—than those that had not (Ethiopia, see box
2.15).

 Box 2.15. Crisis Response Operations

 The Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant Project for Burundi emphasizes the
 need to fully understand local context (IEG 2012a). In this case, the choice of instruments
 and policy measures for an emergency food crisis intervention took into account the local
 causes of poverty and hunger which were identified through recent sector work.
 However, the operation was framed as a short-term response to spikes in world
 commodity prices, and was not designed to address the fundamental problem of low
 agricultural productivity, the root of Burundi‘s food crisis.
 A budget support to Djibouti in response to the global food crisis underscores the need to
 recognize possible trade-offs between speed and targeting accuracy in preparing
 emergency response operations (IEG 2012b). It also shows that emergency response can be
 fruitfully combined with the development of a longer-term program following a
 programmatic approach.
 Through Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program, the largest SSN supported by the
 Bank in an IDA country, the World Bank and other donors supported the government’s
 transition from a situation of annual emergency food appeals to the development of a
 predictable SSN able of providing work opportunities and direct assistance to needy
 families during the annual drought season (IEG 2011e). A three-phase adaptable program
 loan enabled the Bank to support Ethiopia continuously through financing and analytical
 and technical assistance as it prepared, supervised, and evaluated each stage. Evaluation
 evidence indicates that program workfare beneficiaries are more likely to be food secure,
 borrow for productive purposes, use improved agricultural technologies, and operate
 nonfarm business activities. The program prevented beneficiary households from sliding
 deeper into poverty and selling household assets, thus protecting them from the worst
 effects of the shocks. Ethiopia has focused narrowly (and effectively) on food insecurity in




                                                                                            41

 rural areas but is now engaged in the preparation of a broader social protection strategy
 that will address other sources of vulnerability as well.
 The National Social Action Project and the Food Crisis Response Development Policy
 Grant in Sierra Leone point to the benefit of adding emergency components to existing
 projects with an established institutional base (IEG 2013b). In these projects, the addition
 of the cash-for-work program to the Social Action Project benefitted from an experienced,
 field-oriented agency operating in all the country’s districts and having done a small pilot
 for cash-for-work giving it at least a minimal base for scale-up.
 Sources: IEG (2011e; 2012 a,b; 2013b).



To improve its effectiveness in helping countries respond to shocks, the evaluation
urged the Bank to maintain steady engagement through lending, knowledge work,
and dialogue during stable times to build SSN institutions and systems; increase
SSN engagement in LICs; improve the Results Frameworks of Bank supported SSNs
to more clearly identify the needs of the poor or vulnerable and how project
objectives fit within longer term objectives for developing country SSNs; assess the
cost effectiveness of policy alternatives; and improve internal coordination. The
priorities of the Bank’s social protection strategy reinforced these recommendations,
and the Bank has made a substantial effort to increase its efforts in IDA countries,
with a particular emphasis on building systems and institutional capacity. While
data and capacity constraints remain, many IDA countries are better positioned to
scale up SSNs to address economic crises and natural disasters than they were prior
to IDA16.

IEG’s project level evaluations highlight the need to understand local context in
order to inform the approach to be taken and to ensure that actions address binding
constraints and be well targeted (box 2.15). They also identify the need to balance
different trade-offs in designing and implementing crisis response operations, which
may require a quality assurance procedure applicable to crisis situations that helps
mitigate potentially adverse effects associated with rapid preparation and
implementation.

thematic evaluations since 2010, and 49 Project Performance Assessment Reports completed
in FY12–15 covering 83 projects in IDA countries. See appendices A-C for the list of
evaluations reviewed.
2 Three Project Performance Assessment Reports touched on youth employment issues in

the context of temporary work in post-war Sierra Leone and skills development and
curriculum updating for tertiary education in Sri Lanka.

4 The Global Financial Inclusion Database, known as Global Findex, was presented during

the 2015 annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
5 The International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency

have standardized definitions, but the evaluation found them to be ill tuned to many local
contexts.
6 The evaluation recommended the World Bank Group institutionalize the management

accountability framework, develop a monitoring system to assess how well the Bank’s work
program addresses gender-related concerns, establish a Results Framework to facilitate
adoption of an outcome focused approach to gender integration, and restore a broader
requirement for gender integration at the project level.
7 The progress report notes that drawing from the findings of O’Sullivan and others (2014),

the Bank’s Growth Poles Project in the Democratic Republic of Congo started to test the
recommended policy action of providing rural childcare to help women spend more time on
agricultural work (World Bank 2015).
8 Many of the lessons on FCS are addressed under separate IDA special themes (e.g.,

gender). This section focuses on more systemic issues facing FCS countries.
9 The average implementation support cost per project for FCS countries is now $155,000,

compared to $175,000 for all International Development Association (IDA) countries. See
IDA17 Implementation and Results Progress Report, November 2015, p. 71.
10 The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment indicators were developed as an

instrument to determine Performance-Based Allocations of IDA resources.
11 Staff deployed in FCS country offices increased by 68 percent over the evaluation period,

twice the increase of nonfragile IDA countries, and the number of senior staff (GH+) based
in country offices doubled.
12 The Bank provided $11.5 billion for social safety nets (SSNs) in 83 countries in FY00–10,

half of it during the last two years of that decade in the immediate aftermath of the crises.
However, 70 percent of the SSN lending portfolio in FY00–10 went to 10 countries which,
with the exception of Ethiopia and Pakistan, were middle-income countries.

3. Managing for Results
IDA has been a pioneer in results measurement. In 2002, IDA13 adopted the two-
tiered RMS to track the progress of IDA countries and IDA-supported development
results. It was the first time for a multilateral development institution to use a
framework with quantitative indicators to monitor results and performance. In 2010,
IDA16 expanded the RMS from two to four tiers to track IDA operational and
organizational effectiveness. It also introduced indicators to track progress on the
IDA special themes. These activities inspired the World Bank in 2011 to adopt the
Corporate Scorecard, which drew heavily from the RMS indicators.

The IDA16 process also included a Working Group on Development Results. Based
on its success, IDA17 re-established the group with the objective of providing
forward-looking suggestions for how IDA might improve its impact on the lives of
the poor and its accountability. Deliberations of the working group have identified
three sets of issues for further discussion in IDA18: IDA Results Framework; results
culture, and learning from results. IEG evaluations on Bank Group results and
learning, as well as those on IDA special themes, offer relevant lessons.


Results and Learning
IEG’s evaluation of Bank Group self-evaluation systems, Behind the Mirror: A
Report on the Self-Evaluation Systems of the World Bank Group, finds that the Bank
Group has put in place comprehensive self-evaluation systems the design and
operation of which adhere to relevant good practice standards (IEG 2016). Consisting
of cascading indicators, some of which draw on information from project
supervision and completion reports, the system provides a framework and data for
corporate results reporting to the Board and other stakeholders. The systems mesh
well with the independent evaluation systems for which they provide information.
Many evaluation experts consider the design of the Bank Group’s systems to be as
good as or better than those in comparable organizations.

However, the existing self-evaluation systems are found to focus primarily on
meeting the need for accountability and do not well serve the emphasis placed by
the 2013 Bank Group Strategy on the “Solutions Bank” and learning to enhance
performance. That is, the focus on corporate results measurement and reporting has
sidelined other purposes, such as using the system for performance management,
strategic decision making, and learning. For example, when the Bank’s
Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) system works as intended, flags are


                                                                                   46
                                                                                 CHAPTER 3
                                                                      MANAGING FOR RESULTS
raised at the right time,1 and teams and managers act on them to turn problem
projects around. Yet ISR ratings and indicators derived from them are not always
precise because of weak project monitoring and optimistic reporting. The ISR would
be a more effective early warning tool if team leaders had incentives to proactively
acknowledge issues and raise risk flags. Better early warning needs to be combined
with timely action. IEG’s second evaluation of learning and results in World Bank
operations (IEG 2015a) also notes a lack of candor in ISR ratings as the supervision
record often understates the severity of the problems a project encounters.2 A
detailed analysis of IEG’s Implementation Completion and Results Report Reviews
finds that commonly occurring supervision issues, such as inadequate attention to
M&E (45 percent), excessively optimistic ISR ratings (30 percent), and weak project
management (28 percent) are far more prevalent among unsuccessful than
successful projects.3

IEG thematic and project evaluations highlight some long-standing shortcomings in
the M&E system that generate the underlying evidence for results (box 3.1). Weak
M&E is a factor in 70 percent of all downgrades of project completion reports. At the
country strategy level, the introduction of results frameworks in 2005 has improved
country program self-evaluations, but results measurement continues to be an issue.
IEG’s learning note on the results framework in country strategies (IEG 2015b) finds
that of the 25 country partnership strategies approved in FY14, less than 50 percent
were fully aligned with the objectives although 90 percent had measurable
indicators. Also, the country strategy results frameworks are primarily based on
Bank project level M&E frameworks and in many cases lack country-level
indicators. This leads to a substantial gap between Bank Group strategic objectives
and the indicators provided to measure program impact. Because of this
interrelationship, weaknesses in project M&E are carried over to country program
results measurement.

 Box 3.1. Challenges with Monitoring and Evaluation

 Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is a problem that cuts across multiple evaluations.
 Close to two-thirds of the thematic evaluations by the Independent Evaluation Group
 (IEG) include a recommendation to improve M&E. Many recommendations focus on
 strengthening Results Frameworks and indicators, especially outcome indicators, for the
 World Bank Group to be in a better position to assess the impact of its interventions and
 determine whether they are meeting their development objectives. Some
 recommendations point to working with the client to build their data collection and M&E
 capacity. M&E systems for new and cross-cutting areas, such as innovation and
 entrepreneurship, public-private partnerships, and procurement, are also vital.

CHAPTER 3
MANAGING FOR RESULTS
 Bank Group management generally agrees with IEG’s recommendations but cites many
 challenges such as difficulty in collecting data especially when relying on the countries to
 generate the necessary information, methodological issues in assessing project impacts
 and in developing outcomes, and the time lag for outcomes to materialize, sometimes
 several years after a Bank Group intervention is completed. In its annual updates,
 management acknowledges the difficulties in strengthening M&E and rates only one-half
 the M&E related recommendations as “substantial” or better for implementation by the
 fourth year of follow-up, compared to an average of 89 percent.

Having all operational units write substantive end-of-project reports is a noteworthy
accomplishment that not many other organizations can boast. In practice, however,
the two recent evaluations of Learning and Results in World Bank Operations (IEG
2014 and 2015a) and Behind the Mirror: A Report on the Self-Evaluation Systems of
the World Bank Group (IEG 2016) find that knowledge from the Bank Group
systems is not much used, and there is limited effort to extract and synthesize
evidence and lessons to inform operations. Staff are more likely to rely on tacit
knowledge than on written information from the self-evaluation systems. There is
some individual learning, but few benefits of this learning accrue beyond the
authors, leaving the potential of the systems for organizational learning unfulfilled.

Learning has taken a backseat to accountability. The systems’ focus on
accountability drives the shape, scope, timing, and content of reporting, and limit
the usefulness of the exercise for learning. The Learning and Results evaluations
(IEG 2014 and 2015a) and Behind the Mirror: A Report on the Self-Evaluation
Systems of the World Bank Group (IEG 2016) find that the observed shortcomings
are associated with incentives and behaviors rather than templates and processes.
Incentives created inside and outside systems are not conducive to conducting high-
quality self-evaluation, and most staff do not view the self-evaluation systems as a
source of timely, credible, and comprehensive information. Staff engage with the
systems with a compliance mindset, where candor and thoughtful analysis of
drivers of results and failures suffer. Parts of the system not focused on corporate
reporting, such as impact evaluations and other voluntary self-evaluations, are more
valued by respondents. An increasing number of impact evaluations are carried out
at project level. These optional, often self-selected evaluations are seen as technically
credible and regarded as a valuable tool to increase development effectiveness.
Demand for such learning evaluations is stronger, but they need to be deployed
more strategically to understudied areas, and the feedback loop between evaluation
findings and operations needs to be strengthened.

                                                                              CHAPTER 3
                                                                   MANAGING FOR RESULTS
Despite a strong commitment to deliver results, these earlier evaluations have
highlighted that the culture and systems of the organization, the incentives offered
to staff, and the signals from managers are not as effective as they could be. Many
teams do not feel rewarded for good M&E and for identifying and fixing problems
in real time. Management needs to create more incentives for staff to engage with
the self-evaluation systems with candor, conduct thoughtful analysis of both
successes and failures, and move from a compliance mindset to a learning
perspective.

Behind the Mirror: A Report on the Self-Evaluation Systems of the World Bank
Group (IEG 2016) identifies three broad causes of misaligned incentives for using
self-evaluation systems: excessive focus on ratings, attention to volume that
overshadows attention to results, and low perceived value of the knowledge created.
It then puts forward three preliminary suggestions:

       Make the ICR system more compatible with innovation and course
        corrections by reducing the barriers to innovation and experimentation, and
        devoting greater attention to evaluability and adaptability in order to
        balance the excessive focus on ratings.
       Strengthen leadership signals about the value of self-evaluation by making
        better institutional use of the knowledge generated.
       Enhance the value of self-evaluations by using self-evaluations strategically
        to bridge knowledge gaps, developing frameworks for capturing, storing,
        and acting on evaluative lessons, tracking projects with high-quality results
        frameworks, and testing approaches to uphold both accountability and
        learning needs.


Cross-Cutting Issues
Despite differences in the five IDA special themes, the relevant IEG evaluation
findings point to a core set of generally applicable lessons that suggest positive
development impact will be enhanced when:

       The special themes are part of the underlying Bank Group knowledge work;
       The agenda is owned by the client countries and supported by successive
        governments;
       IDA’s country strategies specifically target and fund actions to pursue them;
        and
       Results of the thematic targeting are monitored as part of the strategy
        implementation process.



                                                                                       49
CHAPTER 3
MANAGING FOR RESULTS
It is important to note that IEG evaluations are prepared to help the Bank Group
deliver the best possible development results in a particular area. Each may thus
suggest additional efforts for achieving that goal. Clearly, a strategic choice has to be
exercised at the corporate level as to which thematic areas are relatively more
important for IDA at each moment. The themes need to be assessed within the context
of the changing development landscape, Bank Group strategic directions, IDA’s value
proposition, and the need for enhanced learning, innovation, and results -- to ensure
that they are not simply add-ons. For example, the viability of the themes should be
the demonstrated through socioeconomic and technical analysis. This would help
manage the tension between the pressure to add to the development agenda for
political expediency and the realities of IDA’s resource (staff and budget) constraints.

Strategic choice also needs to be exercised at country level to take into account the
nature and dynamics of the issues in the local context and the key constraints to
resolving them. As demonstrated in the country examples referenced above, earlier
evaluations indicated room for better alignment between IDA’s thematic aspirations
and country strategies. The SCD/CPF process could play an important role for
assessing the trade-offs and making strategic decisions on the Bank Group side.
However, country ownership of IDA’s development agenda determines the ultimate
outcomes. Just as the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative was tied to the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, which also proved to be a useful instrument for
advancing the MDGs (IEG 2015c), future IDA strategic and programmatic support
could be strengthened through a coherent, dynamic, and well-sequenced strategy by
IDA recipients. Learning from past experiences and correcting previous mistakes, IDA
could assist its clients to address the IDA special themes within the context of the
country’s specific priorities, constraints, funding requirements, and M&E framework.

The issue with project and country program M&E is worth reiterating. Despite IDA’s
strong effort to strengthen results measurement for both accountability and learning
purposes, the current results monitoring systems remain underutilized for either
objective. This is not a problem unique to IDA or the Bank Group; all other
development agencies face the same problem. It is particularly important to increase
the focus on learning from projects that have follow-on projects or that are being
considered for adoption in other contexts, and to ensure that those involved in
designing these mine the existing evidence. In this context, clear signals from the top
are critical for creating a robust results culture, including an emphasis on the
importance of adequate and timely results measurement, consistent incentives, and
adequate training and support to staff as well as more attention to supporting the
development of country capacity and country M&E systems.
