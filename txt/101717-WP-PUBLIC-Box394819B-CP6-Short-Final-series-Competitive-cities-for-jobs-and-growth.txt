Part 2: How does Growth Pathways work?
Overview of diagnostic exercises
The Growth Pathways methodology includes three diagnostic exercises. Each addresses a different type of client ques-
tion and uses a different set of techniques and tools. However, all three diagnostics are organized around the Matrix model of a
city’s economy and together make up a holistic approach to city competitiveness. (Figure 3)


Figure 3 Structure of Growth Pathways methodology
Competitive Cities Snapshot
Provides an overview of the city economy focusing on changes in key economic indicators, benchmarks of the city’s economic performance and
enabling conditions, and an analysis of the city’s economic structure.
Why do it: The snapshot answers the question from city leaders, “How is my city doing?”
What it delivers: An overview of the city’s economic performance, plus two types of hypotheses: (i) constraints on city compet-
itiveness and (ii) sections of the city’s businesses (defined by sector, size or type of ownership) that offer growth potential or are
underperforming and thus deserve special attention.

Deep Dives
Focuses on selected industrial sectors or firm size bands and ownership types to identify their competitive potential and to identify key con-
straints.
Why do it: Our approach to city competitiveness starts from firm-level needs. Needs of firms differ across industries, firm sizes
and ownership types. Thus the most efficient interventions are sometimes those that identify and target the needs of specific busi-
ness with growth potential.
What it delivers: A focus on issues that need to be addressed to support specific types of businesses in the city.
Deep-dive diagnostics combines two analytical techniques:
1.	       In-depth prioritization – a detailed analysis of industry potential using market-research techniques.
2.	       Driving conditions benchmarking – a study of conditions that define growth in specific industries.
