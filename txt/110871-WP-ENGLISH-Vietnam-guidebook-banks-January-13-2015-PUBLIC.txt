Note to readers
The Guidebook has been developed as a practical tool which reflects global good practices
for the definition of, identification, management and reporting of related party transactions
in banking. The practices that have been identified have not come from one place but from
diverse and applicable practices derived from a number of countries such as Singapore,
Malaysia, Italy, Ireland, Hong Kong, Australia, United Kingdom and Canada.
The Guidebook is not expected to reflect or repeat all relevant Vietnamese regulations. These
should be clear from the regulations themselves. In any event, sound corporate governance is
more than just compliance with the law and regulations. Corporate governance is about
corporate behaviour and the tone set at the top by boards and management. Strong corporate
governance is conveyed through a company’s leadership characteristics, its systems of
accountability and through fairness, transparency and responsibility to the institution and its
stakeholders.
Finally, this Guidebook is not expected to encompass all governance and disclosure issues but
to deal only with those governance policies and procedures to demonstrate and for proper
handling of related parties and related party transactions, including transparency and
disclosure issues.

1.1. Context and rationale
The government of Vietnam has made commendable efforts to advance corporate governance
principles into the legal and regulatory framework in the banking and financial sector. Yet,
there are persistent corporate governance weaknesses.
The period from 2010 to 2014 revealed several difficulties in the banking sector and in bank
lending practices. High levels of non-performing loans and practices evident from prosecutions
of cases such as Vinashin and Asia Commercial Bank demonstrate a need for rigorous, en-
hanced supervisory review and enforcement and better application of regulations and
better bank governance practices, particularly in the area of transparency and disclosure
regarding related party transactions (RPTs). More recently, allegations of unlawful lending by
Ocean Bank support the need for this Guidebook.
Additionally, in the face of economic downturn, a number of large state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) have defaulted on their obligations and others are overleveraged. The banking system
has accumulated a significant level of non-performing loans, and many small banks have
experienced serious liquidity and solvency problems2.
Transparency regarding RPTs is crucial in banks to ensure depositors, investors and regulators
alike know and can assess the financial position and soundness of a bank. This is even more
crucial in Vietnamese banks as bank ownership structures are complex with many cross
shareholdings between private entities, state-owned enterprises and economic groups.
Concerning Vietnam, a pan-ASEAN corporate governance review report notes, in part, “despite
improvements, certain poor corporate governance practices continue to prevail... companies
lack clear policies covering the review and approval of significant related party transactions”3.
A 2013 World Bank Review of the Observance of Standards and Codes in Corporate Governance
of Vietnam also recommends “improving the protection of minority shareholders by strength-
ening rules on related party transactions”4.
Banks are engines of growth and generate a multiplier impact on the economy. Failure of one
bank has a systemically larger impact in the banking system and the economy. Therefore

greater care should be taken in the governance of each bank. Bank business includes
borrowing money from individual depositors to make loans to other clients. Banks and bank
boards have a duty of care to their depositors and if a problem is suspected, depositors could
start a run on the bank. Banks should establish a higher standard of care, higher than ordinary
listed companies, to establish and maintain the trust of depositors. A strong RPT environment
and leadership ‘at the top’ is important and empowers internal bank gatekeepers.
Another incentive for good RPT practices is that investors, including foreign investors, view
transparency and clarity on RPTs as an indication that the bank actively seeks to identify and
to control these transactions, thus reducing the risk of loss, and thus presenting a better
investment opportunity.
A consortium comprised of four parties, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), International Finance
Corporation (IFC), FMO, which is also known as the Netherlands Development Finance
Company (FMO’s legal name is ‘Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelings-
landen N.V.’), and Dragon Capital of Vietnam (‘the Consortium’), determined that in the banking
sector in Vietnam, there was a need for greater transparency and disclosure surrounding RPTs.
Hence, the concept for this Guidebook was established.
The goal of the Guidebook is to encourage commercial banks to raise awareness of good
corporate governance and to explain the challenge related party transactions and conflicts of
interest present in banking and how they should, in good practices, be managed. Banks should
improve their transparency of information in these areas.

1.2. Objectives
The overarching goal of this Guidebook is to provide guidance to banks on how they can
improve RPT oversight and management and to improve transparency of RPTs in commercial
banks in Vietnam.
The specific objectives of the Guidebook are three-fold:
    -   To raise awareness in Vietnamese commercial banks about international
        practices for RPTs and on transparency in banking regarding RPTs, and related party
        lending (RPL);
    -   To produce a Guidebook that gives concrete assistance to banks to develop adequate
        practices for RPTs and levels of disclosure to increase transparency for RPTs; and
    -   To provide to directors and senior management a source of best practice, together
        with examples, for easy implementation into their banks’ corporate governance.

1.3. Scope and applicability
This Guidebook is developed specifically for voluntary application by all commercial banks,
established and operating in Vietnam. All banks, whether they are Vietnamese or foreign-

owned limited liability companies, joint stock companies or 100% state-owned banks should
apply the provisions of this Guidebook as all may affect national financial stability5.
The Guidebook respects the legal and regulatory requirements for RPTs applicable for all listed
entities. However, it demands a higher standard from all banks due to their position of impor-
tance as deposit taking institutions and their impact on the stability of the banking system
and the national economy. Although regulations and required disclosures may be less detailed
for non-listed banks, especially those that are wholly-owned, these banks can nevertheless
pose risks to the financial system. Therefore, it is recommended that all banks should apply
the recommendations.

1.4. Legal provisions
The Guidebook seeks to incorporate current and key applicable regulations in Vietnam which
are set down in the legal and regulatory framework. These key regulations relating to RPTs are
set out below. Other laws and regulations are applicable also. However, those listed below are
the prime instruments.
Banks hold a special position of responsibility to their depositors, to regulators and the public.
As such, it is expected that all the laws and regulations below are complied with by all banks,
even if some do not directly apply because the bank is not listed, or is privately owned or is
state owned. To the extent the regulations themselves may conflict with the Law on Credit
Institutions, the Law on Credit Institutions will take precedence.
This Guidebook takes the view that all banks should look to global best practices for RPTs
beyond minimal compliance requirements set down in laws, regulations and accounting
standards. Therefore, practices endorsed and adopted in other jurisdictions are recommended
here, beyond Vietnam’s applicable laws and regulations.

     The Financial Stability Board states that “increasingly, governments have recognized the synergy between
     macroeconomic and structural policies in achieving fundamental policy goals. Corporate governance is one key
     element in improving growth and ensuring market integrity and financial stability”.

It is important to note that the global banking standards setter, the Basel Committee for
Banking Supervision (BCBS) sets the tone for national regulations in the banking industry. The
BCBS issued its Corporate Governance Principles for Banks in July 2015 and these are the
starting point with regard to corporate governance in banks. About RPTs, it states:

     “the board should ensure that transactions with related parties (including internal group
     transactions) are reviewed to assess risk and are subject to appropriate restrictions (e.g.
     by requiring that such transactions be conducted on arm’s length terms) and that
     corporate or business resources of the bank are not misappropriated or misapplied.”6

It also devotes several paragraphs7 to how the board should deal with conflicts of interest;
RPTs are considered to be a conflict of interest under the BCBS Corporate Governance Principles
(see also section 3.2).

1.5. Principles v rules approach
When developing regulations, some jurisdictions take a high-level approach applying broad
principles in order to address and regulate RPTs. The UK, Canada and Australia follow this path.
Asia generally, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore have formulated more specific rules to
control RPTs. No matter the approach, the end goal is the same – to identify related parties
and their transactions, to ensure they are not abusive to the bank or its stakeholders and will
not distort financial information provided to investors.

1.6. Structure and notes on terminology
Sections of the text describe in detail issues in RPTs and give rise to recommendations which
are summarised in Table 2 for ease of reference.
Different terms are applied in different jurisdictions to refer to RPTs. Singapore uses the term
‘interested person transactions’. Hong Kong uses the term ‘connected persons’ transactions’.
UK and Malaysia use ‘related party transactions’. Australia explains the term as ’transactions
with persons in position of influence’. In this Guidebook, the terms ‘related parties’ and ‘related
party transactions’ are used.
Where this Guidebook mentions a ’board’, or ‘board of directors’, ‘directors’ or ‘members of the
board’, the text should also apply to members of the Members’ Council of banks, to those with
governance responsibilities in state-owned banks, members of the Supervisory Board, and all
directors, executive or non-executive, alternate, nominee or shadow directors8. Also the term
‘ban kiem soat’ has been translated variously into English as the Supervisory Board, The Control
Board or the Inspection Committee. This Guidebook will use the term Supervisory Board.

1.7. General rules for related party transactions
Experience has shown time and again that RPTs have the potential to be unfair or
abusive to the extent that in some jurisdictions they are very heavily regulated, or are so heavily
scrutinized that a RP will choose, in principle, not to conduct any business with the bank even
if permitted.
Conflicted situations challenge the ability of the decision maker to act objectively in the best
interests of the bank. All bank related parties and their transactions with the bank should be
beyond reproach and even the appearance of conflict avoided. Because of the capacity of one

     A ‘shadow director’ is defined in UK Company Law, in the Australian Corporations Act and in Malaysian Company
     Law, as a person who is not validly appointed as a director but acts as a director and / or is one whose wishes directors
     customarily act in accordance with. In these jurisdictions, a shadow director is thus held liable as director.

party to control or influence the transaction, RPTs are always viewed as possibly conflicted and
for this reason should be subject to rigorous review if they are to be approved.


    Recommendation 1
    Related party transactions are always viewed as situations which are open to possible
    conflict of interest and should be subject to rigorous review.


In many jurisdictions, RPTs are considered so important that regulators have prohibited RPTs
with the bank and/or many related parties choose to do their banking with other institutions
rather than their own so they cannot be called into question if they have repayment issues. A
RPT that is classified or subject to restructuring sets a very poor ‘tone at the top’ and is a poor
example to other creditors. It also should call into question the continuing role of the RP with
the bank. Such situations reduce public trust in those governing the bank.
To protect the bank, its assets and its stakeholders, it is expected that if there is a RPT, it should
be made on an arm’s length basis, on terms and conditions not more favourable than transac-
tions with non-related parties under similar circumstances. All RPTs should be identified and
reported monthly to the board, or its designated committee for review. All material RPTs should
be subject to strict review and (dis)approval processes and publicly disclosed.


    Recommendation 2
    All transactions with the bank should be on arm’s length terms and conditions. All RPTs if
    they occur, should be subject to strict review and (dis)approval processes and publicly
    disclosed.


In Asia, because of the prevalence of controlling owners including family and state sharehold-
ers, and because of the relationship nature of business activities, RPTs in banks may occur.
Owners and bank board directors worldwide have moved to tighten requirements concerning
identification, approval and disclosure of RPTs and some regulators have prohibited certain
types of transactions9. Regulators have been tightening enforcement of regulations on RPTs
and COI. Any RPT that is classified or leads to a loss for the bank should also have serious
consequences for the related party and his/her standing or position in the bank and lead to
an evaluation of control factors.




9   France prohibits loans to directors and managers or guarantees for their benefit. In a similar vein in India, Malaysia,
    Singapore, Thailand and Korea company laws or their equivalent prohibit these RPTs.

  Recommendation 3
  Any transaction with a related party of the bank should be beyond reproach and where
  possible even the appearance of a conflict of interest should be avoided. If a RPT does lead
  to classification or a loss is incurred, the bank should evaluate control factors, review the
  standing of the related party within the bank and the bank’s position on the transaction
  itself.


If a bank’s owners or directors are determined to improve the management and disclosure of
RPTs, first they should analyse the current situation within the bank, note the gaps between
this and good practice regarding RPTs and establish a well-resourced, board-approved plan
for change. The plan should include establishing a framework of systems, structures, policies,
procedures and controls within the bank for RPTs. The framework aims at transparent
management of relationships and transactions that may be detrimental to the interests of the
bank. Banks should establish internal identification, approval and monitoring processes, in
addition to regulatory requirements, and should publish information on these practices on
their website.


  Recommendation 4
  Commercial banks should undertake a gap analysis between current bank RPT practices,
  practices required by Vietnam law and regulation, and RPT good practices as presented
  in the next parts of this Guidebook and develop a plan for improvement. The RPT
  framework should include systems and structures, policies, procedures and controls for
  RPTs. The framework should be approved by the board, well resourced, published and
  reported on to stakeholders.

Part 1 - Frequently asked questions
1.1 Q - Why are RPTs the subject of so much scrutiny by bank stakeholders and by the boards of
banks?
1.1 A - Several studies have shown that when banks have a large proportion of RPTs, the margin
on loans may be very favourable to the borrower and the risk of default to the bank is much
higher (in some extreme cases more than 70 per cent of the total) than on loans to unrelated
parties10. This level of default can destroy a bank. For example, a study of Bangladeshi Banks
after privatization indicates that the greater number of RPTs coincides with other evidence of
weak corporate governance and a higher incidence of fraud in the bank11.
1.2 Q - Does this Guidebook supersede any Vietnam laws and regulations?
1.2 A - No. All Vietnam laws and regulations continue to apply. This Guidebook explains better
CG practices in RPTs that are expected of banks striving to contain and manage RPTs transpar-
ently.

                        bank RPT practices, practices required by Vietnam law and regulation,
                        and RPT good practices as presented in the next parts of this Guidebook.
 General Rule      4    They should develop a plan for improvement. The framework should
                        include systems and structures, policies, procedures and controls for RPTs.
                        The framework should be approved by the board, well resourced,
                        published, and reported on to stakeholders.
                        All banks in Vietnam should develop and adopt their own strong defini-
                        tion of ’related parties’ which meets at least the collective minimum of
                        the following key instruments - the Law on Enterprises, the Law on Credit
                        Institutions, securities regulations and IAS 24, and which goes beyond
                        minimal regulatory requirements.
                        A definition of related parties should include clarity on the following
 Related                persons and their interests:

Topic                 RECOMMENDATIONS

                      The board should understand its role in dealing with RPTs, including:
                      i.   oversee the establishment, approval and communication of a policy
                           on RPTs;

                      Management should implement the board approved RPT policy and
                      ensure adequate policies, procedures and controls are established to
                      support the policy. Senior management may approve RPTs under a de

                      accountable for the implementation of the RPT policy, and report on it
                      to the board.

                      The board appointed committee of independent directors should work
                      closely with:

                           RPTs are fulfilled;
                      ii. internal audit function to ensure RPT policies and processes are

                           financial statements.

                      of RPTs and compliance, internal audit and external audit are key to a
                      robust RPT system.

Topic                   RECOMMENDATIONS

                        All related parties should be identified and required to provide
                        detailed disclosures on their interests and on their related parties’
                        interests. The bank should keep a database of this information. The
                        information should at least include:
RP interests in-        i.   Name of the person or related party
                   20   ii. Person or entity they are related to
formation
                        iii. Description of the nature of the relationship
                        iv. Description of their interests
                        v. Description of any transactions with the bank
                        vi. Date of the completion of the declaration.


                        Banks should establish in the RPT policy, transaction bands for:
                        i   RPTs below the de minimis level where ex ante management (dis)
                            approval is required but no ex ante board review and approval is
                            required; ex post board reporting and approval is still required.
                        ii  the level of RPT at which ex ante board (dis)approval is required and
Thresholds                  which is set at between the de minimis level and a percentage of
for RPTs           21       owners’ equity (recommended to be up to 3.0% of owners’ equity as
approvals                   per the latest financial statements reviewed or audited by the
                            external auditors);
                        iii the level of RPT where ex ante shareholder (dis)approval is required
                            at a percentage of owners’ equity (recommended to be at or above
                            3.0% of owners’ equity as per the latest financial statements
                            reviewed or audited by the external auditors).

                        RPT review and approvals processes should be established which
                        consider non-material and material transactions for board approval and
                        also for shareholder approval and reporting.
RPT (dis)               Processes should be established to include:
approvals          22   i.   (dis)approvals processes;
processes               ii. aggregation of transactions;
                        iii. recurrent RPTs; and
                        iv. incorporation of any other regulatory commercial bank limits,
                             including those set for total limits allowable for all RPTs.

                        RPT policy should incorporate requirements for:
                        i.  published information; and
                        ii. documentation of the review and (dis)approvals process.

documents
                        special provisions for approval should apply and require a review by

The next steps in development of a framework for managing RPTs are to:
    •     define related parties;
    •     identify related parties;
    •     identify the transactions between RPs or between the bank and RPs;
    •     ensure the transactions are not negative to the bank’s interests;
    •     establish a review/approval process; and
    •     make the RPTs transparent through comprehensive disclosure.
An understanding of each step is required.

3.1. Who or what are related parties (RPs)?
In identifying ‘related parties’, the goal is to define it broadly so as to capture all persons, entities
and their business interests who may be perceived to have some potential or actual COI or
some power, authority or influence, direct or indirect, in a transaction which may potentially
be to the detriment of the bank.
Related parties refer to a body corporate, other entity or organization or natural persons in
two groups, those that are:
    i.    related to the bank or financial institution because of an ownership interest; and
    ii.   related otherwise, including directors, senior officers and close family members and
          their business interests, who may also have some other interest in the bank.
These parties or their transactions with the bank should then be subject to particular policies
and procedures to ensure independent scrutiny and determination by non-interested parties
to ensure the interests of the bank are not compromised.
Definitions of ‘related parties’ vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and across various sources
of standards. Therefore, banks should clearly define ‘related parties’, within the confines of
existing laws and regulations, so all may know who are the individual bank’s related parties.
The globally accepted minimum for a related party definition is stated in the International
Accounting Standard, IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures. This standard is not identical to VAS 26
Related Party Disclosures or the definition in the Law on Credit Institutions; IAS 24 is more rig-
orous. Globally, application of IAS 24 is expected as a minimum.

A related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial
statements (in this Standard referred to as the ‘reporting entity’).
(a) A person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a reporting entity if
    that person:
    (i)   has control or joint control over the reporting entity;
    (ii) has significant influence over the reporting entity; or
    (iii) is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a
          parent of the reporting entity.
(b) An entity is related to a reporting entity if any of the following conditions applies:
    (i) The entity and the reporting entity are members of the same group (which means
        that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others).
    (ii) One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or
         joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member).
    (iii) Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.
    (iv) One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate
         of the third entity.
    (v) The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of
        either the reporting entity or an entity related to the reporting entity. If the
        reporting entity is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related
        to the reporting entity.
    (vi) The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a).
    (vii) A person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member
          of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity).
A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between a
reporting entity and a related party, regardless of whether a price is charged.
Close members of the family of a person are those family members who may be expected
to influence, or be influenced by, that person in their dealings with the entity and include:
(a) that person’s children and spouse or domestic partner;
(b) children of that person’s spouse or domestic partner; and
(c) dependants of that person or that person’s spouse or domestic partner.

     In Vietnam, the Law on Credit Institutions, Article 4.28 defines related parties as:
     organisations, individuals having a direct or indirect relationship with other organizations
     that fall in one of the following:
     a)   Mother company with its subsidiaries and vice versa; credit institution with its
          subsidiaries and vice versa; subsidiaries which are owned by the same mother
          company or the same credit institution with each other; administrators, members of
          the Board of Controllers of the mother company or of the credit institution, individuals
          or organizations having the authority to appoint the former with subsidiaries and vice
          versa;
     b) A company or credit institution with its administrators, members of the Board of
        Controllers or with companies, credit institutions having authority to appoint those
        administrators or members of the Board of Controllers and vice versa;
     c)   A company or credit institution with organizations, individuals who own five (5)
          percent or more of charter capital or voting shares of that company or that credit
          institution and vice versa;
     d) An individual with his / her spouse, parents, children and siblings;
     e)   A company or credit institution with individuals who fall into one of the cases
          stipulated in sub-clause d) of this Clause of administrators, members of the Board of
          Controllers, capital contributors or shareholders owning five (5) percent or more of
          charter capital or voting shares of that company or credit institution or vice versa;
     f)   Individuals who are authorized by organizations, individuals stipulated in sub-clauses
          a), b), c), d) and e) of this Clause with authorizing organizations, individuals; individuals
          who are authorized to represent the portions of capital contribution of the same
          organization with each other.


In Vietnam, the recently revised Law on Enterprises13 (LOE) also defines ‘related parties’. The
LOE is inconsistent with the definition in the Law on Credit Institutions but it includes other
elements, such as a wider definition of family members and a comprehensive definition of
who is a manager of an enterprise. Additionally, the Law on Credit Institutions is not consistent
with the definition of related parties in VAS 2614 (accounting standards) also applicable in
Vietnam. To resolve this lack of clarity, banks should adopt and publish their own definition of
related parties that encompasses all requirements of the Law on Credit Institutions, the Law
on Enterprises, securities regulations and IAS 24.

A definition of related parties should be high level and broad to capture relevant
parties and transactions that present a risk of potential abuse and which is not easily avoided
and which can be effectively enforced15. Any list of parties to be included as assumed ‘related
parties’ should not be seen as being conclusively finite as other related parties may emerge
over time. In the end, the determination of ‘related party’ is or should be determined by the
fact of an individual’s or entity’s present or future capacity or perception of capacity to control
or influence decision making at the bank.
In most jurisdictions directors, including non-executive directors, supervisory board members,
senior managers and substantial shareholders and their close family members and any
business entities connected to these parties or to the entity itself, are considered ‘related
parties’. Shareholders who can, directly or indirectly, influence 5% or more of shareholdings or
votes are considered related parties.

  Recommendation 5
  All banks in Vietnam should develop and adopt their own strong definition of ’related
  parties’ which meets at least the collective minimum of the following key instruments -
  the Law on Enterprises, the Law on Credit Institutions, securities regulations, and IAS 24,
  and which goes beyond minimal regulatory requirements.
  A definition of related parties should include clarity on the following persons and their
  interests:
      i.    Directors and Supervisory Board members;
      ii.   Senior management;
      iii. Significant shareholders;
      iv. Related entities (including companies, trusts etc); and
      v.    Family members and relatives of directors and Supervisory Board members,
            senior managers and significant shareholders.



Each of these elements needs elaboration to understand fully the collective expectations of
good corporate governance practices in respect of related parties.
i) Directors
Directors are expected to act at all times in the interests of the company, be above reproach
and avoid even the appearance of a COI. Therefore, when considering a definition of related
parties, ‘directors’ should be clearly and broadly defined.
The term ‘directors’ should be widely defined to include directors of the bank, supervisory
board directors, shadow and alternate directors, executive and non-executive directors and
directors of subsidiaries or parent entities and other related entities, and public and private
entities. It should include all persons who act in the role of a director, whether paid or unpaid.
The definition of director for related party purposes should also include any entities related to
the director in which a director has an interest, whether it is as a director, partner, as senior
management or a key administrator, agent, guarantor or as shareholder of significant influence
or control. Directors should declare any interests in other entities and transactions, including
related party interests and transactions, to the board of the bank and take no part in any
decision related to those interests.

     Recommendation 6
     When considering RPs, ‘directors’ should include all persons who act or are seen to be
     acting in the role of a director, active and influential in board decision making, whether
     or not remunerated, including Supervisory Board members.



ii) Senior management /key managers
In Vietnam, The Law on Credit Institutions defines senior managers or senior management as
‘key managers’ as follows:


     Key manager of a credit institution includes Chairman and members of the Board of
     Directors, Chairman, members of the Members’ Council, the General Director (Director)
     and other administrative positions16 as stipulated in the Charter of the credit institution.
                                                                     Law on Credit Institutions, Article 4.31


The above definition also includes family members of the first order (spouse, parents, children,
siblings) related to key managers. This definition in the Law on Credit Institutions is a narrow
interpretation and should be broadened in good practice to include close family members of
key managers to the second and third tiers (see also the section on ‘close’ family members and
Table 3 below). The definition of ‘related parties’ should include all bank senior management
and their family members, understood to be all those who can control or who can, directly or
indirectly, influence bank decision making.
In good practice the following in senior management would be ‘related parties’:
•      all management reporting to the CEO or to a board committee;
•      all members of the bank Executive Committee;
•      other senior roles such as company secretary and general counsel, CFO, COO, CRO, Head
       of Internal Audit;
•      business unit heads (which in Vietnam include heads of commercial banks from branches
       level 1 and branches level 2 or transactions officers) including Heads of Credit, Treasury,
       Human Relations, Strategy, IT; and



16
     ‘Administrative positions’ includes business unit heads (which in Vietnam include heads of commercial banks from
     branches level 1 and branches level 2 or transactions officers) including Heads of Credit, Treasury, Human Relations,
     Strategy, IT.

     VIETNAM GUIDEBOOK FOR BANKS



•      employees with significant credit approval authority or responsibilities, including
       members of the credit committee.
The definition of senior management also should capture the related interests of senior
managers / management, such as other companies or entities where the senior manager may,
directly or indirectly, control or significantly influence the entity or where they may be ultimate
beneficial shareholders.
Depending on the particular bank structure, there may be other persons who should be
designated ‘key managers/ senior managers’. De facto capacity to influence decision making
within the bank and especially significant transactions, including the determination of lending
practices would be a key criterion. Wide definitions of senior management or key administra-
tors are applied globally.17


     Recommendation 7
     RPs should include senior management and employees and their interests, those with de
     facto control, influence or decision making powers, including:
          i.    all management reporting to the CEO or to a board committee;
          ii.   all members of the bank Executive Committee;
          iii. other senior roles, such as company secretary and general counsel, CFO, COO,
               CRO, Head of Internal Audit;
          iv. business unit heads (which in Vietnam comprise heads of commercial banks from
              branches level 1 or branches level 2 or transactions officers) including Heads of
              Credit, Treasury, Human Relations, Strategy, IT; and
          v.    employees with significant credit approval authority or responsibilities,
                including members of the credit committee.


iii) Significant / major shareholders
Significant or major shareholders and shareholdings for determining RPs are usually defined
using percentage of ownership. Vietnam law provides:


     A related party is an enterprise in which “any person or company owns [shares] at a level
     entitling it to control issuance of decisions by any managerial entity in such enterprise”.18
                                                                         Law on Enterprises, Article 4.17-(g).

The Law on Enterprises is not specific as to the exact percent level of significant shareholding
and therefore of a related party. This is not unusual. Australia is in a similar position in that
there is no specific threshold of significant shareholder or shareholding but rather a ‘significant
interest’ is an interest that “has the capacity to influence the vote of a director”19. In these
circumstances, a bank would set a relevant threshold, relevant to its particular circumstances,
usually about 5% or lower.
A 5% shareholding level held either individually or by a group of related shareholders, is set
by regulators or applied by banks in the Asian region as the appropriate threshold level for
defining substantial shareholders as related parties. Singapore sets a 5% threshold. Malaysia
also sets a 5% threshold for substantial shareholders under its Companies Act.
In Vietnam, the Law on Credit Institutions, which is a higher authority for banks than the Law
on Enterprises, provides specifically that:


     In Article 4.26, a major shareholder of a credit institution means a shareholder owning
     directly or indirectly five (5) percent or more of voting shares of that joint stock credit
     institution.
     Further, related parties should include “shareholders owning five (5) percent or more of
     charter capital”20. Law on Credit Institutions, Article 4.28.c.
     Decree 59/20009/ND-CP21 also indicates a “major share level means a level of share
     accounting for 5% or more of the voting equity capital of the bank”.



It is recommended banks in Vietnam should apply the 5% specified in the Law on Credit
Institutions or a lower percentage when deeming a significant or substantial shareholder.
Banks may wish to apply a lower threshold than regulated if the bank in question seeks to be
conservative with respect of the definition of related parties and it is committed to their
identification. Such a threshold should consider in aggregate the direct shareholdings of
individual shareholders and also shareholdings held by parties (individuals, companies and
other organizations) related or connected to the shareholder which s/he can control or
significantly influence.
The Law on Credit Institutions concentrates on ‘ownership’ as the key indicator for related
parties. Global practices focus on a broader aspect of ‘control and the capacity to influence de-
cision making’ in an entity. Banks should consider the upstream shareholdings in the bank’s
parent company and in other companies within the group when seeking to clarify ‘substantial

or significant shareholders’ as a parent company has the capacity to significantly influence
decisions in its subsidiaries. Transparency of related parties in complex ownership structures,
where cross shareholdings are evident, should be considered in any RPT policy.
In Figure 2 below, shareholder group 1 represents a relatively complex ownership relationship
with a series of parent companies up to the ultimate parent company. It is important that when
considering substantial shareholders, each entity should be taken together with their
controlled companies and subsidiaries. Shareholder group 2 shows a simple relationship with
only one substantial shareholder.

In Vietnam shareholdings tend to be opaque. In determining a substantial shareholder or
shareholding of a group of companies / entities, each shareholder / entity should be taken
together with their controlled companies, subsidiaries and affiliates and should include
shareholdings held directly and indirectly through related parties. Lack of transparency of
ultimate beneficial ownership means certain related parties are not easily detected.
In many jurisdictions22, significant shareholders (those meeting the 5% threshold, including
any shares held beneficially through other parties or entities) are required to provide to the


22    Ireland, Norway, United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, Netherlands and Indonesia are among those who require this.

bank notices of their total shareholding and that of their RPs. To achieve transparency, banks
may send to all shareholders annually a simple information request on shareholdings held
directly and indirectly. Banks may include in their RPT policy the obligation of shareholders to
disclose all shareholdings held directly or indirectly.
A list of significant shareholders should be published by the bank in its annual report and on
its website. Many countries, including in Switzerland, Norway, United Kingdom, Sweden,
Netherlands and Indonesia require this information and look behind vehicles such as trusts
and nominee companies. Domestic intermediaries holding shares for another party should be
required either by law or specific bank policy to provide this information.


  Recommendation 8
  Banks should recognize as related parties all significant shareholders with the capacity to
  control or influence decision-making, including those holding or capable of influencing
  5% of shares or more, held either directly or indirectly. For transparency, significant share-
  holders with 5% or more should be compelled to provide information to the bank on
  themselves and their related parties. Groups of related shareholders holding collectively
  5% or more of shares, would also be classified as significant shareholders. Global focus is
  on those with control or the capacity to control or influence company decision making.



iv) Related entities / companies
In good practices an entity is considered to be a related party if it is a:
    •    holding / parent company;
    •    subsidiary;
    •    controlled company (also referred to as affiliate, associate, sister or fellow company);
         or
    •    jointly controlled entity.
Entities related in a group structure constitute a risk of abusive related party transactions
because one of them, directly or indirectly, has control or significant influence over the other.
Each entity in a group, a financial or non-financial company, listed or non-listed company,
public or private company, or other organization, is deemed related to the other. For example,
if the entity is a member of the same group, it means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow
subsidiary are related to the others. If one entity is an affiliate or joint venture of the other
entity or of any one entity within a group, they are considered related.
Related entities will include any subsidiary, jointly controlled entities, joint ventures, associates
and affiliates of the bank that have the capacity to control or significantly influence decision

making at the bank. Directors of related entities should be considered related parties and
senior management of the parent/holding company and should be considered related parties
if they are directly or indirectly responsible for the operations of the bank or any other group
entity operating in Vietnam.

  In Vietnam, The Law on Credit Institutions, Article 4.30 provides that a subsidiary of a credit
  institution means a company of which:
  a)   The credit institution or credit institution and its related parties own more than 50%
       of charter capital or more than 50% of voting shares; or
  b) The credit institution shall have the right to directly or indirectly appoint most of or
     all of the members of the Board of Directors, Members’ Council, or the General Director
     of the sub; or
  c)   The credit institution shall have the right to amend or supplement the Charter of the
       sub; or
  d) The credit institution and its related parties shall directly or indirectly control the
     approval of resolutions, decisions of the Shareholders’ Meeting, Board of Directors,
     Members’ Council of the sub.
                                                         Law on Credit Institutions Article 4.30



An affiliate is defined as follows:


  The Law on Credit Institutions also provides that an affiliate is “any company of which a
  credit institution or a credit institution and its related parties own more than 11% of
  charter capital or more than 11% of voting shares”. “Such company is an affiliate and not
  a subsidiary”.
                                                        Law on Credit Institutions, Article 4.29.


Therefore, the ownership threshold for affiliated companies is between 11% and 50% share-
holding and for subsidiaries over 50%.
Banks should consider and determine if the related party definition should extend to
companies in which the bank itself serves as a director, partner, executive officer, agent,
guarantor or surety. It may also apply to a single bank customer, supplier, or general agent
with whom the bank transacts a volume of business, merely by virtue of the economic
dependence that may arise.

     Recommendation 9
     Banks should include as RPs, related entities, each deemed related to the other, such as a:
          i.    holding / parent company;
          ii.   subsidiary;
          iii. controlled company (also referred to as affiliate, associate, sister or fellow
               company); or
          iv. jointly controlled entity.
     Directors and key managers of the holding company are considered related parties.
     Directors of related entities should be identified as related parties also.


v) Close family members
A key element of any definition of ‘related parties’ are ‘family relationships’. The definition should
include a broad principles based definition of family relationships assumed to be related to
key persons (directors and senior managers). It should include immediate family, both natural
and adopted, second tier family members (aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces, cousins and
in-laws) and third tier family members (grandparent, grandchildren or equivalent) and close
family associates of directors or senior managers. The OECD 2009 guide23 indicates these three
levels of family relationships should be applied.

                     Spouse (or domestic partner), brother, sister, parents, child (including adopted and

 2st Degree          Cousins, in-laws, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces

 3st Degree          Grandparent, grandchildren and others with capacity to influence

The definition of family members in the Law on Credit Institutions is narrow and limited to first
tier family members only (spouse, parents, children and siblings). It therefore is likely to exclude
many related parties who might be the source of abusive dealings with the bank. In Vietnam
Accounting Standard VAS 26 the full definition of ‘close members of the family’ as stipulated
in IAS 24 does not apply.

     A better definition may come from using the definition in IAS 24, which states:
     “close members of the family of a person are those who may be expected to influence, or
     be influenced by, that person in their dealings with the entity”.
                                                                             IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures


The key element to defining a family member hinges on the capacity of a related or connected
party to influence or be influenced by a director, Supervisory Board member, senior/key
manager or shareholder.
IAS 24 is the basis for definitions of ‘related parties’ and ‘family members’ and is applied in Hong
Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and in the United Kingdom and is recommended as a global
minimal standard for defining related parties and RPTs.

     Recommendation 10
     Close family members of directors and senior managers should be included in the
     definition of related parties and should include family relationships in the first, second
     and third degree.


vi) Other good practices in defining ‘related parties
Other good practices applied in defining ‘related parties include:
•      The board should reserve the authority to declare individuals /entities who, in the opinion
       of the board, are related parties, as it is difficult in one definition to identify all potential
       related parties.
•      Joint ventures should be included in the related party definition.
•      A definition of related parties should extend to current relevant relationships and
       relationships that would fall within the definition and/or that were in place within the last
       year.

3.2. Conflicts of interest
There is no globally accepted definition of ‘conflict of interest’ (COI), yet the term is widely used
in commercial and legal transactions, and is acknowledged in codes of ethics as a reality that
may arise at any time. COI may be defined as “the act of pursuing the interests of particular
firms or individuals at the expense of the interests of others”.24 A COI refers to a situation where
directors, senior managers, shareholders, employees or others have a direct and competing

interest which actually or potentially conflicts or may be perceived to be in conflict with the
person’s duties towards the bank. For example, a conflict may arise if a director is nominated
by a shareholder and the shareholder demands the director be loyal to the shareholder’s
interests at the expense of the prudent operations of the bank or if there are private interests
of the director that compete with the interests of the bank.
The perception of a COI also exists if an independent informed observer could reasonably
assume from the circumstances that there was a pressure or incentive (not necessarily a
financial incentive) for the director to act other than in the best interests of the company. This
is true even if there is no suggestion that the director would act in such a way – the mere
existence of a reasonable perception is sufficient.
RPTs are a specific sub-set of wider COI and should be actively discouraged.
The BCBS in its Corporate Governance Principles for Banks lays out the responsibilities of the
board regarding COI and states in paragraph 83:


  “The board should have a formal written conflicts-of-interest policy and an objective
  compliance process for implementing the policy. The policy should include:
  •   a member’s duty to avoid, to the extent possible, activities that could create conflicts
      of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest;
  •   examples of where conflicts can arise when serving as a board member;
  •   a rigorous review and approval process for members to follow before they engage in
      certain activities (such as serving on another board) so as to ensure that such activity
      will not create a conflict of interest;
  •   a member’s duty to promptly disclose any matter that may result, or has already
      resulted, in a conflict of interest;
  •   a member’s responsibility to abstain from voting on any matter where the member
      may have a conflict of interest or where the member’s objectivity or ability to properly
      fulfil duties to the bank may be otherwise compromised;
  •   adequate procedures for transactions with related parties so that they are made on
      an arm’s length basis; and
  •   the way in which the board will deal with any non-compliance with the policy.
                                     BCBS, Corporate Governance Principles for Banks, 2015.



In corporate governance, directors and managers specifically have a duty of loyalty to the
company that precludes them acting or participating in a decision, if s/he has a ‘conflict of
interest’ with the interests of the company. Directors and managers should act at all times in

the best interests of the entity and to the extent reasonably possible avoid even the perception
of a conflict of interest.


     In Vietnam in banking regulations, Decree 59 states clearly:
     “Obligations of members of the Board of Directors and the [Supervisory] Board, executive
     officers, directors of branches, transaction bureaus, subsidiaries and non-business units
     [include] the duty “to be loyal to interests of their banks; to refrain from using business
     information, know-how and opportunities of their banks, or abuse their positions, posts
     and their banks' property for self-seeking purposes or in the interest of other organizations
     and individuals or to the prejudice of their banks' interests”.25


COI is not defined in the Law on Credit Institutions. However, it is referred to in several places
and where there is a COI, the conflicted party (Board member, member of members’ Council
or or of the Supervisory Board or a General Director or key manager) should be excluded from
decision making or voting26 as a normal required practice. COI is referred to in Circular 121,
especially Chapter V.
A transaction with a related party always implies a possible COI due to the close relationship.

To help identify possible conflicts of interest and RPTs, a director or other person of control
and / or significant influence in a bank should disclose to the entity their related interests
annually and when changes occur27. Further, the bank should develop and maintain a list of
related parties in the bank in order to identify/flag transactions that require special treatment
or approvals processes.
Examples of conflicts of interest, which are NOT RPTs are when:
•      the bank as an investor places fiduciary funds in its own products;
•      the bank prefers one customer over another and neither are related parties;
•      the bank is not dealing fairly with customers or collects fees that are not disclosed, or not
       authorized by applicable law, or are unreasonable;
•      a director or senior manager receiving a gift from a company which has made an applica-
       tion for a commercial loan from the bank;
•      a bank director taking up a senior management or advisory position in another
       directly competing bank while still remaining a director of the bank; or
•      if the bank, its officer, director or employee engages in unethical behavior, such as trading
       in bank shares based on price sensitive, confidential information.


     Recommendation 11
     All bank directors and staff should avoid situations that give rise to a conflict of interest or
     a perceived conflict. They should disclose any possible conflict of interest, related parties
     and related interests annually or when changes occur. They should take no part in
     deliberations, decision making or voting on matters in which they are conflicted. RPTs are
     always viewed as subject to conflicts of interest and should be actively monitored and
     subject to specific requirements.


3.3. Related party transactions (RPTs)
Having explained what a related party is, the next step is to identify relevant RPTs and deter-
mine the (dis)approval process for the RPT accordingly.

     Vietnam Accounting Standard (VAS) 26 Related Party Disclosures, Article 05 outlines a
     related party transaction as:
     “a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a
     price is charged.”


27    Law on Credit Institutions Article 38.6 and the Law on Enterprises Article 71.1.c require this.



                                                            - 40 -
                                       Part 3. Towards a cohesive RPT framework ‐ Application of key terms



In reality, the definition of ‘a transaction’ may mean any transaction between a bank in Vietnam
or any company or entity in its bank group, and with any of the bank’s related parties. A RPT in
a bank would mean all exposures or dealings, including those dealings, such as contracts for
services, asset purchases and sales, construction contracts, lease agreements, borrowings and
write-offs. The list at 4.4.1 of this paper is indicative of transactions that could be RPTs in
Vietnamese banks. There may well be other transactions also which should be included and
treated as RPTs as the list at section 4.4.1 is not necessarily exhaustive.
These transactions would present a vast number of transactions that could be the subject of
this guidance and of review and (dis)approval processes. In particular, RPTs in a bank would
include the provision of credit, provision of payment services, lending, factoring, bank
guarantees.
To manage the large number of possible RPTs efficiently and effectively, and to ensure inform-
ative disclosure, it is normal to differentiate RPTs according to their materiality and conditions.
In an OECD review of related party transactions, “all the reviewed economies have moved from
controlling transactions to setting the general outlines of the (dis)approvals process and its
disclosure. As part of this, they have divided RPTs into those they consider benign”28 and other
larger, non-recurring material transactions. It is recommended Vietnam follow this example.
It is good practice for a regulator, or failing that a bank, to determine a materiality level, or de
minimis level, below which RPTs, individually or in aggregate, are considered immaterial,
negligible amounts and not worthy of time-consuming ex ante (dis)approval procedures.
Approved RPTs should nevertheless be reported to the bank, approved in aggregate ex post
by the board, and included in financial statements. Similar transactions with one individual or
entity should be aggregated when determining if it falls under the de minimis level.
Several countries state in their regulations thresholds for de minimis RPTs for which special,
very strict requirements need not apply, although it is expected that banks would adopt the
spirit of the requirements when conducting such transactions. Each country using this
approach has set de minimis levels differently, but many countries consider the level of
≤USD100, 000 as a de minimis level. Some consider the de minimis level as a proportion of
capital.

Vietnam regulatory guidance to date has not set a de minimis level. In the absence of this
regulation, it is recommended that each bank determine a de minimis level in absolute terms
(i.e. in set monetary amounts) for each RPT and aggregated similar RPTs with one party, below
which RPTs are exempted from ex ante (dis)approvals processes required by that bank. A set
monetary amount is easier to understand and communicate across the bank and it makes it
harder to hide RPTs and avoid bank RPT requirements.
The de minimis level should be set low so that most RPTs will be subject to individual scrutiny
by the board and subject to the ex ante (dis)approvals process. Individual banks may elect to
set a lower de minimis level for itself, lower than any level set by a regulator (if it is prescribed)
to demonstrate commitment to controlling RPTs.


  Recommendation 12
  All RPs and RPTs should be reported to the board.
  The regulator, or failing that, the bank should set a low ‘de minimis’ level for each individual
  RPT or aggregated similar RPTs with one related party, below which RPTs shall be (dis)
  approved initially by management, reported to the board and should be (dis)approved
  ex post in aggregate by the board.
  Banks should elect to set a low ‘de minimis’ level. It could be lower than any level set by a
  regulator to demonstrate commitment to controlling RPTs.

Transactions which are considered material, above the de minimis level, usually have thresh-
olds set at which diverse (dis)approval mechanisms apply. Boards have the primary role in the
(dis)approval of RPTs and shareholder (dis)approval may be required for major or even more
material transactions.
In the MENA region, because of the prevalence of RPTs and their history of abuse, shareholder
(dis)approval remains predominant and very low thresholds have been set. In Asian countries,
thresholds have been set for material RPTs requiring shareholder (dis)approval. Such material
RPTs should be subject to specific (dis) approval mechanisms and disclosure requirements. For
example, Australia uses only one benchmark. The transaction is considered substantial/material
when it exceeds 5% of the equity interests of the entity. Bursa Malaysia uses several
benchmarks. Singapore is similar to Australia and uses only one benchmark to determine
‘material transactions’, which for banks is a percentage of capital and for other non-bank
entities is a percentage of net tangible assets.


  Recommendation 13
  Material RPTs of greater significance, at or above the ‘de minimis’ threshold, should be
  subject to strict ex ante decision making and (dis)approval processes by the board and /
  or shareholders (see also Rec. 21).



3.4. Arm’s length transactions on market terms
In general, all bank transactions are expected to be conducted at arm’s length, where parties
to the transaction are well informed, dealing willingly and independently in their own best
interests, each striving for the best terms and conditions they can achieve. This would apply
to transactions with related parties as with unrelated parties. In doing so, it is assumed this
process results in a fair market value for the transaction - a fair outcome for the party and for
the bank.
For RPTs, the transaction should have no terms or conditions more favourable than would be
offered to the public in the normal course of business or which could be expected to apply in
similar transactions on the open market. This seems to be the expectation in Vietnam also.


  The Law on Credit Institutions, Article 134.2 states:
  “Contracts, transactions and other relationships between controlling companies with their
  subsidiaries, affiliates shall be established and executed fairly and independently based
  on the same conditions as those applied to independent legal entities.”

     VIETNAM GUIDEBOOK FOR BANKS



Whilst this clause above addresses only transactions between controlling companies and their
subsidiaries specifically, other transactions between related persons or entities should be
undertaken in the same spirit, at arm’s length and on market terms and conditions.
Terms and conditions encompass a whole range of possible matters which in banking would
include, but are not limited to, requirements for documentation, applicable interest rates, loan
term, collateral and guarantee requirements, loan covenants, non-performance requirements
and bad loan workouts, and amortisation schedules. All such terms and conditions should be
no more favourable than the terms and conditions applied and required of any other bank
client or counterparty for a similar loan in similar circumstances in a normal business
transaction29.
Fair market terms for RPTs are an area subject to manipulation. Determining comparable
market terms requires consideration of qualitative and quantitative characteristics such as
these listed below for RPT loans.

                            Quality information should be provided as a basis for the loan. There may well
                            be issues with the quality and reliability of the financial information provided.

                            It needs to be scrutinised even more than any other transaction; the

                            All the facts surrounding the loan, its use, repayment terms, sources of
                            repayment, normal application processes (which should not be overridden),
                            prevailing and applicable interest rates and possible future changes in these;

                            acquisition of capital assets is likely to be at a different interest rate than a
                            short term loan for working capital coverage), should be available.

                            The nature and timing of the transaction itself may give rise to different
                            pricing of loans. For example, a loan for construction and land development
 Terms and                  may be riskier in an economic downturn and so should be more highly priced
 Timing                     than similar loans established in growth periods. RPTs should be reviewed to
                            ensure the terms and conditions are not more favourable than those provided
                            to other bank clients in a similar situation and circumstances.



29    Market terms and conditions will vary according to economic conditions at the time of the loan granting, industry,
      sector, history and capacity of the client etc. So determining this is difficult but should be subject to close management
      review.

                       Capacity of the borrower to repay the loan should be scrutinised.
                       Commercial loans will require reviews of cash flows and consideration of their
    Repayment          variability in the economic climate. Interest rates may be higher for clients
                       with lower credit ratings, or those in riskier sectors. RPTs should be treated no
                       differently.



In recent times, the banking sector in Vietnam has experienced several incidents pointing to
problems in credit practices, credit quality, with relatively high levels of non-performing loans
and issues in related party lending. All boards should ensure there are established practices
for RPTs and in particular, independent loan assessment and (dis)approval processes (see also
Part 5 of this Guidebook) to ensure relative equivalence of terms and conditions with other
like transactions.
Some good practices towards achieving fair market terms and conditions include:
•      Demanding and checking quality of and full documentation for the transaction and make
       decisions predominantly based on such documents;
•      Standardisation of documentation and analysis models for RPTs of a similar nature or in a
       similar product line to ensure they are no different from normal transactions;
•      Maintenance of benchmark data for bank products and transactions to ensure compara-
       bility with normal product and transaction treatments;
•      Segmentation of client-facing roles and transaction analysis roles to reduce the possibility
       of influence (Chinese walls) and ensure an independent bank view on transaction terms;
•      Establishing a policy under which no RPT may be approved by a single individual; all RPT
       transactions are to be reviewed by a second competent person;
•      Sometimes RPTs may be negotiated by independent disinterested parties within the bank
       or external professional advisors;
•      Authorising of immaterial RPTs by senior non-conflicted management or, if material, by
       non-conflicted, independent board members or shareholders; and
•      Review of all RPTs by the bank conduct committee comprised of disinterested parties to
       ensure all transactions are authorised according to bank policies and authority levels and
       are fair to the bank.

  RPTs should be scrutinised to ensure fair market terms and conditions are applied. All
  terms and conditions of RPTs should be monitored to ensure continued application of
  normal market terms and conditions throughout the duration of the transaction.



Part 3 - Frequently asked questions
3.1 Q - Why is identification of related parties and RPTs so important in a bank?
3.1 A - It is important because RPTs have the capacity to be unfair to the bank and all other
stakeholders if they are not determined at arm’s length on normal terms and conditions. To
better manage the RPTs, the bank must know the identity of its RPs and so disclosure by key
bank personnel of their RPs is crucial to identifying possible abusive RPTs.
3.2 Q - Why is the definition of RPs in IAS 24 preferred to the application of the VAS 26 or the defini-
tion of RPs in the Law on Credit Institutions?
3.2 A - The definition of related parties in IAS 24 is broader than in Vietnam regulations and
includes a wider variety of family members as ‘close family members’. This may include aunts,
uncles and cousins and even other family members, beyond the first second and third tiers, if
they are ‘close’ to the family i.e. have the capacity to influence or be influenced in a decision.
3.3 Q - Does the Guidebook apply only to RPTs where all parties to the transaction are in Vietnam?
3.3 A - No. The principles in the Guidebook should apply to RPTs, wherever transacted and with
any parties to the transaction, even if they are cross-border.
3.4 Q - Does the Guidebook apply only to RPTs where the proposed transaction is a loan from the
bank to a RP?
3.4 A - No. The principles in the Guidebook should apply to all RPTs, whether they are loans,
Treasury dealing, deposit taking, account operating or other transactions or dealings between
the bank and the RP.
3.5 Q - If a bank has a director in common with another entity, does it mean the two entities are
‘related’?
3.5 A - Not necessarily. It would depend if this was a relationship with the capacity to influence
or control. If the entities are so interconnected that if one experienced financial difficulty and
this would affect the other’s capacity to repay in a RPT, then yes, they would be considered
‘related’.

A general framework for the governance, proper, prudent and good management of RPs and
RPTs involves:
•      establishing a clear written RPT policy including identification of RPs and with internal
       thresholds for RPT treatment;
•      articulated roles and responsibilities in RPTs assessment, management and oversight;
•      regular monitoring and review of the effectiveness of bank procedures regarding RPTs;
       and
•      reporting of RPTs to the board, to shareholders, to regulators and to the public.
RPT procedures should be developed so all RPTs may be identified, reported to the board and
referred for (dis)approval in accordance with the prescriptions of the policy.

4.1. Policy outline
In most jurisdictions, a related party transaction framework and policy is required of banks. In
its Guidelines - Corporate Governance Principles30, the Basel Committee for Banking seeks
jurisdictions to require that boards should develop, implement and monitor a formal written
policy for conflicts of interest and RPTs. It is already a requirement in Australia under Prudential
Standard SPS 521. RPT policies are also required in Ireland, Italy and India. The Bank of Mauritius
requires adherence to a basic framework to manage risks with regard to RPTs. The Monetary
Authority of Singapore requires a RPT policy to be established.


     Every bank in Singapore shall establish a policy on related party transactions and put in
     place adequate procedures to implement it, if it, or any person in its bank group, may enter
     into any related party transaction or write off any exposure to any of the bank’s related
     parties. Every bank in Singapore shall include policies on and procedures to implement
     the [requirements].

It is accepted practice that a bank should outline its RPT policy as a part its governance
framework. Applicable elements for RPTs should be included in a specific bank RPT policy
and/or any bank-shareholder agreement. The rigour of a bank’s RPT policy and its related
procedures is a signal of a bank’s commitment not to engage in abusive self-dealing. It sends
a clear message to all bank personnel and their related parties concerning the policies and
processes for handling RPTs. The policy should systematically define principles and processes
to distinguish material RPTs and the bank handling of these. It should enable the distinction
of RPTs as abnormal transactions and potentially abusive. The goal is that all RPTs should be
subject to scrutiny and not be the subject of special favour. RPT policies are expected to vary
from bank to bank; larger banks tend to have more comprehensive policies.
Examples of good RPT policies can be found at:

party transactions. The second example is from a global bank company operating across.


     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
     OCBC Bank has established policies and procedures on related party transactions. These
     include definitions of relatedness, limits applied, terms of transactions, and the authorities
     and procedures for approving and monitoring the transactions. The Audit Committee
     reviews material related party transactions and keeps the Board informed of such
     transactions, if any. Measures are taken to ensure that terms and conditions of related
     party lending are not more favourable than those granted to non-related obligors under
     similar circumstances. The Bank also complies with the SGX-ST Listing Manual on
     interested person transactions31.
                                                                                                                            OCBC, www.ocbc.com


In developing a RPT policy, the policy should be clear in its objectives, comprehensive, and
sufficiently broad in its application to capture the vast bulk of related parties and RPTs where
control or significant influence of individuals or entities may sway a decision. Clear definitions
are therefore most important.
Objectives of the RPT policy should be formulated and articulated. The board should be
accountable for the RPT policy, for approving it and should ensure its publication and appli-

cation. The policy should state the owner of the policy within the bank. The owner will be
accountable for the development and regular review of the policy and for internal contact
regarding policy matters. A RPT policy should clearly articulate roles and accountabilities for
review, (dis)approval, monitoring and disclosure of RPTs. Publication of the policy on the bank
website and on a bank intranet portal are recommended. The policy should also be forwarded
to controlled companies related to the bank for their application.


  Recommendation 15
  Every bank should develop and publish on its website a written RPT policy to deal with
  related party transactions and should incorporate as a minimum the following elements:
       i.    Policy objective
       ii.   Definitions
       iii. Policy owner
       iv. Applicability of the policy
       v.    Identification of RPs and RPTs, including thresholds and disclosure requirements
       vi. Notification, accountabilities and processes
       vii. Review and (dis)approval processes
       viii. Monitoring of RPTs
       ix. Transparency and disclosure/reporting of RPTs
       x.    Publication and promotion of the policy



4.2. Roles in RPTs
4.2.1. Bank accountability
All banking enterprises should ensure that every RPT is conducted free of conflicts of interest.
The terms and conditions shall be at arm’s length and in compliance with laws and regulation
and bank policies. Banks should establish specific policies to ensure identification, review,
(dis)approval, monitoring of RPTs and appropriate processes and systems. All RPTs should be
documented and recorded.

4.2.2. Board accountability for RPTs
Directors’ responsibilities are prescribed in the Law on Credit Institutions, the Law on Enter-
prises and in Circular 121. In respect of related party transactions, it is expected the board will:




                                                 - 49 -
 VIETNAM GUIDEBOOK FOR BANKS




  Issue internal rules on organization, management and operation of the credit
  institution in compliance with this Law and relevant laws, except for issues falling within
  the authority of the board of controllers or the general meeting of shareholders.
                                                      Law on Credit Institutions Article 63.12



  Circular 121 on corporate governance also recommends that entities take relevant
  measures regarding related party transactions and measures that will protect the lawful
  interests of parties related to the entity.
                                                              Circular 121 Articles 24 and 25.


These regulations are in line with the general duty of directors to be loyal to the bank, act in
good faith to protect the bank’s interests and to make decisions in the best interests of the
bank. In good practices, independent non-conflicted directors have a primary role in reviewing
RPTs, in the (dis)approval of material RPTs and for ensuring RPTs are well managed and
disclosed. This duty should prevent any director acting otherwise and is reflected in new
Corporate Governance Principles for Banks, issued from the Basel Committee in July 2015.


  The board should ensure that transactions with related parties (including internal group
  transactions) are reviewed to assess risk and are subject to appropriate restrictions (e.g.
  by requiring that such transactions be conducted on arm’s length terms) and that
  corporate or business resources of the bank are not misappropriated or misapplied.
                                    Corporate Governance Principles for Banks, BCBS, 2015


Board responsibilities for dealing with conflicts of interest and RPTs in banks in Singapore,
Malaysia, Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei are consistent and specific in their requirements.
Other countries such as Canada, the UK and Australia have similar provisions in this regard.
The challenge is to ensure board accountability for RPTs; for ex ante (dis)approval of material
RPTs, without the board itself becoming too involved or operating in the role of management.
The board’s approach to RPTs should remain strategic and include the following activities.

     Recommendation 16
     The board should understand its role in dealing with RPTs, including to:
          i.    oversee the establishment, approval and communication of a policy on RPTs;
          ii.   ensure disclosure of interests and RPTs by directors, senior managers and
                significant shareholders;
          iii. oversee effective testing and review of RPT policy implementation by all related
               entities, significant shareholders, directors, senior managers and their related
               parties;
          iv. ex ante, review and (dis)approve or recommend to shareholders for (dis)approval
              all material RPTs; and
          v.    oversee the establishment of systems to ensure proper management and
                reporting of RPTs, including reporting of all RPTs to the Supervisory Board and
                the external auditor.



4.2.3. Role of independent, non-conflicted directors
Independent directors32 have a central role in assisting the board to fulfil its function in
overseeing RPTs. In an OECD thematic peer review across 30 jurisdictions with in-depth reviews
of six countries’ practices for RPTs, it found that:


     “all reviewed economies with the exception of France33 make extensive use of
     independent board members to approve [RP] transactions, sometimes aided by independ-
     ent experts”.34


The definition of an independent director differs marginally from one market to another;
however, its main components remain the same. The general principle is that an independent
director should be free of links to management, controllers (major or significant shareholders,
family or state shareholders, family members), and others that could influence his / her
judgment. S/he should be capable of independent, objective judgment.
In Vietnam, the Law on Credit Institutions does not define independent directors. The Law on
Enterprises also does not define independent directors but it does recognise their use and



32
      See Appendix 1 for commonly accepted definitions of independent directors as applied by UK Corporate Governance
      Code and the International Finance Corporation.
33    In France this role is undertaken by the external auditor.

capacity for performing an oversight function and for implementation of control over the
management and operation of the company35.
The possible contribution of independent directors is recognised in Decree 5936 which states
that there should be at least two independent members of the bank board and that the
Chairman may be an independent director. Further Decree 59, in Article 22 set out below, does
indicate conditions under which directors of a credit institution may be considered
independent.


     Criteria and conditions on independence of independent members of the Board of
     Directors
     1.   Being other than those working for banks or their subsidiaries, or having worked for
          banks or their subsidiaries any time for the last 3 years.
     2.   Being other than those enjoying salaries, remunerations and other allowances paid
          by the banks in addition to amounts enjoyed by members of the Board of Directors.
     3.   Spouses, parents, adoptive parents, biological children and adopted children, and
          biological siblings of these persons who do not fall into any of the following cases:
          owning at least 5% of the voting equity capital of joint-stock commercial banks; acting
          as managers or members of the Supervisory Board of banks or their subsidiaries at
          present or any time in the last 3 years.
     4.   Being other than managers or members of the Supervisory Boards of banks at any
          time in the last 5 years; neither owning nor representing the ownership of at least 1%
          of the voting equity capital of joint-stock commercial banks.
     5.   Not joining affiliated persons defined in Clause 11, Article 5 of this Decree in owning
          at least 5% of the voting equity capital of joint-stock commercial banks.
                                                                   Decree 59/2009/ND-CP, Article 22.


This is similar but not identical to the criteria in Appendix 1. The example from the UK in
Appendix 1 are even more stringent than Article 22 above and should be considered if a bank
wishes to aspire to best practices in this respect. The UK definition has a general requirement
that the independent board member be independent in character and judgement and
excludes those with a material business relationship.
Independent members of the board, and others not conflicted in a transaction under
discussion or a party to the transaction, often form a board committee which reviews RPTs or
may use an existing board committee comprised of independent directors, or extend the role

of the audit committee if the bank has one, to review RPTs. The relevant committee should
have accountability for oversight of RPTs included in the committee charter and have specific
powers to enable this oversight. These powers would include the power to ask for and receive
in a timely manner additional reports on RPTs, additional information with regard to specific
RPTs, and the power to examine a particular deal. The committee may need to convene regular
meetings to fulfil its role in respect of RPTs.

In the one-tier board system prevalent in the UK, US, India, Singapore and many other
jurisdictions, the role of an independent reviewer of RPTs is undertaken often by the Audit
Committee of the board, comprised of independent directors. In the two-tier system as in Italy
and Chile, it is a Committee of Directors of non-interested parties, which undertakes this role.
It is essential that each member of any group undertaking this role is in fact truly independent
and not beholden to any control or significant influence that may impair judgment. Singapore
has established guidance to directors on how to manage the affairs of an audit committee in
respect of RPTs. Hong Kong Listing Rules Chapter 14 A is also most specific on accountability
for connected transactions within that jurisdiction.

      Part 4. Governance of RPTs ‐ Policy, key elements, roles, identiﬁcation of RPs and RPTs in banking



In Vietnam it is important that the board identify either a committee of the board or an audit
committee of the board, as permitted by the Law on Enterprises, comprised of non-conflicted,
independent members or securely allocate the relevant duties of oversight of RPTs to a distinct
and responsible group/committee within the board comprised of non-conflicted parties. This
group should interact with the internal audit function and the external auditor on RPT
matters.
Temporary replacements for members of the committee should be provided for in case of a
conflict of interest arising in one committee member or if there is a need for an urgent review
of a RPT. It is likely that board members who are indebted to the bank to any significant degree
would not be classified as independent directors or non-conflicted, as they may be swayed by
their indebtedness. Further, they would not appear to be independent. Board members who
may not be classified as independent directors but who may be not conflicted in a particular
transaction, may join such a sub-committee of the board to assist the review of particular
transactions. Independent advisors may also assist in the review processes for RPTs as long as
they are genuinely independent. No party to the transaction or any party related to those
interested in the transaction should participate in its deliberation.


  Recommendation 17
  Independence of directors should be robustly defined.
  Independent, non-conflicted directors should be identified and their duties and powers
  with regard to RPTs formalized in a committee charter. These directors should support
  implementation of the RPT policy, review and (dis)approval processes and have close
  interaction with the internal audit function and the external auditor who provide RPT
  assurance.


4.2.4. Role of management
There is no one simple ’fix all’ for robust treatment of RPTs. RPTs require quality policies, controls
and practices implemented by the board and management. It is management’s role to ensure
the appropriate handling of all transactions in accordance with bank approved policies and
procedures. In detail, management should fulfil the roles specified below.

       Ensure the RPT policy, established and approved by the board, is implemented and controls
  1    are in place to ensure their effectiveness and that other bank processes are aligned with the
       policy and complied with.

       Institute specific control procedures to ensure adequate RPT documentation, robust
  2    independent analysis of RPTs, appropriate application of RPT assessment policies, and
       transparent decision-making, and reporting of RPTs.

  3    Approve de minimis RPTs within their authority levels.
       Be responsible for identifying all RPTs, for appropriate handling of RPTs, and flagging
  4
       unusual and problematic transactions.

       Be required to report directly to the board committee charged with RPT oversight, any
  5    undue influence in a bank transaction by a director, senior management or significant
       shareholder

  6    Overtly support and communicate RPT policies, practices and controls to all relevant staff



Management should institute specific control procedures to ensure adequate RPT
documentation, robust analysis of the transaction, correct application of policies in the RPT
assessment, decision-making, and reporting of RPTs. This should include proof of the
assessment of de minimis RPTs. Training of senior management to support the identification,
management and disclosure processes for conflicts of interest and related party transactions
may also be required.
One group within bank management is normally allocated management responsibility for the
policy, for its implementation and for reporting on RPTs. The responsible party(s) may be any
one of the following: company secretary, the legal office, the compliance group, the corporate
governance group or corporate conduct group, the risk management function or the chief risk
officer (if one is appointed).


  Recommendation 18
  Management should implement the board approved RPT policy and ensure adequate
  policies, procedures and controls are established to support the policy. Senior
  management may approve RPTs under a de minimis level within their delegated authority
  limits. All RPTs should be reported regularly to the board or the board committee
  established for this purpose. One group in senior management should be nominated as
  accountable for the implementation of the RPT policy, and regularly report on it to the
  board.

4.2.5. Other roles – compliance, internal audit, external audit
Compliance Function
The compliance function of the bank has a role in the RPTs oversight process. It must ensure
that the process and the transactions are compliant with prevailing regulations and bank
policy, and are reported to the board and the regulator as required. The compliance function
should ensure robust systems are in place to support proper recording and tracking of RPTs.
This requires modern compliance systems, skilled, well-trained compliance staff, adequate
resources and quality IT systems. The compliance function should report to the board on
compliance with RPT regulations and bank policy.
Internal Audit
The internal audit function of the bank has a role to play in regularly reviewing and testing
RPT policies, their administration and management and assuring the board committee of
independent directors responsible for overseeing RPTs on the effective functioning of the RPT
policy. The internal audit function should report on the effectiveness of the RPT policy and its
controls directly to the independent directors accountable for RPT oversight. Any exceptions
to the policy’s application should be notified immediately and directly to the committee
responsible and concurrently to bank management. In some countries, management is
required to report any RPTs to the external auditor who will then assess the transactions and
report on them to the board.
External Audit
Under International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), the independent external auditor has
stringent requirements regarding RPTs and should specifically review RPTs when performing
an audit of financial statements and assure the bank that RPT processes are effective. This
assurance includes that RPTs have been identified, properly treated and included in the
financial statements. In twelve jurisdictions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region,
external auditors are required to review RPTs before they are reported on to shareholders at
the AGM. This is also the case in many instances in Asia – in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong,
Chinese Taipei and others.
International Standards in Auditing (ISA), as Vietnamese Standards in Auditing (VSA) are
applicable in Vietnam37. The external auditor is accountable for review of RPTs and should not
complete the audit until s/he is satisfied RPTs are included in the financial statements.




37   Circular 39 also specifies the general audit framework for credit institutions and foreign banks in Vietnam. Circular
     39 requires that if a bank receives a ‘qualified opinion’ or an exception report, perhaps for an anomaly in a RPT, then
     such a bank should select another audit firm to re-audit the issue. In global practices this is unusual. The initial
     external auditor should be accountable for assurances on RPTs and should not complete the audit until s/he is
     satisfied.

  ISA 550 states:
  The auditor has a responsibility to perform audit procedures to identify, assess and
  respond to the risks of material misstatement arising from the entity’s failure to appropri-
  ately account for or disclose related party relationships, transactions or balances in
  accordance with the requirements of the framework.
  Even if the applicable financial reporting framework establishes minimal or no related
  party requirements, the auditor nevertheless needs to obtain an understanding of the
  entity’s related party relationships and transactions sufficient to be able to conclude
  whether the financial statements, insofar as they are affected by those relationships and
  transactions:
      (a) Achieve fair presentation (for fair presentation frameworks); or
      (b) Are not misleading (for compliance frameworks).

The external auditor can provide valuable insights to the board or the audit committee on the
systems required to maintain robust RPT oversight and should be able to advise on how to set
up and develop the RPT oversight process.


  Recommendation 19
  The board appointed committee of independent directors should work closely with the:
      i.    compliance function to ensure RPTs comply with all regulatory and bank policy
            requirements;
      ii.   internal audit function to ensure RPT policies and processes are regularly
            reviewed, tested and effective; and
      iii. external auditor to ensure the effectiveness of RPT policies and processes, that
           the bank has identified all its RPs and RPTs and that all RPTs are correctly included
           in the financial statements.
  Open interaction between the board committee charged with oversight of RPTs and
  compliance, internal audit and external audit are key to a robust RPT system.

4.3. Information on related parties
4.3.1. Identification of related parties
It is important that the parties to which the policy applies are defined and clearly identified.
Each definition discussed at the beginning of this paper (see Part 3) should be applied in turn
and be the basis for identification of related parties. The following terms should be defined:
•        directors of the board;
•        directors of the supervisory board;
•        senior management;
•        managers in decision making roles;
•        major or significant shareholders holding 5% or more of shares;
•        related entities to the bank and related entities to the shareholders; and
•        other related persons and close family members of all individuals who would be
         considered related parties.
These parties should be:
•        identified by their name and their interests, shareholdings and other interests identified;
•        should be disclosed annually to the bank;
•        in a form specified by the bank; and
•        changes to these disclosures of related parties or interests should be notified immediately
         to the policy owner and to the board.
Any changes to these disclosures of interests are to be notified immediately to the policy owner
and to the board.
Individuals should be responsible for notifying the bank of changes in their interests’
disclosures and for notifying any changes in interests of close family members of which they
are aware. The legal representatives of any corporate or other entity shall disclose to the bank
any changes to their interest position.
The bank should keep a current database of interests of all related parties and their interests.
When undertaking a potential transaction, the relevant bank business units should check the
database.


    Article 39 Responsibility to publish related interests
    1.     Members of the board of management or members' council, members of the board
           of controllers, the general director (director) and deputy general director (deputy
           director) of a credit institution must publish the following information to the credit
           institution:

       (a) Name and address of head office, lines of business, serial number and date of
           issuance of business registration certificate and place of business registration of
           any enterprise or economic organization in which such person or a related person
           owns a capital contribution portion or shares in his / her/ their name or authorizes
           or entrusts another organization or individual to own in the latter's name, of five
           or more per cent of the charter capital;
       (b) Name and address of head office, lines of business, serial number and date of
           issuance of business registration certificate and place of business registration of
           any enterprise in which such person and a related person is currently a member
           of the board of management or members' council, a member of the board of
           controllers, or the general director (director).
  2.   The publication of information pursuant to clause 1 of this article and changes in
       relevant information shall be made in writing within seven (7) business days from the
       date on which the [event] occurs or the change arises.
  3.   The credit institution must [also] publish the information prescribed in clause 1 of this
       article annually to the general meeting of shareholders or members' council of the
       credit institution, and shall display and retain such information at the head office of
       the credit institution.

All banks should establish policies and procedures for recording directors, senior management,
significant shareholders and their related parties’ declarations of interests. Any change to the
interests of parties under the RPT policy should be notified immediately it becomes evident
and within 7 days as prescribed. Some countries require notification within 2 days.


  Recommendation 20
  All related parties should be identified and required to provide detailed disclosures on
  their interests and on their related parties’ interests. The bank should keep current a
  database of this information. The information should at least include:
       i.    Name of the person or related party
       ii.   Person or entity they are related to
       iii. Description of the nature of the relationship
       iv. Description of their interests
       v.    Description of any transactions with the bank
       vi. Date of the completion/update of the declaration.

4.4. Related party transactions in banking
4.4.1. Types of related party transactions in the banking sector
The scope of transactions that fall under RPT rules should be broad. It should essentially include
all exposures or dealings. It should include contracts for services, asset purchases and sales,
construction contracts, lease agreements, borrowings and write-offs, whether or not entered
into in the ordinary course of business or whether entered into directly or indirectly. VAS 26.19
includes a list of examples of RPTs. An indicative, but not necessarily exhaustive, list for banking
transactions is provided below.

The goal is to identify all bank transactions that are RPTs and then to ensure they are not
abusive or detrimental to the bank. The transactions systems in a bank should be constructed
to enable the matching of identified individuals and their RPs and entities with any relevant
transactions they or their entities may undertake.

Interbank transactions are a normal part of banking. However, over time they may operate to
expose the bank to RPTs due to the closeness of relationships between particular banks or
particular bank personnel. These transactions should be monitored in a similar manner as RPTs.

Part 4 - Frequently asked questions
4.1 Q - What lending is subject to the recommendations of the Guidebook?
4.1 A - The Guidebook captures loans, quasi-loans and any credit transaction which results in
an exposure or potential exposure, including guarantees.
4.2 Q - Do RPTs include bank credit card debt and overdrafts?
4.2 A - Yes.
4.3 Q - Is the external auditor considered a RP?
4.3 A - No. The external auditor is not considered a ‘related party’ as under the auditor’s
professional standards and regulations, s/he is prohibited from holding any significant financial
stake (including loans) with any entity they audit.

5.1. RPTs initial issues
Prior to (dis)approval, each RPT should be reviewed and assessed to ensure protection of bank
assets and of bank interests. The list of required information in Table 11 below is by no means
exhaustive but it does include sufficient information to help identify any possible abusive
issues in RPTs.

5.1.1. Documentation
All RPTs should be documented fully. International Accounting Standard IAS 24 -Related Party
Disclosures requires certain information should be disclosed to the market when a RPT is
entered into and serves as a starting point for RPT information. Table 11 outlines the minimum
information that should be provided to the review process and required prior to (dis)approval.

5.1.2. Parties to the transaction
It is important to identify the parties to either side of the transaction. In RPTs with entities with
complex shareholding arrangements, it is important to identify all the details of inter-company
or cross shareholding relationships. Identification of ultimate controlling shareholders and
details of offshore subsidiaries or parties to the transaction is necessary.
It is important to consider if all conflicted parties have been identified and ensure they are not
participating in the transaction, not advising or voting on the transaction. This may require
some investigation of family and business relationships and regarding private entities.

5.1.3. Consideration of assets as part of the transaction
Assets may be offered as part of a transaction as collateral or may be the subject of a loan. An
understanding of the asset itself, its position, location and transferability is necessary. Details
of the parties who own the asset, including a copy of the deed of ownership should be
reviewed. Legal access and practical access to the asset should be clarified.
If an asset is part of a transaction, its value should be independently verified using the bank
methodology provided. Property and equities can be difficult to value. The credentials of the
valuer should be carefully scrutinised and recorded. Current market conditions and market
prices should be used as comparatives for applying market terms and conditions.

5.2. Thresholds for review/(dis)approval processes
Review and (dis)approval of RPTs remains a key shareholder protection issue. Regulatory
approaches globally vary widely (see also earlier discussion at 3.3). Nevertheless, decision
making with regard to RPT (dis)approvals should be clearly articulated. In most jurisdictions,
the board is responsible for taking decisions regarding material RPTs. In regions where there
is a large number of RPTs in any one entity, where the board may be influenced by controlling
shareholders (families or state shareholders), or where there is history of RPTs that contribute
a large amount to non-performing loans, or where regulatory monitoring and enforcement is
not strong, even more prescriptive approaches and mechanisms have emerged as good
practices which take into account materiality and conditions of transactions. In Asia, Singapore,
Malaysia, Hong Kong and Thailand have adopted this approach.
As described in section 3.3 earlier, RPTs can be distinguished between those transactions which
are immaterial and have a relatively negligible impact on the bank and those which are
material and of greater significance and impact. For these immaterial transactions, (dis)
approvals and reporting processes can be reduced. Transactions below the de minimis level
should be required to be (dis)approved in the normal course of bank management, adhering
to bank policies, processes, and delegated authorities, reported to the board in aggregate
terms monthly for ex post approval and reported to shareholders annually in the financial
statements.

5.2.1 Setting Review/Approvals Thresholds – material transactions
In Vietnam the Law on Credit Institutions provides that is a duty and power of the board:


  To approve contracts between the credit institution and subsidiary companies or affiliated
  companies of the credit institution; contracts between the credit institution and members
  of the board of directors or Control Board, the general director (director), major sharehold-
  ers or their related persons which are equivalent to twenty (20) percent or more of the
  charter capital of the credit institution as recorded in its most recent audited financial
  statements or at a smaller specific percentage if stipulated in the charter of the credit
  institution. In this case, the relevant member shall not be entitled to vote.
                                                      Law on Credit Institutions Article 63.10



Further shareholders have the capacity to determine bank trading contracts as follows:


  To decide on the bank's trading contracts neither banned nor restricted under the Law on
  Credit Institutions, the Law Amending and Supplementing a Number of Articles of the
  Law on Credit Institutions and guiding documents with members of the Board of Directors
  and Control Board, the Director General, shareholders holding major shares and their
  related persons, which are equivalent to 20% of the bank's own capital or less or another
  lower ratio stated in the bank charter. In this case, related members have no voting
  right.
                                                        Decree 59/20009/ND-CP, Article 46.9


In the regulations cited above, the additional emphasis has been added by this author to draw
attention to the fact that a lower threshold than that which is required by laws and regulations
may be set by individual banks in their bank RPT policy for (dis) approvals by the board or by
shareholders.
The materiality thresholds set in the Law on Credit Institutions and in Decree 59 for board
approval and shareholder (dis)approval respectively, are relatively high when compared to
thresholds set in other countries and the setting of a lower threshold for board (dis)approvals
of RPTs is recommended. It is recommended that a bank in its RPT policy voluntarily set a lower
threshold.
The Law on Enterprises also requires that:

     Contracts and transactions between the company and the following parties must be
     approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders or the Board of Directors:
     (a) Shareholders or authorized representative of shareholders holding more than ten (10)
         per cent of the ordinary shares of the company and their related persons;
     (b) Members of the Board of Directors, CEO and their related persons;
     (c) Enterprises stipulated in article 159.2 of this Law.
                                                                              Law on Enterprises, Article 162.1


In any event in Vietnam a contract or a transaction with board members, the CEO and their
related parties and related entities must be approved by the shareholders’ meeting or board
of directors.
Transactions requiring board approval should be those of a value above a fixed de minimis
amount and below a value of a set percentage of capital, at or above which shareholder (dis)
approval is required. The threshold should be set relative to the risk to the particular entity and
the risks arising from the nature, scope, frequency and value associated with RPTs. In setting
particular thresholds, banks should also consider global good practices and the degree to
which it wishes to protect shareholder interests.

      than a % of assets or turnover commonly used by non financial institutions.

The regulations in Singapore specify upper limits. Within these upper limits, individual banks
are required to set threshold limits for (dis)approval processes for RPTs and notify these limits
to the regulator (see MAS 643 below). Singapore specifically distinguishes limits for RPT
exposures for a particular RP group e.g. RPTs which, in aggregate, give an exposure to an RP
group of at or above 2% of capital must be approved by the board.


  13 A bank in Singapore shall –
  (a) set separate materiality thresholds on an aggregate basis for each type of related
      party transaction where an exposure arises (e.g. mortgages, unsecured lending and
      trade finance facilities) with each related party group;
  (b) take into account the nature, scope, frequency, value of and risks associated with its
      related party transactions in setting the aforesaid materiality thresholds;
  (c) report the materiality thresholds set, and any changes thereto, to the Authority in the
      ‘Additional Information’ section of its quarterly statements submitted pursuant to MAS
      Notice 639A “Exposures and Credit Facilities to Related Concerns”; and
  (d) where any of the materiality thresholds is exceeded, immediately report the fact that
      the threshold has been exceeded to its board or (in the case of a bank incorporated
      outside Singapore) the authorised person.

     A bank in Singapore shall provide its justification for the materiality thresholds set
     pursuant to paragraph 13(a) to the Authority, upon the Authority’s request. The Authority
     may direct a bank in Singapore to reduce any materiality threshold where the Authority
     is of the opinion that it is inappropriate, taking into consideration the factors set out in
     paragraph 10 (a).
                                             Excerpt from Monetary Authority of Singapore, MAS 643



For Vietnam, it is recommended that independent directors or non-conflicted persons on the
board of a bank review current RPT practices and recommend to the board to include in its
RPT policy thresholds for RPT (dis)approvals, including a threshold for RPTs requiring board
(dis)approval by non-conflicted directors.
It is suggested that the threshold for board (dis)approval threshold should be for all RPTs up
to a value of 3.0% of owners’ equity40. Similar transactions with an individual relevant party or
his / her related parties should be aggregated when applying the 3.0% level for board (dis)
approval. Boards may also set thresholds for aggregate exposures to related party groups
above which board (dis)approval is always required.
It is also recommended that all transactions with RPTs at or above the threshold of 3.0% of
owners’ equity and those RPTs required by law/ regulations, should be reviewed and
recommended by the board prior to ex ante (dis)approval by a majority of non-interested
shareholders.
The level of 3.0% of owners’ equity has been suggested for Vietnam given the relative problems
and incidence of RPTs evident in Vietnam and the level and quality of bank controls around
credit assessment and due diligence. In addition, the average capitalisation of Vietnamese
banks, the relative size of RPTs that might occur and that should be (dis)approved through
formal board or shareholder processes, and the relative risks associated with related party
groups in Vietnam in order to protect bank and minority shareholder interests all indicate that
a relatively low threshold is appropriate.
RPTs requiring board approval complements a requirement for shareholder (dis) approval.
Shareholder (dis)approval is generally limited to those RPTs either required for shareholder
(dis)approval by law and other applicable regulations, such as all transactions between the
bank and a board member or the CEO, and all large RPTs. For clarity, it is recommended that
every bank in Vietnam establish thresholds above which it determines a RPT is considered
material and therefore should be subject to (dis)approval of non-conflicted, non-interested
shareholders. This threshold is recommended to be at or above 3.0% of owners’ equity.

The concept of materiality for setting RPT thresholds for (dis)approval processes should not
only consider setting numeric thresholds but also should consider the circumstances of the
RPTs. Although some RPTs may appear to be less than a certain threshold, a materiality test
may prove that they are material to one or more related counter-parties and as such might be
submitted for either (dis)approval of the board or shareholders. Generally, it is accepted that
information is material if its omission or misstatement could influence economic decisions of
users.


     Recommendation 21
     Banks should establish in the bank’s RPT policy, transaction bands for:
          i)    RPTs below the de minimis level where ex ante management approval is required
                but no ex ante board review and approval is required; ex post board reporting
                and approval is still required;
          ii)   The level of RPT at which ex ante board (dis)approval is required and which is set
                at between the de minimis level and a percentage of capital (recommended to
                be up to 3.0% of owners’ equity41);
          iii) The level of RPT where ex ante shareholder (dis)approval is required at a percent-
               age of owners’ equity (recommended to be at or above 3.0% of owners’ equity).


In good practices and for transparency, thresholds set by a bank in its RPT policy should be
reported to the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), and made public on the company website. The
SBV may request the bank to justify the threshold levels it sets.

5.2.2. Transactions of minor importance – below a de minimis level
A de minimis amount should be set for insignificant transactions, either individual transactions
or for transactions with one related party in aggregate. Transactions below this de minimis
level should be approved ex ante by senior management, recorded and monitored and ex post
reported to the board. See also discussion at 3.3.
The board may delegate to non-interested parties in senior management such as the credit
review committee, the capacity to approve RPTs below a de minimis level. Nevertheless, all
relevant information should be provided to the decision maker (see Table 11). Any approval
process should include the provision of full documentation to the process, a review of the
terms and conditions of the transaction, including those related to loan term, interest rates,
fees, collateral where applicable, and any write off policy related to the RPT.


41    This threshold has considered factors such as the average level of capitalisation of Vietnamese banks, likely levels of
      transactions the bank would wish to control, and the desire to limit RPTs and to ensure transparency. Banks may
      always determine a lower level than this recommended threshold.

Management approved RPTs should be reviewed periodically by the independent board
committee responsible for RPT oversight. The board or the board committee should require it
receives regular monthly reports on RPTs and then should approve these transactions ex post
to ensure board accountability for all RPTs. The status and aggregate credit exposure to each
related party and any write-offs on RPTs that occur, should be monitored. In their RPT policy,
banks should also set limits for total exposures to any individual RP or group of related RPs,
either in one transaction or in aggregate (see 5.2.6).

5.2.3. Board (Dis)approval process for material transactions
Material RPTs should be subject to ex-ante review and (dis)approval by either the board or
shareholders, and be subject to additional reporting requirements. Any person with a conflict
of interest, or who is a participant or beneficiary of the RPT, should not participate in the
discussion or any decision regarding the RPT and should not vote to determine it.
Board (dis)approval for material related party transactions should be after review by the
independent board committee, perhaps an audit committee, charged with RPT review
responsibilities. In 65% of countries reviewed by the OECD42 for RPT practices, board (dis)
approval or decision is normally after a recommendation of the board committee charged with
their scrutiny, a committee of non-interested, independent members. The board committee
of independent non-conflicted directors should review all documentation and the terms and
conditions of a RPT and make a clear recommendation to the board for its approval or not.
In Vietnam where audit committees are not prevalent, the review process preliminary to a
board decision by disinterested parties should be allocated to a committee formed for the
purpose, comprised of independent directors of the board and/or independent non-conflicted
members of the board. This group designated to review and recommend RPTs should be
comprised of competent and skilled directors, with adequate time for a full review of the
relevant RPTs, and who are demonstrably independent and not conflicted.

5.2.4. Shareholder (dis)approval process for material transactions
In Vietnam shareholder review and approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders is required
for RPTs above a value of 20% of charter capital. It is the recommendation of this Guidebook
(see 5.2.1 above and Recommendation 21) that a significantly lower threshold for shareholder
approval be set in the RPT policy. Shareholder approval of RPTs is also required by law or
regulation for RPTs with board members, supervisory board members, the CEO and senior
managers.

     the credit institution as recorded in its most recent audited financial statements or at a
     lower percentage if stipulated in the charter of the credit institution between the credit
     institution [on the one hand] and a member of the board of management or [Supervisory
     Board members], the general director (director), a major shareholder or a related person
     of a manager, of a member of the board of controllers or of a major shareholder; and a
     subsidiary company or affiliated company of the credit institution.

Further Decree 59 Article 41.2.l requires the Shareholders’ Meeting:


     To decide on the bank's trading contracts neither banned nor restricted under the Law on
     Credit Institutions, the Law Amending and Supplementing a Number of Articles of the
     Law on Credit Institutions and guiding documents with members of the Board of Directors
     and [Supervisory Board], the Director General, shareholders holding major shares and their
     affiliated persons, which are valued at more than 20% of the bank's own capital or another
     lower ratio stated in the bank charter. In this case, involved shareholders have no voting
     right. A contract or transaction is approved when shareholders representing at least 65%
     of the total number of remaining votes so agree.



Article 23.4 in the Circular 121 on corporate governance also demands that any loan or
guarantees to members of the board or members of the supervisory board or to executive
director or other managers shall be decided by the Shareholders’ Meeting.
In order to better control RPTs in Vietnam, it is recommended that a lower threshold for ex ante
shareholder consideration of material RPTs, lower than 20% of charter capital, be set by
individual banks, as allowed by the Law on Credit institutions43. The recommended level for
shareholder approval of RPTs should be established at a low level, recommended at or above
3.0% of owners’ equity. In Vietnam, shareholder (dis)approval of RPTs requires a vote of 65% of
shareholders for transactions above 20% of capital. Shareholder approval should be prior to
the enactment of the transaction. In a shareholder vote to (dis) approve RPTs, related parties
or interested / conflicted parties should not vote.
Shareholders if they are to consider RPTs should have sufficient information to enable
judgment for (dis)approval. In good practices, information (see also Documentation in section
5.4.2) for such decisions should be comprehensive and should include:

Figure 6 above indicates that all RPTs will be approved, or recommended, by the board either
ex post or ex ante. Some even larger and more material transactions will require shareholder
approval.

5.2.5. Aggregated transactions
Similar transactions with one related party and / or a related entity should be aggregated,
treated as if they are one transaction when applying materiality thresholds, even if individual
transactions are below the de minimis level. This requirement is applicable in order to
discourage individuals and entities from splitting RPTs into a series of small transactions. In
some jurisdictions, all transactions with one related party transacted over a period of one year
are required to be aggregated.


                                             - 74 -
                                                             Part 5. RPT Review and Approvals Process



Information to enable the aggregation of RPTs does require quality data input into robust
trading and aggregation systems, thus enabling review by the compliance function and
transparency on RPTs.

5.2.6. Total limits on transactions with related parties
Notwithstanding the de minimis and materiality thresholds set in an RPT policy, banks normally
also have a limit on the total credit provision they may provide to a single counterparty and
his / her related parties.


    In Vietnam, the Law on Credit Institutions provides:
    Limits on extension of credit
    1.     The total balance of extension of credit to a single client shall not exceed fifteen (15)
           per cent of own capital of the commercial banks, foreign bank’s branches, people's
           credit funds or micro-finance institutions; the total outstanding credits provided to a
           single borrower and her / his related persons shall not exceed twenty-five (25) per
           cent of own capital of commercial banks, foreign bank’s branches, people's credit
           funds or micro-finance institutions.
                                                           Law on Credit Institutions Article 128.1


In summary for commercial banks in Vietnam:
•        Maximum total extension of credit to one single client shall not exceed 15% of bank
         capital;
•        Maximum total extension of credit to one single client including its RPs shall not exceed
         25% of bank capital.
Vietnam’s regulation is similar in style to practices in other countries. However, there is nothing
to prevent a bank in its own RPT policy determining a lower limit of total commitment to a
particular RP if it wishes to be more conservative. It may also choose to determine a total limit
to all RPTs the bank undertakes at any one time.
In Malaysia, the additional limits for total exposures to RPs are that exposures to related parties
shall not exceed 100% of the bank’s total capital or 25% of the total outstanding credit
exposures, whichever is the lower.
In Ireland, additional limits to related party transactions provide that in total all RPTs with all
related parties, individuals plus entities, shall not exceed 15% of the bank’s total funds.

      Recommendation 22
      RPT review and (dis)approval processes should be established which consider
      non-material and material transactions for board (dis)approval and also for shareholder
      (dis)approval and reporting.
          Processes should be established to include:
          i.    approvals mechanisms;
          ii.   aggregation of transactions;
          iii. approval of recurrent transactions; and
          iv. incorporation of regulatory commercial bank limits, including those set for total
              limits allowable for all RPTs.



5.3. Criteria for approval
In the pre-approval process, management should ensure that the following issues are
addressed.
The review process should include that the RPT:
i.      is in the interest of the bank itself and beneficial to the bank;
ii.     has a sound business purpose for the RP and is in the ordinary business of the bank;
iii. counterparty is clearly identified, including challenges presented through cross
     shareholdings and opacity of beneficial shareholders;
iv. is with a party (an RP) that has the paying capacity to service the debt as structured and
    agreed;
v.      is on terms and conditions not more favourable than any other similar transaction in
        similar circumstances, suitable and substantively correct, including all contractual terms
        related to fees, disbursements, collateral and write offs;
vi. if it is part of a set of more complex transactions, that they have a sound business purpose
    and the bank’s interests are not impacted by the complexity of associated transactions;
vii. has been fully documented, appraised by non-interested bank staff;
viii. has been independently valued and financial projections rigorously checked;
ix. is the result of substantive, independent bank oversight to protect the bank’s
    interests;
x.      recognizes the size and impact of all the related party’s interests in the transaction;



                                                  - 76 -

xi. provisions, limits, any guarantees and collateral are adequate for the bank’s protection;
xii. cross border impacts in the transaction have been fully investigated and understood;
xiii. recognizes the impact of the RPT on the bank and the impact is within the bank’s own risk
      appetite and framework;
xiv. has been identified and correctly classified as a material or immaterial RPT;
xv. has complied with all other applicable bank policies and processes and regulatory
    requirements; and
xvi. the final recommendation is sound, reasonable and justifiable in the light of all the facts.

5.4. RPTs information, documentation of (dis)approvals, write-off process
The board should be responsible for establishing effective policies for information, documen-
tation, (dis)approval and any extraordinary write-off to protect the best interests of the bank.
All RPT write-offs should be the subject of board scrutiny and approved by the board, a
decision of disinterested independent board members. (See also role of independent directors,
4.2.3) Such a re-structure or write off should lead to a review of the position of the RP with the
bank.

5.4.1. Information Requirements
The Law on Credit Institutions and IAS 24 (see Table 11 requirements) both stipulate
information that must either be provided to the bank and published, or that must be provided
to shareholders regarding RPs and RPTs.


  Responsibility to publish related interests
  1.   Members of the board of management or members' council, members of the board
       of controllers, the general director (director) and deputy general director (deputy
       director) of a credit institution must publish the following information to the credit
       institution:
       (a) Name and address of head office, lines of business, serial number and date of
           issuance of business registration certificate and place of business registration of
           any enterprise or economic organization in which such person or a related person
           owns a capital contribution portion or shares in his / her / their name or authorizes
           or entrusts another organization or individual to own in the latter's name, of five
           or more per cent of the charter capital;
       (b) Name and address of head office, lines of business, serial number and date of
           issuance of business registration certificate and place of business registration of
           any enterprise in which such person and a related person is currently a member

                 of the board of management or members' council, a member of the board of
                 controllers, or the general director (director).
      2.     The publication of information pursuant to clause 1 of this article and changes in
             relevant information shall be made in writing within seven (7) business days from the
             date on which the [event] occurs or the change arises.
      3.     The credit institution must [also] publish the information prescribed in clause 1 of this
             article annually to the general meeting of shareholders or members' council of the
             credit institution, and shall display and retain such information at the head office of
             the credit institution.
                                                               Law on Credit Institutions, Article 39



Such is the breadth of information to be managed, banks should develop and maintain a
database of all related parties, their interests, their related parties and their transactions with
the bank. The information required by Article 39 of the Law on Credit Institutions also requires
changes to that information:
i.         must be published within 7 days. Good practices would suggest publication through a
           press release and simultaneously on the bank website;
ii.        must be provided at the General Meeting of Shareholders; and
iii. retained at the bank head office.

5.4.2. Documentation of RPTs Review/(Dis)Approvals Process
Good practices suggest all recommendations for and (dis)approvals of RPTs are in writing and
encompass records of:
i.         Persons (dis)approving the RPT at each stage of the process; any negative opinion at any
           stage should trigger independent board committee review;
ii.        A list of the documentation provided;
iii. Description of the transaction, giving economic reasons for it and bank interest in the
     transaction;
iv. Identity of related parties and relationships;
v.         Characteristics and financial details of the RPT, including cash components of the amount
           paid, fair value of any financial instruments, maximum amount that may be disbursed, any
           maximum amount that is covered by a guarantee;
vi. A record of any negotiations that take place and their outcome;


                                                    - 78 -

vii. Clear statement that the RPT is on market terms and conditions, including information on
     benchmarks applied and a statement that reflects consideration of the fairness of the
     transaction;
viii. Rationale and evidence, if required, for any deviation from market terms or conditions;
ix. Statement of any shortcomings in either the process or the documentation found by final
    approvers; and
x.     A clear statement of recommendation, or (dis)approval.

5.4.3. Write-off or changes in existing terms and conditions
Any write–off or re-structuring of RPTs should not be considered part of ‘normal business’ as
they set a very poor example and erode public trust. Indeed, any write-off or restructuring of
a RPT would suggest the need to review the standing of the related party within the bank. Any
exposures or increases in exposures or changes to the terms and conditions of material
transactions with a related party should be reported immediately to the board and be subject
to review of the independent committee of the board (see also 5.2.3).
Changes to terms and conditions should be fully documented, recorded and (dis) approved
by either the board or the shareholders, depending on materiality. Such changes in terms and
conditions are often subject to a special majority vote of the board of 75% of all independent,
non-interested directors or a special majority vote of shareholders of 75% of non-conflicted,
non-interested shareholders. Singapore applies these prescriptions to write-offs, and increases
or changes to terms and conditions of RPTs. The special majority vote is higher than the initial
vote of 65% of non-interested, non-conflicted parties.


     Recommendation 23
     The RPT policy should incorporate requirements for:
         i.    published information;
         ii.   documentation of the review and approvals process.
     Write-off or re-structuring or changes in terms and conditions of RPTs is a major matter.
     More stringent special provisions for (dis)approval should be in place and require review
     by independent directors and lead to a review of the role of the RP him/herself.



5.5. RPTs lending practices
5.5.1. Overview - RPT credit approval process
A bank should develop full and detailed procedures for credit approval processes for RPTs.
These should be understood and applied in the credit approval process. These procedures
should be regularly reviewed and updated.

Of particular importance is the credit granting / approval process which may be standardised
across a number of types of credits, for example, for particular products or it may be individual
for specific borrowers or larger loans. In either case the processes for approval should be
explained in the policy and applied to all relevant credits granted, including RPTs. The individ-
ual process should be reviewed by at least two non-conflicted persons (the ‘four eyes’ policy)
to ensure all is according to the established policies. Given all RPTs should be on normal market
terms and conditions, any unusual transactions, such as loans with unusual terms or with
unusual transaction activity or changes, should be subject to a special review and approval
system.
Finally, after undergoing the normal credit appraisal process, a material transaction should be
notified to the board committee for RPT ex ante (dis)approval (or recommendation to
shareholders), and ex post if it falls under the ‘de minimis’ level.

5.5.2. Credit appraisal
The credit appraisal stage may consider different appraisal processes for different types of
borrowers and will vary between corporate credit applicants and personal credit customers.
RPTs should have the appropriate process applied as if the transaction was a RPT transaction.
Credit applicants, including RPTs, should provide recent, audited financial statements in
support of their application. All RPTs should follow the RPT approvals process. (see sections
5.2.2, 5.2.3 and 5.2.4).
At a minimum, the appraisal process should examine the elements provided in Table 14 below.
Table 14 presents an overview only of the credit appraisal process. Each step in the process
should be documented, fully explained and adhered to by all credit personnel.

                          Table 14: Credit Appraisal Requirements

       Requirements of the credit appraisal process

  1    The amount, purpose and structure of the facility;

  2    Rationale for granting the loan to a RPT, with indication of guarantees required;

       A thorough understanding of the borrower, including analysis of the credit risk of the
  3    borrower, integrity of the applicant, reputation in credit history and previous record in credit
       repayment with the bank; perhaps also an independent check on the classification of risk;

       Risk profile including, borrower total exposure and sensitivity of the sector to economic
  4
       conditions, including the current and forecast operating environment of the borrower;

       A description of how the interest rate was fixed considering the market risk-free rate and the
  5    credit risk of the borrower; a comparison of the rate of interest on the loan with other similar
       applications on the market, explaining any reasons for the discrepancy;

        Requirements of the credit appraisal process

        Capacity to repay and source of repayment, a review of the business plan,
  6     projected cash flows and scenario analysis, including assessment of financial liquidity and
        the level of indebtedness;

        Physical inspection of the borrower’s premises to understand the business and its size and
  7
        complexity and the application of the credit funds;

  8     Value and enforceability of collateral or guarantees;

  9     Management capacity in the borrower; and

  10    Background information on shareholders and beneficial owners and directors.


In some banks good credit application processes focus on the “5Cs” – capacity of a
borrower to repay the credit; collateral which is the adequacy and accessibility of security the
bank controls if the borrower defaults; and character of the borrower including the quality and
reputation of the person or the management team of the borrowing entity, the planned use
for the credit and the strength if their intentions to repay the loan. A strong capital position of
the entity and a relatively lower level of debt should indicate a better capacity to repay the
loan. Covenants which define the actions or limits a borrower must or must not take or achieve,
such as limits on gearing, interest cover and working capital, may be added to the loan
conditions.
The credit approval process should be segmented so no one individual has the capacity to
determine a credit alone. For example, the bank branch manager who receives the credit
request and who has contact with the potential borrower, should originate documentation
related to the loan, but should not analyse the proposal, recommend or approve it. Approval
authorities should be set, commensurate to the positions and expertise of individuals in the
management hierarchy and related to the size and complexity of the transactions under
consideration. Authority limits should be approved by the board, reserving to the board the
approval of large credit exposures over a set limit and those transactions required by any other
regulation or bank policy.
The design of the credit approval process should be one of checks and balances and should
be in place from the first client / borrower request. Bank materials should explain each of the
steps involved in the process from commencement with ‘front office’ to ‘back office’ to approval.
It should identify the personnel accountable for each stage and the actions and documentation
required. The goal is to apply a consistent robust evaluation and rating scheme to credit
proposals and the same to all RPT loans.
In any event, the whole process should result in a thorough understanding of the borrower,
the purpose and structure of the credit, the source of its repayment, the exposure to the bank
and how the exposure fits with the bank Credit Risk Policy.

      Recommendation 24
      Quality RPT loan processes require application of the bank credit risk policy by non-
      conflicted parties and be supported by documentation, application, appraisal and (dis)
      approval processes by management.



5.5.3. Credit transactions with related parties – special issues
Matters for attention in the development and design of a Credit Risk Policy and credit risk
procedures for related party transactions in particular should include:
i.        A description of the types of credit transactions and credit exposures subject to the
          procedures;
ii.       Clarity as to the related parties affected by the procedures;
iii. A stated requirement for RPTs comply with other bank policies and procedures applicable
     to credit transactions;
iv. Credit limits for RPTs for individual/entities should be set and limits should also be set for
    transactions with the same individual/entity in aggregate;
v.        No party with an interest in the transaction should participate in the deliberation, decision
          making or management of the exposure;
vi. Creditworthiness should be carefully checked to see it is no less than normal requirements
    of other persons, parties or groups of parties;
vii. The terms and conditions should not be more favourable than for other counterparties in
     similar circumstances; and
viii. The loan should be consistent with all bank policies and procedures, including risk
      management policies and procedures and related party transaction policies and
      procedures of the bank.

             Issue

             Monitoring of related party credit transactions should be undertaken by independent
  4          non-conflicted parties, should be on-going and the results of reviews reported directly to
             both the board and the audit committee of the board or the responsible board committee

             Market terms for the loan should be identified, explained, especially benchmarks used for
  5
             interest rate setting, collateral or guarantees

             At the due diligence stage of any bank transaction, the personnel should check with IT
  6
             systems to ensure none of the parties to the transaction are RPs.

             RPTs, their status and any aggregated exposures to individuals or particular RP groups, such
  7
             as directors, should be regularly reported to the board

             Exemptions to normal application approval processes for related parties should be minimal
  8
             and any exemptions explained, justified and noted in loan documentation

             Documentation relating to RPT credit exposures should be recorded, maintained, updated
  9
             regularly and available for inspection by the banking regulator and the external auditor

             All unusual or problematic transactions should be escalated to a higher
  10
             authority for review.



  Recommendation 25
  Particular additional policies and procedures to protect the bank in RPT credit transactions
  may be required. These policies and procedures should be aligned with other bank policies
  and with policies and procedures for related parties and related party transactions.



5.5.4. Other Tips in Credit Processes
Documentation
Documentation is an essential part of the credit process and RPTs should be no exception. Full
documentation of all key stages in the transaction should be required and retained for the:
       i.     credit application
       ii.    credit analysis
       iii. credit approval
       iv. credit monitoring
       v.     collateral valuation



                                                    - 83 -

    vi. impairment recognition and
    vii. realization of security.
Documentation should be standardised for similar transactions, completed for all proposals,
certified by appropriate personnel, maintained, updated and indexed for easy access.
Credit administration
RPT credit administration processes should be no different from ordinary loan administration
processes. However additional vigilance is recommended. The credit portfolio should be
properly administered, loan agreements well prepared, renewal notices sent systematically
and credit files updated regularly. Collateral value should be monitored and records updated
where required. The administration should ensure the borrower is making timely repayments
according to the agreement and has in place any bank loan requirements such as insurance
and documentation before the credit is disbursed.
Monitoring progress / system for managing problem credits / loans
RPT loan abuses highlight the importance of good and on-going loan monitoring processes.
To safeguard against potential losses, problem credits need to be identified early so prompt
corrective action can be taken.
Early warning systems are a part of monitoring for problem credits. The bank will need to define
criteria for identifying and reporting problem credits and develop a system of warning signs
for individual borrowers, such as defaults on interest or principal payments and for each major
credit exposure sector. For example, for the commercial real estate sector, checks for
concentrations of exposures should include associated activities in construction, land
development and other associated loans in residential properties. Exposure to residential
mortgage lending may require the bank to introduce conservative loan-to-value (LTV) and
debt-to-income (DTI) ratio requirements. Early warning systems should also have reminder
procedures to follow up defaults and which trigger risk controlling processes in due time. Those
tasked with monitoring require high quality analytic skills, sometimes difficult to find.
Regular diligence around monitoring limits and escalation of breaches is becoming common-
place. Checklists of counterparties, industries and entities under stress may be developed and
built into the monitoring system. Major exposures to particular markets may require prudent
and specific bank policies. Specific individuals should be tasked to monitor credit quality and
should be required to pass information to those responsible for assigning internal risk ratings
to the credit. Periodic reviews are a fundamental part of monitoring as are reviews undertaken
at rollovers and should be factored into the monitoring program.
IT Systems requirements
Amongst other things, the credit record keeping and administrative process and credit
monitoring require well-resourced, sophisticated management information systems with
predefined aggregation and reporting formats which can provide early indicators for further
review. Information system capacity often presents a challenge to banks. Banks should ensure

they develop the technology for the proper conduct of banking business, that systems are
integrated and audited, to assure good management of operations and oversight
effectiveness.

Part 5 - Frequently asked questions
5.1 Q – When the RPT Committee of the board are reviewing a possible loan RPT, what are the kinds
of questions they should be asking?
5.1A – They should review the terms and conditions of the transaction to be sure they are on
market and fair terms, cover the issues raised in 5.3 above and questions should be about:
•   the purpose of the transaction and the prevailing economic environment impact on the
    transaction;
•   the bona fides of the beneficiary of the transaction, his/her capacity to repay the loan and
    other transactions the beneficiary may already have with the bank;
•   the proposed interest rate on the loan to check if it is comparable to market rates for
    entities with similar risk profiles and credit ratings;
•   the collateral for the loan and if it has been externally valued by an independent valuer
    and what are the assumptions of the independent valuer; and
•   what is the schedule proposed for the loan payments.

                          PArT 6. moNITorING of rPs AND rPTs


Changes regarding conflicts of interests, related parties and related party transactions can
occur at any time, thus requiring continual monitoring. It is incumbent on any party with
knowledge of such changes that they report this information to a responsible body or person
within the bank. The responsible body / person may vary from bank to bank. It may be the
nominated board committee responsible for RPT oversight, the compliance section of the
bank, the company secretary or the internal audit function. The roles of each of these should
be clearly stated in the RPT policy so changes can be easily reported and systematically
recorded.
All changes in RPs and RPTs should be monitored by bank business units, notified to the
compliance function and reported to the board committee. The bank management credit
committee should review all problematic RPTs and escalate these for attention of the board
committee and the board. All RPTs should be reported to the Supervisory Board and the
External Auditor.

6.1. Board and board committee monitoring
Oversight of monitoring of RPTs falls to the board and the board committee responsible for
RPTs. The board and the board committee should regularly receive reports on RPTs from
management.
Changes in related parties, in shareholdings, in terms, conditions and exposures of all RPTs
should be escalated immediately by relevant business units to the board or board committee,
and reported to the compliance function. The board committee should recommend any
corrective measures for problematic RPTs.

6.2. Compliance function monitoring
Compliance function activities ensure that bank and relevant parties adhere to laws,
regulations and bank policies. The compliance function’s role in RPTs should be to make regular
checks and report on the presence, ongoing effectiveness and reliability of procedures and
suitability of systems to ensure compliance with the RPT policy, other internal requirements
and external regulatory requirements. It may be the first point of reporting RPs, RPTs and
changes to RPTs and is often responsible for all record keeping, notification of interests,
notification of RPTs and changes to notifications regarding RPTs in a timely manner, usually
amending records within two days. For example, it should check the coherence and
completeness of required information disclosures provided to the bank on RPs and request
additional information and confirmations, if necessary. The compliance function should have
in place particular surveillance measures for all RPTs, especially where terms and conditions
change.

6.3. Risk management function monitoring
It is important that the roles of the risk management and compliance functions do not overlap
or leave gaps. Collaboration between the two functions is necessary.
The risk management unit and the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) should be required to ensure that
all relevant business units identify any related party relationships. Risk management should
ensure standardised processes for bank activities include a check for RPs as a part of normal
transaction review procedures. Some departments may be particularly tasked to monitor
company groups or significant shareholders in order to monitor for major RPT risks. Risk
management should also assess, in accordance with the system of delegated powers, lending
transactions to ensure the conditions applied to a RPT loan are appropriate, at arm’s length
and on normal market terms and conditions. It is also likely to have a role in ensuring sound
records and processes for aggregation of RPTs.
Further the risk management unit should oversee the measurement of risks underlying the
relationships with related parties, check compliance with set limits allocated to the various
operating structures and units, and check that the activities undertaken by each business unit,
including RPTs, is in line with the risk appetite set out in internal policies. The risk management
function acts as a support to quality RPT management.

6.4. Internal audit monitoring
The internal audit function of a bank (see also 4.2.5) should include a review of the application
and effectiveness of the RPT policy in its audit plan, using a risk-based approach. It should
regularly review RPs, RPTs, the RPT approval processes and that any change to RPTs is recorded.
Internal Audit should review the effective and appropriate application of thresholds. A regular
internal audit review of non-performing loans, loan carry costs and provisioning should assist
transparency and disclosure.
Any non-performing RPTs should be most unusual, monitored more specifically, and subject
to specific, regular reports to the board/board committee of independent directors and
questions asked regarding the on-going role of the RP in the bank. Internal Audit should report
on these matters directly to the independent board committee overseeing RPTs, the
Supervisory Board and directly to the board on any serious concerns, such as potential or actual
classification of a RP exposure or write-off.

6.5. Whistle-blowing
Whistle-blowing is a mechanism to provide employees, contractors or suppliers, a way through
which to report suspected wrongdoing at the bank, i.e. speaking out in a confidential manner
in the public interest. An example of a bank whistle-blowing policy is provided at Appendix 5.
It is usual for a whistle-blowing policy to encourage the communication of bona fide concerns
relating to the lawful and ethical conduct of business, audit and accounting procedures or re-
lated matters. Normally the policy will also set out to protect those who communicate bona
fide concerns from any retaliation for such reporting.


                                              - 87 -
 VIETNAM GUIDEBOOK FOR BANKS



Confidential and anonymous mechanisms such as a confidential hotline or an appointed
person for receipt of concerns should be made available and should be described in the RPT
policy. It may be the company secretary or a designated person in the independent board
committee responsible for RPT oversight who is the nominated person to receive concerns.
Anonymous reporting does not serve to satisfy a duty to disclose an individual’s own potential
involvement in a conflict of interest or in unethical or illegal conduct. The policy owner is
normally the recipient of such disclosures or a nominated member of the board, usually an
independent director.


  Recommendation 26
  The board committee should review and oversee comprehensive bank monitoring of RPTs,
  RPs, and effective management of RPTs, including the activities related to RPTs of the:
      i.    compliance function;
      ii.   risk management function
      iii. internal audit function,
      iv. a whistleblowing function; and
      v.    external auditor.
  All RPTs should be reported to the Supervisory Board and the External Auditor.




6.6. External auditor’s confirmation of RPT policies and processes
The external auditor (see also 4.2.5) can support transparency and quality disclosures on RPTs
through his/her role of reviewing bank financial statements. The International Auditing
Standard, ISA 550 requires the auditor to perform procedures to identify, assess and respond
to the risks of material misstatement in financial statements arising from the entity’s failure to
appropriately account for or disclose related party relationships, transactions or balances. VSA
550 is the nationally adopted equivalent of ISA 550.
It is normal for the external auditor to convey to the audit committee, if there is one, and to
relevant board members, board committees, or the Supervisory Board its findings in relation
to related parties and RPTs as they affect the financial statements. Also, the external auditor
can confirm the overall suitability of the RPT policy and procedures and can raise any weakness
s/he sees in the policy.
The board committee responsible for oversight of RPTs should view the external auditor as an
aid to controlling potentially abusive RPTs as the external auditor can:

•     Alert the bank to unusual transactions;
•     Raise concerns about particular policies or processes and their effectiveness;
•     Understand the complex structures which may subject to abuse; and
•     Apply their skills to support quality RPT practices.



    Recommendation 27
    The relevant board committee and/or board members and/or the Supervisory Board
    should review with the external auditor his/her findings on RPT policies and processes for
    continuous improvement.



6.7. RPTs – not reported or approved
If transactions come to light that have not been reported through the appropriate channels
or to the appropriate persons, or approved as required by the law, regulation, or specific bank
policies, there should be effective ways for the transaction to be dealt with and/or for
shareholders to obtain legal redress if necessary.
In some countries, such as India and Singapore, the bank itself may void transactions it finds
which have not adhered to the law, regulations or company policies. Singapore allows banks
to void a transaction, or the terms and conditions of the transaction, without penalties if the
transaction has not been subjected to the prescribed approval processes.
India requires that if a bank finds a RPT that has not been reported to the board, then the
independent committee of non-conflicted members of the board may review, ratify, revise or
terminate the transaction ex post.
In good practices, all material RPTs not initially reported to the board or (dis)approved in the
normal processes of ex ante consideration, should be reviewed by the committee of
independent board members, by the board and reported to shareholders. Many countries
have strengthened their Company Law to ensure effective shareholder redress. China and
Indonesia have strengthened their respective company laws to ensure privately enforceable
shareholder rights in such situations.
The Law on Enterprises does allow for such legal redress.

     A shareholder or a group of shareholders owning at least one per cent of the number of
     ordinary shares for six consecutive months has the right, on its own behalf or on behalf of
     the company, to initiate a legal action regarding civil liability against a member of the
     Board of Directors or the CEO who:
     (c) Implement their assigned rights and obligations contrary to the provisions of law, the
         charter of the company or resolutions of the General Meeting of Shareholders;
     (d) Use information, know-how or business opportunities of the company for their own
         personal benefit or for the benefit of other organizations or individuals;
     (dd) Abuse their positions and powers and use assets of the company for their own
         personal benefit or for the benefit of other organizations or individuals.

     Recommendation 28

Part 6 – Frequently asked questions
6.1 Q - Why is it important to actively monitor all transactions with RPTs?
6.1 A - Economic or personal conditions may change over time, which may lead to problems
or default. Restructuring or write-offs of RPTs threaten the reputation of the bank, should be
viewed as highly suspect and lead to a review of the RPs position with the bank.
6.2 Q - Why is it important for the RPT review committee or the Audit Committee of the board to
engage with the external auditor on RPTs?
6.2 A - The external auditor, under his/her own professional standards is required specifically
to see that RPTs are included in the financial statement of the bank. In checking this, the
external auditor may come across unusual transactions which should be drawn to the attention
of the bank or an area where controls are weak. This information can help the RP review
committee undertake its role.
6.3 Q – Why is a whistleblowing function recommended?
6.3 A – Most fraudulent transactions are detected internally through corporate controls,
internal analysis and internal tip-offs45. The whistleblowing mechanism allows this information
to flow quickly up to the board.

45    PWC, Global Economic Crime Survey 2014 indicates that 48% of frauds are detected in these three ways.

7.1 . General principles for transparency and disclosure
The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) stresses the importance of transparency
and disclosure. The BCBS guidance, Corporate Governance Principles, Principle 12 states:


     “the governance of the bank should be adequately transparent to its shareholders,
     depositors, other relevant stakeholders and market participants”.46


As emphasised in existing BCBS guidance on bank transparency, it is difficult for shareholders,
depositors, other relevant stakeholders and market participants to effectively monitor and
properly hold the board and senior management accountable where there is insufficient
transparency. The objective of transparency in the area of corporate governance is therefore
to provide these parties with the information necessary to enable them to assess the
effectiveness of the board and senior management. A transparent and strong disclosure
regime is a pivotal feature of efficient markets and permits investors to determine their buy or
sell decisions and is important to stakeholders in holding the bank and senior management
accountable. Transparency and disclosure builds trust and confidence of investors and
depositors and helps to attract capital.
The global expectation is that all banks, even those for whom disclosure requirements may
differ because they are not listed, should disclose relevant and useful information, which is not
generic but is specific to the bank.

                         Table 16: Good Practices in RPT Disclosure and Approval

            Good Practices

            All RPTs should be disclosed to the board and to the shareholders and incorporated in the
     1
            financial statements.

     2      All RPTs should be (dis)approved by the board or recommended by the board to shareholders.

            Some relatively small, negligible RPTs may be reviewed, initially by management, and later
     3      reported and approved by the board. All material transactions should be (dis)approved ex
            ante, either by the board or by the shareholders.

     4      All RPTs should be reported to shareholders in aggregate at least annually.

  Disclosure should include, but not be limited to, material information on the bank’s
  objectives, organisational and governance structures and policies (in particular the
  content of any corporate governance or remuneration code or policy and the process by
  which it is implemented), major share ownership and voting rights and related party
  transactions.
  The bank should also disclose key points concerning its risk exposures and risk manage-
  ment strategies without breaching necessary confidentiality.
  Disclosure should be accurate, clear and presented such that shareholders, depositors,
  other relevant stakeholders and market participants can consult the information easily.
  Timely public disclosure is desirable on a bank’s public website, in its annual and periodic
  financial reports, or by other appropriate means.
                                      BCBS, Corporate Governance Principles for Banks, 2015.



7.1.2. Material and non-material disclosures


  Disclosure should include, but not be limited to, material information on the bank’s
  objectives, organisational and governance structures and policies (in particular the
  content of any corporate governance or remuneration code or policy and the process by
  which it is implemented), major share ownership and voting rights and related party
  transactions.
                                      BCBS, Corporate Governance Principles for Banks, 2015.


Materiality can be an obscure term that is defined slightly differently in different jurisdictions.
So in relation to RPTs, it is best practice for a regulator, or failing that, a bank to clearly state
the level at which it determines transactions are non-material, and therefore assumed to be
insignificant. This is the origin of the establishment of a de minimis level for RPTs. All
transactions at or above this threshold are considered ‘material’ and so should be subject to
strict disclosure requirements.

7.1.3. Timing of disclosures – continuous, on-going and immediate, quarterly, annual
For information to be useful, it does need to be timely. Examples of events that are likely to
require immediate disclosure are the announcement of a merger or acquisition, sales or
purchases of bank shares by directors, the acquisition or loss of a significant contract,
occurrence of an event of default under a debt financing agreement, changes in substantial
shareholders’ and directors’ interests and related party transactions. Timely public disclosure
is desirable on a bank’s public website, in its Annual Report, in periodic reports or press releases,
disclosures to the stock exchange or the regulator or by other means.

                                                          Part 7. Transparency and Disclosure on RPTs




      In Vietnam, Circular 121 at Article 23.3 recognises the time imperative of information and
      requires disclosure of material RPTs within 24 hours of approval of the transaction on the
      bank website and to the securities regulator.



In most jurisdictions, bank issuers have continuous or on-going disclosure rules which require
it to announce information that is likely to materially affect the price or value of its securities
or is necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the issuer’s securities. Such
regulation for timeliness of information regarding RPTs should apply to all listed and non-listed
banks as shareholders, depositors, investors, other stakeholders, and regulators have vested
interests in the bank activities.

7.1.4. Placement and security of disclosures
Trust and confidence in a bank is built when there is regular, quality and easily accessible
information provided to external parties, potential and current investors, to the regulator, on
the bank website, in its annual report and available at the Shareholders Meeting. It is essential
that a bank fully discloses all material RPTs to the market and explains whether or not they are
concluded as arm’s length transactions.

7.2. RPT Records
All banks should establish and maintain adequate records, which identify related parties and
their related interests and which specifies their transactions with the bank. These records
should be regularly updated by relevant individuals as required.
In Vietnam, the LCI recognises the importance of quality reliable information to the banking
business and requires banks:


      To ensure that files of the credit institution are archived in order to provide data serving
      managerial and executive activities, control of all activities of the credit institution, and
      activities of checks, supervision and inspection by the State Bank.
                                                          Law on Credit Institutions, Article 38.4


Therefore, it is recommended that global good practices be applied to information
management to ensure:
i.      provision of timely, relevant information internally and externally;
ii.     equal, timely and cost-efficient access to relevant information;
iii. information technologies are applied to maximise information dissemination; and

 VIETNAM GUIDEBOOK FOR BANKS



iv. a good website with current information should include bank policies, press releases,
    annual reports, summary other reports, transactions reports, bank organisational charts,
    and lists of significant shareholders.

7.2.1. Responsibilities for information – a database
An information database of disclosures of interest of RPs and RPTS should be established. It
should encompass specific field headings for all COI, RP and RPT information requirements.
The information register should be the nominated responsibility of one individual, for example,
the general counsel of the bank or the head of compliance, and should be checked by the
internal auditor at least annually to ensure the completeness and accuracy of disclosures
internally to the bank and to the board and externally to others regarding RPs and RPTs. The
external auditor should also access the register as part of his review of RPTs preliminary issuing
an audit report and closure of the audit.
The information database should be regularly updated and as soon as new information arises
or is provided and the nominated officer should review and assure the board and the external
auditor at least annually of the information’s currency and accuracy.

7.2.2. Responsibilities for information – Directors, senior management, and significant
shareholders
It should be the responsibility of each director, senior manager and significant shareholders
to provide accurate and updated information immediately it arises or as in good practices at
least within 7 days of the change.
Information updates should be regularly required of directors and senior managers through
the completion annually of a formal and signed declaration of interests which will, at a
minimum, disclose their interests, their related parties, including close family members, related
entities (by name) and their and their interests’ outstanding transactions (credit arrangements,
contracts etc). All information so provided should be checked and updated in the information
database.
Table 17 provides a list of information that should be included in the database.

7.3. Disclosure of RPTs
The requirements for disclosure of RPTs vary from country to country and depend on
applicable regulations, the nature and size of transactions and the recipients of the report. The
most common forms of reporting are:
•      to the board of directors and board committee charged with RPT oversight;
•      to the Shareholders Meeting;
•      in the Annual Report in the corporate governance report (see Appendix 2);
•      in the Annual Report in the Financial Statements (see Appendices 3 and 4);
•      to regulators (see Appendices 6 and 7); and
•      to shareholders and the general public on the company website and in other documents.
Other reports on related party transactions are often required reporting by regulators, either
securities commission, the banking supervisor or tax authorities for periodic filings and ad hoc
notifications.
In Vietnam there are many laws, regulations, decrees, circulars and guidance that determine
all applicable requirements for full disclosure of related parties and related party transactions.
They have diverse provisions, which are not harmonised (See Table 18). However, when taken
together, regulations incentivise full and complete disclosure on these matters. In this situation
banks and responsible persons at banks should be considering how much they can disclose
in these areas, not how little. Related parties should be disclosed by name and specific details
disclosed about the nature and purpose of material RPTs and the name of the particular RP
involved.

             Table 18: Key Legal Requirements for Disclosure on RPTs in Vietnam

                         Article 38.6 requires banks and managers of credit institutions, which
                         includes directors, senior management, administrators to disclose interests
    Law on Credit        and conflicts of interests.
    Institutions         The bank itself must ensure the information on related parties and related
                         interests is also collected and published within the bank and to sharehold-
                         ers at the Shareholders Meeting (Law on Credit Institutions Article 39).

                         LOE requires public disclosure of related interests of joint stock enterprises
                         assuming the bank charter does not prescribe other stricter provisions (Law
    Law on               on Enterprises Article 159). The requirements include:
    Enterprises          Reporting of the list of related persons and corresponding transactions
                         between them and the company to GMS; declarations of interests of
                         directors, supervisory board members, CEO and other managers.

Given all these incentives for transparency and for the disclosure of conflicts of interests, related
parties and RPTs, it may be easier to establish simple, written rules to identify global good
practices regarding who should disclose, what should be disclosed, to whom it should be
disclosed and how it should be disclosed.
A general principle is that there should be maximum transparency from all banks because of
their importance to financial stability, including on RPTs so that others may understand the
nature of relationships within the bank and with other parties external to the bank and they
can assess the effect of such interests and transactions on the bank’s activities and perform-
ance. While limited liability companies are sheltered from the highest demands of disclosures,
all banks, including limited liability banks, should be subject to similar requirements because
of their importance to national financial stability.

7.4. Disclosures to the board, board committee and shareholders
There should be regular disclosures on related parties, their interests and RPTs to the board
and / or to the board committee charged with RPT oversight and to the RPT policy owner or
compliance function. There should also be considerable disclosures made to shareholders so
they may understand the magnitude and impact of RPTs on the bank. Such is the importance
and complexity of reporting requirements for RPTs, sophisticated information systems should
be used to store, aggregate and report them.

7.4.1. Quality of RPT disclosures
Good RPT disclosures should be substantive, comprehensive and specific to banks, specific to
a particular bank and to their particular approach to RPTs oversight and to the particular
individuals involved in RPTs. A survey of good RPT reporting practices was undertaken by

Ontario Securities Commission staff47. The examples below are adapted from and reflect their
findings.
For example, a generic and uninformative disclosure describing bank management of RPTs in
an annual report follows.


     The audit committee reviews and approves all material related party transactions in which
     the bank is involved or which the bank proposes to enter into.


A better statement would be as follows:


     The bank’s management team discusses all related party transactions. In considering
     related party transactions, management will assess the materiality of related party
     transactions on a case-by-case basis with respect to both the qualitative and quantitative
     aspects of the proposed related party transaction. Related party transactions that are in
     the normal course are subject to the same processes and controls as other transactions,
     that is, they are subject to standard approval procedures and management oversight, but
     will also be considered by management for reasonability against fair value. Related party
     transactions that are found to be material are subject to review and approval by the bank's
     audit committee which is comprised of independent directors.


A generic and uninformative disclosure of a particular RPT follows.


     During the year, the bank paid $120,000 to a director as lease payments. As at December
     31, 2014, the amount outstanding to the director was $10,000.


A better approach would be as follows:


     During the year, the bank paid $120,000 to Mr. Nguyen Diep Bao, a director of the bank,
     as lease payments for leasing the space used as the bank’s information storage warehouse.
     The current lease expires on December 31, 2015. The terms of the lease were reviewed by
     disinterested directors of the Board, and were found to be comparable to market terms.
     The lease is to be reviewed by disinterested directors of the Board every two years and
     renewed on the condition that the terms are comparable to, or more favourable than,
     market terms. As at December 31, 2014, the amount outstanding to Mr. Nguyen Diep Bao
     was $10,000, representing the amount for one month’s rent.

It is recommended that RPT bank policies, annual reports and announcements on RPs and
RPTs be made available to the public on the bank’s website. Potential investors are then able
to see the bank commitment to transparency of RPTs, may understand the impact of RPTs on
the bank and take comfort in the policies and procedures the bank has in place to address as-
sociated risks.

  Recommendation 30
  Banks should aim to be as transparent as possible regarding their policies and procedures
  for RPTs.
  Quality disclosures on RPs and RPTs should be substantive, comprehensive and specific
  to the bank and the individual RP.
  Banks should establish and oversee policies for regular, complete reporting to the board
  committee and to the board of information on interests, related parties and RPTs.
  Reporting should include reports to the relevant board committee, to the board, to
  shareholders and to the public on RPs and RPTs as recommended in Table 18.
  In particular, shareholders should receive full information to enable approval decisions on
  material RPTs and in the Annual Report on all RPTs.



7.5. Reporting to the regulator
Each bank should regularly report to the SBV as it requires, to allow for adequate monitoring
of the affairs of the bank. Article 13.2 of LCI requires credit institutions in Vietnam to provide
the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) information relating to their business operations.
The regulator has special interest in all related parties and their involvement in the bank.
Therefore, the SBV has specified information to be reported to it and the style and format of
such reporting. In Official Letter no 1054/NHNN-DBTK, dated 14 February 2015, the SBV set
out extensive new reporting requirements, applicable from February 2015 onwards. Particular
forms have specified the information and the format of reporting required. Key SBV documents
related to RPTs are listed below. Form 4 can be reviewed at Appendix 7. All forms can be
accessed at www.sbv.gov.vn

7.5.1. Certification of RPT reports to the SBV.
It is good practice that all reports to the SBV regarding related party transactions should be
certified by two bank senior executives and the external auditor. If an individual report is filed
by an individual related party, it should be certified by that individual; if the RP is another legal
entity filing the information, then the report should be certified by two executives from the
legal entity. It is also normal practice that any errors or omissions detected in information on
RPTs that has been filed with the central bank, the central bank should be notified as soon as
possible and at least within five days and the information corrected.

7.5.2. Suggested report types and contents
Information regarding related parties.
Good practices demand the regulator should be informed of the policies and procedures the
bank has in place to determine related parties and RPTs and their management and assessment
as they arise, including processes the bank has instigated to control RPTs, thresholds the bank
establishes and uses to determine the materiality of RPTs, and (dis)approval and monitoring

processes. The regulator can then assess the adequacy of bank policies and processes for
controlling RPTs.
Periodic information is required by the banking regulator on related parties including their
name, full contact details, relationship to the bank, whether a natural person or legal entity,
direct or indirect control or influence, individual or joint control and on credit transactions with
related parties.
Also periodic reports on approved RPTs should be provided to the regulator in aggregate,
indicating types of related party transactions, including the granting of credit; purchase, sale
or transfer of assets; management or service fees. For each transaction the details to be
reported include the nature, amount, rationale for the transaction, related parties in the
transaction, clearly indicating the party’s relationship to the bank and their benefits or interests
in the transactions. Any changes to terms and conditions of material RPTs should also be
reported.
The bank should retain for bank regulator review all documentation associated with RPTs.
Retention of documents / information for listed banks is ten years as required under the
Securities Law, Chapter 2, Article7.1.4. All banks, listed or unlisted, should retain documents
and information for a similar period.
Information regarding the bank organizational structure
The organizational structure of the bank, its affiliates and significant or influential shareholders
should be reported to the banking regulator in such a manner as to make transparent the
bank’s major and influential shareholders, key management and the control and management
of bank subsidiaries and other interests. Official Letter No. 1054 does require information on:
i.     individual shareholders, Vietnamese and foreign;
ii.    institutional shareholders;
iii. shareholdings of the board, supervisory board, senior management and their related
     parties;
iv. cross shareholdings;
v.     capital contributions; and
vi. financial relationships between subsidiaries and affiliates.
Information regarding changes to the bank organizational structure and changes of personnel
Periodic reports should be provided by the bank to the SBV regarding changes to contact
details, bank structure, affiliates and influential shareholders, directors and key management
and personnel changes, and the date of period covered in the report to enable SBV
understanding of RPs and RPTs in individual banks.

  Recommendation 31
  Banks should ensure adequate information is provided to the SBV and should be
  compliant with regulatory requests.
  Disclosure on RPTs should be compliant with all regulations and with bank policies and
  should enable understanding of the full impact of RPTs on the bank.



Part 7 – Frequently asked questions
7.1 Q – Why is disclosure on RPTs critical to regulators and shareholders?
7.1 A – Disclosure is critical on RPTs. Such disclosures help regulators understand better the
particular exposures of a bank and it enables shareholders to identify RPTs and RPs and assists
shareholders by lowering the risk of unfair transactions and tunnelling by controlling
shareholders.
7.2 Q – Should a credit institution make a report on RPTs to the SBV even if it has no RPTs?
7.2 A – Yes. A report is required even it is a ‘nil’ return. The report should be in the form and
style of Official Letter No. 1054/NHNN-DBTK (February 2015).

and judgement and whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect,
or could appear to affect, the director’s judgement. The board should state its reasons if it
determines that a director is independent notwithstanding the existence of relationships or
circumstances which may appear relevant to its determination, including if the director:
    •   has been an employee of the company or group within the last five years;
    •   has, or has had within the last three years, a material business relationship with the

Appendix 5: Example of a Whistle-blowing Policy
Excerpt from Commonwealth Bank of Australia Website (www.commbank.com.au),
accessed on 3 May 2015
We are committed to embedding a culture of 'speaking up'. Our Whistleblower hotline is
available to any employee who wishes to raise a concern.
Embedding a culture of 'speaking up'.
To achieve the Group’s vision, we are committed to maintaining an ethical work environment
and embedding a “speak up” culture. We do not tolerate any act which constitutes fraud,
bribery and corruption, breaches of any law or internal policy.
Our whistleblower hotline is available to any employee who wishes to raise a concern. Reports
can be made in confidence and without fear of reprisals via a dedicated telephone number or
email address. All reports raised are taken seriously and where appropriate, investigated fully.
No employee is discriminated against in any way as a result of reporting a concern in good faith.
Group Whistleblower Protection Policy
Often those making disclosures are concerned with the confidentiality of the disclosure, the
manner in which the disclosures are dealt with, and the fear of repercussions arising from
making such a disclosure.
Our Whistleblower protection policy and procedures ensure that reports are treated appro-
priately and that the employee raising the concern is protected. The Whistleblower protection
policy reinforces the message from the Group’s senior management and Board that those
making a disclosure can trust the matter will be dealt with honestly, professionally and
confidentially.
The policy complies with the Australian Standard AS 8004-2003 - Whistleblower Protection
Program for Entities, and ensures that any person making a disclosure is not personally
disadvantaged or discriminated against.
The policy applies to all businesses within the Group, including subsidiaries and joint ventures
where the Group has a controlling interest, in Australia or overseas. It is applicable to all
directors, employees, temporary staff, contractors, suppliers and service providers.
Staff are encouraged to report any actual incidents of fraud or unethical behaviour, or any
suspicions of such, through regular internal communications and training.
Service providers, suppliers and their employees with information relating to any act of internal
fraud or unethical behaviour by Commonwealth Bank staff have the option of reporting the
issue in the following manner:
     •    Whistleblower Hotline:1800 222 789
     •    Reverse charge from overseas on +61 2 8841 6666
     •    Email the information to whistleblower@cba.com.au
Monitoring compliance
Group Security is responsible for the investigation of incidents reported through the
Whistleblower program and reports to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis on the
Whistleblower process.
The Group Whistleblower Protection Policy is subject to Annual Review.
