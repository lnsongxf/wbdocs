politics. Both ethnic Russians and minority populations
faced two principal and interrelated challenges. First, the
question arose as to how to formulate a Russian national
identity that incorporated the diversity of peoples and cul-
tures of the new Russian Federation. In the RSFSR of the
late 1980s, the Russian democratic movement was formed
around a civic notion of the state. Yet after independence,
this movement disintegrated in the face of ethno-nationalist
sentiments. The status of ethnic Russians, Russian culture
and history, and the Russian language in the new Russian
state thus needed to be determined. Second, due to the link
between territory and political/economic rights that devel-
oped in the late 1980s,37 the administrative arrangements of
the new Russian Federation became extremely important.
The contradiction between the Kremlin's desire to maintain
dominance over the regions and the desire for autonomy, or
even independence on the part of the minorities, fostered a
power struggle between federal and regional authorities.38
Political contestation over issues of ethno-nationalism es-
calated into open conflict between the Russian state and
some of its national minority constituents—particularly in
the North Caucasus.

      ed to extractive industries, at which Bank and IFC repre-
      sentatives have been invited to participate. Both RAIPON
      and regional IPs organizations have disseminated OP 4.10
      and used the policy as a framework in discussions with
      regional governments and developers in their attempts to
      gain recognition of their traditional use rights and protect
      their traditional habitats from incursion and exploitation by
      others.

      In 2002, the ECA Regional Department commissioned
      a preliminary review of the ethnic composition of each
      country. The review aimed to assess the constitutions and
      major legislation to determine whether or not IPs are rec-
      ognized in any of the countries. This preliminary review
      demonstrated the difficulty of applying the policy (OD 4.20
      at that time) in the region and found virtually no legal ba-
      sis to trigger the policy in any country except the Russian
      Federation.

      Given its position as an umbrella organization for the ma-
      jority of IPs groups in the Russian Federation, RAIPON
      could act as one such advisor on IP issues in Russia. Other
      organizations could also take an active part in such endeav-
      or, especially if they are not part of the RAIPON network
      but deal with matters that affect IPs.


      D) ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR

      The impact of the private sector on the development of
      IPs and its potential to contribute to their wellbeing are
      both significant. A unified approach could be devised to
      support corporate engagement with indigenous commu-
      nities regarding projects that affect those communities. In
      many instances, private sector projects in remote locations
      of the Russian North, Siberia and the Far East provide the
      only available development opportunities for local commu-
      nities of IPs. In this context, a key concern is how local
      Indigenous communities can benefit in a sustainable way
      from activities that take place on or near their traditional
      lands and territories.

       Another factor limiting the Bikin Case Study’s use as a
       model is the reliance on access to land and resources being
       tied to participation in a commercial tender with its accom-
       panying annual rental payments; such a pathway would be
       difficult for other communities to follow.

       Nevertheless, the Bikin case shows the way to raise funds
       through the Kyoto protocol for ‘forest projects’ with Indig-
       enous Peoples’ participation to protect the forest environ-
       ment, reduce climate change, and to preserve the custom-
       ary style of life and for sustainable economic development
       of the community.
