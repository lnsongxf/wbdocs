1      A matching experiment

High youth unemployment is a major challenge for countries all over the world. Active labour
market policies have attempted to help young people to move into work, but with limited
success. Training programs, in particular, have been found to have low returns in developing
countries (McKenzie, 2017). Job search assistance programs have shown more promising
results in terms of the cost eﬀectiveness of getting young people into work (Franklin, 2015;
Abebe et al., 2016). Yet getting workers into their ﬁrst job might not be the ultimate solution
to frictions in the labour market. Informational problems may prevent young people from
ﬁnding out what work suits them, including having unrealistic expectations about what kind
of work they could reasonably ﬁnd (Groh et al., 2015; Blattman and Dercon, 2016); similarly,
frictions may prevent ﬁrms and workers from making matches that workers are happy to
keep. Workers thus may spend many years moving in and out of jobs, ﬁguring out what sort
of work suits then and the wages they can reasonably expect to earn.

What role can policy play to help young people and ﬁrms to ﬁnd good matches? This paper
tests whether a key friction in the labour market is simply a lack of contact between ﬁrms and
workers — who may, respectively, be struggling to assess the relative merit of a particular
worker, and struggling to assess the value of working at a particular ﬁrm. By allowing both
sides of the market to meet, we test whether reducing these frictions allows workers and
ﬁrms to ﬁnd better matches in the labour market. To do this, we randomly invite 250 ﬁrms
and 1,000 unemployed job seekers to two job fairs in the center of Addis Ababa. The ﬁrms
were some of largest ﬁrms in the city, across all of the main sectors, and almost all of them
were actively looking to hire new staﬀ at the time of the fairs. The job-seekers, on the other
hand, were all young and looking for work, and had diﬀerent education levels and diverse
backgrounds. Firms and workers met for a day, and suggested matches were made to facilitate
meetings. At one of the two job fairs the job seekers attending were randomly selected to
receive a certiﬁcation intervention. We randomize invitations both for ﬁrms and workers.

The fairs are a new method of recruitment in this market.1 The usual method of job search
and recruitment centers around centrally located job vacancy boards, where ﬁrms post va-
cancies. Workers visit these boards, apply selectively, and ﬁrms assess workers on the basis
of their CVs. This process is subject to high search costs for workers, and information asym-
metries, because of the limited information contained in CVs (Abebe et al., 2016). The fairs
were designed to cut down the costs involved in this process by bringing workers and jobs
together directly, thus lowering the costs of ﬁnding a good match. At the fairs, both workers
and ﬁrms have the opportunity to assess a large number of candidates at the same time, and
1
    Fairs have been used in this context by very large ﬁrms (such as large multi-national ﬁrms), but their use
    is not widespread.



                                                      2
draw inference about the distribution of job and worker quality, respectively. They are able
to have meetings, make applications, and conduct interviews with zero eﬀective marginal
cost.

We ﬁnd that the fairs generate a rich set of interactions between workers and ﬁrms. We
estimate that 75% of workers at the fairs had an interview or in-depth discussion with a
recruiter.2 Among those who had meetings with ﬁrms, 11% report meeting with at least one
ﬁrm after the job fair for a more formal interview. In total, the fairs led to 105 job interviews.
However, these meetings and interviews led to only 14 accepted jobs.3 We therefore ﬁnd
no average impact of the job fairs on job seekers’ main employment outcomes at endline.
Similarly, we ﬁnd no impact on ﬁrms’ hiring outcomes in the last year, nor on the types of
workers they hired.

Why did the fairs not create more jobs? We reject that the ﬁrms at the fair were not
interested in looking for candidates. Most ﬁrms did hire many candidates outside of the job
fairs, and ﬁrms typically spend a great deal of time and money on recruitment, receiving
many formal applications. Similarly, job seekers search hard for employment, both at the
fairs and elsewhere. Since our sample of job seekers was drawn in a representative way from
the population of young, educated unemployed people in this labour market, and we ﬁnd
no evidence of negative selection into attendance, we do not think that ﬁrms just met an
unusually weak entry level candidates.

Instead, ﬁrms are reluctant to hire entry-level workers who were present at the fairs for high-
skill, professional positions — preferring to ﬁnd their recruits among employed workers at
other ﬁrms, with formal work experience. Firms were disappointed with the quality of the
applicants they met at the fairs: they reported that they were, on average, less employable
than the applicants they usually see by direct applications. By comparison, ﬁrms were in-
terested in hiring attendees with no tertiary education for low-skill positions: we ﬁnd that
ﬁrms made 55 job oﬀers to low skilled workers, of which fewer than 15% were accepted. It
seems that low skilled workers had unrealistically high expectations of the wages they could
earn in these positions.

What do ﬁrms and workers learn from this (disappointing) experience at the job fairs? We
ﬁnd clear evidence that both ﬁrms and workers redouble eﬀorts to search for work through
formal channels after the fairs. Firms increase their advertising and recruitment at the main
job vacancy boards. Workers increase their job search at those boards. For the workers, these
eﬀects are concentrated among low-type workers with low predicted probability of ﬁnding a
good job. They also adjust downwards their reservation wages to more realistic levels. This
2
    Roughly 60% of invited workers came to the fairs.
3
    This is conﬁrmed in the reports of both workers and ﬁrms.



                                                     3
combination of increased job search and more realistic expectations leads to considerably
improved employment outcomes for low-type workers. By contrast, the fairs seem to be a
discouraging experience for higher type workers, who learned that ﬁrms have high experience
requirements for formal jobs. They do not adjust their reservation wages, and in fact lower
their aspirations. They are less likely to have good jobs at endline, and more likely to have
switched to self-employment.

This is the ﬁrst experiment, to our knowledge, to try to study the eﬀects of labour market
matching programs on both workers and ﬁrms. A growing but relatively new literature looks
at the eﬀects of labour market interventions that aim to reduce information asymmetries on
job search outcomes. The closest study to ours is Beam (2016), where workers are encouraged
to attend a job fair in the Philippines geared towards placing workers in overseas jobs. The
paper focusses on a remote rural sample of workers who were not necessarily actively looking
for jobs in an urban labour market, and ﬁnds that the job fairs changed people’s perceptions of
the labour market and encouraged job search in big cities (but had no eﬀect on the probability
of working overseas). Similarly Jensen (2012) ﬁnds that remote rural dwellers increase their
employment when they are given information about available vacancies at nearby towns (see
also Bassi and Nansamba (2017)).

Instead, we focus on a sample of active job-seekers who already know the labour market
well. Our design is not intended to introduce workers to a new labour market or to motivate
them to start looking for work. Rather, we aim to look at how lower barriers to talking
to formal ﬁrms can improve workers’ chances of getting jobs, and update their information
about the jobs they are already looking to get. Similar work focussing on information frictions
in large labor markets includes Groh et al. (2015), who try to match workers and ﬁrms on
the basis of observable characteristics. They are unable to get workers to take up oﬀers for
jobs and interviews, who seem to opt to remain unemployed to look for better work. Pallais
(2014) shows how providing information about workers’ abilities, which they can credibly
communicate to hiring ﬁrms, can improve their prospects in an online labour market.4 Finally,
Abebe et al. (2016) conduct two parallel ﬁeld experiments on how to get job seekers into jobs.
They ﬁnd that improving job-seekers’ ability to engage in directed search through the existing
channels increases their probability of ﬁnding a good job. In the second experiment, they ﬁnd
that improving job-seekers’ applications — with a certiﬁcation programme based on detailed
testing — also improves employment outcomes, by making job search more eﬀective. We
extend this literature not only by testing job fairs as a new kind of intervention to reduce
information frictions, but also by studying both sides of the market. We collect data on the
recruitment decisions of ﬁrms where our job seekers looked for work, and we estimate the
4
    See also Horton (2017), who shows that algorithmic recommendations can increase hiring in the same online
    market. Stanton and Thomas (2015) shows that intermediaries in online markets can help workers and ﬁrms
    to overcome information asymmetries.

impact of the job fairs on the ﬁrms by randomly providing invitations to some of the ﬁrms.

While a literature from developing countries suggests that job-placement services have large
short-run eﬀects on employment outcomes (Card et al., 2010), other work has shown that
                                                  epon et al., 2013).5 A key research question
these eﬀects could be displacing other workers (Cr´
is whether improved matching through any interventions of this kind can improve ﬁrms’
ability to hire good workers; whether this is possible or not has important implications for
whether such interventions can have an impact on the total number of jobs available, or
whether the positive eﬀects of all such programs are likely to be displaced elsewhere.6

We contribute to a literature on how biased beliefs can lead to sub-optimal job search and
employment decisions (Spinnewijn, 2015). DellaVigna et al. (2016) and Krueger and Mueller
(2016) show that recent income levels can cause the unemployed to anchor their reservation
wages at levels that are too high. Our results suggest that the unemployed set their reservation
wages too high because of unrealistic expectations of wages in big formal ﬁrms, which seems
to stem speciﬁcally from a lack of contact with those ﬁrms.7 Our results are the ﬁrst evidence,
to our knowledge, that formal employment rates can be increased through interventions that
bring reservation wages down to more realistic levels.8

There is almost no experimental work focussing on ﬁrm recruitment.9 While a growing lit-
erature uses ﬁeld experiments with ﬁrms to test for binding constraints to growth faced by
those ﬁrms (Bandiera et al., 2011), relatively little attention has been paid to how ﬁrms
may be constrained by their inability to ﬁnd the right workers to hire.10 A large literature
looks at how ﬁrm human resource management can improve ﬁrm performance Bloom and
Van Reenen (2011). In a developing country context (Bloom et al., 2010) show that improved
human resource management practices, which include, for instance, performance-based in-
centive systems for workers, can improve ﬁrm productivity. There is relatively little work on
 5
     Other studies looking at the partial equilibrium eﬀects of job search assistance programs include Altmann
     et al. (2015), Dammert et al. (2015), and Graversen and Van Ours (2008).
 6
     Hardy and McCasland (2015) show that very small ﬁrms seem to be labour constrained: the introduction of
     improved screening mechanisms improves revenues and proﬁts. A long literature suggests that job referrals
     can be used by information constrained ﬁrms to learn about work ability; see for example, Pallais and Sands
     (2016) and Heath (2016).
 7
     By constrast, evidence from South Africa suggests that reservation wages are not out line of available wages,
     and thus are not a contributor to the unemployment problem (Nattrass and Walker, 2005).
 8
     Groh et al. (2015) suggest that young people choose unemployment due to preferences over non-wage
     beneﬁts. By contrast, workers in our sample do not reject oﬀers to remain unemployed. They seem to
     increase their search eﬀort, and indeed ﬁnd jobs shortly after the fairs in other positions.
 9
     One notable exception is Hoﬀman et al. (2015), who show that ﬁrms can improve the quality of workers
     hired by limiting managerial discretion in hiring and relying more directly in standardized test results. In
     another experiment related to ours Hardy and McCasland (2015) study the use of an apprentice placement
     system, which they argue can be used as a novel screening mechanisms for ﬁrms.
10
     Work on audit studies (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004) suggest that ﬁrms face time constraints that in
     some cases lead them to make sub-optimal hiring decisions based on statistical discrimination.

recruitment and hiring as a tool of human resource management.11 We contribute to this
literature by studying how ﬁrms recruit, in a developing country, and by looking at how they
respond to an opportunity to recruit in a completely new way.



2       Data

2.1      Surveys of job seekers

We run the job fairs study with a representative sample of young unemployed people in Addis
Ababa. To draw this sample, we ﬁrst deﬁned geographic clusters using the Ethiopian Central
Statistical Agency (CSA) enumeration areas.12 Our sampling frame excluded clusters within
2.5 km of the center of Addis Ababa, and clusters outside the city boundaries. Clusters
were selected at random from our sampling frame, with the condition that directly adjacent
clusters could not be selected, to minimize potential spill-over eﬀects across clusters.

In each selected cluster, we used door-to-door sampling to construct a list of all individuals in
the cluster who: (i) were 18 or older, but younger than 30; (ii) had completed high school; (iii)
were available to start working in the next three months; and (iv) were not currently working
in a permanent job or enrolled in full time education. We randomly sampled individuals from
this list to be included in the study. Our lists included individuals with diﬀerent levels of
education. We sampled with higher frequency from the groups with higher education. This
ensured that individuals with vocational training and university degrees are well represented
in the study. All selected individuals were contacted for an interview.

We completed baseline interviews with 4,388 eligible respondents. We attempted to contact
individuals by phone for at least a month (three months, on average); we dropped individuals
who could not be reached after at least three attempted calls. We also dropped any individual
who had found a permanent job and who retained the job for at least six weeks. Finally, we
dropped individuals who had migrated away from Addis Ababa during the phone survey. In
all we were left with 4,059 individuals who were are included in our experimental study.

We collected data on study participants through both face-to-face and phone interviews.
We completed baseline face-to-face interviews between May and July 2014 and endline inter-
11
     Oyer and Schaefer (2010) review the literature on hiring, writing, “The literature has been less successful
     at explaining how ﬁrms can ﬁnd the right employees in the ﬁrst place. Economists understand the broad
     economic forces–matching with costly search and bilateral asymmetric information–that ﬁrms face in trying
     to hire. But the main models in this area treat ﬁrms as simple black-box production functions. Less work
     has been done to understand how diﬀerent ﬁrms approach the hiring problem, what determines the ﬁrm-level
     heterogeneity in hiring strategies, and whether these patterns conform to theory.”
12
     CSA deﬁnes enumeration areas as small, non-overlapping geographical areas. In urban areas, these typically
     consist of 150 to 200 housing units.

views between June and August 2015. We collected information about the socio-demographic
characteristics of study participants, their education, work history, ﬁnances and their expec-
tations and attitudes. We also include a module to study social networks. We call all study
participants through the duration of the study. In these interviews we administer a short
questionnaire focused on job search and employment.13

We have low attrition; in the endline survey, we ﬁnd 93.5% of all job-seekers. We cannot
reject the null hypothesis that there are no diﬀerences in attrition rates between treatment
and control individuals when we study each treatment individually, or when we run a joint
test for all treatments. A number of covariates predict attrition. Since none of these variables
is correlated with treatment, we are not worried that this is aﬀecting our results. Table A.8
in the Online Appendix presents the analysis of attrition. Attrition in the phone survey is
also low; for example, we still contact 90% of respondents in the ﬁnal month. Figure A.1 in
the Online Appendix shows the trajectory of monthly attrition rates over the course of the
phone survey.14


2.2      Surveys of ﬁrms

We surveyed 498 large ﬁrms in Addis Ababa. We sampled these ﬁrms to be representative
of the largest employers in the city, stratiﬁed by sector. We included all major sectors in
the economy, including construction, manufacturing, banking and ﬁnancial services, hotels
and hospitality, and other professional services. To sample ﬁrms, we constructed a list of the
largest 2,178 ﬁrms in Addis Ababa. Since no ﬁrm census exists for Ethiopia, we formed our
own ﬁrm sample using a variety of data sources. In all, we gathered data from more than
eight diﬀerent sources; many came from government-maintained lists of formal ﬁrms, from
each ministry for the respective sector covered by that ministry. For the manufacturing sector
we used a representative sample of the largest ﬁrms from the Large and Medium Enterprise
surveys, conducted by the Central Statistics Agency (CSA). Where ﬁrm size was available
for the various sources, we imposed a minimum size cut-oﬀ oﬀ of 40 workers. In other cases
we requested lists of the largest ﬁrms in each sector.

We drew the ﬁrms in our sample using sector-level weights that reﬂect the number of employ-
ers in that sector in the city. We constructed these weights using representative labour force
13
     Franklin (2015) shows that high-frequency phone surveys of this type do not generate Hawthorne eﬀects —
     for example, they do not aﬀect job-seekers’ responses during the endline interview.
14
     We do not report attrition rates at the very beginning of the phone survey since many respondents were
     only contacted for the ﬁrst time in months 2 and 3 of the phone survey, either because they were surveyed
     towards the end of the baseline survey, and because of lags in setting up the phone survey.




                                                       7
data.15 The ﬁrms are, on average, very large by Ethiopian and African standards. The mean
number of employees per ﬁrm is 171.5 workers, but this masks considerable heterogeneity,
particularly in the ‘Tours & Hospitality’ sector, which is dominated by relatively small hotels
and restaurants. Average ﬁrm size, when this sector is excluded, is 326 workers per ﬁrm.
These ﬁrms size numbers are given in Table 1 below. Note that these numbers exclude casual
daily labourers: on average, ﬁrms report employing 34 casual labourers per day.


                                            < Table 1 here. >


The ﬁrms in our sample are growing in size and looking to hire new workers. At the median,
the number of workers that ﬁrms expected to hire in the next 12 months amounts to 12% of
their current workforce. The median rate of hiring was highest (16%) among service sector
ﬁrms, which were also the most likely to come to the job fairs. The most common types of
workers which ﬁrms expected to hire were white collar workers, usually requiring university
degrees. These results are shown in Table A.3 in the Online Appendix.


2.3      Randomization of job-seekers

We assign treatment at the level of geographic cluster, after blocking on cluster characteristics
(see Abebe et al. (2016) for further details). Our sample is balanced across all treatment and
control groups, and across a wide range of outcomes (including outcomes that were not used
in the randomization procedure). We present extensive balance tests in Table A.1. For each
baseline outcome of interest, we report the p-values for a test of the null hypothesis that we
have balance between the experiment and control groups. We cannot reject this null for any
of variables that we study.


2.4      Randomisation of ﬁrms

We assigned ﬁrms to either a treatment group or a control group using block level random-
ization techniques suggested by Bruhn and McKenzie (2009). Firms in the treatment group
were invited to attend the job fairs, while ﬁrms in the control group did not receive an invita-
tion. The following method was used to group ﬁrms together: ﬁrstly, ﬁrms were partitioned
by ﬁve main groups of industry (deﬁned in Table A.5, in the Online Appendix). Then ﬁrms
were partitioned into nearest neighbour groups of four ﬁrms on the basis of Mahalanobis

     Table A.5 in the Online Appendix shows the number of ﬁrms surveyed in our sample, divided into ﬁve main
     categories. Column (2) provides weighted percentages obtained by applying the inverse of the weights used
     to sample the ﬁrms. For instance we surveyed NGOs (“Education, Health, Aid”) relatively infrequently
     because of the large number of NGOs in the data.

two groups in each block of four ﬁrms: two ﬁrms were invited to the job fairs, one ﬁrm on
each of the days, at random. The other two ﬁrms in the group were assigned to the control
group, who were not to be invited to the fairs.

Additionally, we assigned treatment using a re-randomization method. Following the recom-
mendations of Bruhn and McKenzie (2009), we will control in our estimations for the baseline
covariates used for re-randomization (that is, the set of variables described in Table 2) and
for the baseline covariates used to construct the randomization blocks.17

With this sample we have 78% power to detect a small treatment eﬀect on the total number of
pay-roll employees (that is, only 0.2 standard deviations), using a signiﬁcance level of 0.05%.



3       Design and implementation

3.1      The job fairs

We invited treated job-seekers and treated ﬁrms to attend two job fairs. The ﬁrst fair took
place on October 25 and 26, 2014. The second fair took place on February 14 and 15, 2015.
We ran two fairs to ensure that each job-seeker and ﬁrm would have the chance to participate
in at least one of them. The job fairs were held at the Addis Ababa University campus, a
central and well-known location in the capital city. To minimize congestion, each job fair
lasted two days and only half of the ﬁrms and job-seekers were invited to attend on each
day. The ﬁrms that were invited to attend on Saturday 25th (Sunday 26th) of October were
then invited to attend on Sunday 15th (Saturday 14th) of February. On the other hand,
job-seekers invited to attend on the Saturday (Sunday) of the ﬁrst fair were also invited to
attend on the Saturday (Sunday) of the second fair. This ensured that, in each job fair,
job-seekers were exposed to a diﬀerent pool of ﬁrms and ﬁrms were exposed to a diﬀerent
pool of job-seekers.

At the beginning of both fairs, we gave job-seekers (i) a list of all ﬁrms invited to the fair
and (ii) a list of recommended meetings. We created these recommended meetings using
information on ﬁrms’ vacancies obtained from the phone survey which we ran shortly before
the fairs (see the data section). After creating a ranking of workers for each vacancy and
16
     These are listed in Table A.6 in the Online Appendix.
17
     Details of these variables and how they are deﬁned are contained in our detailed pre-analysis plan.

a ranking of vacancies for each worker, a matching algorithm matched workers and ﬁrms;
we discuss this shortly. In the second fair, we introduced two further elements. First, we
gave job-seekers the list of all vacancies, on top of the list of ﬁrms. Second, we gave ﬁrms
a list of all job-seekers invited to the fairs, with some information about their educational
qualiﬁcations and previous work experience. We asked ﬁrms to indicate up to 10 job-seekers
whom they would like to talk to at the job fair. These ‘requested meetings’ were posted on
a small board a few hours after the beginning of the fair. We plan to do in-depth analysis
using data on recommended and requested meetings in future drafts of the paper.

During each fair, workers and ﬁrms were free to interact as they preferred. Each ﬁrm set up a
stall before the job seekers arrived. These stalls were typically staﬀed by the ﬁrm’s HR team,
who brought with them printed material advertising the ﬁrms. In a typical interaction, a job-
seeker would approach the stall of a ﬁrm and ask questions about the ﬁrm and its vacancies.
The ﬁrm’s HR staﬀ would then often also ask about the job-seeker’s skills and experience
and check his or her CV. If the job-seeker looked suitable for one of the vacancies, the ﬁrm
would then invite her or him to attend a formal job interview a few days after the job fair.

We did not restrict the invitation to the fair to unemployed job-seekers or to ﬁrms that had
open vacancies. However, only about 8% of job-seekers had permanent jobs by the time of
the ﬁrst job fair, and thus most job-seekers were still searching for work. Similarly, most ﬁrms
were hiring during the period that the job fairs were held. 89% hired at least one worker in
the year of the experiment. On average ﬁrms hired 52 workers in the year and 4 workers in
the month after the job fairs.

In total, we invited 1,007 job-seekers and 248 ﬁrms to attend fairs. Both job-seekers and
ﬁrms were contacted over the phone, were given some information about the nature of the
fairs and had the opportunity to ask questions. 606 job-seekers attended at least one fair:
a 60% take-up rate. The most common reason that job-seekers gave for not attending the
fairs was that they were busy during that particular weekend. This reason was given by 226
job-seekers in the ﬁrst fair and 229 job-seekers in the second fair. Other reasons included
not being able to take up a job at that time (83 respondents for the second fair, but only
nine respondents for the ﬁrst fair) and ﬁnding that the fair venue was too diﬃcult to reach
(31 respondents for the ﬁrst fair and 25 respondents for the second fair). We ﬁnd that very
few baseline characteristics predict this attendance. This reassures us that our results are
not driven by negative selection of workers into attendance. In fact the two variables that
do predict attendance positively are search eﬀort at baseline, and the use of certiﬁcates for
job search at baseline: it seems that workers who attended the fairs are the more active,
organized, jobs seekers. Those who attended are more likely to have a university degree or
diploma, though the eﬀect is not signiﬁcant.



                                              10
Similarly, 170 ﬁrms attended at least one job fair: a take-up rate of 68.5%. Of the ﬁrms that
did not attend the fairs, 12% reported that this was because they did not have vacancies at the
time. The remaining ﬁrms often cited reasons related to logistics and previous commitments.
13 ﬁrms reported that they thought they would not ﬁnd the job fairs useful.


3.2   The matching algorithm

We provided each job-seeker with a personalized list of 15 ﬁrms that we suggested he or she
should talk to during the job fair; each ﬁrm received a symmetric personalized list, showing
the names of all those job-seekers who had been recommended to meet that ﬁrm. We formed
the list of 15 ﬁrms in two distinct ways. First, we used a Gale-Shapley Deferred Acceptance
algorithm to recommend 10 of the matches (Gale and Shapley, 1962). Second, we augmented
this list by randomly selecting ﬁve additional matches. We randomized the order in which
the 15 matches were presented.

In this context, the matching algorithm was applied as a computational tool to suggest
sensible matches, given baseline characteristics on both job-seekers and ﬁrms. To this end,
we constructed stylized synthetic rankings of vacant positions (for each job-seeker), and of
job-seekers (for each ﬁrm). We constructed ﬁrm rankings of job-seekers using lexicographic
preferences over (i) whether the job-seeker’s occupation matched that of the vacancy, then (ii)
job-seekers’ educational qualiﬁcations, and then (iii) the job-seekers’ number of years in wage
employment. We constructed job-seeker rankings of vacancies using a simple ranking over the
advertised wage (that is, we applied identical rankings for each job-seeker). Of course, these
rankings were not intended literally to represent the true preferences of participants; rather,
they were intended to provide a simple method of purposive matching given a heterogeneous
set of vacancies and job-seeker skills. With these rankings in hand, we then looped 10
times over the Gale-Shapley Algorithm; for each iteration of the loop, we formed a stable
assignment, subject to the constraint that we not match any ﬁrm and job-seeker who had
been matched in any earlier iteration.

Figure 1 illustrates the output of the ranking algorithm. Each point represents a match
recommended by the algorithm; the graph shows which combinations of ﬁrm rankings and
job-seeker rankings generated these recommended matches. The graph illustrates that the
algorithm worked well — in the sense of generally generating matches between ﬁrms and
job-seekers who were, at least on the basis of job-seeker skills and experience, reasonably
suitable for each other. Note the substantial mass at the bottom-left of the graph; this shows
that, at least for those ﬁrms paying reasonably well, the algorithm recommended matches of
suitable occupational ﬁt. (For example, for ﬁrms in the top 100 of job-seekers’ rankings, the
median match was to a job-seeker with a ﬁrm ranking of just 14.)

4       Results: Average eﬀects

4.1      Impact on ﬁrms

In this section, we analyze the impact of the job fairs on our sample of ﬁrms; this follows our
pre-analysis plan.18 We divide outcomes into families. For each outcome of interest we use
an ITT approach with an ANCOVA speciﬁcation; we also include the set of covariates used
for the randomization. We use robust standard errors.19 Speciﬁcally, we estimate:

                             yi = β0 + β1 · fairsi + α · yi,pre + δ · xi0 + µi                 (1)

In this speciﬁcation, the ‘balance’ variables included in xi0 are all the variables listed in Table
2. Variable yic,pre is the dependent variable measured at baseline. Throughout this analysis we
distinguish between professional workers and non-professional workers. ‘Professional workers’
refers to traditional notions of ‘white-collar employees’: typically those with some degree
or diploma, working in relatively highly-trained positions. For manufacturing ﬁrms, ‘non-
professional workers’ refers mostly to labourers or ‘production’ workers; for service-based
ﬁrms, these include mostly ‘client services’ (tellers, waiters, receptionists, etc.) The main
results on ﬁrm outcomes are presented in Tables 3, 4, 10, and 5; in each table, we show each
regression as a row, in which we report the estimated ITT (β  ˆ1 ), the mean of the control group,
and the number of observations. In each case, we report both p-values and False Discovery
Rate q -values, taken across the family of outcomes (Benjamini et al., 2006).

First, in Table 3, we test whether the fairs had an impact on ﬁrms’ recruitment processes,
as measured by ﬁrms’ ability to ﬁll vacancies. We ﬁnd no impact on these outcomes, nor
on how long it took ﬁll positions that were made available, nor on ﬁrms’ reported costs
of recruitment. We do ﬁnd a small but signiﬁcant positive impact of the fairs on unﬁlled
vacancies. That is, ﬁrms reported having more vacancies that they were unable to ﬁll during
the year. (However, this eﬀect becomes marginally insigniﬁcant after we apply multiple
hypothesis testing corrections.)

                                           < Table 3 here. >

In Table 4, we then look at the impact of the job fairs on ﬁrm hiring outcomes at the main
endline survey, which took place about six months after the second job fair. We ﬁnd that

     We do not cluster our errors since randomisation was conducted at the ﬁrm level.


                                                      12
no signiﬁcant impact on the number of people hired by the ﬁrms in the last 12 months, nor
on the types of people hired by the ﬁrms, whether it be hiring of candidates with degrees,
or hiring more candidates on permanent contracts. This suggests that the job fairs did not
signiﬁcantly change how, and whom, ﬁrms hired, over the 12 month period.

                                         < Table 4 here. >

Unsurprisingly, therefore, we ﬁnd no impact of the ﬁrms’ overall work-force composition
(Table 5). We asked ﬁrms about their entire current workforce (not just workers hired in the
last few months). We ﬁnd no impacts on the types of contracts held by diﬀerent workers,
their starting salaries, or the ﬁrms’ assessment of how well qualiﬁed their workers are, on
average.

                                         < Table 5 here. >


4.2      Impact on job seekers

We use the same speciﬁcation as equation 1 to analyze the ITT for job-seekers; we report
results in Tables 6, A.2 and 7. These tables show regressions of key employment and search
outcomes at an endline survey conducted four months after the second job fair. We cluster
errors at the level of the enumeration area in which respondents live, to correct for the fact
that the treatments were randomized at the level of the enumeration area. As in our earlier
results, we report both conventional p-values and False Discovery Rate q -values.

We ﬁnd no average eﬀect on either endline employment outcomes or search methods. This
is hardly surprising, in light of our results on ﬁrms. Table 6 reports eﬀects on employment
outcomes. The eﬀect on key job quality outcomes such as ‘formal’ work or ‘permanent’ work
are positive, but not signiﬁcant. (These estimates are very much in line with the results
suggesting that about 14 job seekers found jobs at the large formal ﬁrms at the job fairs,
which would no doubt have been formal and permanent contracts; this eﬀect would register
as a 1.5 percentage point increase in the probability of having such a job.) We ﬁnd that the
fairs have no impacts on the types of jobs held by workers either.20

                                         < Table 6 here. >

In Table 7, we consider average eﬀects on search methods. We ﬁnd that treated individuals
were more likely to have found jobs by interview. Similarly, we ﬁnd that treated respondents
20
     These results can be found in Table A.2 in the online appendix, which reports eﬀects on employment
     amenities.


                                                   13
were more successful in converting job applications into interviews, and then into oﬀers,
when applying for permanent jobs. However, each of these three results are only marginally
signiﬁcant, and not robust to our multiple hypothesis correction.


                                     < Table 7 here. >



5     Why did we not create more hires?

Why did our fairs not generate more hires, and what can we learn from this about matching
in this labor market? We explore two main types of explanations for our results: ﬁrst, that
the fairs did not generate enough interaction between workers and ﬁrms to allow for hiring
to happen (suggesting that fairs are not an appropriate mechanism for screening workers,
or that they were badly executed events in our case), and second, we look at whether there
simply were not good matches available at the fairs.


5.1   Did the fairs provide enough scope for interaction?

We ﬁnd that 454 job-seekers (75% of those attending) interacted with at least one ﬁrm at the
job fair, according to job-seekers’ reports. Of these, 69 job-seekers (11%) were then formally
interviewed after the job fairs. The same job-seeker would typically contact multiple ﬁrms
and would sometimes be interviewed by more than one ﬁrm. In total, we record 2,191 contacts
between ﬁrms and workers and 105 interviews. Finally, we ﬁnd that 76 job oﬀers were made
at the fairs (to 45 job seekers); in total, 14 job-seekers (2%) were hired. Overall, the job-
seekers who attended a fair secured one interview every 21 informal inquires with the ﬁrms,
one job oﬀer every 1.4 interview and one job every 6.2 interviews approximately. Between
our baseline and endline interview, on the other hand, job-seekers in our sample obtained
an interview every 3.5 job applications, an oﬀer every 1.9 interviews, and a job every 3.3
interviews. From these numbers, two conclusions emerge. First, there was rich interaction
between ﬁrms and job-seekers at the fairs. Second, this interaction lead to surprisingly few
good matches. In this section, we combine data from job-seekers and from ﬁrms to explore
this second ﬁnding.

We begin by exploring whether the more suitable worker-ﬁrm pairs attending the fair — ac-
cording to the rankings we created and the matching algorithm we ran — were likely to meet.
We interpret this as a basic descriptive test of coordination: do participants’ rankings predict
meetings? And, following this, do participants’ synthetic rankings also predict meetings? To




                                              14
test this, we estimate the following dyadic regression models:

                meetf w = β0 + β1 · Rankf w + β2 · Rankwf + µf w                            (2)
                meetf w = β0 + β1 · Gale Shapleyf w + β2 · Randomf w + µf w .               (3)

Depending on the regression, meetf w is a dummy capturing either whether ﬁrm f requested
a meeting with worker w, or whether ﬁrm f and worker w had an actual meeting. We use a
two-way cluster, clustering standard errors both at the level of the ﬁrm and at the level of the
worker (Cameron et al., 2011). We report model estimates in Table 8 below, which we obtain
using the sample of workers and ﬁrms who attended the fairs. We ﬁnd that both rankings
and algorithmic recommendations are predictive of both requested and actual meetings. The
eﬀects are large and signiﬁcant. Moving from the highest to the lowest rank is associated
with an almost 100 percent decrease in the probability of a requested meeting, and about a
halving of the probability of an actual meeting. Further matches suggested by the algorithm
are about 200 percent more likely to happen than matches that were not suggested to workers.
On the other hand, the coeﬃcient on randomly suggested matches is much smaller and is
never signiﬁcant. In one speciﬁcation we can reject that the two coeﬃcients are equal at the
5 percent level. In the other speciﬁcations, the F -test is on the margin of signiﬁcance. We
interpret these ﬁgures as suggesting that suitable worker-ﬁrm pairs were likely to meet at the
job fairs. This rules out that market design issues such as congestion and miscoordination
prevented suitable pairs from meeting each other during the job fairs.


                                     < Table 8 here. >


5.2   Were there not enough good matches available at the fairs?

Prior to arriving at the fairs, ﬁrms were surveyed to ask about their current vacancies: a
roster of diﬀerent positions for which, at the time, they were looking to hire. On average,
we ﬁnd that each ﬁrm was looking to hire for two diﬀerent occupations, and had a total of
seven vacancies available. Only 30% of reporting ﬁrms told us that they had no vacancies at
all. In total, going into the fair, ﬁrms were hiring for 711 diﬀerent vacancies, and looking to
hire a total of 1,751 workers. The occupational composition of the vacancies available at the
ﬁrms exhibits considerable overlap with the occupation composition of the job seekers invited
to the job fairs. Therefore, we can rule out that the ﬁrms did not have suﬃcient vacancies.
We can also rule out that ﬁrms did not interact suﬃciently with workers. On average, each
ﬁrm reports meeting 20 job-seekers through the job fairs that they attended. In the second
job fair, we asked ﬁrms — based on list of job-seekers’ qualiﬁcations — whether there were
individuals whom they were interested in interviewing. Most responded positively, by listing


                                              15
names of several candidates who were of interest to them.

We would only see hires if the expected returns to hiring someone with a signal observed
at the fair was higher than the expected quality of the best recruit made through the usual
hiring channels. Indeed ﬁrms may have already received applications for the positions that
they had open at the time of the fairs. If we assume that the job fairs did work for ﬁrms as
a low cost route to get a more accurate signal of worker ability, then ﬁrms must assess the
quality of a candidate for whom they have a very tight signal of ability against a range of
anonymous CVs received as applications. If the workers at the fairs simply were not very
employable, it would be unlikely that ﬁrms would be likely to invite them for interviews.
If they were invited to the interview stage, they would only be hired if they were indeed
stronger candidates than all other interviewees.

Were the workers who attended the fairs negatively selected from our sample of workers? Only
about 60% of workers came to the fairs: if only those with very low education, motivation
and prospects of employment arrived, it is perhaps not surprising that they did not get
hired. In Table A.4 we regress job-seekers’ attendance at the fairs on a rich set of baseline
characteristics; we ﬁnd no evidence that observably weaker candidates attended. In fact,
the only two outcomes that robustly predict attendance were related to search motivation:
those who were searching the most at baseline, and who were using formal certiﬁcates to
search were mostly likely to attend. Education, gender, and even employment do not predict
attendance. We do ﬁnd that invited youth who were already working at permanent jobs at
the time of the fairs were slightly less likely to attend, but the eﬀect is unlikely to be driving
our results: 4% of attendants at the fairs had permanent jobs, relative to only 5.6% of the
total sample.


5.2.1   Education and experience mismatch?

Given our random sampling strategy, the job seekers in attendance could thus be said to be
representative of the population of young, educated job-seekers. Perhaps large ﬁrms simply
do not hire from this population? In other words, could it be that young people who struggle
to ﬁnd a job immediately out of education will never be able to ﬁnd work at a formal ﬁrm,
and thus any hopes of active labour market policies to get young people into work are doomed
to fail?

We certainly do ﬁnd that ﬁrms prefer to hire from a population that is it diﬀerent to the one
at the fairs. Most importantly, ﬁrms place a high premium on work experience. In the phone
questionnaire after the second job fair, we asked ﬁrms to rate the most employable job-seekers
they met at the job fair, compared to the candidates whom the ﬁrm would have selected for



                                               16
interviews through its normal recruitment channels. Only 12 percent of ﬁrms report that
the most employable job-seeker at the fair would be in the top 20 percent of candidates in
their usual recruitment round. 54 percent of ﬁrms, on the other hand, report that the most
employable job-seeker at the fair would be in the bottom 50 percent of candidates in their
usual recruitment. This is is consistent with the fact that the most common reasons ﬁrms
reported for not hiring more job-seekers at the fairs are ‘insuﬃcient work experience’ (34%
of ﬁrms) and ‘wrong educational qualiﬁcations’ (23%). On the other side of the market,
even workers themselves report that they did not have the required experience for the ﬁrms
present at the job fairs. Many reported that ﬁrms ‘asked for experience’, which few of them
have in the formal sector. More than 65% reported that the main problem with the fairs was
that there were not enough jobs for which they were qualiﬁed.

However, we also ﬁnd evidence that ﬁrms do hire entry level workers without previous normal
experience. After the job fair, we interviewed all ﬁrms about the vacancies they were had
open before the fairs and how successful they were at ﬁlling them. 424 ﬁrms hired 2,018
workers in one month after the job fairs. We ﬁnd that more than 30% of vacancies were
ﬁlled with average experience of zero years. Because ﬁrms often hired many people at once
to ﬁll a particular vacancy, and because they hired more workers for vacancies not requiring
experience, this translates into 65% of all hires made around the time of the fairs being ﬁlled
with inexperienced workers. We compare these hiring patterns to the same ﬁrms’ intentions
when they posted these vacancies: only 13% of vacancies (or a total of 33% of workers the
ﬁrm intended to hire) were meant for workers with no experience. This suggests that ﬁrms
strongly prefer work experience, but are often forced to hire the best entry level candidate that
the can, due to a lack of suitable candidates. Attendance at the job fair had no discernible
eﬀect on whether ﬁrms hired entry level candidates.

Finally, we note that our job-seekers were not mismatched in terms of education. A substan-
tial proportion of our sample (31%) had not continued to post-secondary education. However,
55% of ﬁrm hires made after the fair, and 28% of all vacancies ﬁlled, were of job-seekers who
had not ﬁnished high-school.


5.2.2   Mismatched expectations

It is not implausible, then, that ﬁrms might have hired the types of workers attending the
fairs. However, there may have been other kinds of mismatch leading to a lack of hires at
the fairs. In this section, we explore the related roles of expectations and reservation wages.
In particular, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms came to the fairs with the expectation that they would
be hiring highly skilled professionals, for which higher education (degree or diploma) was
essential. Hiring lower skilled workers for low wage jobs does not usually require considerable


                                               17
recruitment eﬀort on the part of ﬁrms, so the fairs were seen as a chance to head-hunt the
best candidates.

So why were our highly educated workers, with university degrees, not hired at the fairs?
Firms report paying their new recruits with university degrees an average of 4,500 birr per
month. This sum lies well above the reservation wages of university graduates at the fairs:
this was 2,500 birr at the median, and only 10% of workers in our sample had reservation
wages above the average paid for professionals at these ﬁrms. So it is unlikely that the workers
were not interested in the high-skill positions available at the fairs.

Rather, a key constraint emerges: ﬁrms hiring for high-skilled professional position put a par-
ticular premium on work experience for these positions. In particular, only 22% of vacancies
ﬁlled by workers with post-secondary education were ﬁlled by workers with no experience,
compared to 52% of vacancies ﬁlled for high-school graduates (or below). Yet very few of
the tertiary educated job seekers in our sample had any experience at all (only 20% had had
any kind of formal work experiences). Firms may have been unwilling to hire them because
of the costs of training a worker with no experience, or to take the risk of hiring someone
without a reference letter from a previous employer.

By contrast, however, lower-skilled workers may have had over-inﬂated expectations about
the salaries they could aspire to in the market. We explore this possibility in Table 9. Workers
without degrees in our sample report reservation wages with median 1,400 birr per month.
Yet ﬁrms that hired individuals with no degree (or diploma) and no experience paid a median
wage of only 855 birr. It may be the case that any possible low-skilled vacancies that might
have been ﬁlled at the fairs did not happen because the workers were unhappy with the
wages they were oﬀered. So, even though ﬁrms have been willing to hire entry level workers
without experience, the workers did not take the oﬀers because of unrealistic expectations.
Recall that workers reported receiving quite a few job oﬀers at the fairs, but only 33% of
workers accepted at least one of those oﬀers. Do the oﬀers and rejections ﬁt with this story of
mismatched expectations across diﬀerent levels of education? We ﬁnd that a total of 76 oﬀers
were made to 45 diﬀerent workers. Of those oﬀers fully 55 were made to low skilled workers,
with the remaining 21 going to those with diplomas or degrees. All oﬀers made to low-skilled
workers were to workers with no previous work experience. The low skilled workers accepted
only 8 of those positions (14.5%) while higher skilled workers accepted 6 (28.5%).


                                     < Table 9 here. >


It also seems that workers and ﬁrms had mismatched expectations: ﬁrms have may have
overestimated the ease with which they could ﬁnd experienced workers with tertiary education
at the fairs; workers with degrees may have been impressed by the salaries on oﬀer by the

                                              18
ﬁrms, but disappointed to ﬁnd that the experience required to get those jobs was beyond
their reach. Finally, while ﬁrms seem to have met low educated workers at the fairs and had
an interest in hiring them, these ﬁrms were used to recruiting such workers very easily, and
with low wages, on the open market. The job seekers at the fairs, though ambitious, may
have been surprised to hear how little even these formal ﬁrms were oﬀering for low skilled
positions. In the next section we study how the experience of attended the fairs may have
inﬂuence the expectations of both workers and ﬁrms, and thus may have altered their job
search and recruitment behaviour.



6    Indirect eﬀects and learning

The job fairs did not generate very many hires. But workers and ﬁrms came into the fairs
with mismatched expectations about the types of matches they were likely to make. Did the
fairs have some impact on their search and recruitment behaviour after the fairs?

To answer this question, we now explore changes in job-seekers’ search behaviour and in ﬁrms’
recruitment activities. We ﬁnd clear evidence that both job-seekers and ﬁrms increased their
eﬀorts at search through formal channels. In particular, workers were more likely to visit the
job boards during the weeks after the job fairs. Figure 2 below plots the fortnight-speciﬁc
treatment eﬀect of the job fairs, relative to fortnight 0 (when the ﬁrst job fairs were held) and
fortnight 8 (when the second job fair was held). These eﬀects were estimated using weekly
phone call surveys conducted with all job seekers in our sample, throughout the course of the
study. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant eﬀects — albeit short-lived — on the probability of visiting the
job boards after each of the two fairs.


                                     < Figure 2 here. >


In Table 10, we study the impacts on ﬁrms’ recruitment activities outside of the job fairs.
That is, we asked ﬁrms about their methods of advertising for vacant positions, and whether
they conducted interviews with the applicants who applied. We ﬁnd that ﬁrms invited to the
job fairs were about six percentage points more likely in the last 12 months to have advertised
for new hires (on a control mean of about 79%); they were 12 percentage points more likely to
have advertised for professional positions (control mean: about 60%). They were also more
likely to be using the job vacancy boards: the main place for attracting formal applications.
All three results are signiﬁcant, including after controlling for multiple hypothesis testing.


                                    < Table 10 here. >


                                               19
This suggests that the fairs increased beliefs about the returns to searching for jobs through
the usual formal methods, for both workers and ﬁrms that attended. The discussion in the
previous section suggests that these impacts on beliefs should diﬀer between high- and low-
skilled workers. Low-skilled workers came to the fairs with unrealistically high expectations
of the wages they could earn if they were hired, while the high-skilled workers were over-
optimistic about their chances of ﬁnding a job without a strong record of work previous work
experience.

To pursue this analysis further, we look at how diﬀerent workers were inﬂuenced diﬀerently
by the fairs. First, we ﬁnd that job seekers with worse employment prospects (lower educa-
tion, and no previous work experience) are driving the overall eﬀect on formal job search. We
generate a single measure of labour market attachment, based on the predicted probability
of ﬁnding a permanent or formal job at endline determined with a set of pre-speciﬁed base-
line covariates, and using the ‘leave-one-out’ estimator developed by Abadie et al. (2013).21
We ﬁnd that the strongest predictors of permanent work at endline are education, use of
certiﬁcates in applications, and previous work experience. While women and individuals
living further from the city have lower labour market attachment on average, they are not
signiﬁcantly worse after controlling for education and experience.

In Figure 3, we look at the shape of treatment eﬀects by baseline predictions of access to
good work; we look separately at the number of visits to the job boards (Panel A) and at
the probability of having permanent work in the past week (Panel B). In each case, we show
point estimates and 90% conﬁdence intervals for both treated and control job-seekers.


                                            < Figure 3 here. >


We ﬁnd that job seekers with low predicted baseline probability of ﬁnding a good formal job
signiﬁcantly increased their number of trips to the boards, with no similar eﬀect for those
with a high labour market attachment (indeed, if anything, higher types reduce their job
search after the fairs, though the result is not signiﬁcant). Further, in Panel B, we show that
this increased job search lead to signiﬁcantly higher probability of ﬁnding a permanent job
for this low attachment group. Again, this increase in good employment is unlikely to have
come through direct hiring at the job fairs, but rather though the channel of increased job
search outside of the fairs. Interestingly, we also ﬁnd suggestive evidence of negative impacts
on permanent employment among those with higher predicted probability of good work.

To test more formally for heterogeneous eﬀects, we split our sample in two, at the median
of predicted probability of formal work, and study diﬀerences in the eﬀect of the fairs in the
21
     The results are robust to predicting just permanent work, and to using a larger range of dependent variables,
     in addition to our core set of heterogeneity variables.

two groups. The results (in Figure 4) are stark: among the high-types, the fairs reduced
substantially the probability of having wage employment, and the probabilities of having
formal employment and permanent work — leading to a shift into self-employment. By
contrast, the low-types experience an increase in formal and permanent work. They are also
more likely to be working at larger ﬁrms. We ﬁnd that overall the fair helped bring jobseekers
connect to large ﬁrms. In particular, individuals invited to the job fair are a signiﬁcant 4.2
points (15 percent) more likely to work in a ﬁrm with more than 10 employees. These eﬀects
are overwhelmingly concentrated among the low skilled workers. We conﬁrm this result by
looking at heterogeneous outcomes according to whether a job seeker only completed high
school or went on to tertiary education. Figure A.2 in the Online Appendix conﬁrms that
high school (low-skilled) graduates experienced increases in formal work, while those with
tertiary education were more likely to be in self-employment.


                                   < Figure 4 here. >


What could explain these eﬀects? Recall that wages paid for high-skilled work by ﬁrms at the
fairs are much higher than reservation wages of workers, while wages page for low-skilled work
were much lower. If high-type workers have unrealistic expectations about their ability to get
high-paying formal jobs, they may have been unpleasantly surprised by the strict experience
requirements imposed by ﬁrms at the fairs. Given that many of the ﬁrms at the fair were
well-known brands in the local market, where they may have aspired to ﬁnd work, this might
have lead them to give up hope for ﬁnding a good formal job. In response, they were less
likely to take wage employment, and shifted into the entrepreneurial sector. By contrast, the
low-types may also have been impressed by the wages available in higher-skilled positions,
but also realised that they were substantially over-estimating the wages available to them
from formal ﬁrms for low skill work. This may have prompted a stark realisation: the high-
skill professional jobs were much harder to get than they thought, while the the low-skilled
jobs that they were oﬀered paid very low wages. They may have adjusted their expectations
downward. To test this, we test the eﬀect of the job fairs on reservation wages. In Panel A
Figure 5, we ﬁnd that low skilled workers signiﬁcantly reduce their reservation wages after
the job fairs, while the higher type candidates did not. By contrast, higher type candidates
did become less optimistic about their prospects for being oﬀered wage work: Panel B of 5
shows an increase the numbers of weeks that expected to wait for a job oﬀer.

7       Conclusion

We run a job fair in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where we bring together unemployed job-seekers
and ﬁrms looking to hire. We facilitate interactions between workers by suggesting matches
based a Gale-Shapley algorithm — and by providing information about workers education
and ﬁrms vacancies. We ﬁnd that the workers who attended the fair were not very diﬀerent
from the types whom the ﬁrms usually hired, and that the fairs generated a rich set of
interactions between workers and ﬁrms. However, only 14 workers were hired as a direct
result of interactions at the job fairs. Firms invited to the fairs were not signiﬁcantly more
likely to hire; invited job-seekers were no more likely to ﬁnd work.

The reasons for the failure of the job fairs to generate jobs provide several lessons about
the working of labour markets. Two key problems arose. First, for high-skilled professional
jobs, ﬁrms prefer to hire workers with more experience.22 Therefore, more educated job
seekers at the fairs received few oﬀers at the fairs, and reported that they did not have
the required experience for these formal sector jobs. Second, for low-skilled vacancies, ﬁrms
seemed willing to hire at the fairs, but lower-skilled workers received oﬀers comfortably below
their reservation wages; indeed, lower-skilled workers received many oﬀers, but rejected most
of them.

We ﬁnd evidence of learning in the aftermath of the fairs. High-skilled workers seem to have
realized that their lack of experience put most of these formal jobs beyond their reach. They
were less optimistic about their chances of ﬁnding work in the future, and less likely to be
engaged in formal employment, but more likely to be self-employed. Low-skilled workers seem
to have revised down their reservation wages after the fairs, and also to have signiﬁcantly
increased their job search eﬀort through formal methods. Four months after the job fairs,
they are considerably more likely to have found a formal job. In short, we conclude that
mismatched expectations — among both job-seekers and ﬁrms — can generate important
labour market frictions.




22
     This is consistent with Tervi¨o (2009), who shows that ﬁrms can often over-invest in hiring among workers
     with existing experience, instead of investing more in the recruitment of talented workers with less observable
     skills.

     Notes: This table report the estimates of model 2. The highest ranked worker and ﬁrm are assigned a value of zero. Lower ranks corresponds to higher
     numbers. Standard errors are corrected for two-way clustering at the level of the worker and at the level of the ﬁrm. The last row reports the p-value of an
     F -test of the hypothesis that the eﬀect of the algorithmic and the random suggestion are the same.
