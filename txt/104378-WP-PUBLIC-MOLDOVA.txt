The lack of adequate forest cover represents a significant environmental and economic challenge for the Republic of
Moldova. The resulting degradation and erosion of agricultural land adversely affect rural communities. Manifestations
of soil erosion are a serious problem for about one-third of all agricultural and community land in the country. The
ensuing decline in soil fertility has reduced crop yields by more than one-half in some areas. Most of the affected land
is in small, patched areas of fewer than 10 hectares, with little or no economic and/or environmental value. Such land
has remained in community ownership as “marginal land,” with little interest in its privatization and/or utilization for
economic or community purposes. Addressing the problem of “marginal land” by reclaiming its economic and/or
environmental value through forestation, while preventing further degradation, is an important instrument in
empowering rural communities and ultimately reducing rural poverty.
The Project Development Objective is to restore degraded land through forestation to increase economic and
environmental use for the benefit of rural communities. In addition to community benefits, the project’s forestation
activities would support, through the restored productivity and conservation of the soil, the global objectives of carbon
sequestration and a reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.
The project sets out to create community forests and protective forest belts on an area of at least 8,157 hectares, with
ensuing estimated emission reductions of 2.8 million tons of CO2 over 30 years. In addition, the project is providing
technical assistance to participating communities for improving forest and pasture management. The carbon
sequestration activities of the project were validated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) Clean Development Mechanism procedures, allowing for carbon payments from the BioCarbon
Fund to begin.
Results achieved:
The project has successfully supported:
1. The forestation of more than 10,000 hectares of degraded land (2,000 more than the initial target), resulting in an
     estimated sequestration of 600,000 tons of CO2 over the project’s five-year duration.
2. A national competitive grant scheme for participating communities to provide grant funding for localized capacity
     building and improvements in forest and pasture management.
Key Partners: The World Bank team works closely with: (i) Moldsilva (State Forestry Agency), which is the
implementing agency; (ii) the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Moldova; and (iii) selected local
communities.
Key Development Partners include the Government of Japan, which provided grant funding through a Climate
Change Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) facility.

economic and/or environmental value through forestation, while preventing further degradation, is an important
instrument in empowering rural communities and ultimately reducing rural poverty.
The Project Development Objectives are to restore a total of 20,000 hectares of degraded agricultural land to
productive uses for rural communities and to build capacity for the community-based management of 5,400 hectares
of these lands. In addition to community benefits, the project’s forestation activities support, through the restored
productivity and conservation of the soil, the global objectives of carbon sequestration and a reduction of atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations.
The project has set out to restore the productivity of degraded pastureland by means of forestation with tree and shrub
species adapted to adverse site conditions, while also ensuring estimated emission reductions of 1.9 million tons of
CO2 by 2015. In addition, technical assistance has been provided to participating communities for improving the
pasture management capacity.
Results achieved:
The two projects have successfully supported:
 1. The forestation of 20,300 hectares. As a result, the project host, Moldsilva, the State Forestry Agency, is receiving
       regular carbon payments for an estimated total of 1.9 million tons of CO2 to be sequestered by 2017.
 2. The methodology applied in the two projects was successfully registered with the UNFCCC (AR-AM0002) and
       can now be applied to other forestation/reforestation projects in the world.
 3. The projects have supported the implementation of a national competitive grant scheme for participating
       communities that provided grants to more than 50 localities for capacity-building activities aimed at improving
       the management of more than 6,000 hectares of community land (mostly pastures).

The Republic of Moldova is struggling with a legacy of a vast bureaucracy its excessive and redundant procedures that
result in delays in the provision of public services. Therefore, it began a dramatic turnaround about four years ago by
adopting an e-transformation strategy designed to speed up and streamline government service delivery, fight
corruption, and promote transparency by placing public services online, adopting an open data policy, and promoting
digital tools.
Project Description. The project has two components:
Component 1. e-Leadership Capacity and Enabling Environment: provides support to the e-Government
Center; e-Leadership training and civil servant capacity building; strategic communications and partnerships; the
development of policy, technical, legal, and regulatory frameworks; and project management.
Component 2. Shared Infrastructure and e-Services Development: provides funding for: (a) establishing and
implementing the M-Cloud (Government Cloud Computing Infrastructure); and (b) developing a selected number of
e-government services and shared platforms and applications.
Results achieved to date:
(a) E-Government Center and sectorial e-Transformation Coordination Units were established to coordinate e-
     government initiatives government-wide.
(b) E-Government Policy and more than 40 legislative and sub-legislative acts were approved.
(c) Government-shared computing infrastructure “M-Cloud” was launched.
(d) Open Government Data and Government Services Portals were launched.
(e) A number of e-services and shared platform services were launched: e-Applications for Criminal Record and
     Activity Licensing, e-Registration to Social and Health Insurances Systems, e-Procurement, Governmental
     Documents and Records Management System, M-Signature, M-Pay, e-Visa, etc.
(f) More than 2,000 public servants and other employees of central and local public agencies have received e-
     government training under the project.
Key Partners. The World Bank works closely with the State Chancellery, which is responsible for executing the project
through the e-Government Center. The National e-Transformation Council and the Ministry of Information
Technology and Communications are playing a major role in driving and approving information and communications
technology (ICT) policy, legal, and technical frameworks.
Key Development Partners include the Government of the Netherlands, which has provided complementary
financial assistance, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID), which are engaged in e-government reforms.

           The Government of the Republic of Moldova is pursuing a policy agenda to support export-led economic growth. To
           achieve this goal, the Moldova 2020 national development strategy focuses on improving the business-enabling
           environment and promoting better access to finance for enterprises as two of its top priorities. The 2014 Roadmap
           for Increasing Competitiveness also focuses on the need to improve competitiveness at the enterprise level. Therefore,
           the Second Competitiveness Enhancement Project (CEP II) will help the Ministry of Economy achieve its reform
           objectives by supporting implementation of: the Government’s regulatory reform strategies, programs to support
           export growth and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development, and initiatives to improve access to
           medium- and long-term finance for export-oriented enterprises.
           The Project Development Objective is to increase the export competitiveness of Moldovan enterprises and decrease
           the regulatory burden they face. This objective will be achieved through a set of measures that aim to: (i) improve the
           business environment through regulatory reforms that reduce the cost of doing business; (ii) help SMEs and exporters
           to get access to business development services; and (iii) improve access to medium- and long-term finance for export-
           oriented enterprises.
           Key Results Expected:
           1. Reduction in management time spent meeting regulatory requirements, from 10.7 percent in 2013 to 8.5 percent
                in 2020 (as reported in the annual domestic Cost of Doing Business survey)
           2. Increase in new export-oriented activities2 by matching grant recipients, with at least 50 percent of matching
                grant recipients engaged in a new export-oriented activity by project close
           3. Increase in lending to export-oriented enterprises by participating financial intermediaries (PFIs), with average

Moldova is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, particularly droughts and floods that have significant social and
economic costs. The incidence of such events has seen a marked upward swing in the past 10 years. Moldova is also
situated in a seismic zone, leaving it vulnerable to powerful, potentially damaging earthquakes. Its vulnerability to
natural disasters is accentuated by a lack of proper forecasting of weather events, an obsolete infrastructure, a poor
institutional setup to manage post-disaster situations, and other limiting capacity issues. Another emerging adverse
factor is the increasing climate variability and the uncertainty it brings to agricultural production and thus to the
livelihoods of farmers and the country’s food security.
The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the State Hydro-Meteorological Service’s ability to forecast
severe weather and improve Moldova’s capacity to prepare for and respond to natural disasters.
The project aims to strengthen the institutional, human, and technical capacity for: (i) enhanced weather monitoring
and early warning systems for weather-related hazards that can produce timely and accurate hydro-meteorological
forecasts and services; (ii) improved management and response times to natural and man-made disasters; and (iii)
assistance to farmers for awareness of, and adaptation to, natural hazards and climate variability.
Results achieved:
 Operation of a dual polarization Doppler radar system resulting in improved precision of forecasting severe
  weather.
 Establishment of the country’s Emergency Command Center for disaster coordination response.
 Implementation of a Just-in-Time Mobile Communication Platform for the delivery of weather information to
   farmers via mobile technologies.
 Implementation of more than 50 pilot subprojects aimed at generating and disseminating knowledge about the
   practical application of agricultural technologies resilient to climate risks.
Key Partners: The World Bank team works closely with the: (i) Ministry of the Environment, (ii) Ministry of Internal
Affairs, and (iii) Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry.
Key Development Partners: Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA); the project will
benefit from Sida support (US$100,000) for theoretical and practical activities aimed at strengthening the capacity for
disaster preparedness and response.

Over the past 20 years, the Government of Moldova made good progress in strengthening family medicine and hospital optimization
and ensuring universal access to primary health care regardless of a citizen’s insurance status. While good progress has also been
made in reducing death rates among younger age groups, mortality in adult males has increased. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)
have become the major burden of mortality and illness in the population, with high blood pressure (hypertension) and smoking
among the leading NCD risks. Notably, around 50 percent of Moldovan adults have high blood pressure. Adult smoking prevalence
is 43 percent, compared to the regional average of 31 percent.
With total health expenditure per capita at around US$360, Moldova spends significantly more on health than comparable countries.
However, Moldova’s health outcomes are less than expected given the level of health expenditures. The discrepancy between
Moldova’s health expenditures and its performance in health outcomes points to the need to improve the effectiveness of healt h
expenditures in delivering results for health.
To this end, the World Bank developed the Program-for-Results operation to support the Government in addressing the challenges
related to NCDs, achieving better value for money and the delivery of better health outcomes.
The Project Development Objectives are to contribute to reducing the key risks for NCDs and improving the efficiency of health
services in Moldova. The Health Transformation Operation (HTP) is guided by the National Health Policy 2007–2021 and is further
operationalized in the National Health Sector Development Strategy 2008 –2017 with financial support from the Medium-Term
Budget Framework (MTBF).
HTP consists of a program-for-results instrument with an investment project financing (IPF) component aimed at supporting the
Government in meeting the agreed disbursement-linked results. It is expected that the operation will address a range of
interconnected sector issues by: (i) contributing to further policy developments in the area of hospital optimization while also
reducing acute care hospital beds and further shortening the average length of stay at hospitals, (ii) reducing the smoking prevalence
among adults, and (iii) facilitating better management of hypertension.
The IPF instrument aims to address the following technical capacity constraints: (1) strengthening of a diagnostic-related group
payment mechanism for hospitals, (2) development of performance-based incentives for efficiency and quality in health care, (3)
development of strategies to optimize hospital networks, and (4) monitoring and evaluation of project results (disbursement-linked
indictors [DLIs]).
Key challenges:
1. Due to the program-for-results disbursement to the general budget and the weak MTBF process, the key challenge is to ensure
    that project proceeds are not diverted to finance other sector needs.
2. Achievement of NCD-related results is largely dependent on cooperation from other sectors and counterparts. Notably, the
    prevalence of smoking could be reduced only if there is a combination put in place of tax-related measures and a ban on public
    smoking.
3. Achievement of sensitive results related to hospital optimization would require continued government commitment and
    support, which is subject to the reconfirmation of the current political leadership.
Key Partners: The World Bank team works closely with the: (i) Ministry of Health, which is responsible for implementing the IPF
part of the project (technical assistance component) and reporting to the World Bank on the results achieved; and (ii) National
Health Insurance Company (CNAM), which is also responsible for project implementation and the achievement of specific results.
Additionally, activities under the project involve close cooperation with National Centre for Health Management (NCHM) and the
National Centre for Public Health (NCPH), which are subordinated to the Ministry of Health.
Key Development Partners are the EU, the World Health Organization (WHO), Swiss Development and Cooperation Agency
(SDC), German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), and other relevant UN agencies engaged in the health sector that
have been running complementary financing operations and that coordinate with the World Bank team on policy issues.

Moldova’s spending on social assistance continues to be high compared to the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional
average of about 1.7 percent of GDP, and even higher when compared to International Development Association
(IDA) countries. In 2014, the Government of Moldova spent about 2 percent of GDP on social assistance programs,
most of which are poorly targeted categorical benefits. Reforms launched in 2009–10 helped improve the financial
sustainability and equity of the social safety net through the expansion of targeted cash transfers such as Ajutor Social
and the Heating Allowance and the elimination of some inefficient categorical benefits.
The Project’s Development Objective is to improve the efficiency and equity of Moldova’s social safety net through
a fiscally sustainable expansion and strengthening of the Ajutor Social program. The objective is to be achieved by:
 Supporting the interim transitional costs of expanding the Ajutor Social program and consolidating other benefits
  for the fiscal sustainability of the social safety net.
 Implementing measures to enhance the administrative efficiency of the social safety net through strengthened
    institutional roles and capacities, improved operating procedures and systems, and better outreach and greater
    awareness of the need for reforms.
The Project has two components. The first component cofinances the scaling-up of the two targeted cash transfer
programs (the Ajutor Social and Heating Allowance), while supporting the consolidation and downsizing of other
category-based benefits. It links disbursements to the achievement of specific results measured by “disbursement-
linked indicators” (DLIs). The second component invests in strengthening the institutions responsible for the design
and administration of the social assistance system, with a focus on the Ajutor Social program.
Results achieved:
 After showing good progress in 2011–12, the project has experienced difficulties because the coverage of the
  targeted cash transfers has shrunk. In late 2014, the beneficiary take-up significantly intensified. The targeted
  benefits coverage is now gaining momentum, which is critical to achieving the project’s objectives and to
  supporting poor households in time of economic crisis. The launch of the new management information system
  eliminated most of the paper-based procedures and streamlined the benefits application. The turn-around time
  for Ajutor Social application processing was reduced from 30 to 11 days between 2010 and 2014.
 Establishment of the Social Inspection unit helped reduce losses from fraud and errors in the social benefits system
   by 29 percent relative to 2010.

Challenges:
Moldova’s climate and relatively high soil fertility give the country a comparative advantage in growing most temperate fruits
and vegetables. The production and sale of fresh fruits and vegetables offer the highest potential for increased incomes from
domestic sales and exports. However, the transition to more profitable crops, as well as more profitable market segments,
continues to be hampered by high capital requirements for post-harvest infrastructure and the stringency of end-market
safety and quality requirements. In addition, current farming patterns and ubiquitous land fragmentation lead to the
proliferation of unsustainable land management practices that need to be curbed in order to reduce land productivity losses.
The Project Development Objective is to enhance the competitiveness of the agro-food sector by supporting the
modernization of the food safety management system, facilitating market access for farmers, and mainstreaming agro-
environmental and sustainable land management practices.
The objectives will be achieved through activities aimed at: (i) strengthening country capacity to manage the increasingly
complex food safety agenda; (ii) increasing the levels of farmer organization and improving the post-harvest infrastructure;
and (iii) promoting the adoption of sustainable land management practices by farmers and ensuring a strengthened response
by the authorities to soil degradation challenges.
Results achieved:
a) Under Component 1: Enhancing Food Safety Management, the country’s Food Safety Agency, a relatively new institution
   established in 2012, has largely become functional due to the support of the ACP. Three major civil works activities are
   under way: the rehabilitation of the Food Safety Agency building and the construction of the Border Inspection Points
   in Tudora on the country’s southeastern border with Ukraine and in Criva on the northern border with Ukraine.
   Procurement of civil works for another three border inspection points—Leuseni (west), Giurgiulesti (south), and Criva
   (North) - has been completed and works are expected to commence in the next few weeks. Procurement of works for
   the construction of the country’s national reference laboratory for the safety of products of vegetable origin (Balti) has
   been completed. Capacity-strengthening activities at the national reference laboratory for the safety of products of animal
   origin and animal health aimed at future international accreditation are also advancing. Additionally, the Food Safety
   Agency continues to receive support for legislative and regulatory improvements, capacity-building activities, training,
   and knowledge transfer from various international food safety institutions.
b) Under Component 2: Enhancing Market Access Potential, two calls for proposals for matching investment grants from emerging
   productive partnerships have been completed to date. The first one, carried out in 2014, resulted in awards of US$1.65
   million to eight newly created producer groups for a variety of investments in post-harvest processing and the handling
   of apples, table grapes, and berries. A second call, which ended on January 30, 2015, resulted in a yield of four very solid
   proposals amounting to US$0.8 million. In parallel, implementation of outreach activities has continued to focus on
   raising awareness about the project’s competitiveness-enhancing opportunities for fruit and vegetable growers and also
   about the quality of Moldovan fresh fruits in order to increase domestic consumption.
c) Under Component 3: Enhancing Land Productivity Through Sustainable Land Management, all activities related to the rehabilitation
   of protective shelter-belts have been implemented on schedule, and the equipment that was procured for these purposes
   is being utilized efficiently by two mobile mechanized agro-forestry squads. The component’s sustainable land–managed
   grant scheme has been launched and the first two calls for proposals yielded 91 awards for an amount of approximately
   US$0.7 million. A second, recently closed call resulted in an additional pool of 80 applications.

Moldova was one of the first countries to join the Global Partnership for Social Accountability.
The Project Development Objectives are to empower each member country’s civil society to: (i) engage local,
regional, and national authorities in evidence-based policy and budget dialogue in its education sector; and (ii) promote
an enabling environment for social accountability. The project includes the following specific objectives:
 Facilitate engagement of local stakeholders in approximately 100 schools using social accountability tools and
    promoting a dialogue on school budgets.
 Facilitate the flow of information from users of education services to local and national authorities.
 Promote the use of three new social accountability tools as inputs into formal education budgetary processes.
 Inform the public about the impact of wider economic and financial conditions on the education sector and
    reforms (e.g., current situation, availability of budgetary resources, forecast).
 Support the Ministry of Education and other policy stakeholders in improving the quality of data to better support
    an evidence-based policy-making process.
Results achieved:
1. New “Scoala Mea” platform launched under the project facilitates citizens’ engagement in and the monitoring of
    the quality of education service delivery.
2. Social accountability tools have been developed, promoted, and used for the oversight of the education sector,
    such as stakeholders’ report cards and public hearings about the school budgets, which are new concepts for
    Moldova. Budget analyses of schools with infographics have been made and presented by the implementing
    agency Expert-Grup (a model applied in participating schools and beyond).
3. Training on social accountability tools have been delivered to regional partners and other stakeholders of the
    project.
4. The Education Sector Open Data Readiness report has been developed, covering dimensions of leadership;
    legal, policy, and institutional frameworks; responsibilities and skills; sector data; demand for open data; and the
    funding of relevant initiatives and national infrastructure (with relevant policy recommendations).
    The Ministry of Education supported the initiative, including through opening education data, for example,
    opening baccalaureate exams results for the 2013 and 2014 school years, the first time ever since Moldova’s
    independence, making school budgets for 2013 and 2014 public, and ensuring legal grounds for open data in the
    new Education Code that entered into force in November 2014.

The Project Development Objective is to demonstrate through pilot activities that local governments can
successfully apply national policies to promote the integration of children with disabilities into the mainstream
education system.
Children with disabilities can be successfully integrated into mainstream education and supported in achieving better
learning outcomes through the provision of equal educational opportunities. The project aims to demonstrate that this
can be achieved through adequate planning, infrastructure investments, teacher training, and community awareness
and mobilization. By bringing educators, parents, communities, and local authorities together to help kids benefit from
inclusive education, the project aims to build “models of inclusiveness” that can be replicated across Moldova. In the
process, the project aims to address the following constraints and challenges related to the integration of children with
disabilities into mainstream education. First, the funds are used to help district authorities in rolling out the National
Program for the Development of Inclusive Education, including support in assessing the number of children with
disabilities and in addressing school infrastructure needs and adequate teacher training. Second, a focus is placed on
carrying out 20 demonstration subprojects aimed at the rehabilitation and refurbishment of school facilities to ensure
that they are accessible and that they meet the educational needs of children with disabilities, in addition to providing
relevant training for parents, teachers, and the community. Third, support is channeled toward the dissemination of
experiences and good practices to encourage the national replication of successful practices concerning the integration
of children with disabilities into mainstream schools. Integration can be considered successful if it is achieved with
improved community support and if it improves educational outcomes for the children. The key performance
indicators thus include:
1. Increased participation of school-aged children with disabilities in mainstream education, as measured by the increase
in school-years completed in the district in nonresidential schools by children certified as having a disability;
2. Decreased share of people who think that children with disabilities should not go to mainstream schools and
kindergartens (from an estimated 45 to 30 percent); and
3. Improved learning environment for children with disabilities and special education needs in 20 pilot schools as
measured by the availability of trained educational personnel (including teachers and support staff) and accessible
physical infrastructure.
Results achieved: Despite the delayed effectiveness caused by the ratification of the grant, this initiative already has
a number of visible results. Solid progress has been made on mapping schools and designing the raion (district) action
plans for inclusive education in pilots.
Key Partners: Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labor, Social Protection and Family, Moldova Social
Investment Fund and local authorities.
Key Development Partners. Government of Japan, UNICEF, LUMOS Foundation.
The grant is funded by the Government of Japan, administered by the World Bank and implemented through the
Moldova Social Investment Fund (MSIF). Furthermore, UNICEF, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of
Labor, Social Protection and Family actively participate in the project as members of the Project Supervisory Board.

Moldova was one of the countries that benefited from the US$1 million allocation provided by the Russian
Government under Multi-Donor Programmatic Trust Fund for Europe and Central Asia Public Finance Management.
The Project Development Objective is to enhance Moldova’s public external audit function by increasing the
effectiveness of audit work and strengthening the capacity of the Court of Accounts. It is in line with the goals of the
Court of Accounts as outlined in its Strategic Development Plan for FY11–15.
The key components are the following:
(i) Strengthen the capacity to conduct performance audits in specialized areas, including development of
     methodological guidelines, provision of training, and measurement of impact of audit reports produced by the
     Court of Accounts;
(ii) Enhance performance systems for effective development and deployment of human resources on audit
     engagements.
Results Achieved:
The project started with a significant delay due to the slow ratification of the grant, but as of now, all the activities
envisaged under this grant are fully operational and are expected to be completed by project closing. Under the first
component, two pilot performance audits of independent regulatory bodies have been initiated under the guidance and
support provided by the international consultant. In addition, several training sessions on techniques of performance
audit were carried out for the court’s staff. The performance audit manual has been revised and updated in line with
international standards and practices.
Key Partners: The World Bank team works closely with the Court of Accounts, which is responsible for the overall
implementation of the project.
Key Development Partners: The Russian Government, whose funds the World Bank is administering for the purpose
of this project. Other development partners include Swedish National Audit Office and the European Union, which
are providing complementary support to the Court of Accounts in implementing its Development Strategy.

The Project Development Objective is to promote the transfer of new, environmentally sustainable renewable
energy technology through piloting the use of animal manure for biogas-based heating and electricity production at
the farm level. To raise awareness and create a market for this new technology, the project has three main components:
Component 1: Enabling legislative and policy environment;
Component 2: Technical assistance, capacity building, and awareness raising on sound animal waste management and
animal manure-based biodigester and electricity generation technologies
Component 3: Biodigester investment grants.
Results achieved:
     Extensive training and outreach program has been completed. Through outreach and awareness-raising
      activities, over 18,000 participants from farms and households have been reached through 1,840 events, including
      579 workshops, 250 round tables, and 1,011 site visits. The project has formally trained over 8,500 beneficiaries in
      sound manure management practices and the operation of biodigesters, including 5,828 farmers, 884 rayon and
      local administration representatives, 774 engineers, agricultural and food processing sector specialists, 669 rural
      entrepreneurs, and 381 consultants. Brochures on sustainable manure management practices, biogas generation
      from animal manure, and the installation, operation, and maintenance of biodigesters were prepared and published.
     Adoption rates of sound practices are much higher than expected. A follow-up survey carried out indicated
      that at least 11,414 households and farms (63.4 percent of the total number of trainees against the original target
      of 10 percent) have applied an improved agricultural or manure management practice.
     Legal framework was found to be conducive for the use of biodigesters in Moldova. A review of the
      framework for the use of biodigesters in Moldova was carried out, providing recommendations both on the
      feasibility of the overall legal framework and the specific steps that need to be taken to legally use biodigesters in
      Moldova. It was found that the legislation is supportive of renewable energy investments, and no separate licensing
      of biodigesters is required.
     A Feasibility Study of the potential for scaling up biogas investments in Moldova has been completed in
      collaboration with the Energy Efficiency Agency (EEA) under the Ministry of Economy.
  The project has supported construction of two biodigesters and technical designs for four sites. The
   project has contributed to the installation of one biodigester with technical advice. Construction of another
   biodigester will be started in spring 2015. Technical designs for biodigesters in four sites have been completed.
Key Partners: Ministry of Environment, Energy Efficiency Agency, and private livestock producers.
Key Development Partners: Global Environment Facility, coordination with SIDA.

Trans-Oil is a leading grain trader and oilseed crusher in Moldova, headquartered in Chisinau and with operations
across the country. IFC has provided a long-term financing package to help the company expand its business and
strengthen the sustainability of its operations.
The Project Development Objective. IFC provided Trans-Oil with long-term financing that was not available in
Moldova from commercial banks or capital markets. With IFC’s support, Trans-Oil has expanded its business through
the acquisition of a local oilseed processor and five silos. The company is also making investments to improve its
energy efficiency and raise environmental standards. Cooperation with IFC will help Trans-Oil become a major oilseed
crushing and trading group in the region and contribute to the development of the Moldovan economy.
IFC committed (July 8, 2014) and disbursed (July 17, 2014) another US$30 million of a short-term loan, which is IFC’s
share of the US$155 million short-term syndicated pre-export facility led by Societe Generale. The facility is supporting
the Group’s commodities purchases, storage, and processing during the 2014–15 harvest season for sale to export
markets.
The development impact of providing the above mentioned short-term loan is expected to include (i) increased access
to finance for a leading agricultural player operating in a key sector of the Moldovan economy, (ii) support for the
Group’s growth and generation of higher export revenues, a major source of export income in Moldova, (iii) increased
farmer reach by providing a sizable and stable source of financing for the Group’s purchase of commodities from
mainly small and medium-sized farmers, and (iv) job preservation and increased tax revenues.
Expected role and additionality: the new project complements IFC’s existing long-term investment and provides
funding to help the Group meet its working capital financing needs during the harvest season, broadening its funding
base beyond its existing financial network. The Company reported strong profitability and cash generation in FY14
(2013–14) mainly as a result of the rich harvest last year, the availability of working capital financing, and access to
additional port terminals, enabling a larger export volume of agri commodities. FY15 (2014–15) is also expected to
show growth and strong performance for the same factors. The Company continues to grow, in particular, it has
recently acquired port terminals in Reni, Ukraine, and as far as is known, considers other potential expansion
opportunities in the region, which are expected to complement and strengthen its existing operations.
Key Expected Results:
      Provide long-term financing to the company, strengthening its balance sheet and enabling it to finance its
       expansion with long-term funds;
      Support the mobilization of capital: through the B loan, IFC has attracted additional financing from international
       lenders, helping extend tenors available to the company and broadening the company’s long-term funding base;
      Help improve operational efficiencies and enhance competitiveness by sharing IFC’s global agriculture sector
       expertise;
      Realize benefits to local farmers by integrating them with higher value-added domestic and international
       markets;
      Promote job preservation and increased tax revenues; and
      Encourage local and regional companies to consider investments in Moldova.

Over the past 20 years, investments in the city’s infrastructure were almost nonexistent. As a result, streets with the
highest concentrations of traffic have significantly deteriorated, imposing economic costs on road users and having
negative consequences for the city’s growth potential and competitiveness. The water supply and sanitation networks
required urgent rehabilitation or, in some suburban areas, did not even exist, causing frequent interruptions in service
and significant environmental ramifications. The situation was further hindered by the absence of reliable data on the
existing networks’ layouts, which resulted in poor quality technical designs and estimates that often deviated from the
concrete reality.
The Project Development Objective. As a result of this project, the newly built and rehabilitated water supply and
sewerage networks with pumping stations and treatment facilities provide more reliable and higher-quality water supply
and sanitation services to about 80,000 city’s inhabitants. The project contributes to further reducing water loses,
saving both water and maintenance costs. In addition, about 5 kilometers of the city’s main streets that handle the
highest traffic flow are rehabilitated.


Key Results:
       30 kilometers of new water supply networks
       4 kilometers of the water supply networks rehabilitated
       14 kilometers of new sewerage networks
       four pumping stations
       four wastewater treatment facilities
       5 kilometers of the city’s main streets rehabilitated
