THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        Request and obtain land clearance from Tashkent City Hokimiyat
        (submission of an application for a land plot and of approved
        materials)

        BuildCo applies to the Hokimiyat of Tashkent for the land allotment. In
        the application BuildCo must must specify the purpose for which the
        land is required, its location and size, the approximate dates of
        commencement and completion of construction, postal address, details
        of a legal entity or an individual passport data.

        The Hokimiyat forwards the application to the Main Department of
        Architecture and Construction (Главное Управление Архитектуры и
        Строительства – GUAS) for consideration. Main Department of
        Architecture and Construction will send the head architect of the region
        where the warehouse is planned to conduct an on-site inspection.
        Represetnative of BuildCo does not need to be present during the
        inspection. The head architect of the region will prepare a map of
   1    1/2000 scale for the land plot. Once the map is prepared, GUAS             30 days         UZS 672,735
        establishes a land commission to consider the land allotment case. The
        land commission consists of different agencies including engineering
        communications, utilities and government agencies. The land
        commission gets together every week to examine the cases and
        approve the decision. By law, these approvals have to be obtained by
        the GUAS in a one-stop shop principle; however, in practice the
        building company obtains the approvals by itself. GUAS issues a
        document that specifies all agencies which have to provide approval for
        the land allotment decision. BuildCo has to take that document and
        obtain approvals from the specified agencies. Industry professionals
        have named the document “begunok” which means “runner’s
        document” in Russian, indicating the fact that the applicant has to
        obtain approvals from multiple agencies.

        After the land allotment document is signed and approved by all
        members of the commission, the Hokimiyat has to send the application
        package to the Tashkent General Plan (Tashgenplan) for obtaining their

      approval. This is needed because Tashkent has a general plan and any
      new construction has to meet the zoning rules and architectural norms
      set by the General Plan. GenPlan will approve the land allotment
      application and send it back to GUAS, which will forward the
      application to the Hokimiyat. There is a separate commission at the
      Hokimiyat that will do the signing in about 1 week. After that, the
      Hokimiyat will forward the application to the Cabinet of Ministers of the
      Republic of Uzbekistan for final approval. The final approval is obtained
      from the Cabinet of Ministers.

      issued within 5 days, in practice it takes longer.

      An inspector from the local branch of the architecture and construction
      authority undertakes oversight of the construction. There is no permit
      application fee. However, for the oversight/inspection phase, the
      company enters into a contract with the authority at a cost of 0.03% of
      the value of the warehouse.

        The customer submits an application for the electrical connection to the
        Tashkent City Electric Network Enterprise and waits for them to issue
        technical conditions. The technical conditions specify the point of
        connection and other technical arrangements. In this particular case, the
        segment of the cable, for which the customer is responsible, is identified.

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a

case study assumes that the court hears an expert on
the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
