This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

        Obtaining neighborhood consent can be carried out
        simultaneously with the previous procedure. The initial step is to
        post a sign with specific information about the planned
        construction on the plot. Thereafter, BuildCo must obtain the             30 days             no charge

        not object to the construction of the warehouse.

        Agency: Local Authority



        Hold initial consultation with local authority

        BuildCo must have clearance at the initial consultation phase
        with at least 14 different departments at the prefecture level.
        Due to stricter requirements of compliance with construction
        regulations, the process now takes around 24 days. The purpose
        of this consultation is to avoid the risk of resubmitting the
        application for the actual building permit which if submitted
  *2    wrongly, or some parts require alteration, the process can take           24 days             no charge
        another 2 -- 3 months. Closer scrutiny is paid to the structural
        component of the drawings and plans. The rules require an
        engineer to resubmit an entire construction plan, even to change
        a peg or location of windows.

      Normally, architects submit the application on behalf of their
      clients. The Fire Office is also involved in the permit examination
      process. The application must be amended when any changes
      are made after the building permit is obtained. In addition, a
      change permit must be obtained prior to final inspection by local
      authorities.

      After the falsification of structural calculation of buildings by
      former Architect Aneha became public knowledge in November
      2005, many Japanese local authorities and private inspection
      companies have had to spend extra time checking structural
      design documents in new applications. This situation is still very
      much true in many parts of Japan. There is also a spill-over effect
      on site inspections by privatized control institutions, and it is
      likely that the Japanese government will introduce more frequent
      and thorough inspection procedures in building construction in
      the near future. Building permit review and approval procedures
      became very stringent since the new Building regulation as of
      June 20, 2007. As of June 2007 any project exceeding 1,000 sq.
      m. will require a peer review process by an independent
      authorized structural engineer/agency. The engineers are
      generally hired by the Building Department to undertake this
      review. However, the amount of work and backlog on one hand
      and the number of available professionals on the other hand
      willing to work extra hours on the weekends has caused delays.
      The peer review may take about 30 days in addition to the 50
      days of building permit review period. In simpler cases the
      process may take on average 70 days.

      Request and obtain workmen’s compensation insurance
      proof from Labor Control Office

      The Labor Control Office verifies worker compensation insurance
      for all companies annually. No cost is incurred for obtaining
      confirmation. Once a contractor obtains confirmation and
      insurance, it is valid for one year for any project of the
      contractor’s company. Application for worker compensation
      insurance is made with the local labor control office. The
      applicant must comply with the registration criteria. A worker        60 days       no charge

      compensation insurance fee must be paid within 50 days after
      the application is filed. Worker compensation insurance is valid
      for a year, and it must be extended every year between April 1
      and May 20. The insurance cost is 2.05% of the company's total
      personnel costs (1.25% paid by employer, 0.8% paid by
      employee).

      companies annually. No cost is incurred for obtaining confirmation.
      Once a contractor obtains confirmation and insurance, it is valid for one
      year for any project of the contractor’s company. Application for worker
      compensation insurance is made with the local labor control office. The
      applicant must comply with the registration criteria. A worker              60 days       no charge

      and it must be extended every year between April 1 and May 20. The
      insurance cost is 2.05% of the company's total personnel costs (1.25%
      paid by employer, 0.8% paid by employee).

          Register the building with the Land and Building Registry

          The building registration involves two steps. First, the description of the
          building should be registered (usually through a notary public). This
          part cannot be done by BuildCo or its lawyer. No formal registration
          cost is required.

          Second, proof of building ownership should be registered. It takes             12 days      JPY 409,429
    12
          about 10 to 14 days for the registration to be completed. The cost of
          proof of building ownership registration varies depending on the value
          of the building (0.2% of the building’s taxable value).

        There is no external inspection. As there is no inspection of the internal
        wiring, TEPCO is asking the customer for the necessary information
        regarding the licensed electrician who did the internal wiring. Japanese
        laws require every owner/user to hire a licensed electrician to install the
        wiring. The information is submitted on the formatted application
        document and contains the name, license number and contact
        information of the electrician. There is no notarization needed for the
        documents, however the signature of the customer needs to be on the
        documents when applying online. The contractor building the warehouse
   2    will usually make an application for power supply and connection several 93 calendar days         JPY 0
        months before the required date of the connection to allow TEPCO
        sufficient time to survey the proposed area in terms of electricity supply
        route and capacity required for the specific building. If the electricity
        main supply is not suitable, TEPCO will carry out necessary infrastructure
        work to provide the required utility services. There is usually no estimate
        prior to the determination of the actual contract start date. There is no
        connection fee: In case of overhead wiring, up to 1000 meters long,
        construction work does not require any financial responsibility by the

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes

consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                              The most likely procedure applicable to our case study would be a
                                              reorganization (civil rehabilitation). Mirage may use the
                                              rehabilitation proceeding to gain time, find a new investor, or
                                              renegotiate its debt. The rehabilitation proceeding starts with Mirage

                  Osaka                       District Court. Mirage’s managers will draft a rehabilitation plan
                                              which is likely to be approved by creditors. BizBank will likely
                                              support the rehabilitation proceedings as according to the case
                                              assumption the continuation of Mirage’s operations as a going

                                               take 7 months in total. Creditors will file the proof of claims and, in
                  Tokyo,                       the meantime, Mirage will prepare the plan. The plan will be

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
     Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
       age 19, with one year of work experience.
     Is a full-time employee.
     Is not a member of the labor union, unless
       membership is mandatory.
The business:
     Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).

Job quality
Doing Business introduced new data on job quality in 2015. Doing Business 2017 covers eight questions on job
quality (i) whether the law mandates equal remuneration for work of equal value; (ii) whether the law mandates
nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring; (iii) whether the law mandates paid or unpaid maternity leave; (iv)
the minimum length of paid maternity leave (in calendar days); (v) whether employees on maternity leave receive
100% of wages; (vi) the availability of five fully paid days of sick leave a year; (vii) whether a worker is eligible for
an unemployment protection scheme after one year of service; and (viii) the minimum duration of the contribution
period (in months) required for unemployment.

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
