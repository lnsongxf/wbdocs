provision, labor recruitment and training, access to logistics

Bogota (Colombia) and Chennai (India) in the 2000s – were
able to focus their efforts on improving city-level conditions
and thus were able to differentiate themselves from a weak

This section summarizes the key factors that multinational
firms consider when making location decisions. The re-
search is based on in-depth interviews with 16 professionals
working in location advisory services firms as well as IPIs
worldwide. These findings are based on discussions with prac-
titioners, who are working “on the ground,” actively engaging
in shaping the location-decision process. They both serve as
a reality check and provide a list of simple dos and don’ts for
policymakers. The findings are heavily focused on the inves-
tor-attraction and entry stages of the investment lifecycle.

Table 3 Investment attraction-related regulations decided by national vs. city governments

The overall legal and regulatory framework for FDI is almost always determined at the national level. City entities have to function
within those frameworks. Examples of regulations, policies and administrative procedures at both levels include the following:

                        National                                            City
                        Trade/Investment agreements                         Local one-stop shops
                        Export/Import licenses                              Construction permits
                        Customs                                             Technical certificates
                        Visas                                               Activity licenses
                        Company registration                                Property registration
                        Foreign purchase/ lease of land permits             Land use certification
                        Sector incentives                                   Local incentives
                        FDI sector restrictions
                        Income taxes

•	   City entities can “lobby” their central government for changes/improvements in conditions for FDI investment decided at
     national level (e.g. customs, export/import licenses, visas, etc.)
•	   City IPIs, however, may have a strong role in fast-tracking investment procedures at the city level, e.g., company startup
     licenses, construction permits, etc.
•	   Even under the same overall regulatory framework, differences in the performance of local administrative and regulatory
     bodies can make an important difference.

Some location advisors refer to this as “the 90–10 guideline”
in the location decision-making process, in which 90 percent
is about the fundamentals but a significant 10 percent is
about these softer factors, or perhaps “the last mile.”16 In the
last mile of the decision process, a city’s IPI can make
a huge difference. While IPIs also play an important role in
expediting the realization of some of the fundamentals (such
as putting roads, water and electricity in place), it is IPIs’
promotion, facilitation and marketing efforts that can often
help seal the deal. IPIs not only help cities stand out on a
firm’s radar screen, but can also – once a few cities have been
shortlisted by the firm – help guide the firm’s interaction
with local officials to influence the firm’s final decision.


   “Some city governments who try to attract

Different cities have different characteristics, and therefore
they need to build up specific business propositions to attract
companies from a variety of economic sectors. However, no
city can compete in every sector. For example, in the case of
Bogotá, after analyzing different options, the city decided
to focus its efforts on trying to attract investors from the
shared-services sector. The city seemed to have a competitive
advantage in the call-centers business: Bogotá was able to
provide an adequate level of well-educated and skilled labor,
and was able to provide the office space needed at compara-
tively lower costs compared to other domestic locations. Bo-
gotá was thus able to take this sector to a higher-value-added
segment (i.e., IT services) when faced with competition from
other Colombian cities entering the call-center market. It
was also able to build up a strong offer to international firms,
allowing Bogotá to grow and progress up the value chain.

6. Recommendations
We provide policy recommendations in this section, based on the evidence discussed earlier in this paper, to help cities attract
multinational firms to locate in their cities. There is no dispute that cities compete primarily on the basis of the city’s fundamen-
tals: their investment climate, their infrastructure, their labor skill sets, and the quality of their institutions. However, competi-
tion for FDI is fierce, and there is still a need for cities to go beyond the fundamentals.

This section is especially relevant for secondary cities in developing countries that have invested in improving their fundamen-
tals but that still face limited success in attracting FDI. The table below highlights extra efforts that successful FDI-attracting
cities make. It also underscores some common mistakes that location advisors and practitioners say cities should avoid.

Appendix 2: Deciding factors by MNC Sector

Using the secondary sector (manufacturing) for example, locations in developing countries that have seen strong FDI inflows
also tend to have lower real exchange rate (i.e. cheap local currency), high FDI stock in the past, better labor-market flexibility,
better financial depth, and higher-quality infrastructure. For locations in advanced economies, strong FDI inflows in the
secondary sector are also correlated positively with high FDI stock, labor-market flexibility and infrastructure quality, but are
negatively correlated with judicial independence, financial depth and secondary-school enrollment.
