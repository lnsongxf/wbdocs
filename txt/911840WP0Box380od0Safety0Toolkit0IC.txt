    Foreword



          Demand for food safety regulatory reform can come from many quarters: domestic businesses,
          exporters, traders, retailers, foreign investors, and most importantly, consumers. Well-crafted
          regulations can guide and assist domestic farmers and firms to effectively compete with imports
          or allow them to access new export markets. As the agricultural sector in a developing country
          evolves and the quality and breadth of food processing increases, establishing a viable food
          safety system is a key element of success.

          This Toolkit aims to empower reformers with a suite of tools to assess market potential, build
          capacity, and assist in mitigating barriers to development in the area of food safety. The Toolkit
          tackles each step in the reform process. It examines the related system development in a strate-
          gic way supported by best practice examples and sound principles of institutional structure and
          legislative reform. Risk-based approaches to regulation and regulatory delivery are considered
          alongside the need for flexible and proportionate responses to both.

    Foreword

          Design of the Investment Climate Food Safety Toolkit builds on the IFC’s Sustainable Business
          Advisory Food Safety Toolkit which sets out practical tools and techniques for verification of
          effective food safety systems at the firm level. These two complementary tools, addressing
          both public and private sector dimensions to the development and implementation of effective
          food safety systems, can form the basis of a public private partnership that fosters reform and
          growth. Products, sectors and entry points may vary but the need for confidence in the safety
          and quality of the products produced for the benefit of both markets and citizens remains
          constant.

    Module 2   Guiding principles of food safety reform

               For all projects related to food safety reform, the following guiding principles should be kept
               in mind:

                •	 Regulation and official controls by themselves cannot ensure food safety.
                •	 Primary responsibility (and liability) for the safety of food rests on food business operators.
                •	 Food safety should be secured across the entire food chain.
                •	 A preventative and risk-based approach should be the basis for regulatory reform, decision
                   making, and control and self-control of food safety.
                •	 International standards and scientific justification should form the basis of all regulatory
                   measures.
                •	 The impact of food safety reform on trade, consumer prices, economic output, and jobs
                   should be carefully considered – costs and negative impacts can be significant from an
                   economic perspective.
                •	 The food safety system will always involve multiple players; coordination and collaboration
                   are vital.
               Note: Not all projects will go through all the following steps – selecting what will be covered will
               be based on the project scope and design as defined above, depending on country needs, capacity,
               resources, and the specific role of the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group.



    Module 3   Legislative reform

               For a food safety reform project to be successful, it is not enough to alter only texts in legisla-
               tion, or structures in the government or processes in inspectorates. It involves a different way of
               thinking by many people and a change in attitudes and behaviors. This can be the most difficult
               part of the project and easily underestimated or even overlooked. Applying food safety reform
               can in many countries be an extremely radical change in fundamental assumptions about
               safety and about the role of the state.

               It is important to be clear about the starting point and destination. For countries that are
               realistic candidates for European Union accession, the destination is a pre-existing package
               of legislation within the EU system and this path has been followed by a number of other ac-
               cession countries previously. For countries not in line for EU accession the destination may be
               joining other trade agreements and there may be in some cases similarly clear packages of food
               safety regulations to adopt. For other countries, getting a clear vision of the destination can be
               difficult and the timescale for that journey can be challenging and often insufficiently thought
               through. The World Trade Organization Sanitary and Phytosanitary (WTO SPS) agreement pro-
               vides a general framework, but many details have to be fleshed out in each specific case.

                       To assess the starting point for any legislative reforms, you have to have a good grasp of how            Module 4   Institutional structure
                       the current system operates and how embedded it is in institutions, practices, and the culture
                       of practitioners as well as of businesses and consumers. It is also essential to think about capac-                  Start from a map of the current distribution of responsibilities and roles, which are likely to be
                       ity of economic operators and regulators and about consumer incomes and education. It is not                         spread across a range of ministries, agencies, and inspectorates. The field of food safety im-
                       simply a matter of aligning legislative texts or of aligning systems and thinking. Depending on                      pinges on many other policy areas, and the particular distribution of roles in a country is likely

                                                                                                                                            inspections, supervision, testing, enforcement) than the policy inputs (that is, setting rules
                        These are some key questions to ask:                                                                                and requirements on all aspects (production, animal health, chemicals, water, residue levels in

                        •	 Have any of the norms and standards been aligned with international standards?                                   There may be a strong desire to try and set up a single food safety agency that covers policy
                        •	 Can the legislation be identified clearly as being about food safety or is it mixed with issues                  and implementation, but such institutions are quite rare. It may not be appropriate or feasible

                        •	 What is the implementation capacity, existing problems in enforcing applicable legislation,
                           and what challenges are to be expected in bringing reformed legislation to life?                                 Although there is probably a preference internationally for a single agency, at least in terms of
                                                                                                                                            inspections, it does not have the status of international best practice, precisely because of the

    Purpose of the Toolkit

          The purpose of this Investment Climate Food Safety Toolkit is to provide reformers, project
          teams supporting reforms, and policymakers with an overview of the principles of food safety
          reform, the primary objectives, key instruments and critical success factors, as well as provide a
          number of specific examples and case studies. The Toolkit is aimed at supporting work on food
          safety and inspections reform to support development of the agribusiness sector.

          This toolkit may also be used as a guidance document for external audiences, such as partners
          and stakeholders in reform programs, so that they can understand the scope of food safety
          reform, the importance of collaboration of public and private sectors, the value of education
          of all involved parties, the importance of transparency, and the strength of the market-driven
          approach.

          This toolkit focuses on the overall architecture of food safety regulation and answers the fol-
          lowing questions:

           •	 What does it entail?
           •	 What other components form the “food safety system” and are essential for it to work ef-
              fectively?
           •	 What are the key elements of best practice (and what elements are disputed)?
           •	 What can interventions by the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group
              focus on (and achieve)?

          This toolkit emphasizes the roles of all players in the food chain, including food business opera-
          tors and states providing the regulatory and control environment.

          The Toolkit emphasizes solutions and approaches that are realistic, and conducive to private
          sector development and broad-based, inclusive growth. At the same time it warns against
          potential pitfalls, including the danger of “gold plating” and the introduction of regulatory
          requirements that are not commensurate to the level of development of the country or of its
          businesses.

          Finally, it should be noted that the Toolkit does not attempt to provide full, in-depth prescrip-
          tions on all aspects of food safety regulations, as this would both make the Toolkit unwieldy
          and duplicate information readily available in public documents.

    Guiding principles
    The whole architecture of the food safety regulatory system needs
    to be built upon the following key elements:


                     •	 Food safety is not ensured by adhering to external, visible rules such as statutory
                        legislation or other elements such as private standards requirements – they cannot be
                        enough. Food safety results from a constant attention to processing specific hazards
                        and how they relate to products.

                     •	 Problems will occur, since there is no fail-proof system. It is essential to build the system
                        around rapid detection of contamination and outbreaks and appropriate reaction,
                        including recalls and swift and effective communication.

                     •	 Food safety results from consideration being given to the entire food chain. No part of
                        it can be viewed in isolation because all are essential to total product safety.

                     •	 Regulatory and enforcement resources are limited, as are private sector resources, so
                        there should be risk evaluation and analysis. The focus should be on critical risks that
                        are both product and process specific, rather than on trying (and failing) to address
                        everything, everywhere, all the time. A food safety regulatory system needs to provide
                        for:
                       •	 risk assessment – the process of identifying food safety hazards, assessing likelihood
                          of occurrence and severity, and evaluating the significance;

                       •	 risk management – the coordinated and economical application of resources to mini-
                          mize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of food-borne incidents;
                          and

                       •	 risk communication – the process of ensuring that the logic, outcomes, significance,
                          and limitations of the risk assessment are clearly understood by all stakeholders.


                     •	 Harmonization of rules and measures with international standards is essential for
                        implementation of a scientifically sound system.

                     •	 Transparency in decision making enhances the consumers’ and trade partners’ trust in
                        the food safety system.

                     •	 Everyone has a role to play in ensuring food is safe, including food business operators,
                        their employees, regulators, and consumers. The concept of shared responsibility with
                        responsibilities should be clearly defined.

    Fundamental pillars
    Food safety reform should be based on eight
    fundamental pillars:


    Pillar 1               Food safety should be secured along the entire food chain (plough to plate, farm to
                           fork, stable to table) thus covering all potential hazards emerging from primary production,
                           processing, transportation/distribution, retail, catering, food service and home use of food.
                           One of the issues is that each link in the food chain has limited or no ability to control other
                           links in the chain. Good regulation and enforcement can help to address this. Production of
                           raw materials, all inputs and outputs in food production, and all materials coming into contact
                           with food should be covered by regulatory frameworks. Regulations should be implemented
                           and enforced in line with food law and enforcement codes of practice.

    Pillar 2               Regulation by itself cannot ensure food safety. The overarching principle of effective and
                           efficient food safety regulation is that regulation by itself cannot ensure or deliver food safety.
                           It is only one of several elements in the food safety system. In most countries engaging in
                           reform, the pre-existing situation is very much the opposite: everyone (consumers, regulators,
                           businesses) assumes that safety is something “externally imposed” by rules and enforcement
                           (effectively or not, and very often not effectively).

                             products that are intrinsically safe, to follow defined procedures based on risk, and to take                                                         data on process-specific hazards and known accepted controls to inform potential risk posed

                     Coordination, cooperation, and collaboration among these institutions are essential, as is fluid
                     communication. Building a single food safety agency (if this approach is taken) may never be
                     enough, because this agency could never consolidate all the functions of veterinary medicine
                     and human health care, with which it needs to have a constant interface. There is no such
                     thing as an agency that would really cover all aspects of food safety even if it purports to do so.
                     Conversely, national governments that have food safety responsibilities spread among several
                     different departments or agencies may encounter issues of overlap and potential communica-
                     tion difficulties. It is critical to the effective management of food safety as a public health issue
                     that whichever approach is taken, the benefits and deficits of each approach are recognized
                     and understood. Certainly, having oversight of issues at government level, such as the follow-
                     ing, as part of a combined strategy is beneficial:

                      •	 Public health
                      •	 Animal health

                      •	 Food defense

                     A collaborative relationship between the food industry, academia, national, and non-gov-
                     ernmental and intergovernmental organizations is needed to improve food safety and public
                     health protection.

    Introduction

            Legislation based on international standards and harmonized between trade partners fa-
            cilitates trade and enables products from developing countries to be competitive in the
            international market. Countries looking to export to the EU should aim to harmonize leg-
            islation with EU rules. If exporting to EU markets is not a priority, countries should follow
            requirements of the WTO SPS agreement and thus ensure that their products can access
            markets of all WTO member states.

            Both the EU and WTO legislative models for food safety require a risk-based approach to
            food safety controls, prioritizing funds and activity on the most risky areas.

            Reforms in this area should be primarily focused on ensuring food safety, although en-
            suring that consumers are receiving the quality of food that they expect is also a consid-
            eration. When planning legislative reform, the burden on business should be carefully
            considered, and consultation with the business community is strongly recommended to
            obtain a good understanding of the business perspective. The benefits to private sector
            development discussed in Module 2 should also form part of this discussion.

            Public awareness on the need for reforms can be important and it is essential to outline
            the benefits of improved food safety legislation to consumers and their representative
            bodies as they can help to support reforms and sustain their results.

    Introduction

            In developing countries the capacity of the state to regulate and control food safety in a
            risk-based approach will usually need to be strengthened. Reforming the institutions with
            responsibilities for regulating and controlling food safety may be a necessary step.

            The role of governmental institutions that are responsible for controls on food safety
            (sometimes called “competent authorities”) will include making food safety policy and
            regulations, analysing evidence to implement a risk-based approach as well as carrying
            out the checks that the regulations are being implemented. Often the policy and rule
            making is carried out in one government institution (such as a ministry) and the checks
            on implementation of the rules are made by other institutions, such as inspectorates and
            laboratories.

    For the government to have an effective role in food        The FAO guidelines on strengthening national food
    safety requires one or more ministries or regulatory        control systems should be considered when looking at
    agencies to have the following responsibilities:            institutional reforms relating to food.2

    Regulatory agencies are usually linked with either the
    ministry in charge of health or the ministry in charge of
    agriculture, but in many countries both ministries share
    responsibilities in this area.

    Sometimes, ministries in charge of consumer affairs,
    or even economy or trade, participate in regulating
    and control of the food area, mostly dealing with food
    quality issues and prevention of fraud. Since agriculture
    and food production have an impact on the environ-
    ment, the ministry of the environment is often included
    in regulation of certain issues in connection with food
    safety (mostly in disposition of solid and liquid waste,
    but there are cases when this ministry regulates water
    to be processed into drinking water as well).

    Regulatory agencies should divide responsibilities for
    regulating certain areas. Issues that are of the common
    interest for various agencies should be regulated with
    the collaboration of all agencies concerned.

    Risk responsibilities
    at national and
    international levels

    As previously discussed in the Module entitled “Leg-
    islative Reform,” the architecture of the food safety
    regulatory system needs to be built upon several key
    elements, three of which are risk focused.

    A food safety regulatory system needs to provide for
    the following:

     •	 Risk assessment. This is the process of identifying
        food safety hazards, assessing likelihood of occur-
        rence and severity, and evaluating the significance.

     •	 Risk management. This is the coordinated and
        economical application of resources to minimize,
        monitor, and control the probability and/or impact
        of food-borne incidents and to maximize the real-
        ization of opportunities to prosper throughout the
        food sector.

     •	 Risk communication. This is the process of ensur-
        ing that the logic, outcomes, significance, and limi-
        tations of the risk assessment are clearly understood
        by all stakeholders.

    The term prerequisite program (PRPs) has evolved to be

    in this context cannot be overstated.

    Prerequisite programs are good agricultural, manufac-

Organic standards: Various standards based on the                                  Common Code for the Coffee Community42 – a common
International Federation of Organic Agricultural                                   code of farmers, societies, traders, and civil society organiza-
Movements-IFOAM principles.38                                                      tions to improve living conditions of those involved in the
                                                                                   coffee cycle.
There is a trend in the production of raw products to move
towards organic production, where no inorganic substanc-                           Waste management standards in line with waste hierar-
es/chemicals are used in agriculture. Organic production is                        chy44 (prevention, preparing for re-use, recycling, recov-
regulated by various national39 and private standards40 and                        ery-like energy recovery, disposal).
producers who meet those requirements are allowed to label
their products as “organic.” In the EU, products of organic
farming are visibly marked with the logo, which is mandated
by legislation and it must be used, as per legislation.41

It is often found that developing and transitional countries
expect organic production to increase their profits from the
export of agricultural products to developed markets. Be-
fore launching this type of production, a cost benefit analy-
sis of the transfer from conventional to organic production
should be performed. Also, data on soil contamination with
chemicals need to be assessed. Only after these data are as-
sessed, should the decision on launching organic production
be made. Often in developing countries, organic production
is only taken up for a limited number of products and the
majority of food continues to be produced according to the
conventional agricultural methods.

      Other factors may contribute to the unsuccessful reforms or no reforms at all:


       •	 Lack of national policy – constant change, no planning or measuring of results of activities.
       •	 Lack of strategy or prioritization of activities.
       •	 Trend to avoid changes by insisting on the “special situation in the country,” which requires international standards to be adjusted to
          local circumstances.
       •	 Inconsistent implementation of measures – relying on certification, which may not be based on the estimation of the efficacy of the
          system in place, but instead controlling only the formal side (documentation, paperwork).
       •	 Adoption of regulations with no follow up implementing measures – businesses may implement measures according to their own will
          and inconsistency is a problem.
       •	 Lack of sustainability in measures – highly dependent on foreign experts and funds.
       •	 Procurement problems/purchase of low quality equipment for governmental agencies’
       •	 Funds allocated for food safety reallocated to other sectors due to some emergencies or to a political decision.
       •	 Lack of division of responsibilities, constant disputes and transferring of responsibilities from one agency to another.
       •	 Lack of capacities in the national scientific community and no efforts to develop them.
       •	 Lack of public awareness on the importance of food safety for public health.
       •	 Manipulation information and depriving public the access to information.

    IFC has helped develop a methodology for risk-based in-

    though the SFSS has a strategy document for food safety
    reform, it is based on a somewhat generic goal of “getting
    closer” to EU regulations. What was needed was a proper
    stock taking of issues, gaps and problems to reach specific
    EU regulations. At the same time there was no clear under-
    standing or agreement that the current system is both bur-
    densome and of limited effectiveness. The interim result
    was a bifurcated scenario with a desire for improved safety
    but a reality where some stakeholders sought to introduce
    fees, fines and a heavier oversight process.

The intergovernmental working group was established by
decree of the prime minister in February 2000 to prepare the
reform. The resolution that created the new institutions was
adopted by the government in May 2000. They started func-
tioning in July 2000. In other words, the initial step of the
reform was implemented in record time. Full implementation
of the reform, to get institutions working and improving their
practices, took several years. To some extent, it is still going
on, as the government has been implementing (since 2010) a
comprehensive inspections reform program that covers food
safety as well as all other issues. The aim is to make inspec-
tions more transparent, more risk based, and to help busi-
nesses comply through better information efforts.

    The high point of reforms so far has been the recent
    adoption of a new Law on Food Safety (voted by Par-
    liament on May 18, 2012). This law continues the
    approximation process by setting forth rules on food
    safety that are directly taken from EU legislation. It also
    foresees the creation of a national food safety agency,
    with both regulatory, and inspections and enforcement
    powers. As such, it can be seen to constitute both a
    final step (to the series of legal changes on the food
    safety side) – and a starting point (for implementation
    work to make this new food safety approach a reality).

About the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group
The Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group helps governments implement reforms to improve their business
environments and encourage and retain investment, thus fostering competitive markets, growth, and job creation. Funding is
provided by the World Bank Group (IFC, the World Bank, and MIGA) and over 15 donor partners working through the multidonor
FIAS platform.
    Annex 1:
    Justification and scope of World Bank Group involvement


                 Food safety is key for growth in the food-processing sector because it allows development of
                 the local market as well as provides access to export markets. It thus has direct benefits for the
                 private sector, in addition to its role in ensuring growth more broadly by reducing the burden
                 of food-borne diseases. It is an important area where the International Finance Corporation
                 and the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group have a specific role to play
                 to improve the regulatory environment, which often acts as a barrier to development, access
                 to markets, and investment. Demand for food safety regulatory reform can come from many
                 quarters: domestic businesses, would-be exporters, retailers, foreign investors, etc. It is part
                 of a broader set of changes as regulation is only one piece of the food safety puzzle. Many
                 changes are simultaneously needed on the private sector side (how businesses actually work),
                 as well as changes of behavior among consumers.

                 Before getting involved in starting a food safety reform project, the Investment Climate De-
                 partment of the World Bank Group has to clarify:

                    •	 whether the proposed intervention fits with the World Bank Group mandate and strategy
                       for the country and region;
                    •	 that needs and demand for the intervention are sufficiently evidenced, and that there is
                       real added value for intervention by the Investment Climate Department of the World
                       Bank Group; and
                    •	 what the realistic limitations are on the scope of the project.

                 On the first point, this is a crowded space with many international organizations and donors.
                 Therefore, the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group needs to play to its
                 strengths. It needs to collaborate rather than compete with the other players and that means
                 there has to be a strong private sector development reason for becoming involved. Although
                 there are many technicalities in the field of food safety regulation, it is also fundamentally
                 about developing markets and supporting the growth of the private sector. That is what proj-
                 ects of the Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group should focus on. Food
                 safety regulation aims at “healthy markets” in addition to healthy people.

                 It is also essential to know what the project will precisely focus on and aim to achieve. The field
                 is too vast to just start a “food safety regulation” project without a clear objective. In parallel
                 with defining the focus, it is also important to consider how a project will add value to that of
                 others or will in some other way complement the projects of others. It is also absolutely essen-
                 tial to check that there is a real demand for the project from policymakers and key institutions,
                 and that there is a good chance of the project being successful even if there are changes in
                 important personnel in the government.

    In terms of scope, the following main options should be considered, generally in some combi-
    nation as framework and implementation should be seen as complementary:



       •	 Revision of legislative framework – is this a critical pre-condition for further work, and
          does this involve only limited changes to roughly adequate legislation, or fundamental
          rewriting? If there is a need for fundamental rewriting, it is important to think through
          what will be needed in terms of implementation support.

       •	 Institutional reform – because food cuts across so many issues of government there is
          often confusion and overlap across both ministries and agencies. On this point reform can
          be limited reform (clarifying some problematic issues) or fundamental reform (setting up a
          whole new institutional framework). This has implications at the implementation level.

       •	 Process reform (changing how regulators organize and conduct their work) and
          implementation support – this is an essential part that can come as “stand alone” (if
          framework is generally right) or in complement to framework reform. The Investment
          Climate Department of the World Bank Group has expertise and a track record in
          inspections and licensing reforms, and other regulatory reform tools that are relevant to
          food safety reform implementation.

    Once the decision has been made for involvement by the Investment Climate Department of
    the World Bank Group, and the scope of the intervention is determined, a certain degree of
    training for World Bank Group staff would be helpful, particularly in supporting productive
    relations with collaborators who are experts in the food safety, such as the World Health Or-
    ganization and Food and Agriculture Organization.

        •	 inform the public about risks and ways to prevent and combat them; and
        •	 present requirements to trade partners outside the EU..
    Regulation (EC) 178/2002 lays down these principles and outlines a model to be followed when developing a food
    safety law in the EU member states. Those principles are:

        •	 high level of protection of human health, consumers’ interests and, where necessary, animal and plant health
           and the environment;
        •	 implementation of international standards whenever they exist, and use of other standards only when no
           international standards exist and until they are developed;
        •	 “Farm-to-fork” regulations and measures to cover all stages of food production, processing, transportation,
           retail, and catering;
        •	 Risk analysis – a three-tier system to be introduced and implemented by official bodies in policymaking and
           enforcement;
        •	 “Precautionary principle” when there is a risk of harmful effect on human health, animal, or plan health.
           Management of that risk can be performed by ad hoc measures only if scientifically based measures do
           not exist for that risk. Such measures should be replaced with scientifically based ones, as soon as they are
           developed, or remain in force if proved to be scientifically sound and effective;
        •	 food and feed imported into the EU market from third countries shall have the equivalent food safety
           characteristics as food produced in EU member states. If there is a specific agreement between a third country
           and EU member state, than food must comply with provisions stated in that agreement;
        •	 transparency is important when developing food laws and measures, and when estimating their impacts.
           Involvement of all stakeholders (authorities, private sector, associations of producers, scientific community,
           NGOs, chambers of commerce, international trading partners, trade organizations) is recommended;
        •	 primary responsibility of food business operators for safety of food they place on the market;
        •	 food business operators are responsible for fulfilling all regulatory requirements concerning food and feed;
        •	 implementation of the preventive approach to control of hazards is at all levels of food and feed production,
           circulation and use;
        •	 presentation of food and feed that does not mislead consumers; and
        •	 Securing traceability along the food chain at least as “one step down-one step up.”
