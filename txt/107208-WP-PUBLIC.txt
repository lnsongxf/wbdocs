                           government schemes. However, MSPDCL lacked the capability to implement
                           multiple large projects. The utility had a track record of 107 percent cost
                           overrun (INR  47,000 million) for projects handled between the years 2009
                           and 2014 and was further executing projects costing around INR 6,340
                           million under various state and central schemes. There were general delays
                           in project execution and closure.

    Reliability of         A weak transmission and distribution network was impacting the reliability
    Supply                 and quality of supply. Lack of regular preventive/scheduled maintenance had
                           led to an inadequate infrastructure. Maintaining the quality of power to meet
                           consumer expectations and maintaining commercial viability were proving to
                           be major challenges. On an average, power supply in the hills was available
                           only for six to eight hours per day and in the District Headquarters and
                           Valley for around 10 to 12 hours per day. Per capita power consumption was
                           amongst the lowest in the country at 207 units.

 Parameters           Key challenges faced by MSPDCL (2012-13 and 2013-14)
 Commercial           High Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses were impacting the
                      commercial viability of the utility especially with increases in power purchase
                      costs and poor revenue recovery. The actual revenue collected by MSPDCL
                      was only 40 percent of the power purchase cost. To achieve its business
                      goals, MSPDCL needed to improve revenue collection drastically. The key
                      challenges were:

                      1. Improve access: consumer coverage was only about 68 percent of the
                         total households in the state;
                      2. Improve metering: a significant number of unmetered consumers existed
                         in Manipur; and
                      3. Reduce AT&C loss: AT&C loss in Manipur was around 50 percent (2013-14).

                      constraining sector growth and development.


Overall, despite the unbundling, the power sector in Manipur was far from being reliable or
commercially viable and thus also a constraint to attracting investments into the state. It was
against this backdrop that the state requested World Bank support for TA focused on institutional
strengthening and capacity building of power distribution utility in the state.

Institutional Strengthening of MSPDCL:
Focus Areas and Outcomes


The World Bank-supported institutional
strengthening exercise for MSPDCL was
initiated in October 2014 and was focussed
on Commercial, Projects and O&M functions
based on priorities indicated by MSPDCL. A
brief timeline of the initiatives undertaken by
MSPDCL is shown in Figure 1.

As part of the exercise, As-Is analysis
of organization structure, roles and
responsibilities, manpower strength,
skill gaps, and HR policies and mapping
of business processes - at corporate,
circle, division and sub-division level was
undertaken covering projects, planning,
                                                                   Students in a classroom at the HRD Academy in Imphal
commercial, O&M and support functions.
Subsequently a benchmarking exercise
was done against distribution utilities of                         Gap analysis. Based on the gap analysis,
hill states and those catering to a mix of                         initiatives were identified and implemented
rural and semi-urban consumers, to do a                            to address the same.
