I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Costa Rica perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Costa Rica
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Costa Rica
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From February to March 2016, 475 stakeholders of the WBG in Costa Rica were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 171 stakeholders participated in
the survey (36% response rate).

Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via mail, email, or completed the
survey with the presence of a representative of the independent fielding agency; other
respondents received and completed the questionnaire online. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing Costa Rica; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Costa Rica; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’14 (response rate is 41%, N=127). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix D (page 91).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from PMUs/consultants/contractors working on WBG
       supported projects/programs were combined with employees of ministries/ministerial
       departments/implementation agencies; respondents from the financial sector/private
       banks were combined with those from private sector organizations; and respondents from
       NGOs/community based organizations, private foundations, trade unions, and youth
       groups were combined in the “CSO” category. Few respondents from local governments,
       bilateral/multilateral agencies, and the judiciary branch were included in the “Other”
       category. Note that there were no respondents from the Office of the President/Prime
       Minister and faith-based groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’14 Country
        Survey indicated statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean
        in FY’16 = 6.7; weighted mean in FY’14 = 6.4)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Costa Rica, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Costa Rica, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

IV. General Issues Facing Costa Rica
Headed in the Right Direction3
       Year comparison: This year’s respondents were significantly less likely to believe that
        Costa Rica is headed in the right direction compared to respondents in the FY’14 Country
        Survey.
       Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the office of a
        minister were significantly more likely to indicate that Costa Rica is headed in the right
        direction, while respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks and the
        media were significantly less positive about the prospect of Costa Rica.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: In the previous FY’14 Country Survey, respondents attributed failed
       or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to “the WBG not being sensitive enough to political/
       social realities on the ground” (53%) and “political pressures and obstacles” (37%).
      Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the private sector,
       CSOs, and the media were significantly more likely to attribute failed or slow WBG
       assisted reform efforts to “the Government working inefficiently”, whereas respondents
       from the office of a minister were significantly less likely to indicate this response option
       compared to respondents from other stakeholder groups.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from the office of a minister, the office of a
       parliamentarian, and academia had the highest mean ratings for the aggregated responses
       to the twenty six COS indicator questions, whereas respondents from the media had
       significantly lower mean ratings. Responses for individual indicator questions by
       stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 62).
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had significantly higher
       mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS indicator questions
       (mean rating = 7.6) compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG
       (mean rating = 6.8). Responses for individual indicator questions by exposure to the
       WBG can be found in Appendix E (see page 97).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Costa Rica,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty one
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Costa Rica. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at trade and exports; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Costa Rica, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2014
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2014 COS report.

FY 2014 Number of comparable respondents = 97  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 153

By weighting, the FY 2014 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

 less well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the
 following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Costa Rica? (Choose no more
 than TWO)
  1    Consistent economic growth
  2    More reliable social safety net
