This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

      submission of the incorporation documents are mandatory required to
      be done via the MyCoID online portal. Upon the approval of the name
      search application, the company secretary, who has the access to the
      MyCoID online portal, only needs to enter the relevant information and
      particulars required by the online portal and is not required to prepare
      any incorporation document (save for the Form 48A as explained
      below) or upload any incorporation document into the online portal.
      Within one or two working days upon the complete submission of the
      information and particulars required by the online portal, an electronic
      copy of the Certificate of Incorporation of Private Company (Form 9)
      issued by CCM evidencing that the company has been duly
      incorporated will be generated by and can be downloaded from the
      online portal. In addition, the online portal will also generate an
      electronic copy of all the incorporation documents mentioned above,
      i.e. the M&A (which is a standard boiler-plate M&A), Form 48A, Form 6,
      Form 24, Form 49 and Form 44 for the company secretary’s record and
      the same will also be available in CCM’s database for public searches.

      Please note that in respect of the Form 48A which is a statutory
      declaration to be signed by the director, notwithstanding that the
      physical signed Form 48A is not required to be uploaded into the online
      portal, the online portal will require the company secretary to confirm
      that the Form 48A has been duly executed by the director and hence,
      the company secretary will still need to prepare the Form 48A for the
      director’s execution.

      Please note that if any one of the initial subscribers is a corporate entity
      and not individual shareholder, the preparation and submission of all
      the incorporation documents are not possible to be done via the
      MyCoID online portal (not allowed by the system of the online portal)
      and the company secretary will still need to prepare and submit all the
      incorporation documents over the counter of CCM in person.

      GST is implemented and enforced by the Director General of Customs
      and Excise and the Royal Malaysian Customs and Excise Department
      (“Customs”), which implement and enforce indirect taxes. It is a broad-
      based consumption tax that will virtually apply to every supply of goods

      (i)       when charging GST, issue a tax invoice showing, amongst
      others, the amount of GST and the price of the supplies separately;

      (ii)     where the output tax exceeds the input tax, remit the
      difference to Customs;

      (iii)   submit GST returns to Customs at the prescribed time and
      comply with all other GST reporting requirements; and

      (iv)     keep all business and accounting records relating to GST
      transactions in the National Language or English for a period of 7 year

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      valuation and it is at the discretion of the valuation department, but in
      practice, it takes place in the majority of the cases. The Stamp Office will
      issue a notice of assessment based on the valuation department’s report.
      Submission can be made either manually or online through the website
      http://pinharta.hasil.gov.my. E-stamping (online) is now available only to

      5. Other supporting documents

      Once accepted, an adjudication number will be assigned by the system.
      When the Stamp Office receives the submission, the documents are
      transferred to JPPH for valuation. When required, a valuation inspection
      will be made on the property by JPPH. In most of the cases, commercial
      properties will be assessed. The JPPH will prepare a valuation report
      which is sent to the Stamp Office. The applicant will be able to follow
      the status of the adjudication online.

      The purchaser’s lawyer presents the duly stamped Memorandum of

      must be done within three months from the date of the Memorandum of
      Transfer (Form 14A) which is usually dated when it is submitted for
      adjudication. A title search is conducted just prior to presentation to
      ensure that there are no encumbrances or restraint against dealings
      which may hinder the registration of the Memorandum of Transfer (Form
      14A). The documentation shall include: • Copies of Quit rent and
      Assessment receipts • Certified true copies of the Memorandum and
      Articles of Association, Form 24 (Return on Allotment of Shares), Form 49

      “presentation receipt” the same day. It gives the time of submission and
      that is the time of legal “registration”. The computerized system at the
      Land Registry also immediately tags the land as ‘pending transfer’ and
      hence anyone conducting a land search on theproperty will be aware of
      encumbrances (if any). However, the “presentation receipt” is sufficient
      for Banks to release the loan.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
