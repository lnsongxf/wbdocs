Introduction
 A brief introduction to the ICP defining and outlining the program, its objectives,
governance framework and organization. The introduction will describe the roles and
responsibilities of the different bodies in the governance structure in the various ICP
implementation stages and activities.


Part I. General Background

   Purpose of ICP
   An overview of the purpose of the ICP, which is to compare the price and real
   expenditure levels of GDP and component expenditures across participating
   countries; a description of the basic requirements of international comparisons of
   GDP; and the definition of PPPs and when they are used in lieu of exchange rates.

   Users and uses of PPPs
   This section will describe the main users, which include international organisations,
   governments, universities, research institutes. The principle uses include
   international comparative analysis, derivation of statistical totals and indicators for
   groups of countries (World Bank and Regional development banks and agencies),
   calculation of international poverty line and poverty analysis (World Bank) and
   administrative purposes (EU and the IMF).

   Analysis of the Results
   Highlights of global and regional analyses of 2011 results.


                                                                                          3
   Differences between 2005 and 2011 rounds
   This section will highlight the major differences between 2005 and 2011 rounds,
   including governance, country participation, organisation of participants (regions,
   dual participation, singletons), and key methodological developments and their effect
   on comparisons between the two rounds.

   Reliability of PPP estimates
   This section will briefly explain the sampling and non-sampling errors as well as
   costs and other considerations that restrict data collection. This section will also
   discuss the difficulties faced when calculating PPPs for comparison-resistant areas,
   and when comparing countries with very different economic structures.


Part III. Data Requirements
An overview of the conceptual framework, survey framework, data collection and
validation during the 2011 round.

   Conceptual framework
    This section will describe the ICP conceptual frameworks: estimation of GDP from
   the expenditure side; direct and indirect estimation of PPPs; price collection criteria
   [consistency, comparability, importance], input-price approach, and productivity
   adjustments. It will also describe the implications of the framework provided by
   SNA93: actual individual consumption and individual consumption expenditure,
   actual and imputed expenditures, market and non-market services, benefits and
   reimbursement and concept of total price, etc.

   Survey framework
    An overview of the survey framework and coverage within the ICP 2011, and a table
   summarizing the survey coverage by country.

   Data collection
    An overview of the survey implementation and data collection processes for the
    following surveys: household consumption, housing, health, education, water, fast
    evolving technology products, compensation of employees, machinery and
    equipment, construction and civil engineering.

   Data validation
    A summary of the validation processes employed during the 2011 round (price data,
    expenditure data, PPPs and price levels for basic headings and for aggregates).


Part IV. Methodologies to calculate regional and global PPPs
An overview of the different methodologies to calculate regional and global PPPs used
during the 2011 round.

                                                                                        4
   Basic Heading PPPs
   An explanation of the methods used to calculate basic heading PPPs within regions,
   including the use of productivity adjustment for government compensation basic
   headings.

   Aggregation
   An explanation of the methods used to aggregate to the GDP within regions.

   Linking
   An explanation of the methods used to link the regional comparisons at the basic
   heading level (Global Core List approach) and above the basic heading level
   (Country Aggregation with Redistribution approach).

   Linking Special Cases
   An explanation of the methods used to link the CIS, the Caribbean, the Pacific,
   singleton countries (Georgia and Iran), and double-participation countries.


Part VI. Imputing PPPs for non-participating countries
An overview of the method to impute PPPs for non-participating countries within the
2011 round, and table of results for non-participating countries.

Part V. Implications of new benchmark PPPs on PPP estimates for non-benchmark
years
An overview of the implications of the new benchmark PPPs on PPPs for the years
between 2005 and 2011. A brief description of why PPPs and real expenditures
extrapolated from 2005 will not match those from the ICP 2011.
