Introduction
The adoption of laws establishing the right to information (also referred to as access to information or
freedom of information) has been extremely active in the past two decades, with 71 such laws having
been enacted in the previous fifteen years (Global RTI Rating 2014). In part, this popularity reflects the
demand for information about how governments work, what governments do, and what those
governments know about their citizens. The right to information (RTI) serves as a means of challenging
government secrecy and abuse of power by addressing information asymmetries between government
and citizens. But it also serves as the institutionalization of information access, whereby administrative
procedural transparency makes information available to the public about government operations that
are relevant to the interests of citizens (Dragos et al 2012; Hood 2006; Dror, 1999). RTI is a facet of
government transparency, or open government, which is embedded in the administration operations of
the public sector, compelling all public officials to consider their roles as caretakers of information,
rather than owners.

Transparency has been defined and characterized in many ways, but essentially it is an element in the
ecosystem of accountability. As a metaphor, it serves as a public value that citizens demand from
government (Ball 2009, Greiling and Spraul 2010). It can be understood as an institutional relation of
monitoring and oversight, as information exchange over decisions and actions, and as a means of
understanding how governments work and what they achieve. (Meijer 2013: 430; Heald 2006: 30).
Right to information spans all metaphors as a value common to democratic governance and a
procedural tool for access to information.

Implementation of the right to information is an integral, foundational factor in the institutionalization
of transparency. The implementation of the right to information is realized in the practical components
of government administration, i.e., it is established through the daily activities of organizations,
particularly within the public sector. But is also influenced through the activities of a range of
stakeholders, including citizens, civil society organizations, media, oversight bodies, and politicians. For
this reason, robust implementation of RTI systems is challenging. Neuman and Calland (2007) cite lack of
leadership, administrative support, and long-term vision as key variables in poor RTI implementation.
There are surely many more factors that either cause or hinder effective RTI implementation. In the
absence of reliable, consistent data on RTI implementation in public sector management and its
governance environment, however, not enough is known about what works and why.

The benefits of transparency in government have been celebrated without robust evidence of
effectiveness, in part because the right to information is considered an intrinsic good and a human right
that should be enjoyed by individuals regardless of its effect on economic growth or political stability. It
is also a reflection of the difficulty in defining and measuring effectiveness in the implementation of the
right to information. A good starting point for considering the meaning of effectiveness within RTI
systems is discussion of its potential outcomes and how those outcomes reflect the achievement of RTI
goals.


Considering the outcomes of RTI implementation

Because of the complex nature of RTI systems, involving actors from government, civil society and
independent bodies, the trajectory from laws to social change is neither time-bound nor linear. As such,
it is difficult to determine both the nature and timing of outcomes. As a starting point in identifying a

                                                     7
theory of change, it may be more analytically useful to propose conceptually logical outcomes that can
be linked back to the system in some demonstrable way. Objectives and projected outcomes can vary
depending on the stakeholder, i.e., government, civil society, international donors, etc. Because of the
diffuse nature of transparency and accountability mechanisms, RTI systems may well achieve any
number of outcomes, whether officially envisioned or not. In this discussion, three types of outcomes
are envisioned, rooted in a context where accountability and development outcomes are the focus.

Categories of first, second, and third-degree as descriptors of outcomes are not necessarily about timing,
but rather, are intended to reflect the degree of contribution from RTI implementation process to its
outcomes. Outcomes of degree may also be understood as the deepening of transformation within the
culture of information in a particular context (district, country, region, etc.)

                                                                                 Increased gender equality, standards
                                                                                 of living, education and health

In this context, first-degree outcomes refer to the outputs of the RTI system, and can be expressed as
data on how well the system is meeting its mandate to disclose information, e.g. how responsive is the
agency to the demand for information? This includes the rate, quality, and timeliness of responses, as
well as the amount, relevance, and regularity of proactively disclosed information. Even though this data
is collected, issues with data quality and reliability in government administrative systems, and the small
size of samples from civil society compliance testing, make its use problematic for assessing
effectiveness. 1

It is possible to view first-degree outcomes as an imprecise estimation of demand for information, but
only to a small extent. Data on the composition of the group of requesters is needed before inferring
increased demand, as the volume of requests may be driven by a small group of urban elite, or a few
CSOs or journalists. Indeed, a recent study shows that requests per capita are below 1% for the eight

countries studied, which includes more established regimes in the United States, Mexico, and India
(Worker 2014).

Second-degree outcomes are about information usage for accountability purposes, i.e., strategic use of
RTI to hold government or public officials responsible for their actions and improve operational
efficiency. These outcomes answer questions about the extent to which information is being used to
hold government to account. These outcomes concerning accountability are a primary rationale for
transparency reforms. Transparency initiatives are, in fact, a means of making government more
accountable. Accountability encompasses the idea of being responsive, and responsible, about decision-
making and activities. 2 Responsiveness is captured by the concept of âanswerability,â which refers to the
right of citizens to request a response to questions about government decision-making, as well as the
obligation of government to provide a response. Responsibility is related to âenforcement,â which is
about the capacity to ensure that an action is taken, and provides for access to mechanisms for redress
when accountability measures fail (Schedler 1999).

Enforcement of accountability writ-large extends beyond right to information oversight functions into
horizontal accountability institutions such as the supreme audit institution and anti-corruption agencies
that exert pressure on organizations or individuals within government to address grievances. Vertical
forms of accountability are advanced by civil society organizations through various means of protest and
advocacy, while diagonal accountability arrangements see citizens engaging directly with horizontal
accountability institutions through policymaking, expenditure tracking, and participatory budgeting
processes (Fox 2014). RTI implementation forms a small, but important, part of these established
accountability mechanisms.

Basing their understanding of the relationship between transparency and accountability on Besley
(2006), Florini (2007), and Carey (2009), Bauhr and Grimes characterize the principal-agent problem at
hand:

         Transparency reduces the problem of information asymmetry by shedding light on the extent to
         which the agent (i.e., the government) is pursuing goals that are in the interest of principals (i.e.,
         its citizens) effectively and efficiently. In other words, transparency should enable citizens to
         evaluate to what extent their interests are being served by government and encourage
         accountability and deter abuses and misdeeds by officials (Bauhr and Grimes 2014: 310).

But in certain political contexts that are characterized by pervasive corruption, information disclosure
may induce resignation and a withdrawal from civic engagement (Bauhr and Grimes 2014). When there
is little chance of reliable sanctions or holding agents accountable, we are left with a collective action
problem, whereby the public would benefit from changes in behavior (e.g., disclosure of information)
but there is a high cost for the few individuals who move against the tide (e.g., informal penalties,
ostracization), making it unlikely that any one individual can or will undertake the task alone. Contextual
factors play a significant role in identifying the most appropriate path to accountability or reform.

Information about government and its activities must be made available, but does it matter what is
done with that information? As shown in Table 1, both the nature of the information request (public,

2
 Transparency and accountability are elements of good governance â the effective exercise of authority in the allocation of
economic and social resources and the management of government functions. The focus of governance reform is on
administration and its processes, rather than political systems of government.

                                                               9
private) and its level of politicization can determine whether information is used to hold government in
check. Indeed, the typology presented by Michener and Worthy suggests that many requests span both
private and public uses, and the information may eventually be used for accountability purposes
depending on the content of government response and the context in which the information will be
used (2013:10-11).

Figure 2: Use of RTI Requests (from Michener and Worthy 2013: 9)




The civic uses of open government data suggested by Davies (2010) supports the view that information
(even in the form of quantitative data) can be used for a variety of purposes beyond
scrutiny/accountability, including campaigning and lobbying, collaborative production of information,
planning, and services, and improving the quality of supply and demand of information for economic
development. But in a developing country context, particularly when linked to public sector reform,
transparency policies are often justified based on their political relevance, i.e., the practicality of
information for accountability mechanisms employed by citizens (Michener and Worthy 2013; Darch
and Underwood 2010; Fung et al 2007; Curtin and Meijer 2006). It is important to remember that
information can be used for a multitude of purposes, regardless of the potential for its role in holding
government or public officials in check.

Third-degree outcomes include the institutionalization of information access (disclosure as business-as-
usual) and development outcomes. Both of these outcomes are often long-term, requiring much more
than mere transparency to facilitate positive results.

Nearly all countries face ongoing challenges associated with the bureaucratic culture of secrecy that
hampers efforts to obtain information. In some countries, officials are apprehensive about sharing
information that was once considered secret or that may attract criticism to the agency upon close
inspection. In other cases, civil servants believe that the information that they generated is, in fact, their
personal possession and will not even share it with colleagues. In many instances, particularly within the
political system, information is viewed as power, not as a public good or part of the knowledge


                                                           10
commons. Well before the introduction of right to information, these attitudes can become entrenched,
making it difficult to instill the values of openness, even in the context of a clear right to information.

But often, it is not stubborn reluctance to disclose information that hinders RTI implementation. In many
countries, the incentive structures are complex and riddled with inconsistencies, leaving public officials
with little guidance as to how they should approach information disclosure. This is the case in Thailand,
where there are no incentives to release information when punishments for disclosure are severe (Nicro
et al. 2014). In Uganda, officials take an oath of secrecy upon taking office, and are penalized for
disclosing secret information (Dokeniya 2014: 291). In these cases, both the personal and institutional
incentive structure must be re-arranged to encourage disclosure and signal senior-level policy
prioritization for RTI implementation.

As with transparency and cultural shifts, the link between transparency and development outcomes is
long-term and likely influenced by a number of factors beyond an RTI system. This makes measurement
of whether outcomes are achieved a challenging process. Very often, studies depend on correlations
and regressions to estimate the relationship between development outcomes and transparency, with
indicators for transparency ranging from the existence of an RTI law to open budgeting measurement, to
constructed indices of transparency. Theories of change about these processes have yet to be supported
with reliable evidence. However, Bellver and Kaufman (2005) have shown that human development
outcomes such as life expectancy, female literacy and vaccination coverage are associated with
transparency (as an index constructed from a variety of sources), even when controlling for per capita
incomes. Fukuda-Parr et al. (2011) show that the open budget index correlates significantly with the
human development index, gender-related development index, gender empowerment measure,
primary education, and water and sanitation access. However, when differences in per capita income
and region are held constant, budget transparency retains a significant statistical association with only a
few variables, namely infant and child survival, the percentage of the population using improved
drinking water, and public health expenditure levels (Fukuda-Parr et al. 2011: 17-18).

The intended outcomes of degree in RTI implementation dealing with public sector reform parallel the
orders of change (or levels of reform) found in organizational change management literature, shown in
Table 1.

Applying the orders of change to RTI implementation suggests that first-degree outcomes are reflected
in sub-system change, where formal practices for request processing, records management, and
proactive disclosure are implemented into administrative operations within departments of
organizations. Change is incremental, depending on the resource-constraints facing organizations and
the degree of RTI policy prioritization. This kind of sub-system change bleeds into organizational change
as information disclosure becomes an accepted practice across the organization.

Second-degree outcomes about accountability are more transformational. These outcomes associated
with the use of information for accountability purposes have to do with holding government in check
and effecting change within organizations and systems. Participatory budgeting is an example of a
transparency initiative that can transform core paradigms at the organizational level about funding
allocations and policy priorities. The use of information obtained through RTI processes can also be used
to unearth corrupt practices, improve service delivery at the municipal or sub-national level, and
enhance the efficiency of internal organizational operations.

Third-degree outcomes reflect the wide scope of change â identity change that spans organizational
boundaries. The institutionalization of information access is about changes in administrative culture that
overcome practices in government secrecy, information hoarding, and perverse incentive structures.
While development outcomes extend well beyond the borders of the public sector, they can still be
reflected in changes at the inter-organizational and sectoral levels.

Effectiveness as Responsiveness

Second-degree outcomes of information usage, both intended and unpredictable, vary across a
spectrum of practical uses and theoretical models, while third-degree outcomes are diffuse and long-
term in nature. Assessing the effectiveness of RTI implementation against these kinds of outcomes
requires reliable, rigorously-collected empirical data, which is beyond the scope of this study. First-
degree outcomes of information access seem the most accessible or practical means of evaluating
effectiveness since information access is a logical, if not basic, outcome of RTI implementation (Fox et al
2011). The question then becomes how responsive are government agencies to demand for
information? The answers may include a range of variables: rate, quality, and timeliness of responses, as
well as the amount, relevance, and regularity of proactively disclosed information. Much of the past and
ongoing work in measuring the performance of right to information systems has focused on this
responsiveness of the government to information requests (e.g., Calland 2010). It is a viable basis for
advocacy work by civil society organizations and interest groups.

There have been several cross-country studies and country-specific research on the responsiveness of
governments to information requests (Dokeniya 2013; Worthy et al. 2011; Hazell et al.2010; Open
Society Justice Initiative 2006; RaaG 2009; Global Integrity Report 2004-2011). These studies employ a
variety of methodologies, including case studies and local expert assessments with scoring criteria, both
which may involve interviews and desk research of policy reports, media articles, and other sources of
information. There has also been compliance or field testing by civil society organizations and donors to
determine the costs, timing, and quality of responses from different ministries and government
agencies. However, the costs of large-scale cross-country compliance testing are considerable.

The Transparency in Governance section of the OECD Government at a Glance survey of member
governments is one of the few attempts to collect data on the extent of proactive disclosure. But much
of its data is concerned with the location of access, rather than the regularity of updates or relevance to
demand. Open data assessment and evaluation of government web portals are two separate lines of
inquiry that capture partial data on proactive disclosure, but the results are not geared towards
establishing links to RTI implementation process, and have yet to prove useful for this purpose (Open
Data Barometer 2013, Open Data Index 2013, Luna et al 2013, Holzer and Manoharan 2007).

An additional source is the tracking/reporting data that agencies collect on their own RTI
implementation processes. Table 2 provides a snapshot of the requests and appeals data from eight
countries, demonstrating that comparison of performance data is problematic at best. The number of
agencies reporting ranges from 15 to 285 per country, a gap that does not necessarily correspond to
population differences. It may, in fact, reflect different institutional arrangements, reporting rules and
compliance and/or differences in the scope of the laws. Though the number of requests submitted
varies across countries, per capita request statistics are generally similar at less than 1%, albeit with
substantial variance among countries. Given the information that is available, backlogs seem to be much
higher in countries where number of requests is higher (India, Mexico, US), but India is clearly an outlier
in the number of requests outstanding.

Table 3 shows that more than half of information requests are being granted in full or in part (range of
55%-85%), with less than 15% of refusals based on exemptions, although only half the countries
reported this statistic. In absolute numbers, South Africaâs disclosure rate is higher than that of the
United Kingdom and United States. But unqualified comparison of the numbers is not appropriate, as
the complexity of requests varies across countries. Detailed data on the content of requests is extremely
difficult to obtain, and in fact, is not collected in a majority of countries. 5 By and large, data is
disaggregated at the level of ministry, not by the content of request or identity group of requester, e.g.,
academic, media, private sector, etc. The most commonly collected request data the total number of
requests, and the number of requests granted, refused, outstanding, and transferred.

other than for appeals and complaints. The CIC in India reports refusal data, but does not provide figures for granted in full or
part. Jordan and Mexico do not have a category for granted in part.

The appeals data collected in Workerâs paper demonstrates more variation but offers much less
explanatory information. In addition to the challenges posed by different levels and types of appeals,
the statistics on appeals often aggregate appeals numbers and offer little explanation as to the basis for
an appeal and how it was resolved. Some patterns in the appeals data show that data is generally
collected only at level of agency and external appeals body. Though appeals are not only about refusals
to provide information, the percentage of refusals that are appealed ranges from 2%-66%, and the
percent of appeals upheld ranges from 12%-75% (Worker 2014). Appeals provide even less information
about the extent of information disclosure, as the nature of appeals is complex, and does not reflect a
simple or deliberate refusal to provide information. Decisions depend on the nature of the request,
basis for appeal, and case precedent. There is no reason to believe that data on appeals can provide a
clear assessment of more or less information disclosure.

Analyzing the data on requests and appeals helps provide an understanding of the performance of
agencies, shortcomings of the legal framework, and points to areas that need improvement. But this
kind of descriptive data does not provide enough information to determine whether information
disclosure process is effective. In order to get a clear picture of the reasons for variation in the data, it is
necessary to investigate contextual factors in the enabling environment and administrative factors at
the agency level. All data must be interpreted in a way that is appropriate for the context, and often this
requires additional data collection and analysis.

Alternative means of exploring effectiveness

Overall comparisons about the effectiveness of countriesâ RTI systems across the sample is a difficult
task, as contextual factors play a large role in the performance and sustainability of RTI systems. Some
countries struggle with legacies of administrative secrecy, while others face serious records
management challenges that impact the capacity to respond to requests. There is also significant
variation in the extent of RTI implementation within agencies or public bodies within one country,
rendering de-contextualized conclusions about âcountry performanceâ in the realm of RTI somewhat
abstract.

In general, RTI systems in India, Mexico, the United States, and the United Kingdom are considered
robust, but still facing challenges. India has a vibrant civil society that engages with the RTI system
regularly and at all levels and sectors of implementation, yet it still struggles with low levels of capacity
within the public sector. Mexico is considered a model RTI system because of its independent and well-
funded information commission, which succeeds in enforcing disclosure obligations on public bodies
using a variety of methods. The RTI system in the United Kingdom has succeeded in implementing RTI
throughout public bodies through its professionalized civil service and the monitoring and enforcement
capabilities of an independent information commission. Even though it lacks an information
commission, the United States has been implementing RTI for nearly five decades, and its RTI system is
considered functional, yet characterized by delays in appeals processing.

On the other side of the spectrum are new and struggling RTI systems, where implementation is either
slow in taking hold, or has suffered setbacks. Jordan is still in the early phases of implementing RTI
within the public sector, and many agencies have yet to develop forms or procedures for requesting
access. Uganda faces general challenges with levels of staff capacity and resources within the civil
service, while the implementation of Moldovaâs RTI system has not been supported by any nodal
authority or monitoring body. Public officials in Thailand operate with unclear policies on the kinds of
information that can be released, but are subject to severe sanction for release of classified information.

                                                      15
In the middle of the spectrum are countries that have implemented RTI with varying degrees of
progress, but still face serious challenges. Albaniaâs RTI system is characterized by informal personal
networks within the public sector that substitute for formalized practices, but makes obtaining
information through RTI procedures problematic for ordinary citizens. Peru and Romania have engaged
civil societies, yet grapple with training, enforcement, and monitoring. South Africa has an active human
rights commission that conducts regular evaluations and training for civil servants, but also lacks
enforcement authority and faces the challenge of low capacity within the civil service.

Though these descriptions of country RTI systems are accurate in that they are factual, they are far from
comprehensive or contextualized, and they provide little indication of effectiveness. But there is no
quantifiable, reliable measurement of RTI implementation yet available to measure effectiveness as the
first-degree outcome of extent of information disclosure. Data on the number of requests, responses,
and appeals, and proactively disclosed documents provides a general picture of the volume of requests
being processed and information released by administrative systems, and may even capture data on
timeliness (Worker 2014). But this type of data offers little information on the quality of responses,
relevance of proactively released information to demand, or the satisfaction of users. These latter
factors are arguably more important to understanding the extent of disclosure than figures on volume
and timeliness, as they provide insight into whether there is pro forma adherence to RTI disclosure
obligations, or by contrast, a deeper level of commitment from government to the principles of
information access.

There is also the question about the reliability of the administrative data being published by countries
on their performance in RTI systems. This is not necessarily a reflection of intentional obfuscation on the
part of governments, but perhaps, the state of institutional capacity within an agency. Inconsistent
adherence to internal tracking systems for requests, as well as variance in the quality of performance
monitoring systems within public bodies, may contribute to imprecise data. Other types of monitoring,
such as compliance testing by civil society organizations or oversight bodies on the rate of response, are
often only feasible for a sample of agencies, as are external checks on the quality of government
response. Generalization to the entire set of government agencies with unreliable and inconsistently
collected data must be done with qualification. Basing conclusions about effectiveness on administrative
data or compliance testing generates a partial understanding of how a system is performing, but is far
from complete.

In an attempt to encompass a wider frame of study than responsiveness, performance, or the mechanics
of implementation, this study focuses on the precursors to implementation effectiveness, i.e., what is
preventing or facilitating implementation in practice? This is not a question of whether specific
outcomes are achieved, but rather, an inquiry into the drivers of implementation that lead to
effectiveness. With this exploratory frame, it is important to study so-called âsuccess storiesâ in RTI
implementation, as well as systems that are struggling with different aspects of implementation.

The conclusions in this study about the drivers of effectiveness in RTI systems are based on a synthesis
of the successes and constraints to a functioning RTI system that were documented in twelve country
case studies. Recurring issues, areas of success, and large and small failures were categorized and
grouped so as to generate insight into what matters for RTI effectiveness beyond the parameters of one
case. The following section on methodology explains the steps that were taken to identify the drivers of
effectiveness using a qualitative approach to data synthesis.

Methodology
Thematic Synthesis

The study employs a thematic synthesis of twelve country case studies that examined the quality and
extent of implementation of right to information systems. Its primary aim is to identify drivers of
effectiveness for RTI implementation, but consideration of important themes that characterize RTI
implementation (e.g., innovations, good practices, challenges, etc.) was a secondary goal. Rather than a
reorganization and summary of information that characterizes a literature review, thematic synthesis
aims to identify the recurring themes or issues in a collection of primary research, and to generate an
analytical understanding that extends beyond the conclusions of the individual cases.

Themes are identified through iterative coding of the text, and then organized and analyzed for the
purpose of interpretation. Reliability is established through intercoder reliability checks on the codes
that are generated and the text that is coded, with the aim of assessing the extent to which independent
coders reach the same conclusion when evaluating the same text. The purpose of this method is to
develop analytical themes through a descriptive synthesis and find explanations relevant to a particular
review question (Ring et al. 2011). Information is often tabulated to allow identification of prominent (or
higher-order) themes and offer structured ways of dealing with the data in each theme (Tacconelli
2009).

Coding involves the assigning of a code (category, theme, idea) to part of a text for the purposes of
classification or identification.

         Codes are tags or labels for assigning units of meaning to the descriptive or inferential
         information compiled during a study. Codes usually are attached to 'chunks' of varying sizeâ
         words, phrases, sentences, or whole paragraphs, connected or unconnected to a specific
         setting. They can take the form of a straightforward category label (Miles and Huberman 1994:
         56).


                                                               17
Coding can be employed without a priori theoretical considerations, so that codes are inductively
created while the researcher is reviewing the text (Glaser 1978, 1992). This is the hallmark of the
Grounded Theory Method developed by Glaser and Strauss (1967) and further refined by Strauss and
Corbin (1998) and Charmaz (2001). 10 But prior knowledge of a phenomenon can also inform data
analysis. Literature reviews are, in fact, âvital tools for developing frameworks and paradigmsâ¦which
work as scaffolding for the researcherâ (Fram 2013: 4). Qualitative content analysis is thus a variant of
coding that begins with ex ante categories derived from theory or empirics, but allows for those
categories to change as coding progresses (GlÃ¤ser and Laudel 2013: 22). Relevant text is then extracted
and simplified, capturing the content rather than the phrasing or framing of the information, allowing it
to be cross-tabulated and compared. In thematic synthesis, coding and extracting overlap during the
review process, allowing for inclusion of pre-existing empirical considerations that do not crowd out
inductive reasoning.

Qualitative data undergoes an iterative and inductive process of constant recoding through the Constant
Comparative Analysis method, whereby data is repeatedly compared to other data during coding, with
the aim of ensuring that the emerging codes account for all the data being reviewed. This reduces the
data so that core categories can emerge (Fram 2013; Charmaz 2001; Strauss 1987; Glaser 1978; Glaser
and Strauss 1967).


Sampling

Purposive sampling was used to select cases, as a form of non-probability sampling in which decisions
about the sample of cases were strategic and tied to the objectives of the study. The aim of purposive
sampling is not prediction, but interpretative explanation that extends beyond the analysis of each
individual case (Thomas and Harden 2008; Doyle 2003). Results are not generalizable to an entire
population without qualification. Instead, they contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of the
phenomena being studied and serve as a basis for further research.

In this context, case studies were initially designed and written with the aim of serving as the basis for a
larger qualitative synthesis. A first round of eight case studies was completed in 2012 with a focus on
identifying factors associated with implementation effectiveness, using a minimal framework for
investigating and organizing qualitative data that is reflected in the content of the studies. A second
round of four indicator-driven case studies was conducted in 2014. As part of the second-phase project
design, indicators were discussed, vetted, and revised by researchers involved in the project so that
indicators could serve as practical guides for data collection in the case studies. Criterion sampling was
thus employed for this study, as all cases focused on the implementation of right to information systems
as shaped by legal frameworks, public sector practices, and enabling environments, using a variety of
data collection methods for the purposes of triangulation of data, e.g., interviews with public officials
and civil society organizations, analysis of administrative data, third-party compliance testing and
analysis, desk research, and where possible, use of indicators to structure research and analysis. 11
10
   Grounded Theory Method is an inductive methodology that involves coding for saturation, where no new
properties or dimensions are emerging from continued coding and comparison when additional data is added to
the sample. This is considered theoretical saturation, and forms the basis for theory-making (Holton 2010).

   This report is complemented by three other publications: a volume of the 12 case studies that form the basis for
this report (Trapnell 2014), an analysis of data on requests and appeals in eight countries (Worker 2014), and a
short report on the spread of RTI legislation (Mendel 2014). http://go.worldbank.org/7IP1PWBFV0

Table 5 provides details on the sample of cases from a wide variety of contexts. The range of countries
studied was limited to some extent by the existence of RTI laws, which are somewhat concentrated in
middle-income and high-income countries. Most of the countries in the sample passed their RTI laws in
the late 90s and early 00s, leading to a timeline of about 10-15 years for implementation at the time of
the data collection. Exceptions to this rule are the United States - 1966, Uganda â 2005, and Jordan â
2007.

Limitations

The data collection and frame for analysis for the underlying case studies were structured by a set of
parameters (or indicators) that were informed by prior research and practitioner expertise. However,
there is no doubt that some areas could have benefited from a deeper level of inquiry, or may have
appeared throughout cases even though they were overlooked in the initial data collection instruments.
One of the goals of the qualitative coding process is to capture themes and patterns that were not
fleshed out in the initial data collection strategy.

Because of the wide scope of investigation with the case studies, abstraction from micro-level cases to a
macro level of analysis was challenging, as was the aggregation of information into manageable items
for systemic analysis. One suggestion for future work in this area is to narrow the field of inquiry to
fewer components, so as to encourage a deeper level of analysis that does not require extensive
abstraction to a higher-order. This might be achieved through provincial, sectoral, agency-level or even
thematic studies.

The case studies that serve as the basis for this report were researched and written up by a variety of
authors, with different levels of focus and knowledge, but with extensive experience in studying or
working with RTI systems. They brought different skill sets to the analysis, and applied their
understandings of what matters for RTI systems to the subject matter, albeit within an analytical
framework that required triangulation of data for reliability purposes. Further qualitative or quantitative
inquiry into the effectiveness of RTI systems may confirm, clarify, or contradict these findings, but will
more than likely build off of the substantial work that has already been accomplished in the case
studies.


                                                                 19
Because the study is based on only twelve country case studies, there remains the possibility that other
factors matter for the effectiveness of RTI systems, but they were not captured in the studies, and
subsequently in this synthesis report. Generalizations to the universe of RTI systems may not be
appropriate, but the goal is to present findings from this qualitative synthesis as a first, rigorous step
towards understanding the drivers of effectiveness in RTI systems, even if they are further revised as
additional research is conducted.

Conceptual Framework
Codes and Fields

In this synthesis report, both open coding and qualitative content analysis were used to categorize data
from twelve country case studies that totaled 650 pages of text. This dual approach reflects the current
knowledge base of RTI systems, and serves to identify themes that may not have been made explicit in
the individual case studies, but regularly appear across the cases.

In terms of agency operations and oversight of RTI systems, empirical investigation has been ongoing for
several years. Hence, qualitative content analysis was conducted using ex ante variables for
investigation that are based on a growing consensus on the administrative practices that form the basis
of request processing, records management, and proactive disclosure, as well as the features of
monitoring and enforcement of RTI systems (Carter Center 2014; Fox et al. 2011; Neuman 2009). These
codes reflect an understanding of RTI systems as embedded in public administration functions at the
agency or ministry level, and requiring centralized government oversight of implementation processes
and compliance with legal mandates, along with a multi-level, accessible process for appeals and
complaints.

Because RTI systems operate within a dynamic ecosystem of transparency and accountability actors,
there is less agreement on the external factors that drive success within implementation. Thus, open
coding served as the primary basis for identification of themes related to the enabling environment for
RTI systems, including but not limited to, the role of civil society organizations, political stability,
international pressure, and the domestic demand for information.

Coding produced an average of 260 references (instances of coded text) per country case. Reliability
checks were conducted independently on 5% of all coded text with two coders that were not involved in
the project, using the set of codes in Table 7. Inter-coder reliability tests resulted in 92% matching
among the coders, with 30% of external coding suggesting additional nuances in interpretation, but no
new codes.

Once prominent themes were confirmed through an iterative process of reviewing and coding, a
conceptual mapping was produced in order to capture the relationships among codes. This mapping of
codes into higher-order fields reflects the barriers and facilitators to RTI effectiveness that were
captured in the content of the codes.

Drivers of Effectiveness

Fields that contained the highest number of distinct references across the case studies were identified
as prominent drivers of effectiveness. They were then organized into domains of RTI implementation
that reflect the codes generated through this study, as well as the relationships among those codes and
their higher-order fields.

Figure 2 presents the drivers of effectiveness as identified in this synthesis report. It is important to
point out that the findings from the study suggest that government action and administrative processes
are only some of the factors that facilitate effective RTI implementation. Drivers of effectiveness span
the range of actors involved (citizens, activists, policymakers, civil servants, political appointees,
ministers, civil society organizations, media, firms), and often require collaboration among these actors
for successful functioning.

The drivers also extend across local and national levels of implementation. The domains of both
enabling conditions and oversight focus on national-level features of RTI systems, while demand for
information bridges national, provincial, and local levels, and institutional capacity centers on the
functioning of individual agencies. In fact, all drivers pertain to implementation at various levels and
interact with each other in ways that reflect local conditions , e.g., demand for health and medical
information may be influenced by accessibility barriers at a central agency that are in turn fueled by a
lack of national-level policy prioritization. This suggests that sequencing of reform should be based on an
adequate assessment of the drivers and a subsequent interpretation of their relationships to each other
in specific circumstances. Sequencing necessarily varies by country context and the presence or absence
of drivers of RTI implementation effectiveness. It is beyond the parameters of this synthesis paper but
warrants future study.

Domains of RTI Implementation

The analysis of codes and fields produced a conceptual mapping of four domains of RTI implementation
that encompass the drivers of effectiveness. They encapsulate the legal and civic environment in which
RTI is implemented, the demand and supply of information, and oversight of the RTI process through
monitoring and enforcement.

Enabling conditions inhere both within and outside the public sector, but are not only relevant to right
to information. They include a well-designed legal framework, as well as a functioning civil society with
the capacity to engage with government and to advocate for reform. Also included are political stability
and ongoing policy prioritization from executive or legislative leadership that signals the importance of
RTI policies within government agencies.

Demand for information is driven by user knowledge of the right to information, the understanding of
bureaucratic procedures that serve as gateways to accessing information, and barriers to accessibility
that originate within the public sector. It includes rule-based and accessible government processes that
allow individuals and groups to engage with the government through regular channels.

Institutional capacity refers to the non-specialist functions of bureaucracies, including strategic
planning, personnel management, and monitoring progress towards institutional goals. Administrative
practices that are grounded in operational transparency lay the foundation for open government. Poor
operational performance in RTI is often the result of a combination of factors: resource-constrained
environments, combined with a lack of training and employment incentives, resulting in poor
performance.

Oversight has to do with monitoring activities and enforcement capabilities at the system level. This
includes support to the implementation process across government through the provision of guidance,
implementing regulations, and training. Enforcement concerns appeals and sanctions, but also
encompasses other methods to compel regular and consistent information disclosure by public bodies.

Findings
Enabling conditions
Legal framework for RTI

All the country cases confirm that the implementation of RTI is critically influenced by the quality of the
laws that establish the entitlement to information. In many cases, the regulatory framework establishing
RTI and ensuring its implementation consists of several laws, decrees, or ministerial orders, some of
which contradict the principle of disclosure, and some of which support RTI though implementing rules.
The latter is particularly relevant if the RTI law exhibits flaws, but would be difficult to amend.
Weaknesses in the RTI law can, in fact, lead to a number of implementation problems. Absence of
deadlines for responding to information requests, or legally specified deadlines that extend beyond the
standard 20-day limit, allow delays to characterize the RTI system across public bodies. In fact, most
countries in the sample have a 30-40 day deadline with the option to extend.

Table 8 captures scores for the RTI law in areas that were cited as obstacles for implementation in the
case studies. Of particular concern were secrecy provisions in other laws and weak or limited exceptions
in RTI laws, which allowed information officers to exempt a great deal of information from disclosure.
This was noted as a problem in Uganda, Moldova, and Jordan, where state secrets laws trump RTI
provisions (Dokeniya 2014: 290; Lipcean and Stefan 2014: 162; Meknassi 2014: 378). In Peru, recently
revised declassification timelines trump RTI disclosure provisions, and broad exceptions in the RTI law in
Thailand give officials wide discretion in determining what to disclose (Pereira Chumbe 2014: 194; Nicro
et al. 2014: 490). Of course, even well-specified exceptions may be abused, but narrowly defined
exceptions limit the latitude of officials in exercising discretion.

Table 9 demonstrates that the laws establishing RTI in the sample countries range from a low of 55 to a
high of 119, where the maximum score is 150. Countries score relatively well in the categories of right to
access, scope, and request procedures, but struggle with the quality of legal provisions governing
exceptions, sanctions, appeals, and promotional measures. Exceptions to disclosure obligations include
indicators on internationally-accepted exemptions, the harm and public interest tests, severability
clauses that allow portions of records to be released, and reasons for refusals.

Table 10 demonstrates that half of the countries either have state secrets laws that supersede RTI laws
or have RTI laws with broad exceptions to disclosure, making it difficult for officials to determine what
kinds of information can be disclosed, particularly if they will be penalized for violating exemptions
requirements. Even when state secrets laws do not contradict or dominate RTI laws, there are still
questions about the appropriateness of some exemption policies that maintain secrecy. This pertains
both to more advanced RTI systems, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as
struggling systems such as Uganda, Jordan, and Thailand.

At least one-third of countries fail to legislate the requirement for public consultations, whistle-blower
protections or data protection. These laws are complementary and supportive of the right to
information by allowing civil society input on RTI policies, protecting public officials from releasing
information that is in the public interest and exposes wrongdoing, and by protecting individuals from
release of sensitive, personal data.


Advocacy efforts

All case studies cited the efforts of civil society organizations, media groups and journalists, and
academics as instrumental in the formation and/or implementation of RTI laws. In fact, lack of
involvement in passage of the RTI law in Albania, Jordan, Moldova, and Thailand has resulted in lack of
ownership by citizens, and very slow implementation progress due to lack of demand ( Trebicka and
Shella 2014; Meknassi 2014; Lipcean and Stefan 2014; Nicro et al. 2014). This is true even in countries
with more active post-communist civil societies, such as Albania and Moldova. In over half of the
countries, civil society conducts compliance testing on the rates and quality of response from
government, which can be compared to self-reported data from administrative system to provide a
more accurate understanding of agency performance.

CSOs are comparatively less involved in RTI implementation in Jordan, Thailand, and Uganda, which
correlates with a lack of civic space for this kind of engagement, indicated by the lower CIVICUS scores
highlighted in Table 11. These countries also heavily regulate their NGO communities, which serves as a
deterrent to the establishment and activities of civil society organizations. The average CIVICUS score for
the sample of cases is 0.57, indicating that the governance environment need not reach the scores of
advanced economies, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, in order to predict sustainable
advocacy efforts on RTI. Generally speaking, once a country passes a score of 0.50 on the Civicus Index,
advocacy efforts are seen to span the range of most common options.


Policy prioritization

Policy prioritization is comprised of signaling events by high-level officials within government, which
consequently impact the strength of strategic and operational leadership of senior public officials
engaged in the management of the public sector. Findings from the country cases suggest that political
support is a major driver of sustainable and effective implementation.

Table 12 demonstrates that public expressions of support for RTI by politicians and ministers are
uncommon across the sample of countries. However, in countries that are considered more robust, e.g.,
Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States, there is not only public support for RTI
implementation, but there is also clear evidence of sustained, well-funded initiatives supported by high-
level political figures, such as presidents and members of parliament (Mizrahi and Mendiburu 2014;
Trapnell 2014; Alexander 2014). In nearly all cases, civil society organizations and media are active in
either advocacy or collaborative activities. International support in the form of funding or technical
assistance seems to correlate closely with level of GDP, rather than with types of implementation
activities.

There is a variety of reasons for lack of political support for the right to information, leading to
ineffective or absent initiatives that prioritize RTI implementation. Political instability has hindered
implementation in Albania and Moldova, and by extension, limited the prioritization of RTI within the
public sector (Trebicka and Shella 2014: 11; Lipcean and Stefan 2014: 163). The push for accession into
the European Union initially drove implementation in Romania, helped in particular by the publication of
league tables that assessed implementation efforts, but political interest has tapered off. In the absence
of a monitoring body, implementation has stalled (Ionita and Stefan 2014: 244, 250). The case in South
Africa is similar, except that it was post-Apartheid reforms that drove RTI and have now lost steam
(Moses 2014: 458). Politicians and bureaucrats in Thailand view RTI as a tool for investigating corruption
and ousting officials from government, and thus there is little political support (Nicro et al. 2014: 482,
518).

Demand for information
Public Awareness

Public awareness of RTI influences not only the ability of requesters to access information, but also their
understanding of the information rights accorded to citizens. Table 13 identifies countries in which the
general public demonstrates an operational understanding of RTI. In country cases where lack of public
knowledge of RTI was cited as a barrier to effective implementation, conclusions were based on surveys
carried out by government monitoring bodies or civil society organizations (Trebicka and Shella 2014:
29; Devasher Surie and Aiyar 2014: 75; Meknassi 2014: 388; Lipcean and Stefan 2014: 167; Pereira
Chumbe 2014: 206; Moses 2014: 426; Dokeniya 2014: 283-84).

Public outreach and promotional measures are an overlooked aspect of government responsibility, even
when mandated by law. It is important to make citizens aware of their rights if their participation in the
information access regime is to be considered a measure of the effectiveness of the RTI system. In the
sample of cases, only four countries - India, Mexico, Peru, and South Africaâ have mandated
government agencies that regularly conduct activities aimed at RTI education and outreach (Devasher
Surie and Aiyar 2014:62-64; Mizrahi and Mendiburu 2014: 118; Pereira Chumbe 2014: 197; Moses
2014: 447-48). However, Mexico is the only country of these four with a general public that
demonstrates an understanding of RTI. This suggests that public outreach is either not being conducted
effectively by government in other countries, or that public outreach activities have less of an effect on
public awareness than previously thought. All country cases described CSO engagement (and sometimes
media) in public education and awareness-raising on RTI, in some cases this included assistance with
formulation and submission of their information requests.

Accessibility

Beyond awareness of information rights and processes, accessibility of information encompasses
structural factors that block access to the RTI request and appeals process and the dissemination of
proactively disclosed information. Findings from the case studies revealed a wide scope of instances
where accessibility was compromised, with factors ranging from petty corruption to informal networks,
lack of information officers, and language differences. One of the most entrenched obstacles to access
to information is the legal provision that excludes non-citizens from making requests for information.
The legal frameworks in Uganda, Jordan, and Thailand allow only citizens to benefit from the right to
information system, excluding the international community, migrants, and immigrants from exercising a
right to information (Dokeniya 2014; Meknassi 2014: 379; Nicro et al. 2014: 484).

Table 14 indicates that requesters in half the countries in the sample face other obstacles to
accessibility, which can be compromised by a variety of factors. Petty corruption was cited as a concern
in Albania and Uganda, where soft money is used not to expedite requests, but rather to ensure that
requests are accepted, with no guarantee of a quality response (Trebicka and Shella 2014: 34; Dokeniya
2014: 301). Personal connections are important again in Albania, but also in Jordan, where informality in
request processing is a result of the low number of requests, further exacerbating the problem (Trebicka
and Shella 2014; Meknassi 2014). Moreover, in Jordan, there is simply no form available to request
information in most ministries, even though it is mandated by law, and a reason for use of the
information must be provided (Meknassi 2014: 377). Language difficulties are a prevailing factor in the
low demand for information in South Africa, as requesters struggle with not only formulating a request,
but also understanding the rules for submitting requests (Moses 2014: 452). Despite the high volume of
requests in India, with remarkable successes in securing accountability in some areas, citizens still face a
lack of information on the filing process, and they are regularly unable to find contact information for
submission at district and local government levels (Devasher and Surie 2014: 75).

Providing assistance to requesters is mandated by law or included in policy guidelines for Mexico,
Moldova, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States, however, the practice of assisting is not

Trapnell 2014: 329; Alexander 2014: 558). In some countries, such as Albania and Thailand, assistance
may be provided as specified by non-RTI laws, but there is no guarantee that RTI requesters will benefit
from this practice (Trebicka and Shella 2014: 18; Nicro et al. 2014: 506).

Nearly all the countries in the sample provide for first instances of appeals at the level of the public
body. Because this level of appeal is at the same organization as the initial request, users have a higher
likelihood of receiving assistance from officials in the appeals submission process. As shown in Table 15,
only five of the countries in the sample specify that appeals (either first or second) are filed through an
independent, non-judicial authority, such as an information commission or council. Appeals to these
kinds of authorities do not require substantial fees or expertise, the processes are simplified for
maximum accessibility, and decisions are often binding.

Several countries in the sample face obstacles to an accessible appeals process, for reasons having to do
with both accessibility and problematic judicial authority. In Peru, a legal suit is file through the
constitutional action of habeas data, which must be maintained over time, and even then, decisions
may not be applied as general rules (Pereira Chumbe 2014: 198-99). Appeals in the South African courts
are complex and expensive, deterring most requesters from pursuing information disclosure through
this option (Moses 2014: 452). Judicial review is such a complex deterrent in Albania that few appeals
have ever been filed (citation). The High Court in Jordan often refuses to hear RTI cases, and it is not
clear if decisions by the appeals authority are binding on agencies (citation). The judiciary in Uganda is
considered to be prone to political influence, and lacks the technical capacity to address RTI issues
(Dokeniya 2014: 297-8). In order benefit from the investigatory authority of the public protecter
(ombudsman) in South Africa, violation of due process must be established, which is not always the
reason for failure to disclose information (Moses 2014).

Institutional capacity
Updated, formal practices

Internal rules and administrative regulations are important for incorporating legal obligations into
agency processes and activities. They are present in most or all agencies in only three countries in the
sample (Mexico, United Kingdom, United States). These rules lay the groundwork for institutionalization
of RTI practices. Formalization here refers to the extent to which agencies have institutionalized their
legal obligations into formal practices, procedures, and institutional arrangements that support the basic
functions in an RTI system at the agency level. It does not refer to the boundary-setting of case law on
appeals, such as is the case in Romania, where laws are operationalized through the courts and non-
compulsory guidance is ignored (Ionita and Stefan 2014: 255).

Table 16 indicates that most agencies do not benefit from updated, formal practices in all three areas of
RTI-related operations. Records management is by far the least formalized or updated of all practices,
likely because it is behind the scenes. Proactive disclosure practices are also poorly formalized, and only
half of the sample cases enjoy some measure of updated and formal practices in information request
processing.

Request process

Informal requests for information have always been prevalent among some user groups, such as
journalists and civil society organizations, as they are expedited means of obtaining information. There
is no reason that informal requests of this nature pose a problem for formalized information disclosure.
However, some countries struggle with overcoming a tradition of informal networks in the information
request process, or petty corruption in front-line offices, that served to exclude and reinforce

                                                            34
established power dynamics. In this sample, Albania, Jordan, Uganda face challenges of that kind
(Trebicka and Shella 2014: 34; Meknassi 2014: 388; Dokeniya 2014: 300). Formalization of the
information request process is important as a means of providing access beyond a specialist group of
users. Informality in the requesting process precludes reliable tracking of activities, as requests are not
registered, departments holding information may not be consulted, and the basis for appeals is pre-
empted. Even though formal requesting procedures may lengthen the process of obtaining information,
they are essential for institutionalizing the process in the organization, rather than with a few
individuals. But care must be taken not to overly bureaucratize the process of information request.

Without proper guidance on the methods to evaluate information requests, public officials fail to
distinguish between RTI-based requests and routine information inquiries. Requests that are treated as
routine information inquiries are not subject to RTI deadlines and do not benefit from the protections
under law, including appeals and assistance. In other cases, such as in Albania, Moldova, Romania, and
Uganda, the formal request process involves several levels of management, and official disclosure often
requires the approval of the secretary-general of the ministry (Trebicka and Shella 2014: 34; Lipcean and
Stefan 2014: 164; Ionita and Stefan 2014: 252; Dokeniya 2014: 305-6). This over-bureaucratization
motivates public officials to treat requests unofficially, as the time and effort involved with processing
an official request is overwhelming. Although this tactic may be useful in terms of efficiency of response,
it can be abused and result in discarded requests or informal refusals that do not provide a basis for
appeal. The combination of extensive informality in practices or a lack of clear distinction between
normal business operations and RTI requests leads to poor tracking of requests, such as in Moldova and
Jordan.

Most countries allow electronic means of submitting formal requests (online and email), but require an
official form to be completed and sent by requesters. Electronic submission (as opposed to email
requests) is available in five countries in the sample â United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Mexico,
and India â but it is not equally available across agencies. In the case of the United States and Thailand,
electronic submission of requests is developed by the agencies and available on agency websites
(Alexander 2014; Nicro et al. 2014). In contrast, Mexico and India have a centralized portal for the
submission of requests that is used for access to information for any agency in the country (Mizrahi and
Mendiburu 2014; Devasher Surie and Aiyar 2014).


Proactive disclosure

In Romania, it is estimated that only 50 percent of central institutions release information on their
websites, with only 25 percent of local institutions doing so (Ionita and Stefan 2014: 258). Albanian
ministerial and cabinet decisions, as well as legal amendments and policies, are sometimes not even
published in paper form, even though electronic dissemination has been available since 2005 (Trebicka
and Shella 201; 25-26). Only two countries in the sample use centralized portals for proactive disclosure
(Mexico, Peru), and it is not clear whether this approach is optimal. Centralization of information
disclosure avoids problems with less user-friendly agency websites and low technical skills of local
agencies. But coordination and technical costs for uploading materials from various parts of the country
may outweigh any benefits to citizens for central access, particularly if technical support for the
centralization process is not sustainable (Pereira Chumbe 2014: 200).

Online submission allows for automatic recording and tracking of requests, but country cases noted that
investment in design and maintenance are required to ensure sustainability. Mexicoâs portal also serves
as internal tracking of all requests and responses. This has enabled the information commission and
others to identify patterns and trends in information flows that contribute to improved practices, and in
particular, performance monitoring. In Thailand, the ministry of environment tracks requests for
information and proactively releases information with high request rates (Nicro et al. 2014). Mexico has
created a searchable database for all requests and responses, allowing for tracking of highly popular
information and identification of information that should be proactively released (Mizrahi and
Mendiburu 2014).


Records management

All but three countries in the sample have issued some guidance on electronic records management, but
the level of detail and compliance in this guidance is not clear.

Electronic document management systems are inconsistently implemented even in the strongest RTI
systems. In the United States, for example, emails are still printed out in hard copy and scanned into the
system, rather than filed electronically directly into the system (Alexander 2014: 585). In weaker and
less-resourced systems, emails are not even considered manageable, because of the lack of resources to
print and scan. Records management in Romania suffers from a lack of integrated data management,
making it difficult to access even current information within the filing systems (Ionita and Stefan 2014:
251-252). E-government processes are implemented by IT staff without concerns of RTI or integrated
records management, and information cannot be linked across systems for appropriate categorization
and storage. Records management authorities provide much needed guidance on the introduction of
electronic management systems within the public sector. In cases where records management is not
given high priority, or resources are constrained, manual filing processes are still employed, and storage
facilities are poorly organized and insecure.


Staffing levels

Table 19 indicates that four cases specifically noted that staffing levels were a concern for effective RTI
implementation. In Jordan, Moldova, Thailand, and Uganda, demand for information is so low that
there the number of staff assigned RTI responsibilities is sufficient to respond to requests (Meknassi
2014; Lipcean and Stefan 2014; Nicro et al. 2014; Dokeniya 2014). Albania faces the challenge of the
wide use of political appointments in the civil service, which has lessened the degree of commitment to
RTI objectives within an organization, as appointees were more focused on a limited and time-bound
political agenda (Trebicka and Shella 2014: 20). In other cases, turnover of staff with specialized
knowledge of RTI obligations resulted in a loss of institutionalized knowledge (Pereira Chumbe 2014:
197; Trapnell 2014: 334).

The placement of RTI functions within separate, dedicated units varies across the countries in the
sample. As noted in Table 20, only two countries require the establishment of dedicated units or
centers, while four other countries may see dedicated units in agencies with a high volume of requests
or complicated schemes for exemption. Table 19 also indicates that at least three countries have
agencies without information officers to receive information requests (i.e., Jordan, South Africa,
Uganda).

Staff capacity

Staff capacity is driven by adequate training and resources that allow information officers to meet their
legal obligations for information disclosure. All countries in the sample faced training constraints and
low levels of RTI awareness by public officials (Trebicka and Shella 2014: 29; Devasher Surie and Aiyar
2014: 66-67; Meknassi 2014: 376-7; Lipcean and Stefan 2014: 164; Pereira Chumbe 2014: 207; Moses
2014: 440-41; Dokeniya 2014: 301). The exceptions to this pattern are Mexico, the United Kingdom, and
the United States, as shown in Tables 21 and 22. In these three cases, individual agencies have either
taken on compulsory training responsibilities for their own staff, or RTI training has become embedded
in local training programs, indicating that line ministries are institutionalizing RTI into regular agency
functions (Mizrahi and Mendiburu 2014: 103; Trapnell, ed. 2014: 333; Alexander 2014: 574). Staff
knowledge was not cited as an obstacle in Romania, where an initial push for training was initiated by
the government and sustained by international funding and local NGOs, and resulted in a manual
produced for information officers. However, the monitoring and training efforts have since lost steam
and are nearly defunct (Ionita and Stefan 2014: 253).

The large number of public information officers required to implement RTI systems in government
bodies, at the national and sub-national levels, makes sustained centralized training difficult to
implement in federal systems. This is particularly the case in India, where central and state governments
do not have the resources or incentives to train all personnel. In Mexico, the well-funded enforcement
body has collaborated with human resource departments with the aim of incorporating RTI trainings
into agencies (Torres and Esquivel 2011). But in cases where individual agencies are expected to initiate
and fund ongoing training, there are often few resources to do so. Such is the case in South Africa
(Moses 2014: 447-8). In over half of the countries in the sample, RTI training is supplemented by civil
society organizations, or in some cases like the United Kingdom and the United States, by non-

governmental organizations specializing in data protection and information rights. 13 Even with
supplemental training provided by civil society, information officers in most countries without
compulsory training were operating with low levels of technical knowledge that impeded their ability to
disclose information in response to information requests.

Staff incentives

A pervasive failure to comply with disclosure obligations because of a lack of incentives, or the existence
of perverse incentives, affects most of the sample. Even in countries with generally positive incentive
structures governing the disclosure of information (i.e., Mexico, United Kingdom, and the United States),
poor incentives in records management is nearly universal across the sample.

As shown in Table 23, nine countries cases cited a lack of incentives, or the existence of disincentives, as
a major obstacle to a functioning RTI system. There are generally no incentives to comply with RTI rules

in Albania, as sanctions are rarely imposed and informal practices dominate daily operations (Trebicka
and Shella 2014: 24, 28). Responsiveness to requests is not included in personnel evaluations in India,
and there is an ongoing lack of ownership of proactive disclosure because of uncertainty as to whether
the departments of technology or communications should take responsibility (Devasher Surie and Aiyar
2014: 66-67). Public officials in Jordan, Thailand, and Uganda lack clear guidance as to the kinds of
information that can be disclosed and the manner of disclosure (Meknassi 2014: 382, 479). Penalties for
improper disclosure exist in India, Thailand, and the United Kingdom, with a lower threat of sanctions in
the remaining countries. However, it is not clear that there is a complete absence of penalties for
improper disclosure in any of the countries in the sample. In Romania, civil servants do not consider the
RTI law relevant to their interactions with citizens, possibly because there are few monitoring efforts to
reinforce the importance of their disclosure obligations (Ionita and Stefan 2014: 253).

Oversight

RTI systems benefit from effective management during implementation that facilitates adequate
resources and resolution of administrative delays. Although legal frameworks may clearly specify the
enforcement mechanisms for a RTI system, the institutional arrangements for monitoring of
implementation may be set through de facto practices in the public sector. Monitoring tasks include
oversight over nation-wide implementation, and guidance on the design of policies at the national, sub-
national and agency-level, while enforcement responsibilities include decision processes on appeals and
complaints, and enforcement of appropriate sanctions for non-compliance.

Monitoring of institutional capacity

In nearly all countries except for Jordan and Moldova, a public body has been mandated with
monitoring responsibilities, has been created specifically for these tasks, or has assumed monitoring
tasks as an extension of existing responsibilities for public sector modernization. There is a wide range of
public bodies that are responsible for supporting RTI implementation processes within the public sector,
including ombudsmen and human rights commissions, ministries of public administration or justice, and
special departments within the cabinet or prime ministerâs office. Table 23 captures the monitoring
arrangements around implementing rules.

In two-thirds of the sample countries, the presence of implementing rules across ministries is not
consistent (Trebicka and Shella 2014: 15; Meknassi 2014: 388-392; Lipcean and Stefan 2014: 163-64;
Nicro et al. 2014: 505-6; Dokeniya 2014: 289-90). In nearly all cases where implementing agencies are
responsible for developing implementing regulations or rules, including Albania, Jordan, Moldova, South
Africa and Uganda, these rules have been inconsistently developed and/or adopted. The lone exception
to this pattern is the United States.

Table 25 captures the range of RTI monitoring responsibilities that are assumed by public bodies.
Only Mexico performs all these tasks, overlapping between the IFAI (Federal Institute for Access to
Information) and the SFP (Ministry of Public Administration) (Mizrahi and Mendiburu 2014). In Albania,
Jordan, Moldova, Romania, and Uganda, there are no public bodies that perform monitoring tasks, with
the exception of the Albanian Training Institute for Public Administration. In the United Kingdom and
the United States, the Ministries of Justice perform a variety of monitoring tasks, but neither country
assigns public outreach to any one public body (Trapnell 2014; Alexander 2014). Of countries with an
information commission or external appeals body, only Thailand assigns both monitoring and
enforcement to one public body â the Official Information Commission (Nicro et. al 2014). The
remainder of countries â Mexico, India, and the United Kingdom â split monitoring tasks between the
information commission and public sector bodies, while Jordan assigns no monitoring responsibilities at
all.

Table 26 outlines the features of data tracking in the sample countries. In India, Mexico, South Africa,
the United Kingdom, and the United States, data from agencies is used to analyze weaknesses in the
system and to highlight good practices across agencies. In some countries, data is not collected at all, as
in Albania and Moldova, where there is no reporting requirement. Despite a legal obligation in Uganda
to collect and present monitoring data to Parliament, no public body has ever done so (Dokeniya 2014:
296). In Jordan and Thailand, no data on requests and appeals is released publicly (Meknassi 2014; Nicro
2014).

Enforcement of disclosure obligations

While monitoring efforts may be comprised of reviewing compliance, providing training, and issuing
guidance or internal rules on implementation, enforcement has to do with ensuring compliance of RTI
laws. Enforcement includes the hearing of appeals, investigation of complaints, issuance of binding
resolutions, and recommendations for sanctions.

Appeals are formal requests to a higher authority for a reversal of an official decision or to require a
decision to be made. In RTI systems, they can also be filed for other reasons, such as failure to respond
within a time limit or charging unreasonable fees, but this depends on the conditions specified in the RTI
law. If the requester continues to seek a reversal of the original decision, appeals can progress through
several levels of authority until they reach the judiciary. Decisions on appeals are usually binding.

The availability of appeals systems and ways in which requesters can appeal refusals to grant
information vary by country. Most countries have multi-stage appeals systems that start with an internal
appeal at the agency level. If the requester is not satisfied with the response, the next stage is usually an
external appeal at an information commission or an administrative tribunal. These bodies can vary in
their authority to issue binding decisions, but many are able to compel the release of information from
public bodies. When external appeals authorities do not exist, or when lack of access to information
cannot be appealed by law, requesters can file complaints with grievance redress bodies. These bodies
offer mediation services, but cannot compel disclosure through binding adjudication. Table 28 captures
the levels of appeals process within each country in the sample, demonstrating that some countries
have a very limited appeals process before the final appeal in the courts. It must be noted that grievance
redress through the ombudsmen does not result in binding decisions, but rather, channels complaints
through a mediation process in the hope that public bodies will disclose information in lieu of appeals.

Very few countries benefit from public bodies with the power to issue binding decisions or recommend
sanctions for violations. India, Mexico, Thailand and the United Kingdom benefit from independent
information commissioners that can issue binding decisions, while Jordan has a non-independent
council that may not have the authority in practice to issue compulsory decisions (Devasher Surie and
Aiyar 2014; Mizrahi and Mendiburu 2014, Nicro et al. 2014; Trapnell 2014; Meknassi 2014). These
bodies are tasked with ensuring compliance with RTI law, through either binding adjudication or
compulsory decisions, but they may not be authorized to apply sanctions. In fact, the only country with
an independent commission that can impose sanctions is India. The Mexican IFAI can recommend
sanctions to the Ministry of Public Administration, and does so sparingly (Mizrahi and Mendiburu 2014).
In the United Kingdom, the decisions are registered with courts and effectively become court decisions
after the time for appeal has passed. In some countries, there is also the potential for civil service
oversight committees to enforce administrative sanctions on public officials who violate disclosure
obligations that have been incorporated into employment rules, but among the sample this is a rare
occurrence, particularly when the law is not clear on what constitutes a violation of this sort.

The remainder of countries relies on the court system to obligate disclosure, set precedents, and impose
sanctions when laws are violated. All countries in the sample allow appeals to be heard in the court
system, although this is often a last resort, given the time, expense, and expertise required to move
cases through courts. However, courts have been effective in establishing case precedents that
influence good practice. In Romania, high-profile strategic litigation is credited for the high response
rate by government agencies (Ionita and Stefan 2014: 262). United States case law has expanded and
defined the scope of RTI in the absence of any other appeals authority (Alexander 2014). As noted
above, legal expertise is often a prerequisite for pursuing disclosure through the courts.

Table 28 provides an overview of the various enforcement methods that are utilized across the sample
of countries. An effective appeals process is the most prevalent form of enforcement in the sample of
countries. The lack of an external appeals agency with the power to perform binding adjudication,
combined with a lack of judicial capacity in Albania, Moldova, and Uganda, discourages requesters from
pursuing appeals (Trebicka and Shella 2014: 24; Lipcean and Stefan 2014: 165; Dokeniya 2014: 297). The
High Court in Jordan has so far refused to hear most RTI cases on procedural grounds, and has ruled
against the few cases that have been heard (Meknassi 2014: 382).

In fact, there are no enforcement methods employed in practice in Albania, Jordan, Moldova, or
Uganda, with the possible exception of Jordanâs Information Council, which may have the authority to
perform binding adjudication on appeals. South Africa, Romania, and Thailand benefit from some
enforcement methods operating in practice, with Thailand the only one with an external appeals
agency. India, Mexico, and UK employ all five methods of enforcement, but this is not surprising, given
their relatively well-resourced enforcement bodies with the authority to fulfill their mandates.

Outside of the appeals process, enforcement bodies may also resort to less punitive measures to ensure
compliance, such as threat of inspection, closed-door meetings, notice of inquiry, or calling senior
officials as witnesses (labelled as Persuasion/Monitoring/Investigation in Table 28). In some cases,
simply the notice that a complaint has been filed prompts reparative action on the part of agencies, such
as in Mexico (Mendiburi and Mizrahi 2014). Public release of poor performance data is employed by
half of the countries in the case studies, but it is the weakest method of enforcement, dependent on
civil society or other government actors to initiate discussion and/or change.

                                                               47
Credibility of sanctioning threat depends on a variety of factors, including nature of appeal, extent of
media coverage, and inclination of specific courts to rule against the government. Financial penalties
and attorney fees are often imposed through court decisions when cases are on appeal in Romania and
the United States (Ionita and Stefan 2014: 255; Alexander 2014: 549). In India and Peru, the threat of
sanctions is credible but not consistently applied (Devasher Surie and Aiyar 2014: 71; Pereira Chumbe
2014: 198).

Discussion

Strategic leadership and incentives

As noted above, policy prioritization is determined to a large extent by the level of support expressed by
political actors. Administrative capacity is in turn influenced by levels of political support, facilitating
prioritization of RTI at lower levels of government. This is operationalized though strategic leadership in
public bodies, properly aligned incentive structures, and accountable relationships among oversight
bodies, agency head, managers, and information officers

In terms of an RTI system, principal-agent relationships between managers and staff can be
strengthened through formalized practices and training, in addition to performance appraisal systems
that include disclosure obligations. Detrimental behavior patterns can be overcome through changes in
the incentive structures rewarding, permitting, or punishing that behavior. 14 But incentive structures are
complex and influenced by any number of cultural norms or institutional practices. In particular,
obstructive informal practices, inadequate staffing levels, and low staff capacity might need to be
addressed before incentives can be properly aligned.

Figure 3: Lines of accountability and responsibility that shape incentives




Incentive structures that constrain and encourage behavior are shaped by lines of accountability within
agencies and across the RTI system, as shown in Figure 3. Relationships between monitoring entities and
individual agencies establish channels of communication among information officers, managers, and
monitoring bodies, as shown on the left side of the diagram. This includes guidance and training
provided by monitoring bodies, and the reporting of requests and appeals data by individual agencies.
But these relationships lack the threat of consequences unless disclosure obligations are included in

14
  Fox et al. (2011) refer to issues of values on the one hand, and interests and power on the other. This paper
takes the view that addressing interests and power within administrative contexts can contribute to changes in the
attitudes of public officials.

                                                               49
monitoring responsibilities. Because accountability relationships in public sector operations rarely move
diagonally from information officers to enforcement bodies, as shown on the right hand side of the
diagram, incentives must be shaped through the horizontal accountability relationships between agency
heads and information officers, and between agency heads and enforcement bodies. 15 Although chief
information officers may be responsible for the operational activities associated with RTI, agency heads
are the locus of accountability in RTI implementation, making leadership at all levels a key component in
shaping attitudes and behavior, and prioritizing RTI policy.

Three country cases (Mexico, United Kingdom, and United States) are robust RTI systems that made no
mention of staff incentives as contributing to effective information disclosure. 16 It is likely that there is a
significant and positive relationship between a professionalized civil service and properly aligned staff
incentives that affect RTI implementation. This implies that appropriate incentives employed in the
public sector may have a significant effect on RTI effectiveness at the agency level. These incentives
include appropriate time for additional duties, functioning personnel evaluations with accurate
measurement, and a lack of formal or informal penalties for disclosing information, e.g., penalties for
improper disclosure. Training specific to RTI obligations, including records management, also contributes
to encouraging appropriate behavior. The fact that no country mentioned the need for special
incentives such as cash bonuses or administrative honors suggests that properly aligned incentives
matter more for motivating behavior than special rewards.


Barriers to access

Demand for information is a critical factor in the effectiveness of RTI systems, as underutilized systems
tended to be underdeveloped and exhibited poor performance. The case studies highlighted both
knowledge and accessibility as constraints on access to information. These two drivers co-exist in a
virtuous circle of demand, shown in Figure 4. The accessibility of RTI systems is significantly influenced
by the extent of public knowledge about information rights and RTI processes. In return, knowledge of
RTI processes is enhanced through repeated encounters with agencies over information disclosure.

   Fox et al. (2011) note that the internal audit units embedded within Mexican public bodies are responsible to the
supreme audit institution, establishing a diagonal relationship between audit officers and audit oversight body.
This may be an option to insert additional means of accountability within RTI systems.

   Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States are also the only members of the OECD in the sample of
twelve countries.

An understanding of rights, as well as having accessibility to processes, matter for marginalized groups in
very practical ways. Language differences, literacy levels, familiarity with bureaucratic procedures, and
internet access are all major factors that prevent large numbers of people from accessing information
request processes. There are good practice examples in the country cases where consideration of
specific user groups was addressed at the agency or program level, particularly at sub-national and
municipal levels, so that information, forms, assistance, and mediation processes are made accessible to
marginalized communities.

Public awareness of RTI influences not only the ability of requesters to access information, but also their
understanding of the information rights accorded to citizens. Knowledge of what is available to be
requested, and how information can assist with certain goals (which motivates request making), is also
part of this equation. The success of information requests is based upon the technical knowledge
needed to formulate requests, as well as the broader knowledge of the kinds of information that can,
and should, be requested. As a result, there is concern that requesters comprise a potentially narrow
social base of specialist information requesters centered in urban areas (Fox and Haight 2011: 156).
Request data collected by governments indicated that ratio of requests to population was less than 1%
across a sample of eight countries (Worker 2014). One implication is that the group of requesters that
make up the bulk of requests may constitute an extremely small proportion of the population.
Questions of representativeness and inclusion abound, potentially compromising the universality of
access to information initiatives.

Information requests are the primary channels for individuals to communicate their specific demands
for information to government bodies. As noted above, the is a learning curve associated with obtaining
satisfactory responses to information requests, as requesters must know how and what to request from
government bodies. In terms of providing access to information, information intermediaries such as civil
society organizations and media play a critical role in their analysis and dissemination of information,
but they also serve as filters through their own sets of lenses.

Lack of access based on gender, race, and class are also fundamental issues compromising the
inclusiveness of RTI systems, though they were only weakly addressed in the country cases. In a
separate study from Liberia on gender and right to information, perceptions of mixed-gender groups
confirmed that women access information much less often than men, a finding that was also confirmed
through observations of RTI units within government agencies. Aggregate data from interviews
demonstrated that the barriers preventing women from exercising their right to information included
illiteracy, fear of asking, and not knowing how to ask or where to go to find or request information.
Responsibilities to household and childcare, as well as mobility and distance to government agencies,
were also cited as significant barriers (Carter Center 2014: 25-28). These findings suggest that further
study of the relationship between RTI systems and minority groups is essential to making the right to
information equally, and fairly, accessible to the general population.

Innovative approaches to making information more accessible to marginalized communities combine
functions such as assistance to requesters, communication over content of the request, negotiation of
what is an acceptable and meaningful response, and complaints processes. They are located
strategically near populations of potential information requesters. The Oportunidades program in
Mexico has a specific citizen attention window through which most of the information requests and
complaints are managed (Mizrahi and Mendiburu 2014: 121; Fox and Haight 2011: 157). It is important
to note that both requests and complaints are addressed through this unit. Citizens are engaging and
negotiating with government over the kinds of information that they are seeking. In Thailand, there are

                                                    51
one-stop service centers with the mandate to provide information to citizens, but there is little
negotiation over the kind of information that can be released. In fact, some agencies do not even
register information requests, as the information requested does not fall within the very specific
parameters laid out in the RTI law (Nicro et al. 2014: 506-510).

Because of its focus on citizen uptake, proactive disclosure of information, data, and documents should
be based on citizen interest. However, very few countries have procedures to identify information for
proactive disclosure beyond a standard list of categories of information to be disclosed. In order to
identify information that is most relevant to the demands of the public, agencies should at the minimum
be tracking downloads or hard copy requests for proactively disclosed information. There is also a need
for consultations with citizens and civil society groups about the content of information that should be
released (Darbishire 2010: 27). Information that is not relevant to users or does not meet the needs of
information consumers meets only a pro forma adherence to disclosure obligations. Proactive release of
information should not become a passive form of resistance to disclosure.

The accessibility of proactively disclosed information is becoming more of a concern as internet
technology is used to disseminate documents, even in areas where internet penetration rates are quite
low, shown in Table 29. Online disclosure is the most common form of proactive disclosure of
information across all cases and agencies, but disorganized and poorly constructed websites make

                                                                             52
information extremely difficult to find. As a means of countering this challenge, public officials make
registers of information available online in one document, such as in South Africa (Moses 2014).
Requesters then contact agencies directly for access to the information, but this creates another layer of
work for staff, reducing the efficiency that online proactive disclosure is supposed to offer. Registers of
information are not just for use in proactive disclosure of information but also used to facilitate access
to records under RTI law using RTI request procedures. When registers of information are not updated,
even when mandated by law, the functions of both records management and proactive disclosure can
suffer.

In contexts where internet penetration is low, shown in Table 29, alternative methods of dissemination
are sometimes employed to facilitate access to proactively disclosed information. Print media and print
publications are common methods to disseminate information, and all agencies cited in the cases used
this method of disclosure. But low literacy levels may also require radio or television transmission, local
bulletin boards, along with townhall or community gatherings. As stated above, agencies in Thailand
have opened One-Stop-Service centers of information, staffed by knowledgeable employees who are
tasked with assisting information requesters with their searches. Information and documentation are
available for inspection as specified by various provisions in the law (Nicro et al. 2014: 506-510).


Financial and material resources

Although the absence of a specific budget line item for RTI is often considered the primary obstacle to
effective RTI implementation, particularly in low income contexts, the issue of resources is much more
diffuse. RTI functions tend not to be housed in separate units dedicated to RTI except in agencies that
receive large volumes of requests, such as ministries of social welfare or pensions, or agencies that are
faced with complicated classification and exception schemes, such as the ministry of defense. Thus, RTI
functions are embedded in administrative functions that face common resource failures. In the sample
countries, insufficient material resources manifested in broken, missing or outdated equipment that

                                                         53
impacted the extent to which officials could identify and locate information, and as noted above,
inadequate financial resources led to low levels of staffing. Much of the breakdown in supply of
resources is not the failure of individuals or departments and is not related to RTI. Perhaps because of
this, or in ignorance of it, most countries expect agencies to cover RTI costs within their existing financial
envelope. An exception is the funding that is normally provided to centralized enforcement bodies, such
as information commissioners. A response to the issue of lack of resources for RTI should be rooted in a
strategy that assigns greater priority for RTI funding within the existing budget, and in this way, is much
more likely to be sustainable in the long term. This approach calls for the inclusion of RTI in regular,
strategic decision-making and an institutional incentive system to encourage public bodies to do so.


Institutionalization of RTI practices

No RTI system will function adequately without clear, formalized procedures that remove opportunities
for abuse of discretion, set appropriate incentives for civil servants and managers to support its
implementation, and encourage leadership across levels of government that signals commitment to the
regular practice of information disclosure. These formalized practices are particularly important for
records management, request processing, and proactive disclosure, as these areas form the backbone of
an RTI system.

Records management is the unseen, underappreciated foundation of an RTI system. It comprises the
control of processes by which digital and paper information about organizational activities is created,
organized, stored, and accessed by employees (Shepherd 2010, Colquhoun 2010). It includes the use of
information and communication digital technology for the purposes of storage, retrieval, and
dissemination of information. In many circumstances, ranging from high to low-income countries, the
issue of records management is overlooked, and as a result, agencies rely upon informal methods of
information creation, organization, storage and retrieval. Informality in record-keeping means that that
standards cannot be maintained. In fact, poor records management practices produce poor records. This
practice results not only in delays in responding to information requests, but also in lower-quality and
even unreliable information being distributed about government activities (Shepherd 2011; Luyombya
2011). It also prevents effective collection of data on government functioning, posing a significant
obstacle to the success of proactive disclosure of information and open data initiatives. Issues with
records management significantly influence the potential success of a RTI system, as well as
policymaking and decision-making within the public sector. In the context of an absence of or ineffective
records management, it is extremely difficult to determine whether weak RTI performance data
indicates an inability to find records or an unwillingness to disclose information.

Responding to an information request is rarely straightforward, and there are several stages where
bottlenecks can occur: finding and compiling responsive information, consulting with third parties,
assessing and applying exceptions (i.e. redacting, e.g. private information), and considering appeals
(Shepherd 2010, Colquhoun 2010). One of the most oft-cited practices for lowering the administrative
burden and financial costs of request processing is proactive disclosure. Categories of relevant
information include administrative data, expenditures and accounts, policy reports, internal procedures
and functions, human resources management (salaries and positions), procurement/contracts,
declarations of conflicts of interest, and income and assets of public officials. While open data is a part
of the proactive disclosure function, it is focused on releasing datasets about government operations
and data that the government collects and uses to make policy decisions. The assessment of proactive
disclosure is a difficult task, as there are no agreed standards as to the amount, regularity, or content of

                                                     54
information that should be disclosed, aside from general recommendations about regular postings, and
serious concerns over the relevance and comprehensibility of information to citizens. 17

Specialized ICT tools are intended to streamline the process of online disclosure in order to keep costs
down. But they are often a major investment, and without appropriate training and skilled IT staff to
deal with interoperability difficulties among information databases, these initiatives often fail. The
sustainability of these tools are also at the mercy of staffing levels, unless steps are taken to ensure that
institutional knowledge will remain with the organization rather than the individual. Both Peru and
Mexico have launched centralized online portals for agencies to upload proactively disclosed
information, but questions of sustainability and stakeholder support persist. Based on country
experiences, potential good practices for proactive disclosure include:

       â¢   tracking of high volume requests and releasing popular information (Thailand)
       â¢   a ârule of three,â whereby information is released if an agency anticipates that it will be
           requested three times (United States)
       â¢   an online repository of requests and responses (Mexico)

Each practice requires effective data tracking and RTI usage statistics gathering processes and in the
case of Mexico, a sustainable level of IT expertise.

As with any organization, hiring strategies for an agency-level RTI system must anticipate training needs
and turnover. External demand for information, through both information requests and proactive
disclosure, will determine the number of staff necessary to meet the needs of the system. Many
agencies in the sample of cases do not devote sufficient staff time to RTI tasks, citing a lack of
commitment from management or a lack of human resources. There is no one model that will suit all
agency contexts and demands. In all cases, however, a designated information officer should exist in at
least each agency, perhaps with additional officers in larger administrative units within agencies.
Moreover, compulsory training should be accompanied by coordinated efforts to incorporate RTI
training into agency training programs, or less commonly, through centralized training efforts by
national schools of public administration or enforcement bodies.

Updated, formal practices contribute to the functioning of many other drivers within the domains of RTI
implementation. They are a necessary, but not sufficient, feature of RTI implementation at the agency
level. Engagement with civil society over the development of formal practices for request processing
and proactive disclosure is an often overlooked value to government. Collaboration among agencies,
oversight bodies, civil society organizations, and media on agency-level policy-making and rule-making
processes would provide opportunities to shape practices for internal efficiency and external relevance
to users.


Monitoring responsibilities and institutional arrangements
For effective and consistent implementation of RTI across ministries and agencies, it is important that at
least one national-level authority is made responsible for supporting the implementation process, often
by articulating a framework for RTI implementation. This body is often referred to as a ânodal


17
     There are suggested recommendations for proactive transparency standards in Darbishire (2010).

                                                         55
authority,â and its role is to assist agencies in setting up appropriate organizational structures and
administrative procedures that facilitate compliance with the law.

When nodal bodies are not resourced appropriately, with sufficient authority and capacity, public bodies
may fail to develop implementing rules, such as with Thailand and Uganda (Nicro et al. 2014: 505-6;
Dokeniya 2014: 289-90). Without guidance and logistical supervision, there is significant likelihood that
implementing rules and regulations will not be developed or will be radically inconsistent, particularly
when responsibility for developing these rules is left to individual agencies. Because ombudsmen sit
outside of the government, they should only be charged with official responsibility for implementation
oversight when they have sufficient authority, resources, and capacity to perform the task. In the cases
of Peru and South Africa, the ombudsmen are highly organized and resourced, with considerable
expertise, and maintain mutually respectful relations with government entities and other RTI monitoring
bodies (Pereira Chumbe 2014: 196-204; Moses 2014: 433-436).

In all of the cases in the sample, and shown in Table 26, data reporting is not considered a priority unless
a nodal agency, or enforcement body, requires the submission of an annual report (Worker 2014). It is
not surprising that RTI data is not reported when agencies claim to not be aware of their own reporting
obligations under the RTI law. Reporting data involves the tracking of responsiveness to requests and
appeals processing. It is an ongoing process of collecting information (or data) on how well an RTI
system is on track to meet its objectives, and it is extremely important for both real-time and end-of-
year evaluations that feed into budgets, resource allocation, and investments in technology for
improved processes. However, a major challenge to incorporating RTI indicators and targets into
existing administrative systems is the weakness of existing performance monitoring at the agency level.
Capacity building may be required to design and implement agency-wide performance monitoring
systems that can accurately and efficiently collect data. Electronic submission of requests allows for real-
time tracking, although there are issues with the exclusion of marginalized groups without access to, or
understanding of, the internet. In the absence of resources (or mandate) to recommend policy changes,
issue good practice models, and provide more training, it is likely that data will not be collected regularly
or reliably. In resource-stretched circumstances, data is released to the public in the hope that civil
society organizations will use the data to highlight gaps and areas of weakness.

The credibility of RTI data reports from agencies is also a constant struggle for performance monitoring
purposes. Even in strong RTI systems such as Mexico, studies have shown that figures of effectiveness
are overestimated (Fox et al. 2011). Several independent studies on compliance with RTI obligations
(some conducted by in-country civil society organizations) have demonstrated that agencies fail to meet
deadlines, keep requesters informed of status requests, and provide high quality responses (Dokeniya
2013; Worthy 2011; Hazell 2010; Open Society Justice Initiative 2006; RaaG 2009; Global Integrity
Report 2004-2011; South African Human Rights Commission Golden Key Awards 2008-present). Findings
from this study revealed that compliance testing has become more common across the sample, with the
expanded role of CSOs in monitoring of implementation, and the development of more sophisticated
monitoring mechanisms by enforcement agencies.


Enforcement mechanisms

Countries vary in the complexity of the appeals process, and assessment of effectiveness in appeals
depends very much on the practices and of individual bodies and the nature of information requests.
Delays in appeals at the judicial level characterized most of the countries in the sample. Combined with
a lack of faith in judicial capacity or rule of law, delays contributed to a reluctance to pursue appeals
through the courts.

                                                                    57
The existence of an information commissioner or comparable enforcement body in an RTI system allows
for a second level of appeal outside the public body or the courts, and which does not require legal
representation. In addition, information commissioners, if well-resourced and mandated with
appropriate authority, can employ alternative methods of enforcement besides appeals and sanctions.
As noted above, enforcement bodies can conduct closed-door meetings, issue notices of inquiry with
threat of inspection, publish compulsory guidelines or analyses of specific RTI challenges, or call senior
officials as witnesses in investigations. The mission of ombudsmen often does not extend to this type of
intervention, and existing nodal bodies may not have the capacity or authority to conduct these kinds of
activities.

It is clear that credible threat of sanctions is not prevalent, suggesting that the possibility of penalties is
not necessarily the primary means of enforcement in RTI systems. Aside from the need for an effective
appeals process, which is a necessary but not sufficient means of enforcement in RTI systems, no clear
pattern emerged from this analysis about what works best for enforcement. It may well be that a
combination of methods works most effectively to enforce disclosure obligations, particularly when
capitalizing on the stronger institutions and norms of individual countries.


Transformative factors: Collaboration and Technology

During the qualitative analysis of the case studies, it became apparent that some features of RTI systems
extended across the four domains of RTI implementation, yet were not always included in the narratives
of success and failure. They fall into no single domain exclusively, but instead, influence the path of each
driver in different ways. These transformative factors can enhance aspects of the drivers significantly by
increasing their efficiency, efficacy, and inclusiveness, thus magnifying their impact. Below is brief
discussion of the factors identified in the analysis. Findings from the cases are highlighted wherever
relevant.


State-society collaboration

Advocacy efforts refer to contestation over the institutionalization of rights, which by their nature are
subject to challenge and transformation by stakeholders. Human rights, in fact, stand in opposition to
the arbitrary use of power and privilege (Stammers 2009: 105). Civil debate over the shape of legal
instruments or the path of implementation allows for the balance of interests from both government
and society, and is a natural part of democratic governance (Cohen and Arato 1994). However, once
rights become embedded in structures of administrative power, there is also space for collaboration
over the direction of policies and implementing rules (Booth 2012).

State âsociety collaboration includes any kind of engagement between civil society and the government
that is not considered adversarial. This includes working groups, stakeholder consultations, and
participation in committees and councils. It ranges from joint efforts to produce outcomes, which may
include civil servant training and promotional activities for the public, to solicitation of civil society
feedback, such as on the relevance of proactively disclosed information. Formalized means of
collaboration are important for sustainability purposes, but governments must be able to acknowledge
the value-added of joint efforts in RTI systems for institutionalization of these practices to occur.

Figure 6 presents information on the number of civil society organizations operating on transparency
issues within each country in the sample. 18 Civil society organizations (CSOs) and media play a major role
in all aspects of implementation in the sample countries, even if their absolute numbers are small. These
activities range from training to compliance monitoring and public outreach, with CSOs more
substantially represented in these activities. Nearly half of the cases cited civil society involvement in
training of public officials (e.g., India, Moldova, Peru, Romania, South Africa, United Kingdom, and
United States), suggesting that civil society groups are in close collaboration with government in the
planning of training, or assisting government-sponsored RTI training efforts (Devasher Surie and Aiyar
2014; Mizrahi and Mendiburu 2014; Pereira Chumbe 2014; Moses 2014; Trapnell 2014; Alexander
2014). In India and Mexico, civil society organizations are regularly invited to provide input into policies
and legal amendments (Devasher Surie and Aiyar 2014; Mizrahi and Mendiburu 2014). Civil society
organizations in Jordan have proposed that non-governmental organizations be given seats on the
information council (Meknassi 2014: 387).

There were also instances in which the civic space did not yet allow for meaningful collaboration
between public officials and civil society. In Albania, there are few opportunities for civil society groups
or citizens to engage with the highly-centralized decision-making process (Trebicka and Shella 2014: 13).
The civil society sector in Moldova lacks institutional capacity and, often, basic equipment, and the
polarization of the media has called its independence called into question (Lipcean and Stefan 2014:
168). Civil society organizations in Uganda are often not included in decision-making processes
(Dokeniya 2014: 304-5). The small community of civil society organizations and journalists working on
RTI in Jordan operates in a politically conservative environment with few opportunities for substantive
engagement (Meknassi 2014: 395). Collaborative efforts between civil society and government are
predicated upon a shared concern for establishing sustainable and meaningful aspects of open
government, from training to public awareness, accessibility, and responsiveness.

As shown in Figure 7, civil society organizations and the media focus on a variety of areas regarding
transparency, and they play important participatory roles in RTI implementation. The findings from this
study indicate that engagement by civil society on issues related to RTI implementation matter for RTI
effectiveness, although no particular form of engagement emerged as more or less important to this
outcome. However, the effects of participation and collaboration are likely complex and non-linear. A
recent study on participation and development outcomes showed that a budget participation sub-index
constructed from items on the Open Budget Index did not predict development outcomes or
expenditure levels. A possible explanation suggested by the authors is that the indicators used in the
sub-index on participation reflected only possible engagement opportunities, not actual engagement
(Fukuda-Parr et al. 2011). These findings confirm that questions about quality and extent of civil society
engagement remain unanswered, even though there is general agreement that civil society participation
is an essential element in policy implementation. 19 At a minimum, public bodies and governments can
be engaging in consultative processes with users to identify information that is in high public demand
and relevant for usersâ needs, which will ultimately enhance the overall functioning of the RTI system.

Technology

Technology is a tool that augments success, but it does not solve problems without human and material
resources to support it. It is often touted as a relatively straightforward solution to issues of efficiency.
In terms of transparency, for example, the role of technology in government can serve as a means for
collection, organization, and release of open data in machine readable formats for others to capitalize
upon. In addition, technology can be employed to ensure that business activities and citizen-
government interaction is more efficient and cost-effective through e-government initiatives. But the
success of technology is based on a clear understanding of the needs and interests of users, both
19
  Recent studies on e-participation reveal that the outcomes of citizen engagement, where individuals feel that
their actions ultimately influenced government decision-making, are correlated with higher perceptions of
government responsiveness and transparency (Kim and Lee 2012).

                                                             60
internal and external to government, and the capacity of those users to employ technology sustainably
(Fung et al. 2010). Online submissions of requests allow government to track the status requests and
collect data automatically, obviating the need for public officials to log requests. Web portals are the
main mechanism for dissemination of proactively disclosed information, providing access to documents
to a wide audience.

While it is true that technological approaches to transparency can quickly facilitate access and openness,
significant human and technical capital is the bedrock upon which technology rests. With few
exceptions, technology for transparency and accountability purposes is rarely adopted across-the-board
to universal acclaim. It is more likely that successful technological approaches are tailored to the needs
of various user communities (Fung et. al 2010). Parents of school-age children, for example, may be very
interested in school fees, curricula, and teaching quality. Information on medical treatments and
hospital quality may be valuable to patients, doctors, and otherwise healthy individuals. Interventions
that are successful on this kind of large-scale tend to organize and display information that is
immediately relevant to usersâ lives, and made available in easily accessible formats. Other
technological interventions may complement mainstream efforts at transparency by releasing
specialized information that is relevant for intermediaries, such as journalists or political campaigns,
who then make the information accessible to a wider audience. Ultimately, the most successful use of
technology for transparency purposes may lie with interventions that are dedicated to advancing the
agendas of civil society organizations (Fung et al. 2010). Examples of this type include budget tracking
tools, crowd-sourcing of information via mobile phones, and online platforms for submission of
complaints and requests.


Intra-governmental collaboration

Collaboration between records management authorities, technology departments, and nodal authorities
or monitoring bodies is an important means of embedding RTI successfully into administrative
operations, with the aim of making information disclosure a business-as-usual process. In fact, there was
scant information in the case studies on collaboration between technology officers and RTI officials, and
in some cases, responsibility for proactive disclosure practices was caught in disputes between
individual departments and the heads of public bodies, with technology staff not even part of the
discussion (Devasher Surie and Aiyar 2014: 75). Moreover, communities of practice or networks of
practitioners across public bodies were rare except for the United States (Alexander 2014).
Collaboration between different technical units can facilitate both dialogue and practical decision-
making over RTI responsibilities, while communities of practice among RTI officials encourages sharing
of good practices and knowledge about RTI responsibilities.

Records management authorities provide much-needed guidance to agencies on the proper destruction
of records, electronic records management, archiving procedures, use of resources, and performance
monitoring. Table 31 shows the records management oversight authority and RTI collaboration within
the sample of cases. It is only in Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States that records
management authorities collaborate with RTI oversight bodies to harmonize record keeping policies
across the public sector (Mizrahi and Mendiburu 2014; Alexander 2014). In these countries, there are
ongoing efforts to standardize record-keeping practices for the benefit of RTI.

Assessing the drivers of effectiveness
Assessment of the drivers of effectiveness will be conducted through a mixed-methods approach.
Research teams comprised of international experts, government officials, and/or civil society
organizations will be given specific scoring criteria and requirements for supporting documentation. In
this way, data collected will be reliable and countries will be consistently scored on the drivers of
implementation supporting RTI systems.

The levels of analysis for each domain can be assessed at either the national, sub-national level, or
sectoral level, except for institutional capacity, which will apply at the level of individual agencies.
Aggregation of individual agency-level data is possible, but it is not likely that any sample of agencies will
be representative of the country as a whole. Generalization must be considered carefully.

Indicators will be developed and revised through stakeholder consultations.

Conclusions
The conceptual mapping of domains of RTI implementation and their related drivers of effectiveness
were built up from a rigorous, iterative coding process that incorporated checks on reliability for the
purposes of generalization of higher-order elements. The mapping and related drivers are meant to
serve as both a guide to the development of implementation strategies, as well as a heuristic for
understanding the dynamism and interdependence of implementation components. There is no one
strategy or approach to RTI implementation that works best in all contexts, as implementation of reform
efforts across the entire public sector will be characterized by variation. Data will require interpretation
of context even with pre-existing assessment frameworks or heuristics. In addition, the sequencing of
reforms will depend on the contextual factors in specific circumstances, particularly with institutional
capacity, as they address interdependent operational functions within individual agencies or
departments.

Of all domains in RTI implementation, institutional capacity is primary, since without the mechanisms for
disclosure, information will not be released effectively. Without functioning operations, demand falls,
and there is little need for oversight. However, institutional capacity will not function effectively or
sustainably without enabling conditions, demand for information, and oversight. The best approach is to
institutionalize RTI within the public sector so that disclosure becomes a business-as-usual practice.
When political support wanes or oversight capacity deteriorates, the impetus to continue disclosing
information will remain, even if weakened. Demand can also serve a driving force for reform in these
circumstances, in addition to helping to ensure sustainability and collaboration.

The findings from the study suggest that international pressure for more effective RTI implementation
only goes so far. The development of RTI laws with the encouragement, assistance, or insistence of the
international community was a prominent theme throughout the case studies, particularly for EU
countries during their accession process. But implementation is a less straightforward task, with many
interlocking, moving parts, and international support comes in ad hoc fashion as the process unfolds. A
strong implication from these findings is that a national coordinating strategy may be valuable for
implementation. This kind of strategy document should take the interdependence of the drivers of
effectiveness into account when drafting policies and rules for practice, and can serve as a guiding
document when deciding on foreign funding priorities.


Areas for further research

Coordination of RTI and records management
Records management is a fundamental contribution to effective RTI systems. It is the underlying
structure that facilitates many aspects of RTI functions at the agency level: information requests,
proactive disclosure, internal appeals, and performance monitoring. Records management encompasses
the recording, storage, retrieval and archiving of information, and with the introduction of electronic
records and e-governance functions within administrative processes, collaboration between RTI
monitoring bodies and Records management authorities is just as important to the effectiveness of
agency-level RTI systems.

    â¢   Records management is the cornerstone of RTI implementation; however, little is understood
        yet about what contributes to an (in)effective records and information management system
        within agencies and how current practices impact upon RTI system implementation in more

                                                    65
        than general ways. A series of exploratory case studies similar to those conducted in phase on
        of this project would support greater understanding of the factors lead to effective records and
        information management and to the development of rapid diagnostic tools.
    â¢   The interface between records management, E-governance, technology, and RTI systems is
        becoming a more prominent issue to contend with, particularly on a very practical level of daily
        operations. Solutions are likely to be found in administrative practices and through functional
        collaboration among oversight bodies.

Collaboration with stakeholders
CSOs offer vital contributions to the implementation of RTI systems as both users of information and as
collaborative partners. In cases where monitoring and oversight arrangements are weak, CSOs provide
supplementary projects on training of officials, compliance monitoring, and public education, including
the provision of assistance to citizens with filing and use of information requests. In cases of strong RTI
systems, CSOs are key partners in dialogues with monitoring bodies over enhancements in proactive
disclosure and information request processing. Collaborating with CSOs demonstrates a commitment to
transparency for the benefit of both government and society.

Public outreach for citizens and training events for public officials can be held jointly with civil society
organizations to reach as large an audience as possible. For citizens, public awareness is an important
support to the effective exercise of their right to information. It is not a simple task for the ordinary
citizen that is unaccustomed to bureaucratic practices. Information needs, both complex and basic, must
be translated into administrative demands that are acceptable through formalized request procedures
and easily answerable by distracted and overwhelmed public officials.

Accessibility
The accessibility of RTI processes and procedures is of paramount importance to the demand for
information, and the extent of inclusiveness of RTI systems. Very little information has been
systematically collected on the reach of RTI systems with regard to marginalized communities. It is
questionable whether RTI systems can effect meaningful without ensuring that opportunities for
participation extend to all citizens, regardless of gender, race, class, or location.

Global scope
As this report is based on a limited sample of countries, an obvious next step would be to conduct a
global survey of countries to assess effectiveness across countries, recognizing that such assessment can
only be indicative and not explanatory, nor necessarily sensitive to contextual factors. These kinds of
surveys can be conducted as collaborative efforts with in-country oversight bodies and civil society
organizations, with a view to strengthening country systems rather than comparing countries outright.

     complied with the basic provisions of the law, including
     appointing PIOs and appellate authorities and proactively
     disclosing information.
     While the law does not speciï¬cally provide for the designation
     of a nodal implementing agency, institutional arrangements
     have been made with speciï¬c departments to lead
     implementation at the central and state government levels. At
     the central level, the DOPT in the Ministry of Personnel, Public    Monitoring -
                                                                                                 Implementing rules,   Monitoring

     the RTI Act. Notably, the DOPT was closely involved in the
     formulation and drafting of the RTI Act; it even presented the
     draft bill in Parliament.
     There seems to be a wide variation in the seniority levels of
     PIOs within the central government and across states. In many

     The Court system proved to have major limitations for the

     The LSAI does not explicitly promote proactive disclosure and
     it limits the access to information to the existence of a legiti-
     mate interest and reason presented by the requester for

     requesters for information to demonstrate what their interest
     is in accessing the requested information.
     The ICO has no mandate to request information from other
     public agencies. He has the mandate of ï¬ling the received

     The Ofï¬cial CommuniquÃ©s of successive Prime Ministers

     Despite constitutional protections of freedom of information,
     there remain several laws that hinder free expression and
     access to information. These include the Jordan Press Associa-

     Archives Law and the Law on the Protection of State Secrets
     and Documents (LPSSD), will limit signiï¬ cantly the information
     that may be accessed.

     the Federal Institute for Access to Information (IFAI) in early

     Agencies might often reply to information requests by issuing
     information that is difï¬cultâif not impossibleâto interpret as
                                                                                                                    Resistance,

     Or, they might respond with pages and pages of legalistic
     argumentation that is virtually impossible to decipher.
     Yet the majority of requests are concentrated, both regionally
     and professionally. Most users (more than 50 percent) are
49                                                                      Requester Profile      Requester profile    Requester profile

     To comply with these provisions and make the formats for
     posting information uniform, the IFAI designed a central Web
     portal called Portal de Transparencia or POT (Transparency
     Portal). Each government agency is required to set a Web link      Technology,                                 Proactive
     to the POT on their Web sites. Although some government            Proactive -                                 dissemination,

     argue that POT is not always user friendly, it has signiï¬cantly
     helped in the veriï¬cation of compliance with proactive
     disclosure provisions.
     Aside from personnel, federal agenciesâ budgets are only
     minimally affected by complying with the law. âFor most
     agencies, implementing an ATI law is possible by diverting
     existing assets, and as such, is a matter of people, not
     equipmentâ (HernÃ¡ndez-ValdÃ©z 2009: 18). Moreover, the
     study also reveals that relatively few additional personnel are
51   required to respond to information requests. According to          Budget, PIOs           PIOs                 PIOs, Budget
     Alfonso HernÃ¡ndez ValdÃ©z report, in 2007, in small agencies it
     took only one full-time staff member to respond to all
     information requests received, on average; in medium- sized
     agencies, the number rose to 2.5 full-time personnel; and in
     large agencies the number was 25 (it must be noted that these
     agencies employ thousands of employees).
     While the IFAIâs decisions are binding, it does not have
     sanctioning powers, and thus, it has limited enforcement
     capacity. In the event a federal agency does not comply with a
52   resolution by the IFAI, the most the IFAI can do is to inform      Sanctions              Sanctions            Sanctions

     A new law on state secrets adopted in November 2008
     (Access-Info 2008b; 2009a) retained a number of restrictive
     provisions from the previous law (Banisar 2008). The new law
     sought to extend the defi nition of a state secret, as well as of
     types of information that may be protected, lacked any
53                                                                          State Secrets           State secrets        State secrets
     provisions for whistle-blowers, extended deadlines for
     protecting secret information were too extensive, and left
     little room for parliamentary control. As the law does not
     contain any provision regarding a potential conflict with the
     RTI act, the secrecy of public institutions continues.
     Regulations on how the law should be implemented have not
     been issued, so individual institutions are left to decide if and                                                   Implementing

     There is no dedicated budget allocated for the implementation
     of the law. Most ministerial accounting departments have no

     Overall, there is little ownership of the law by political leaders.
     The issue of the implementation of the RTI law has been at the
     margins of the public agenda. The political crisis that followed
                                                                                                    Monitoring

     signifi cant level of confusion on the difference between
     petitions and proper information requests.
     Preparing an answer for an RTI request usually involves
     several persons in any public institution. The fi rst point of
     contact for a request is usually the offi cials working in the
     department of public relations, who handle many other tasks.
     When a request is submitted, it is usually forwarded to the
     minister or senior offi cials, who decide which department is
                                                                            Bureaucratization,

     approved by all department heads, the legal department, and
     the minister. The answers to requests are usually signed by
     the heads of institutions or other top management offi cials,
     which shows the existence of multiple fi lters in the provision
     of information and the lack of autonomy of public servants
     responsible for this task.
     Data on ATI requests in many state institutions are still not
     separated from those of individual petitions. It is usually up to

     The judiciary has problems of capacity, integrity, and
     politicization, as the European evaluation missions attestâa
     combination of poor material conditions in courts,
     overburdened staff, and a lack of exposure to international
60   legal thinking, especially in new areas such as modern                 Judiciary               Judiciary            Judiciary

     come before them. Moreover, judges tend to stand with
     public institutions.

     After the 2001 elections, the space for civil action also shrunk
     considerably. CSO efforts focused on monitoring and

     against a specific institution in a flagship case, or strategic
     litigation.
     According to IPYS, which has extensive experience making
     requests to and filing complaints against the government,
     filing an action of habeas data without a legal defense hurts
     the plaintiffs. This is because litigation requires a certain level
     of specialization in the application of procedural norms.              Access to External                          Access to external

     Further, judges tend to require excessively bureaucratic               Appeals                                     appeals
     procedures that are not common knowledge among citizens.
     Finally, government bodies are defended by public
     prosecutors, thereby generating a technical imbalance in the
     litigation, to the detriment of plaintiffs.

     Another important norm is Law No. 28664, Law of the
     National Intelligence System (SINA) along with the National
     Intelligence Directorate (DINI), adopted on January 4, 2006.
67   One negative aspect of this law is that it establishes longer          State Secrets         state secrets         State secrets
     time limits than LTAIP for the declassification of information:
     20 years for secret information, 15 years for reserved

     There are key general regulatory norms; in other words, ones
     that are applicable to all bodies subject to LTAIP. Many public
                                                                                                                        Implementing

     procedural or organic provisions about the general obligations
     of each entity.
     As discussed at the Third National Conference on Access to
     Public Information (October 2010), most government bodies
                                                                            Request Process,

69                                                                          Access to Request                           Request process
     obligations stipulated in LTAIP for each entity (for example, a                              process
                                                                            Process
     regime of internal responsibilities
     to respond to information requests).
     Although LTAIP stipulates that noncompliance with its
     contents constitutes a serious offense and may result in a
     criminal charge of abuse of authority, compliance ultimately
     depends on the director of the entity. An example of this is
70   Mayoral Resolution No. 1364- 2010-MPT of December 16,                  Sanctions             sanctions             Sanctions

     Moreover, the two offi cials who launched and coached the
     implementation of this tool in the SGP are no longer employed
     at the PCM.
     Between 2009â10, the SGP attempted to train the national
     offi cials responsible and to build their RTI capacities. There
     are few available resources for these activities, however, for
73                                                                         Budget, Training         training, budget     Training, Budget
     which reason the entities requesting the training had to cover
     the costs themselves, as was the case for the Puno regional
     government.
     Finally, the successful exercise of persuasive authority (the
     magistracy of persuasion) by the Ombudsmanâs Offi ce has
     enabled it to exercise leadership that is reflected in high levels
     of social acceptance. The persuasive, noncoercive nature of its                                                     Monitoring

     because they allow the offi ce to exercise its influence in a                                                       informal
     variety of ways (through public declarations or reports, for
     example) in its efforts to promote good government practices
     and respect for fundamental rights.

     Another factor is that the digitization of information, which
     increases the capacity for its conservation and dissemination,
     is limited to specifi c institutions and contexts. The                                                              Records

     information. The lack of technical assistance on the topic and                                                      Technology
     the costs entailed in undertaking a technological process of

     Given the limited resources allocated to the General Archive

     As a result, new legislation was adopted in both Bulgaria and

     In March 2001, a civil society coalition was forged that

     But IT that is used for communication cannot solve the
     problem of a lack of integrated data management within the
     concerned institutions. Since most of the requests concern
     individual cases, there is a lot of effort invested in manually

     the staffâs tendency is to recover old pieces of legislation from
     the ministriesâ physical archives, largely because the object of
     the FOIA requests is the secondary or tertiary legislation that
     sometimes does not exist in free-of-charge e-repertoires.

     The fi rst obligation created by the FOIA was for all the public
     bodies covered by it, depending on their size, to open public
     relations offi ces or at a minimum to designate civil servants in
     charge of FOIA compliance within the institution. The process
     is currently quite formalized and uniform across public bodies:
     applications are received by the designated service (or person)
85                                                                        Request Process          Request process    Request process
     and registered; they are then forwarded to the relevant
     department for a draft response. The draft response is
     checked by the FOIA offi cer and countersigned alongside the
     relevant department headâs signature. The offi cial response is
     sent to the solicitor in the form preferred (for example, by
     paper or e-mail).
     In general, there has been relatively little formal training for
     the concerned civil servants after the law was adopted,
     although the ministry had initially put a training plan in place.
     Several rounds of information sessions were organized and a
     handbook for FOIA implementation was printed and
     distributed. After the MPI was terminated in 2003, support for                                                   Training, State-

     projects. These activities, either in the form of capacity
     building or independent monitoring initiatives were, as a rule,
     more visible than those organized by the central coordinators,
     but they were far from suffi cient to cover the entire
     administration.
     But introducing meaningful activity reports as a regular
     practice is an uphill struggle in the Romanian public
                                                                          Monitoring Activities,   Monitoring         Monitoring data,

     depends on more than the goodwill and determination of the

     In practice, the courts shaped the interpretation of the law
     and set the boundaries of the right to free ATI. NGO advocacy
     programs focused on testing the FOIA were instrumental in
     bringing strategic litigation to court, allowing judges to pass
     rulings in this fi eld. Even nontransparent entities were
88                                                                        Judiciary                Judiciary          Judiciary
     eventually forced by the decisions of the courts to open their
     doors.This method of making the law operational is an
     entrenched habit in Romania, where pronouncements are
     taken into account by other institutions only if the entity
     generating them has clear enforcement powers.
     Crucial for the enforcement processâbut also for
     deterrenceâis the fact that once a judge has decided against
     a public institution, the information must be disclosed
     immediately. If it is not, the judge may impose fi nancial
89   penalties that apply to heads of institution individually or to      Sanctions                Sanctions          Sanctions
     both the head and the FOIA offi cer as a fraction of their
     salaries. The fi nes accrue daily until the decision of the court
     is enforced (that is, until the information requested
     satisfactorily reaches the applicant).
     The quality and completeness of information posted online is
     still weak. A top-level decision was made to reduce
     compliance costs across the entire public administration with
     the posting of more relevant information online in the correct                                                   Proactive

     practice. On average, 50 percent of central institutions used

      highlight the signifi cant implementation and compliance
      problems for government offi cials, Parliament, and the public
      at large. Through events such as the NIOF and GKA, SAHRC has
      repeatedly reached out to other PAIA stakeholders, including                                                      Monitoring

      strengthening PAIA based on the African Unionâs recently

      community who do not have access to such technology.
      Only 27% of the surveyed public institutions had submitted
      their reports to the Minister annually as required. SAHRCâs
      consolidated audit found this number had only increased to
94                                                                         Monitoring - Data       Monitoring â data    Monitoring data

      40 national departments checked, 80% of the bodies surveyed
      had failed to comply with this requirement at all.
      Public institutions are also submitting inaccurate information.
      This may be due in part to poor records management, but                                                           Records

      However, the SAHRC consolidated audit found that only a
      third of the audited institutions had established internal

      Poor records management is a signifi cant problem at all levels

      offi cials to locate and produce requested information. Civil

      In general, the lack of fi nancial resources hinders PAIA
      implementation. PAIA stakeholders all agree that limited fi
      nancial resources are impacting records management, staffi
      ng, training, strategic planning and communications, and other
      key components of effective PAIA compliance. Over 87% of
      the institutions surveyed in the consolidated audit indicated
101                                                                         Budget                Budget               Budget
      no specifi c budget for PAIA implementation or compliance. In
      the institutions with a PAIA budget, allocations reported
      varied from 0 to R200,000 primarily based on manual printing
      costs. Most departments audited did not see the need to
      create a PAIA budget, citing the low number of requests
      received.
      Historically, SAHRC training has focused on DIOs in order to
      improve the poor response levels of government departments
      to information requests as well as to enhance the
      implementation of PAIA. The DOJ Justice College also provides
102                                                                         Training              Training             Training
      PAIA training for public institutions. In 2013, SAHRC conducted
      33 workshops and reached out to 1065 DIOs, at least 21 PAIA
      public institutions, and multiple local communities through
      trainings and other forums
      Overall, public institutions engage in very little public outreach
      on PAIA outside the published Section 14 manuals. In 2012,
      the SAHRC shifted its emphasis away from the training of
      government offi cials and began to focus more on supporting                                                      Public knowledge,

      This shift was in recognition of the need for the public to hold
      government to account in the delivery of various social
      services. SAHRC

      When an IDT decides that an agency should disclose the
      information to the requester, the agency is supposed to
      comply with the decision and disclose the information.
      However, in case the agency fails to do so,
      there is no sanction against it. The OIA bestows on the IDT the

      While CSO work involves making requests for offi cial

      One of the most signifi cant stumbling blocks to the success of
      the ATIA was the absence of implementing regulations. The
      absence of regulations was not a formal barrier to requests for
      information; citizens could still request information citing the                                                Implementing

      absence of the regulations, combined with the Secrecy Law
      still being in force, created a lack of clarity about their
      obligations, the procedures, and the functioning of the law.
      Under the Oaths Act Cap 19, every civil servant, on
      assumption of offi ce, must take an oath of secrecy against
      disclosing information received in the discharge of offi cial
      duties. The Fourth Schedule of the 1995 Constitution also            State Secrets, Data   Data protection,

      requires such an oath. Article 9(1) of the Public Service            Protection            state secrets
      Act (1969)35 and Article 22 (12) of the Education Service Act
      (2002), criminalize the disclosure of information by public
      servants (Uganda, 2002a).
      The directorate spearheaded the drafting of the regulations,
      developed a National Access to Information Program (ATIP)
      and issued a memo for the appointment of information offi
      cers within public bodies. An implementation plan was                Monitoring

      When the ATIA was enacted, no significant resources were
      allocated for its implementation. The Directorate of
      Information, working with other stakeholders, including civil
      society, has designed a program of approximately 4.5 billion
                                                                                                                      Budget,

      public offi cials, in addition to other activities. But separate
      resources have not been allocated for this, neither to the
      directorate nor to individual ministries.
      In 2009, four years after the implementation of ATIA, fewer
      than 20 public bodies had appointed information offi cers or
      public relations offi cers (PROs). In most cases, staff members
      are assigned the role of IO or PRO in addition to their other
                                                                                                                      PIOs, Agency

      information is low so IOs and PROs are able to juggle their
      existing work with process requests for information.
      Interviews with the offi cials of these various ministries
      revealed a lack of clarity with regard to the responsibilities of
      the different institutions and the perception of fragmentation
      of institutional responsibilities for the management, storage,       Records               records oversight,

      Fragmentation of information across departments also makes

      Under Section 43 of the ATIA, ministers are required to submit
      an annual report to Parliament on requests for access to
      records or information and responsiveness. No public body
      has come up with a manual or presented an annual report to          Records              Records

      Parliament has not asked for either these documents or
      information. Most ministries do not keep records of the types
      of information requests received or their responses to them.
      The lengthy judicial process discourages citizens from using
      the courts as a means of redress. Several critiques and reports
      have been issued and many see the judiciary as not being
128   independent of political influence. The funding allocated to        Judiciary            Judiciary           Judiciary
      the judiciary has been steadily scaled down since 2003, which
      has forced the courts to scale down their operations up to 60
      percent in some respects (IBA 2007).
      The ATIA provides for sanctions for officials who intentionally
      denies a citizen with the right of access under the law by
      destroying, damaging, altering, concealing, or falsifying a
      record; committing such an offense makes the official liable to

      exceed three years, or both. But to date, no public official has
      been charged in a court of law for denial of the right to access
      information.
      Although government departments are making advances in
      the management and dissemination of information, as
      evidenced by the experience of the health and education
      ministries, systematic disclosure of the documents mandated
                                                                                                                   Proactive

      individual departments and ministries have largely been
      developed quite separately from the ATIA.
      Implementation is also facilitated by the fact that public

      its drafting. Since the mid-1970s, politicians, offi cials, and                                              CSO - advocacy

      progress through the parliamentary process.
      The introduction of the absolute exemptions is a signifi cant
      point of difference between the governmentâs consultation bill

      Costs are mainly incurred due to the need to train staff in the
      legal and strategic requirements of responding to requests
      and the practicalities of redaction and information
      management. But other interviews suggest that resource
136                                                                          Budget, Training       Budget, training     Budget
      implications are highly variable and that many authorities
      receiving fewer requests have been able to incorporate
      response processes into their existing legal or public relations
      functions with minimal disruption
      Authorities were given considerable leeway in determining
      their own arrangements. This fl exibility was considered
      desirable given the range of authorities subject to the law, the
      differing resources available to each, and the diversity of the
      relationships they have with the formal political system and
137                                                                          Agency Leadership      Agency Leadership    PIOs
      with external stakeholders. Smaller authorities have tended to
      delegate the administrative handling of FOIA matters to their
      legal teams or to their corporate services divisions; larger
      authorities and those receiving a high volume of requests have
      set up dedicated teams
      However, a lack of widespread support within the cabinet
      proved particularly signifi cant after the decision to shift to the
      âbig bang.â It introduced an unanticipated delay between the
                                                                             Training, Political    Training,political   Political support,

      trained offi cers among public authorities that had been built
      in anticipation of an early entry into force.
      The interviewees from the National Archives suggested that
      effective records management tends to exist at agencies
      dependent on accurate records to conduct core business and

      also suggested that this view of records management as an

      The monitoring of compliance with the FOIA is carried out by
      the Information Commissioner and the nodal agency. The ICO
      discharges its duties in a number of ways. Apart from hearing
      appeals and working with authorities to improve their internal

      The commissioner also supports research into transparency,
      conducts public information campaigns, and is empowered to
      report to Parliament on issues of concern on an ad hoc basis.

      In 2010, the commissioner increased the number of staff
      dedicated to resolving appeals and reported that the number
      of open cases dropped signifi cantly, especially among those
                                                                                                                         External appeals

      Evidence of compliance with proactive publication schemes is
      patchy, and it is diffi cult to draw any fi rm conclusions from it.
      There is a high level of compliance with the requirement to
      adopt a scheme, but evidence of impact or effectiveness is

      schemes, although it is not clear whether this is indicative of
      general public satisfaction with the schemes or of a lack of
      awareness of their existence.
      The existence of a legal rule favoring disclosure allows offi cials
      to answer informal requests from and engage in discussion
      with external groups much more freely. This is because all
      parties know that requesters will probably be able to access
