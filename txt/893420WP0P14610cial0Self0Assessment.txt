Overview
City of Ulaanbaatar (UB) leaders recognize that capital expenditure requirements to support
continued economic growth and current urbanization trends are enormous. Like many national
and local governments around the world, UB is closely weighing the benefits and costs of using
borrowed money to build the infrastructure needed for more and better municipal services.
Borrowing from the capital markets on a long-term basis could provide large capital sums for
immediate use, and enable intergenerational equity, where those who benefit from the asset will
also contribute to repaying long-term debts for long-lasting urban infrastructure.

This note is part of a Technical Assistance program provided by the World Bank at the request
of UB. This financial self-assessment is a joint effort by the City of Ulaanbaatar and the World
Bank to guide UB in preparing for a credit rating. A credit rating is an opinion by an assessor on
the chances that a borrower will repay a loan on time and in full as agreed. The rating enables
potential investors to decide whether to invest in the borrower’s business, based on the
underlying risk assumptions and uncertainties underscored by the rating. In other words, the
credit rating is useful for investors to assess the long-term performance and stability of a
municipality when they are considering partnerships in infrastructure development programs.
The primary reason for obtaining a credit rating is to lower the cost of borrowing, as higher
ratings tend to have a positive correlation with lower interest rates. Obtaining a credit rating
also increases the marketability of the borrower, thus opening up more financing options and
enhancing the municipality’s ability to choose the most cost-effective source of funding at a
given time.

The objective of this note is to assist the UB government in identifying the critical issues that
would affect a future credit rating. The note reviews factors that may support or constrain the
rating, ultimately impacting the UB’s creditworthiness. Moody’s methodology for subnational
government credit rating has been applied to form the basis for the assessment. (See Appendix
B for Moody’s methodology). This assessment comprises of a comprehensive review of the
city’s economic fundamentals, institutional framework, fiscal performance, debt profile, and
governance system. A key component of a credit rating comprises a review of the institutional
framework that governs the city’s financial system. This includes evaluating the legal
framework, regulations, and procedures. The review also elucidates the jurisdictional
parameters across levels of governments regarding debt raising and financing, and evaluates
the overall quality of decision-making. As in a formal rating, the assessment also examines the
operating environment, which is underlined by the sub-sovereign credit rating, and the support
range, or the sovereign guarantee available to UB, if any. The exercise aims to reveal capacity
gaps and potential areas for strengthening, as well as proposing concrete steps to improve the
city’s creditworthiness.

Summary
The finances of the City of Ulaanbaatar (UB) reflect a fairly stable financial position on the basis
of a well-diversified economic structure, a historical trend of surplus and cash flow liquidity,
and fiscal resilience against cyclical macroeconomic factors. There are concerns regarding the
insufficient clarity and transparency of the current financial reporting system, which does not
accurately reflect total assets and total liabilities. The city’s consolidated balance sheet indicates
moderate long-term debt liabilities of UB’s public enterprises. There is also an apparent lack of
legal clarity in cases of debt distress. These aspects raise concerns regarding UB’s role and any
implicit financial obligations it may be obliged to undertake. Capital and real estate assets in
UB, which could potentially be used as collateral for municipal borrowing, are currently not
properly inventoried and valuated. This exposes city finances to vast opportunity costs on the
incomes and market values that could potentially be generated from their effective management
and usage. Central government guarantees are moderate, given the role of UB in the national
economy. They may not be equal to the short-term macro-fiscal readjustments, underlined by a
large amount of off-budget spending, burgeoning credit growth, unsustainably high fiscal
deficits, and inflationary pressures on the horizon. For UB to improve its credit quality and
prepare for an official rating from a credit rating agency, it the city should consider the
following actions:

    Improving its financial reporting system. This should include audited financial statements
     indicating basic classifications such as own revenue sources, fiscal transfers, operating
     and capital revenues, as well as current expenditures. Current expenditures should
     differentiate between expenses in general administration, operations and maintenance of
     each municipal service, and capital expenditures.
    Strengthening its capital investment planning process. This should comprise three- to
     five-year capital investment budgets prioritizing capital spending by services/programs.
     Budgets should also indicate specific sources of financing, such as own-source revenue,
     proceeds from debt, capital transfers, local development fund, PPPs, and any other capital
     sources.
    Improving its capital asset registry. This registry should differentiate, among other things,
     between land and buildings devoted to services and fixed commercial assets including
     land not assigned to municipal services.
    Greater oversight role over municipal-owned enterprises and their debts, identifying UB’s
     contingent liabilities, both explicit and implicit.

Credit Outlook
Based on recent sovereign ratings, the credit outlook for UB would have been stable or positive.
However, Standard & Poor’s has revised its credit outlook for the sovereign rating from stable to
negative. A negative outlook on the sovereign rating would have unfavorable implications for
UB’s credit outlook. As of April 3, 2014, although Moody’s rated Mongolia as B1 stable, it
concluded that policy laxity and uncertainty are constraining the quality of its credit, resulting
in a sharp spike in Moody’s External Vulnerability Indicator. The rating agency notes that in the
absence of greater policy discipline and given the recent rise in government debt and system-
wide foreign-currency borrowing, government finances and the economy at large would remain
susceptible to boom-bust economic cycles.

I. Financial Performance and Debt Profile
This section analyzes the key indicators of UB finances as a whole, which include the UB
government budget as well as the budgets of the nine districts. It also presents findings on local
public debt and their implications for the city’s creditworthiness.


Budget Finances
Ulaanbaatar’s stable financial position has benefitted from a relatively diversified economy,
which generated MNT 401.4 billion (equivalent to US$227 million) in own-source revenue in
2012. This represents about 63 percent1 of GDP, which supported a relatively stable revenue
base. UB has a strong record of balancing its annual budgets, and has consistently maintained
operating surpluses that have enabled the city to acquire new financial obligations. In the last
five years,2 UB has closed yearly operations with balanced budgets and average surpluses of
about 6.5 percent of total revenue. The reduction of cash financing surplus from 6.5 percent in
2008 to 3 percent in 2009–10 was due to the global economic slowdown, which had a negative
impact on tax collection both at the local and national level. Nonetheless, the city has recovered
in subsequent years, recording cash surpluses of 10.2 percent and 8.9 percent in 2011 and 2012,
respectively (see Table A.1). In absolute terms, yearly cash surpluses have ranged from MNT 9.5
to MNT 78.6 billion, equivalent to US$5.4 to US$44.6 million (Table A.3).

Between 2008 and 2012, an average of 48.7 percent of total revenues came from own-sources,
which have been fairly stable. UB’s main revenues are underpinned by taxes on incomes and
wages, which represent about 58 percent of its total revenues and have been growing in both
nominal and real terms, as well as in real per capita terms. During the five-year period of this
analysis UB’s annual real revenues have grown at an annual rate of 36.4 percent. However, the
city has no authority to set its tax rates. These are established by the central government’s
Ministry of Finance (MoF). In addition, UB also draws revenues from a land payment/tax,
property tax, vehicle tax, user fees for underground water extraction, an inheritance tax, and
stamp duties. Other service charges and tariffs are collected by UB enterprises and reported in
their own budgets. However, the enterprises and UB do not have full rate-setting autonomy on
some of these charges and tariffs, which compromises revenue flexibility and sustainability.




1 This figure should be treated as a rough estimate (which is most likely overestimated by the national regional accounts),
considering the inherent difficulties in calculating local/regional GDP, particularly the nation’s capital, which is the most interlinked
with the rest of the Mongolian economy.
2 The fiscal year is defined as the period between January 1st and December 31st.




                                                                                                                                       1

Beginning in 2012, intergovernmental transfers through the MoF’s Local Development Fund
(LDF) for infrastructure are being made on the basis of a formula and are likely to range
between US$50 to US$100 million. UB is now also being allowed to retain all revenue collection
surpluses, which will incentivize the city to improve its collection efficiency. Fiscal transfers
equal to 51.3 percent of UB’s total revenue are earmarked for specific public programs, such as
health and education, from corresponding line ministries.3 Note that fiscal transfers cannot be
used to cover debt service obligations or any type of recurrent operating expenditures. LDF
transfers are for investment financing only, and transfers from line ministries are earmarked for
expenditures in health and education or corresponding sectors. Therefore, changes in transfers
do not affect UB’s fiscal capacity associated with its operating budget. They may only affect
UB’s capital budget. While earmarked transfers from line ministries could be characterized as
fairly stable, transfers from MoF had historically been fairly erratic and hence, unpredictable.
However, with the passage of the Budget Law, which established the LDF and a formula-based
transfer system, discretionary capital transfers appear to have finally stopped.

On the expenditure side, both current and capital expenses recorded significant expansion of
132 percent and 128 percent, respectively, between 2010 and 2011. These increases reflected
huge public spending in response to the economic downturn, as well as intensifying pressure
for rehabilitation and expansion of urban infrastructure and services. Some of these
expenditures have been partly financed by recurrent revenues, yearly surpluses, and by
accumulated cash balances, as reported under “Cash and Bank Deposits” in the UB’s balance
sheet (Table A.5). As a sign of financial resiliency and fiscal discipline, the city still managed to
close yearly operations with cash financing surpluses, despite the increase in investments in
public works (Table A.4).


Capital Assets4
International experience suggests that cities use their recurrent revenue to cover both interest
and principal of debt service obligations. In practice, immovable capital assets, such as land and
buildings, are rarely used as collateral for borrowing. Bond buyers expect timely payment of
principal and interest, and know that liquidation of government-owned capital assets cannot
typically be accomplished to ensure timely payment if default looms. Even in revenue-
generating projects, only the corresponding revenue streams are usually pledged for the
financing of debt service obligations. Most cities use a general obligation pledge, which
promises the bondholder that interest and principal will be the first recurrent expense paid
from all available revenues. For UB, the Budget Law Article 62.4 establishes that the Capital
City is prohibited from using its revenue as collateral when it incurs debt. As would be

3While UB manages these funds, they cannot be used to cover its financial obligations, including debt payments.
4Capital assets include movable and nonmovable property. Movable property refers to tools, machinery, equipment, and motor
vehicles; nonmovable property comprises lands and buildings.

expected, the law does not say that general revenues cannot be used to cover debt service
obligations (interest and principal). However, the law does not explicitly prohibit UB from
pledging its general revenues to secure bonds during is normal operations, which is quite
different from using general revenues (or part of them) as collateral in case of default. The
Budget Law also specifies that municipal assets designated to provide services cannot be used
as collateral. The current value of UB’s non-movable assets is recorded under “Tangible assets”
in its balance sheet (Table A.5). However, no distinction is made in the balance sheet between
nonmovable assets devoted to services and those commercial fixed assets not associated with
service provision. This distinction would be useful because the non-service-related commercial
assets could potentially be used as collateral. Note that if pledging revenues were explicitly
adopted as part of normal operations, the actual need for collateral would become much less
important and fairly remote.

If the current Securities Market Law, which requires collateral, is not reformed through the
proposed draft law on Debt Management, it should be noted that UB owns some land and
buildings that are not used for service provision, and could potentially be used as collateral for
municipal debt.5 For other objectives, UB has started an asset registry system of public
infrastructure, which does not report on vacant and undeveloped public land. The valuation for
commercial lands and buildings is not based on market price, but on construction costs,
adjusted for depreciation, excluding the value of land. Consequently, UB’s capital assets stock is
significantly undervalued and not fully reflected in its balance sheet.

Additionally, land and (indirectly) public buildings may be quite unattractive for investors as
collateral, due to the legal risks associated with ownership of public land. Under the current
system of restricted land tenure, land is not a very liquid asset (that is, not easily tradable) and
thus ineffective as collateral. This limitation seems to be aggravated by the lack of valuation of
public land and buildings, which currently makes the market value of such potential collateral
unknown, or at best uncertain.


Debt Profile
Until 2012, UB was prohibited by law from borrowing. The debt report for the period of
analysis (2008–12) does not report any direct debt, and thus UB’s ratio of debt service to total
revenues is zero, as reported in Table A.1. Nevertheless, some municipal-owned companies
currently hold internal and external debts. Some of these debts are guaranteed by the central
government, others by the assets of the enterprises. It appears some concessional loans have


5 Article 62.4.1 of the 2012 Budget Law states that the capital city is prohibited from using “capital city property, which is required to
fulfill its responsibilities.” The only viable options would be city property that is not related to the provision of services, such as
vacant lands not involved in a program of land distribution, or real estate property owned by UB’s own enterprises that are not
being used or meant for the provision of city services.



                                                                                                                                        3

been made in the form of on-lending agreements through the city to the enterprises by the MoF.
The consolidated debt for FY 2012 reported long-term external debts of about MNT 130 billion
(or US$73.4 million), and internal debts in the amount of MNT 44 billion (equivalent to US$23
million). These debts, as reported by the city, belong to UB’s municipal enterprises (see Table 1
and Table A.2 in Appendix A). In 2012, these debts (MNT 173 billion) comprised 19.7 percent of
UB’s total revenue—not an unmanageable proportion in the event of a potential contingent
liability. This debt is equivalent to 1.2 percent of Mongolia’s GDP (Table A.2). In the event that
the city would have to assume the debt service obligations of its enterprises, the yearly financial
obligations of the city would be less than a half a percent of its total own revenues. The
repayment of this debt is in principle the responsibility of the companies themselves. According
to UB’s debt report, the city government and its nine districts have no legal obligation for the
payments of interest and principal. Nonetheless, over-borrowing by UB enterprises could lead
to operational deficits, and potential default on their debt service obligations. This situation is
more likely considering that some of these enterprises do not enjoy full financial autonomy. For
example, city enterprises are not able to set their own rates and tariffs for the services they
provide, which may compromise their financial sustainability. In addition, given that most of
these enterprises provide essential services, UB may be forced to bail them out in the event of
insolvency. As such, there are implicit contingent liabilities that could have a negative effect on
UB’s financial stability and possibly in its future credit rating. The largest debt of MNT 88
billion (about US$50 million) belongs to the water utility. This debt represents 22 percent of
UB’s own revenues in 2012, which suggests that current implicit contingencies could be
manageable, but still significant.

                                                         Ulaanbaatar Financial Self-Assessment


Note that the loan to the water company originated in July of 2004 from a loan provided by the
World Bank Group (IDA) to the government of Mongolia through MoF to improve services in
UB. This loan, as it appears, was on-lent by MoF to UB, which in turn passed it on the water
company. This lack of clarity for financial responsibilities illustrates the critical importance of
full transparency in debt management. Records on debt need to be systematized so that new
local administrations are fully aware of the debt situation, as well as the corresponding legal
responsibilities between UB, its enterprises, and MoF.

After passage of the 2011 Budget Law on January 1, 2013, UB was authorized to borrow and
issue bonds. The law specifies the central government approvals and disclosures required prior
to borrowing. It also sets limits on the size and duration of debt. Specifically, “government”
debt (that is, public debts) may reach ceilings of 40 percent of GDP; debt service for local
governments is capped at 15 percent of base revenue of the previous year. The total debt of a
local government cannot exceed its base revenue of the previous fiscal year and debt can only be
held up to four years. Note that empirical findings of UB’s financial performance, including its
yearly cash financing surpluses of about 6.5 percent of revenue, suggest that the city has
capacity to borrow (within the specified limits) from either financial institutions and/or through
the securities markets.

Prevailing laws do not require a central government guarantee for UB’s borrowing. This means
that the city would need to back its debt with its own creditworthiness based on the stability of
its net revenue flow. If the city acquires debt, then it must be fully prepared to make the
corresponding yearly budgetary appropriations to cover debt service obligations. In addition, it
is advisable that UB pledges yearly revenues to a reserve fund, and makes mandatory annual
deposits to a sinking fund, so that it can periodically redeem its bonds. Investors in bonds, in
contrast to bank lenders, rely more on the stability in revenue sources (for servicing debt on a
timely manner), than on a city’s own commercial assets that could serve as collateral in the
event of default. Since UB would be fully responsible for the payment of its future financial
obligations, a credit rating should be required by either law and/or corresponding regulations.




II. Economic Fundamentals
As the capital and largest city of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar has roughly 1.3 million inhabitants, or
46 percent of the total population. People have migrated to the city in droves, attracted by
growing economic and job opportunities and better public services. They have also been forced
from the rural areas by the loss of livestock and livelihoods due to persistent harsh winters. The
average income per household in UB is 21 percent higher than the national average, and income
per capita is 35.6 percent higher. With 67.2 percent of the inhabitants in the working age group,



                                                                                                 5
MONGOLIA


UB has a reported unemployment rate of approximately 5.6 percent, and the monthly average
salary of workers increased by 170 percent between 2008 and 2012.

The local economy is relatively well-diversified. Local output is mostly (99 percent) comprised
of construction, mining, and transportation services; light manufacturing and processing; and
retail. In 2011, the mining industry, commerce, wholesale and retail, transportation, and real
estate accounted for 15.7 percent, 11.0 percent, 9.74 percent, and 8.10 percent of GDP,
respectively. Between 2008 and 2012, Ulaanbaatar’s average real GDP growth was around 13.3
percent, compared to the national growth rate of 8.76 percent. In spite of the global economic
downturn (when national GDP decreased by 1.3 percent), Ulaanbaatar’s GDP grew by 6.4
percent, reflecting a high degree of economic resiliency. Construction and maintenance works
in UB accounted for US$421 billion in 2011, 75 percent of total national output. Similarly, the
retail and wholesale industry in UB produced 2.88 billion, also about 75 percent of total national
sales. As these two sectors continue to drive growth and generate employment in UB,
diversification of the tertiary sector, including hotel management, restaurants, and the
development of financial services, will expand economic opportunities to UB’s inhabitants. The
city also benefited from having domestic and foreign mining enterprises registered in its
jurisdiction and receives 5 percent of royalties on minerals as part of the shared taxes system.

Economic and revenue bases in UB have been broadening due to the demographic dividends.
However, increasing pressure for municipal services has compounded a host of existing urban
challenges, including air and soil pollution, solid waste management, water and energy
(heating and electricity) provision, affordable housing, and transport. In the past two years, the
real estate sector has grown significantly, driven mainly by increasing demand (rapid in-
migration, rising disposable income, and interest rate subsidies), as well as boosted supply
resulting from the direct government funding to construction companies, producers of
construction materials, and real estate developers to support new construction.6 Strong demand
for both housing and service delivery associated with this population growth will continue to
put pressure for infrastructure spending in the future. In the face of mounting financial pressure
on the municipal budget, UB is constrained by its restricted authority to set new tariffs and fees
and limited adjustment flexibility. However, incentives to improve collection efficiency have
expanded as UB has gained the authority to manage its own operating surpluses.




6This effort is part of the recent Monetary Stimulus Programs of the Government of Mongolia, which seeks to reduce inflation and
spur economic growth. The program is well intended and embeds important social objectives. However, it is being implemented in
an uncertain macroeconomic policy environment, through inappropriate channels of off-budgetary schemes, and therefore has the
potential to exacerbate unfavorable macro trends. Furthermore, there is a perception that Ulaanbaatar’s public works projects are far
beyond the capacity of local contractors, who simply don’t have the human resources, technological know -how, or experience to
properly undertake many of the necessary infrastructure projects.

III. Institutional Framework and
Governance
The democratically elected city leadership came into power in June 2012. It has since then
moved towards a governance system that allows for greater public participation in the decision-
making process through inclusion of voices from the neighborhood level, and introduction of a
complaints system for better accountability and improvement in services provision. The city
management has made major efforts to demonstrate visionary leadership to tackle enormous
municipal challenges more effectively.

Nevertheless, UB faces institutional constraints to manage its growth and development. The
capital city is currently managed through a complex institutional structure, which renders
effective cross-sectoral collaboration and data sharing particularly challenging. The UB
municipal administration is comprised of 6 key departments, 32 agencies, and 53 municipal-
owned enterprises overseen by a mayor (also governor of the UB Capital City), 6 vice-mayors,
and 45 council members. This structure leads to institutional fragmentation, with overlapping
roles and responsibilities among city departments and agencies, especially with regards to
financial management, planning, and execution. The Finance and Treasury Department is in
charge of producing financial statements, while the Property Relations Department provides
data on city-owned enterprises’ debt record. However, it is unclear which departments would
be responsible for providing crucial information regarding cash flows and liquidity, plans for
municipal borrowing, comprehensive debt levels, and debt management strategy. The internal
auditing function has not been set up yet. This self-assessment recommends (as does the debt
management assessment) the creation of a financial and planning coordination mechanism and
a debt management unit in the Finance and Treasury Department to be in charge of cash flow
projections and liquidity, borrowing strategy, and debt management.

Significant progress has been made in improving budget reporting formats. The dual reporting
obligation requires that UB submit a budget report that is in line with MoF’s format and
uniform with the rest of the country. Meeting this obligation, while trying to align its own
budgeting system closer to international standards, severely hinders UB’s ability to report on
relevant municipal finance elements; it also hinders reporting of key standard ratios from the
budget reports for credit rating purposes. Budget reports from 2013 onwards have reported on
actual services provided. There is still room for improving this service- or program-based
reporting to be closer to international standards. Furthermore, the UB’s financial data and
budget information are not managed or reported in an integrated manner that follows
international standards. Following such practices would facilitate effective financial analysis,
planning, and forecasting. UB’s budget format still does not record the yearly balance between


                                                                                              7
MONGOLIA


revenues and expenditures, as it should. Even in the revised format prepared for this
assessment, distinctions between capital and current revenues are not made. Finally, there is no
systematized reporting (or a yearly balance sheet) on assets and liabilities. Since any future
credit rating would need to review budget data for the previous five years, the rating agency
would not be able to do this assessment for the years prior to 2013. This self-assessment exercise
took 11 months; the majority of the time was spent in identifying the relevant financial data.

Recently, UB has adopted recommendations on key principles for capital investment planning
(CIP), with a goal of preparing a pipeline of projects to be financed with municipal bonds and
other capital sources. These principles are: multi-year capital investment planning,
establishment of an interagency CIP working group to provide inputs and oversee the
prioritization of investment projects, and inclusion of life-cycle costing to account for operations
and maintenance. Given the significant infrastructure investment needs in UB, and under
current CIP practice, financial planners are overwhelmed with review requests from 9 districts,
50 government entities, and 70 municipal enterprises and joint ventures; each may request a
dozen to over 100 projects. The key challenges and recommendations relate to the providing the
human resources and expertise needed for project supervision. Staff and expertise shortages
pose several challenges for UB, from independence in its investment decision-making to
effective procurement of public works.

Because of the role of UB as the economic, social, and political center of Mongolia, the
institutional framework governing subnational governments is subject to national laws. It has
gradually evolved towards deconcentration of fiscal powers and expenditure responsibilities.
Several laws provide the broad legal framework for debt management,7 although inadequacies
across these laws introduce rigidities and create significant uncertainties in the legal mandate
that UB would have to follow to issue bonds. These laws need to be carefully reviewed,
adjusted, and clarified in order to ensure legal and actual viability of these expected debts. 8
Hence, it is recommended that UB, as main stakeholder, actively advocate for technical revision
of some crucial articles in these laws, as discussed in this note.




7 This body of laws includes: the Public Sector Management and Finance Law (2002); Securities Law (2002); Law on Coordination of
Foreign Loans and Grants in Aid (2003); Making Payments for Treasury Securities (2005); Fiscal Stability Law (2010); Budget Law of
2011; and Securities Market Law (2012).
8The lack of clarity in some key elements of the laws may expose them to different interpretation by implementing agencies and

could generate discretionary actions that may be against the law. The concepts of “debt” and “debt instrument” are defined in
Articles 4.1.45/46, while the concept of “Public Debt” is defined in Provision 4.1.8 of the Fiscal Stability Law. When incurring public
debt, local governments must adhere to the legal mandates established in Articles 57.4 and 62.2 of the 2011 Budget Law (BL). The
first article refers to central government short-term loans, while the second one alludes to medium-term debt. Regarding short-term
government loans, Art. 41.5 of the BL establishes that short-term loans can be allocated from upper-level budgets for financing
revenue shortages in lower-level budgets as specified in the Provision 41.4 of the BL.

IV. Extraordinary Support Considerations
Extraordinary support is defined as the likelihood that a higher tier of government would aid a
local government that faced acute liquidity stress or help local government avoid default on its
debt obligations. Support could take different forms, such as a one-time cash infusion or any
action facilitating negotiations with lenders that enhances access to interim financing for the
local government.

For UB, there is a moderate likelihood of extraordinary support from the national government.
This conclusion reflects, at the jurisdictional level, the national government’s willingness to
address any major financial problems that may be experienced by UB, in view of its strategic
importance for the Mongolian economy. Legally, it is not explicitly stated whether the national
treasury will provide timely bailouts, given the lack of precedent for municipal borrowing.

Regarding bond issuance, best international practices strongly suggest that UB’s ultimate policy
goal should be a legal framework that incentivizes local governments to be financially
transparent, balanced, and solvent. In this way, central government guarantees would not be
needed. Note that central government guarantees inherently induce moral hazard; that is, if a
local government defaults, then the central government will bail it out. In a number of cities,
moral hazard can be avoided by banning central government guarantees. Furthermore,
following best practice transparency and accountability principles, bond issuance regulations
must explicitly state the procedures to be followed in case of delays of interest payments,
default, or bankruptcy. This gives investors a measure of confidence that they will recover their
investments through liquidation of city assets, or other means.




V. Conclusions and Recommendations
UB has favorable economic fundamentals and a strong history of balanced budgets and cash
financing surpluses. Despite a relatively diversified revenue base, UB’s expen diture
assignments are not matched by flexibility in raising revenues. Nor is there a clear mandate to
set fees, taxes, tariffs, and service charges, which are a common source of revenue for recurrent
costs and capital expenditures. While there have been significant improvements in financial
reporting, clearly understanding the extent of UB’s capital asset stocks and the city’s financial
situation is challenging. Finally, the legal and regulatory framework on borrowing and debt
management is incomplete. There is still a need to develop the guiding regulations, norms, and
procedures for debt management, especially of city-owned enterprises.



                                                                                               9
MONGOLIA


In order for UB to enhance robustness in financial governance and credit quality, prepare for a
formal credit rating, and achieve creditworthiness, a number of measures are proposed for the
consideration of the city’s leadership. The following measures build on the achievements of the
ongoing partnership and technical assistance with the World Bank.


Improvement of financial reporting
Investors and creditors base their decisions to purchase bonds or to lend primarily on the
financial strength of the issuers, and the associated guarantees to ensure the expected returns
and minimize financial risks. The self-prepared and audited financial statements of UB would
legally need to include information on cash flow, surpluses in operations, liquidity, sources of
collaterals, and current holding levels of different debt types. UB would also be expected to
highlight its sources of collateral, generally its commercial assets that should be reported in
financial statements. However, UB’s reporting systems do not make such statements timely and
easily available. Financial statements for the year 2013 are closer to international standards
because they use a revised format that reports on the basis of outputs or services provided.
Statements of prior years and those for 2014 are reported in a complex and nontransparent
manner. As a result, producing the five-year statement for this self-assessment was an arduous
task for UB technical staff that took a number of months. A credit rating agency would not have
the time or the insider knowledge to dedicate the same degree of attention as the self-
assessment team. As a result, it is likely that the city may not receive the rating it merits.
Therefore, in preparing for a formal credit rating, UB could consider having the statements
produced for this assessment formally audited as an interim measure to provide a degree of
confidence to the rating agency.

UB should internally undertake projections of revenues and expenditures, taking into account
the expected financial obligations that would result from bond servicing. This information will
help the city in its overall financial management. Specifically, it would help UB anticipate any
possible negative trends in the balance between revenue sources and expenditure
responsibilities. These projections would also be particularly relevant in the event that a specific
revenue-generating project was expected to help finance debt service obligations of a revenue
bond.


Strengthening of capital investment planning process
The city needs to strengthen its investment planning capacity. UB should strive to convince
potential private investors of its ability to make a good and efficient use of public credit. UB
should also develop its capacity to prioritize investment projects through a multi-criteria
ranking methodology and cost-benefit analysis. UB should also build confidence with timely

execution of its new capital budget. New regulations can establish a threshold below which a
project is not financed through the CIP but instead funded from the current budget. This would
reduce the backlog of project review requests.


Strengthening capital asset registry
In UB, not all land and buildings can be used as collateral for borrowing, depending on their
current use. Current practices of asset inventorying only apply to public infrastructure in
service and neglecting potential income-generating assets is not efficient or bankable. A public
capital asset registry would help the city manage its assets inventory, and derive values and
incomes from assets. The registry would also be a mechanism to help keep the costs of owning,
operating, and maintaining assets at acceptable levels. Based on international best practices,
government property and assets are owned by the government as a whole, with specific
institutions or agencies as “users” of the assets. The registry will enable UB to duly reflect these
assets on its books and value them accordingly.


Greater oversight role over municipal-owned enterprises and
their debts
Municipal-owned enterprises have debt payment obligations and assets that are under the
oversight of UB, as sole owner of such enterprises. Hence, UB would be obliged to intervene in
case of enterprises’ default. Effective oversight over enterprises operat ions is crucial,
particularly given the implicit and potential burden on the finances of the capital city in case of
debt distress. Therefore, it is recommended that for each city-owned enterprise, UB officials
exercise a systematic and thorough review of (i) annual operating and capital budgets,
including a review of the justifiable number of staff; (ii) monthly statements of revenues and
expenditures, with explanations of any variances from approved budgets; (iii) annual audited
financial statements; (iv) assessments of the adequacy of current rates and charges; and (v)
requests for any new borrowing and any disposition of assets beyond those justified by the
normal course of business. In addition, for the eight enterprises that have loans, a
comprehensive debt management system should be put in place.

There is also a need to strengthen the legal framework that ensures effective enforcement of
loan agreements. For example, as proposed in the draft Debt Management Law, a fiscal
intercept could be introduced to withhold transfers to the city if it defaults on debt service
obligations. A similar enforcement mechanism is needed to ensure UB enterprises comply with
their debt service obligations. This will reduce uncertainties and credit risks, providing
investors and lenders greater confidence that there is oversight and an effective enforcement
system in place for debt repayment.

Appendix B: Moody’s Rating Process for
Local and Regional Governments

Our ratings process is manageable and most information should be readily available to
government officials. It generally starts with the provision of the following information:

I. Document requirements
        Three to five years of financial statements
        Current year’s budget and projections
        Breakout of expenditures by object and operating vs. capital
        Off-budgetary revenues and expenditures and trends
        Capital budget or multi-year capital improvement program
        Debt statement for past five years detailing amount and structure, for
         direct/indirect/unconsolidated debts
        Other contingent liabilities (pension funds, etc.)
        List of major related companies, ownership stake and debt outstanding
        Coverage of principal and interest of total debt
        Economic data as available would be useful


The next step is a face to face meeting with Moody’s that generally takes around one day. The
city/province selects who should participate in the meeting—some suggestions are as follows:

II. Suggested participation of city officials
      Finance Bureau (Department of Budget, Treasury, Department of Exchequer,
       Intergovernmental Relationship)
      Department of Debt and Capital Works
      Economist/Economic Development Department


City officials determine how the meeting will be run—questions can be provided in advance
and dialogue may continue after the meeting if information is not available at the meeting

III. Topics to discuss at rating meeting
      Institutional framework: Relationship between City/Province and the central
       government including financial, legal and political aspects. Examples of central
       government support to the city/province.

     Government Related Issuers: Financial interaction with GRIs including level of subsidies
      and dividends, importance of companies to the city, summary of financial performance of
      major profitable and unprofitable companies and future development plans.
     Economic Factors: Size, structure and diversity of economic base: major economic sectors
      and their activities. Potential growth sectors, competitive pressures and importance of
      different industries. Planned large capital projects and potential impact.
     Budget Structure and Policies: The structure of the city’s budget, key factors that have driven
      trends in major categories over the past five years, and degree of flexibility to raise revenues
      or cut expenditures if necessary. Review intergovernmental grant and loan programs.
     Financial Performance and Position: Discuss past recent years of financial performance
      and projections and key factors driving outcomes. What are the major financial pressures
      addressed in the budget? How does the city manage its liquidity requirements?
     Debt Position and Management: Review of total direct, guaranteed and non-guaranteed
      debt of state-owned companies. Debt management policies and limits. Financing plan
      including projections of government investment and future borrowing for the next three
      to five years.
