This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

        taxable transactions carried out in any continuous period up to 12
        calendar months exceeds GEL 100 000”, shall apply for a VAT
        registration to Revenue Service under Ministry of Finance of Georgia. A
        company can also perform voluntary registration.
        In both cases, the company representative makes an application with
   3    the request to register the company as a VAT taxpayer. The application         1 day        no charge
        is made at the Revenue Service territorial service center. The applicant is
        considered as a VAT taxpayer from the moment of a such request. VAT
        taxpayer number in Georgia is the same as the Identification Number of
        the company, which is obtained while registering the company with the
        NAPR.

        The cost is determined by the project value. According to Tbilisi
        Government Resolution No 2-21, as of February 28, 2008, the fee
        has been increased to GEL 1.00 per sq. m. and only the ground
        floor space is counted. Thus, the breakdown in the case
        considered here is 1300.6/2 x GEL 1.00 = GEL 650.30.

        According to GOG Resolution No. 57 as of March 24 2009,

        does not require project expertise and entails a simplified

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and
greater transparency of tariffs.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      It is also possible to submit the transaction at one of the 500 authorized
      users. These can be banks, notaries or real estate companies. These
      entities can verify the transaction and submit the purchase and sale
      agreement to the National Public Registry. The employees dealing with
      these transactions receive a training provided by the National Public
      Registry and a memorandum is signed between the National Public
      Registry and the entity. The most commonly used authorized users are
      banks.



      The authorized entity receiving the application will verify the identity of
      the buyer and seller, as well as the ownership of the property. Once the
      information is submitted though a specific software, the National public
      registry employee will verify again the ownership and the existence of
      the individuals (in the Civil registry database that they can access
      electronically) and process the transfer. Another software is used at this
      stage.



      Georgian legislation provides for the possibility of accelerated
      proceedings, therefore if the buyer wishes to register property transfer
      on the same day of submission of all necessary documents, the fee is
      respectively GEL 200. If registration is carried out on the day following
      the day of submission, the fee totals to GEL 150. GEL 50 is a fee paid for
      ordinary registration procedures, which take 4 business days following
      the submission of all required documents to the Public Registry. The
      payment is done at any commercial bank.



      There is also an option available to apply for an extract electronically via
      the Georgian National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) website with
      fees being as follows: 1 working day - 10 GEL and at the day of

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                               BizBank is most likely to initiate liquidation proceedings, because it would want
                                   to sell the assets as soon as possible. As a secured creditor, BizBank can

                                which would allow it to select a representative to the Conciliation Council - a
                                 body that decides whether liquidation or reorganization should be pursued.

                              Hotel's assets will be sold at a public auction. At the first auction, the assets
                              must be sold as a whole. If they are not sold at the first auction, the creditors
                             may authorize a piecemeal sale during the second auction and the price will be
Outcome       piecemeal sale
                              decreased (Article 38 of the Law on Insolvency Proceedings). It is likely to be
                              difficult to find a buyer for the hotel as a going concern, therefore, the most
                                                     likely outcome is a piecemeal sale.

                                    It takes 2 years to complete liquidation proceedings in Georgia, because
                                 statutory deadlines are not always complied with. In particular, it may take a
                                year for the first meeting of the creditors to take place. As a first step, BizBank
                                 will commence liquidation proceedings with the Tbilisi City Court. The court
                                will review the materials and accept the case for consideration. Once the case
                                       is accepted, the National Enforcement Bureau will be appointed as a
                                 trustee/supervisor (Article 26 of the Law on Insolvency Proceedings) and the
                                     date for the first meeting of the creditors is set (Article 21 of the Law on
                                     Insolvency Proceedings). The trustee will inform the creditors about the
                               opening of the insolvency proceedings by publication, will assume control over
                                the management of the debtor company, examine its financials and prepare a

                                Proceedings). Creditors submit their claims, and then present them at the first
                                  meeting of the creditors. The judge makes a decision whether to accept or
                                    reject the claim after consulting with the trustee (Article 29 of the Law on
                                  Insolvency Proceedings). Conciliation Council will be appointed (the debtor
                                   and the creditors will each appoint one member and the two will elect the
                                      third member) (Article 32 of the Law on Insolvency Proceedings). The
                                  Conciliation Council will decide whether to proceed with liquidation or with
                                  reorganization (Article 33 of the Law on Insolvency Proceedings). Once the
                               decision to liquidate the debtor is made, the creditors will appoint a liquidation
                               manager (Article 37 of the Law on Insolvency Proceedings). Debtor's assets will
                                      be sold at an auction organized by the National Enforcement Bureau.

                                     Around 7% of the value of the estate will be paid to the National Bureau of

                                     the estate will be paid to the National Bureau of Enforcement acting as an
 Cost (% of

                                   30, 2010). Other expenses will include attorneys' fees and remuneration of the

does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance

business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
