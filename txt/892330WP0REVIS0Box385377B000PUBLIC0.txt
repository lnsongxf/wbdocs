   Box 2.1. Defining Active Citizenship
   The European Youth Forum, one of the world’s best established and most influential youth
   advocacy platforms, has defined active citizenship as a legal status and a role. A combination
   of specific attitudes and institutional arrangements must be in place for individuals to exercise
   “involvement, participation, and influence.” This definition of citizenship also encompasses an
   individual’s relations with others and the labor market, as well as questions of cultural iden-
   tity, given that individuals belong to and participate in many different communities—social,
   economic, and cultural. Citizenship defined as status in a political, legal, and social community
   is based on a set of legal rules that defines membership in the political community. These rules
   include legal rights—e.g., freedom of speech, thought, and religious belief, and the right to
   own property—as well as and political rights—e.g., the right to participate and exercise power.

    revolution’s icons. His song “Rais Lebled” (Head of State) is regarded as the “anthem” of the
    revolution.

       Since the revolution, rappers have continued to give voice to youth disillusionment. Along
    with journalists, many musicians fell afoul of the government elected in 2012. They continued
    criticizing police brutality, expressing their disappointment with the revolution, and advocat-

    The rapper Weld El 15 received a 21-month jail sentence in absentia on charges of performing
    songs deemed insulting to the police at a concert in the eastern town of Hammamet. After
    he surrendered to the authorities, he was retried and received a four-month sentence, against

         The IDMEJ Project: Investing in Youth Inclusion in
Box 2.3. 
         Lagging Regions
Project Design: Following the Tunisian Revolution, the Government of Tunisia launched the
IDMEJ youth project to strengthen youth inclusion, with the support of a grant by the World
Bank’s Japanese Social Development Fund. IDMEJ means “inclusion and cooperation” in
Arabic. The project provides a scalable alternative to existing public works programs. It pro-
motes youth-led community development and participation while providing participants with
small stipends.

   The project provides emergency income support and short-term employment to 3,000
youth with a secondary education or less—mostly youth who are not in education, employ-
ment, or training (NEETs)—in the disadvantaged governorates of Kasserine and Siliana in
the central-western region of Tunisia. Implemented by the National Youth Observatory, the
project combines skills training with community volunteering, apprenticeships, and self-em-
ployment opportunities. The project is relatively cost effective with a per capita beneficiary
cost of less than US$1,000, which could be further reduced through scaling up.

    Results: As part of the project, youth aged 15–29 receive training in life skills, including
financial literacy. Beneficiaries volunteer for up to five months in community projects man-
aged by local civil society organizations. Initial project results show that over 85 percent find
the training useful. New technical and social competencies were acquired by 76 percent and
80 percent of respondents, respectively. These positive results are in line with an assessment
of more than 200 international civil service programs, which exhibited an increase in work
skills, career options and education, as well as higher self-esteem and sense of civic responsi-
bility (McBride, Sherraden, and Benítez 2003). IDMEJ has indeed led to improved relations
between local youth nongovernmental organizations and local governments. Additional funds
have already been mobilized by local governments in the Siliana and Kasserine Governorates
to replicate and scale up this component based on its success on the ground. Overall, the proj-
ect benefits youth by helping to break the cycle of inactivity, supporting young women, and
promoting social inclusion and trust.

   Management and Monitoring and Evaluation: The project is supported by an innovative
cost-effective approach to monitoring and evaluation, using an online platform that allows
real-time data entry and analysis that is accessible by multiple stakeholders. The project
collects direct beneficiary feedback about the quality of services and their impact on employ-
ability via mobile phones.

  Box 2.4. Houkoumetna: The “Our Government” Movement
  The movement known as Youth Decides is calling for youth to play a full role in national poli-
  tics. The use of social media is central to its efforts. In December 2013, Tarec Cheniti, a human
  rights activist, nominated himself as prime minister by posting his resume on Facebook. Other
  young Tunisians soon followed suit, including Bassem Bouguerra, the president of Reform,
  an organization seeking to reform Tunisia’s police force. Bouguerra nominated himself as
  deputy minister for security reform. Soon, multiple “Youth Decides” subpages emerged on
  Facebook, with young Tunisians posting their resumes online and volunteering to be part of
  the government.

     The movement is a clear expression of the youth’s frustration at their lack of voice in the
  new political configuration. All of the prime ministers since the revolution were older than
  aged 50—one was 92-years-old. Rached Ghannouchi, the leader of the ruling Ennahdha party,
  is 72 years old, and Beji Caid Essebsi, the head of the opposition Nidaa Tounes party, is 87
  years old. Tunisian youth view the current political struggles as merely a resurgence of stale
  political ideologies and rivalries aligned with vested interests from the old regime.

     As Cheniti explained, “There are thousands of young Tunisian men and women who have
  gained enough education and experience to be able to run our country. These people deserve
  to be given a chance to lead the democratic transition because, after all, the revolution is
  theirs.” According to Bouguerra, “It’s about time that the youth started deciding for them-
  selves, instead of being used by older politicians for political interests.”

                society itself does not accept him, he is not part of the circle of society.

  the needs of all young people who have finished education and training and should be work-

  young people experiencing difficulties in transitioning from education to work life.

     NEET is important because it more comprehensively defines youth inactivity, which stan-
  dard unemployment statistics generally overlook. Inactive youth are those young men and
  women already discouraged from looking for work despite their young ages. Instead of ne-
  glecting these young people, the NEET indicator encourages policy makers to consider that
  discouraged young people require at least as much government support as the unemployed.
  Discouraged youth—often referred to as inactive youth—are particularly vulnerable. Inac-
  tive youth are the litmus test for the effectiveness of youth policies aimed at fostering social
  inclusion.

     NEET is a well-established concept. Many member countries of the Organisation for Eco-
  nomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and a growing number of developing countries
  are using the NEET indicator to complement youth unemployment statistics. It is systemati-
  cally measured by the International Labor Organization and presented in its annual flagship
  report, “Global Employment Trends for Youth” (ILO 2013). The OECD is also reporting
  NEET shares, and the organization has prominently applied the indicator in its recent “Afri-
  can Economic Outlook 2012,” which focused on promoting youth employment in Northern
  and Sub-Saharan Africa, including Tunisia (AfDB 2012a), and in the World Economic Fo-
  rum’s Global Youth Unemployment Study (WEF 2013). Recently, NEET was proposed by the
  United Nations High Level Panel to be used for the Post-2015 Development Goals (United
  Nations 2013). Originally coined by the government of the United Kingdom, the acronym
  “NEET” is used officially by statistical agencies in Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Spain,
  and South Korea. While more efforts are needed to measure NEET globally, most labor force
  surveys already include the required variables to establish reliable NEET rates.

  Box 4.1. Family Formation
  Some segments of Tunisian society perceive the possession of a degree from an institution of
  higher learning as a burden in several respects, especially among young women. These young
  women effectively become constrained by their own initiative and academic success because
  men may perceive women graduates as possessing more autonomy than is their lot in a pre-
  dominantly patriarchal culture and subsequently consider them inappropriate as potential
  wives. Furthermore, if the degree does not lead to employment, a young woman must return
  home to what, in some cases, is a mostly isolated life, particularly in the interior regions and
  in the south. Moreover, a woman’s sector of employment largely determines whether or not
  she remains suitable for marriage. Prevailing social norms permit a young woman to work as
  a nurse or teacher, but they preclude most other lines of work.

      Nevertheless, young Tunisian women believe that education and professional qualifications
  are significant assets for potential marriages as economic conditions make it progressively
  more difficult to manage households on single wages. The notion that both spouses can work
  is just as common among female nongraduates, who expressed the importance of contributing
  to household finances. In the words of one young woman “Life is even harder nowadays. It is
  necessary that both members of the couple work.”

      Employment status and educational credentials affect marriage prospects for young Tuni-
  sian men as well, albeit in a different way. On a societal level, many families would prefer that
  their daughters marry an employed man, regardless of his degree. Thus, unemployed male
  graduates possess little-to-no comparative advantage relative to unemployed nongraduates.
  The resultant lack of social status assigned to unemployed male graduates may dissuade po-
  tential couples from seeking an engagement for fear of being refused by the bride-to-be’s fam-
  ily, or worse, having the engagement broken off prematurely due to prolonged unemployment
  and intense pressure on the man to provide for his fiancée.

   Box 4.2. Education in Tunisia
   Basic Education.a Basic education from grades 1–9 is compulsory and is comprised of six
   years of primary education and three years of preparatory education, which is also referred
   to as lower secondary or middle school. At the end of grade six, students must score above
   50 percent on their exams to continue to middle school. Traditionally, many students have to
   repeat the sixth year of primary education, which has led to increased dropout rates after only
   six years of education. In the early 1990s, about one-fifth of young Tunisians had to repeat
   the sixth year, and while the rate of this repeating has gradually reduced over the past twenty
   years, it is still relatively high (8 percent in 2012) (Ministère de l’Education 2012). The official
   primary level dropout rate was 12 percent in 2000 and 6 percent in 2009 (World Bank 2009a).
   Those primary education students who cannot make it to the general preparatory education
   are offered the opportunity to access technical preparatory schools, which can lead either to
   secondary education or vocational training programs. At the end of the ninth year, additional
   dropouts occur because students must obtain the Basic Education Completion Diploma.

      Secondary Education.b Passing the ninth grade exam is required to enroll in the four years
   of secondary education from years 10–13 (previously 10–12). At the end of grade 11, second-
   ary education students have to choose between nine streams that focus on academic and spe-
   cialized studies. While these are meant to help students prepare to enter a university or to join
   the workforce, course content is mostly designed to prepare students to take the final exam of
   secondary education. Passing the final exam of secondary education is required to continue to
   public universities, as the exam is both a school-leaving and a university-entrance examina-
   tion.c Until 2000, some 60–70 percent of secondary students failed the final exam each year,
   an outcome related to a number of factors, including—but not limited to—those associated
   with the educational system and youth engagement. The improvements in the baccalaureat
   pass rates observed since 2000 (from 32 percent in 2000 to 64 percent in 2011) is mostly due
   to a change in the exam rules. The failure rate further highlights the fact that youth have not
   acquired sufficient knowledge to prepare them for employment.

                                                                                            continued

     Vocational Training. Three different types of technical training are open to students. Basic
  technical training is an alternative to secondary education and lasts two years.d The profes-

  years of practical training.e The advanced professional technical degree is available to voca-
  tional students by adding another two years of study to the advanced technical degree—i.e.,
  two years of secondary school plus four years of technical training.f By 2007, about 10 percent
  of Tunisian students were enrolled in a vocational training program (World Bank 2007b).

     Tertiary Education. Tunisia has rapidly expanded access to tertiary education during
  the past decade, currently enrolling over 35 percent of young Tunisians and spend-

  education used to be structured in three phases of two years each, but has recently been
  transformed toward the European and British system of Bachelor’s (3 years), Master’s

 Box 5.1. Online Platforms Najja7ni and Tounes Ta3mal
 The online platform “Tounes Ta3mal” offers a virtual career and entrepreneurship center for
 Tunisian youth. Co-funded by Silatech and Microsoft, this initiative is designed to provide
 Arab youth with resources ranging from online career guidance, employability and entre-
 preneurship education, work experience, and employment opportunities. Launched in Oc-
 tober 2013, the “Tounes Ta3mal” site (Tunis Works) offers free, ad-free access to more than
 600 e-learning courses available in Arabic, English, and French. Integration with the mobile
 “Najja7ni” service is underway to expand reach and access.

    Young users can register and engage with the platform by themselves. Silatech works to
 deploy the platform in the context of local partnerships with academic institutions, nongov-
 ernmental organizations, and other youth-serving organizations, including Tounes Ta3mal, as
 an integrated element of their youth programming. The resources on the platform complement
 and expand the services offered by these organizations to better address the needs of their
 youth. For example, career centers can use the online job-matching service to help students
 find relevant internships or jobs in their area. Other organizations have used e-learning con-
 tent on Tounes Ta3mal to design blended learning courses that rely on the platform for content
 but actually take place in the classroom.

    “Najja7ni mEmploi” is the region’s first mobile-based career center, offering employability
 support service that connects young people without Internet access to employability resources,
 financial inclusion, and job opportunities via basic mobile phones. Free services include career
 guidance, labor market and training opportunities, English-language learning, financial liter-
 acy, CV (resume) writing, self-awareness, and setting up businesses, among others. Quizzes,
 Short Message Service (SMS) alerts, and personality tests keep the user updated with informa-
 tion regarding vocational areas of work. They can also reach out to potential employers by
 posting a mini-CV with Najja7ni Employment.

    Najja7ni mEmploi’ is complemented by mEducation and mEnglish programs. Between
 these three initiatives, Najja7ni reaches almost one million registered users, although there
 may be some replication due to people subscribing to more than one service. The mEmploi
 service was relaunched with job-matching functionality in January 2014 and is in its first quar-
 ter of operation. It has already gained a registered user base of nearly 300,000, of which over
 200,000 used employability mLearning and 96,000 created mini-CVs to receive job alerts for
 about 2,500 jobs.

    The initiative is a partnership among Silatech, Tunisiana,a ProInvest, and EduPartage and
 works closely with youth-focused initiatives of the World Bank, the National Agency for Em-
 ployment and Independent Work (Agence Nationale de l’Emploi or ANETI), and Microsoft
 Citizenship. The initiative has won many global awards, including the Stevie Silver Award and
 the Global Telecom Business Innovation Award.

            Jovenes “Training Plus” Programs for Disadvantaged Youth
   Box 5.2. 
            in Latin America
   The Jovenes programs offer comprehensive training to unemployed and economically disad-
   vantaged youth, aged 16–29, to improve their human and social capital and employability.
   The demand-driven model has been implemented in eight Latin American countries, custom-
   ized to local contexts and labor markets.a Technical training and internship experiences with
   employers are combined with training in basic life skills and other support services to ensure
   the social integration and job readiness of beneficiaries. Private and public institutions con-
   tracted through public bidding mechanisms provide training and organize internships. The
   program targets the poor, with more than 60 percent of participants coming from low-income
   families, including early school-dropouts.

      Impact evaluations show that the programs increased the probability of beneficiaries find-
   ing employment after graduation, especially among young women. In Argentina, the program
   increased the probability of employment for young adult women (aged 21 and older) by about
   10 percentage points over a control group. In Chile, the program increased the probability of
   employment by 21 percentage points with strongly significant results for youth aged 21 and
   younger. In Argentina, the program increased monthly wages by about 10 percent over a con-
   trol group, with results more favorable for young males and adult females.

   Box 5.3. Youth Entrepreneurship Program in Peru
   The Programa de Calificación de Jóvenes Creadores de Microempresas provides assistance
   and training to youth in developing business plans and creating profitable businesses. The
   program is implemented by the Peruvian nongovernmental organization Colectivo Integral
   de Desarrollo and was started in 1999 as an initiative to counteract the significant lack of
   entrepreneurial skills among low-skilled young people. Its objective is to improve the earnings
   and quality of life of beneficiaries. The target population is economically disadvantaged young
   people aged 15–25 who own a small and/or informal business in operation for less than a year
   or who demonstrate entrepreneurial skills and reside in the targeted localities.

      The program offers different types of services. During the preparation phase, interested
   youth benefit from mentorship and training to prepare business plans that will be presented
   for selection. After selection, eligible youth or beneficiaries of the program are offered mentor-
   ship, training, and internship services. Program beneficiaries can also access microcredit. The
   program has been cost effective, with a beneficiary cost under US$1,000.

       Impact estimates suggest an increase of 7.8 percentage points in the probability of beneficia-
   ries having operating businesses and an 8 percent increase in average incomes. These estimates
   also show an increase of almost 40 percentage points in the probability of businesses operating
   for more than a year and an increase in earnings of 40 percentage points. An important sec-
   ondary effect is job creation. Beneficiaries employ 17.3 percent more workers than the control
   group, which consisted of interested but non-enrolled peers. Further evaluation and follow-up
   is needed to monitor the success of the program over a longer span—e.g., a follow-up on busi-
   nesses in operation for at least two years. Regarding its replication in other localities, increasing
   the program’s scale may actually hamper its effectiveness because the executing agency may
   not have sufficient capacity to offer the types and frequency of personalized services previously
   rendered to youth. The institutional capacity of the executing agency and/or of the institu-
   tions involved—as measured by personnel, knowledge, and types and frequency of services—is
   critical. Low frequency and low quality of services would dramatically reduce the program’s
   probability of success.

  Box 6.1. Eleven Principles of a National Youth Policy
  1.	 Nonformal learning: Encourage active learning outside of the formal education sys-
      tem—e.g., life skills, foreign language training, and technical skills—through open and
      inclusive youth nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).

  2.	 Youth training policy: Promote the development of good trainers in the youth sector, a
      prerequisite for the formation of effective youth NGOs.

  3.	 Youth legislation: Draft legislation that includes youth NGOs in policy decision making
      and that ensures the efficiency of government institutions working on youth issues.

  4.	 Youth budget: Allocate an administrative budget and project grants to youth organizations.

  5.	 Youth information policy: Inform young people about opportunities that exist for them
      and ensure communication among all stakeholders in youth policy and transparency in the
      conduct of youth policy.

  6.	 Multilevel policy: Outline youth policies to be implemented at both the national and local
      levels.

  7.	 Youth research: Regularly identify the key issues for youth well-being, the best practices in
      addressing these issues, and the potential role of youth NGOs.

  8.	Participation: Support the active involvement of youth organizations in the design and
     implementation of youth policies.

  9.	 Interministerial cooperation: Implement youth policies in a cross-sectoral manner, en-
      suring joint ministerial responsibility, possibly through a designated youth coordinating
      agency.

  10.	Innovation: Stimulate creative and innovative solutions to youth problems.

  11.	Youth advisory bodies: Establish structures—e.g., consultative committees with a mandate
      to influence government on youth issues.
