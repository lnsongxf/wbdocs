  *As of August 31, 2015


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The project is designed to improve access to finance, including long-term finance, for SMEs in Sri Lanka affected by the global financial crisis. The core components
are a Financing and Risk Sharing Facility ($41 million), and policy and capacity enhancement for SME banking ($16.4 million). The project underwent a restructuring
in June 2013, to address the following: (i) reallocating funds among the project’s components; (ii) revising the results framework accordingly; and (ii) extending the
closing date by 18 months from March 31, 2014, to September 30, 2015. The project objectives remained unchanged.
This project also has fostered policy dialogue with the government in enhancing financial sector development and has supported the Collateral Registry and Credit
Information Bureau, an initiative backed by IFC.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
As of March 25, 2015, approximately $36.07 million has been disbursed by the eight partner financial institutions (PFIs) to 743 SMEs, yielding an average loan size
of $60,000. The majority of the loans disbursed to SMEs (80 percent) are longer-term (greater than 36 months) maturity loans. Banks have provided training to 7,483
staff and 12,355 SMEs, bringing the total of direct beneficiaries of the training program under the project to over 20,000. Training for SMEs has focused on business
development services and accounting, and more recently on entrepreneurship skills and financial literacy. Technical assistance to PFIs has allowed them to incorporate
environmental and social safeguards policies in the credit appraisal process, and strengthen SME banking risk management.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Higher Education for the Twenty First Century project supports the development of the higher education sector in Sri Lanka, including university education and
     short-cycle vocational higher education. The project aims to enhance the capacity of the higher education system, institutions, and human resources, to deliver quality
     higher education services in line with equitable social and economic development needs. The project comprises four components:
     ■■     Institutionalizing norms for higher education: Developing the institutional foundation of the country’s higher education sector through the establishment of a
            qualification framework covering the higher education and training sectors, plus development of a quality assurance system to cover the entire higher education
            sector.
     ■■     Promoting relevance and quality of teaching and learning: Providing university development grants to improve the social and economic relevance of university
            education, as well as quality and innovation grants to improve the performance of strategically selected study programs.
     ■■     Strengthening alternative higher education: Modernizing the Sri Lanka Institute for Advanced Technological Education and its network of Advanced Technological
            Institutes (ATI) through curriculum and management reforms, and expanding the coverage of the ATI to under-served areas to provide more equitable access to
            alternative higher education.
     ■■     Human resource development, monitoring, evaluation, studies, coordination and communication: Strengthening the human resource and organizational capac-
            ity of the higher education sector, including the qualifications of academic staff of higher education institutions, while also supporting monitoring and evalua-
            tion, policy analyses, and dissemination.


     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     ■■     A Sri Lanka Qualification Framework covering all stages of education and training has been developed and adopted. The higher education institutions are imple-
            menting the stages of the Qualification Framework ranging from bachelor’s degrees to Ph.Ds.
     ■■     A Quality Assurance Framework covering public and private higher education institutions has been prepared. Implementation has been competed in 80 percent
            of universities to date.
     ■■     University Development Grants to improve the English, information technology and soft skills of students have been implemented in all universities.
     ■■     Quality and Innovation Grants are under implementation in 55 study programs, exceeding the project target of 51.
     ■■     There are over 15,000 students enrolled in the ATIs, surpassing the project target of 11,000 students at the present stage. Modernized curricula have been
            introduced in all 12 ATIs.
     ■■     Over 200 university and Sri Lanka Institute for Advanced Technological Education academics are pursuing Master’s or Ph.D degree programs, exceeding the
            project target of 100.
     ■■     Short-term professional development activities have benefited about 4,500 university administrators and managers, academics, and technical and support staff.
     ■■     Employment and employer studies conducted under the project show improvement in the employability of graduates, and that employers provide positive
            feedback about many types of graduates.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Transforming the School Education System as the Foundation of a Knowledge Hub Project aims to enhance equitable access and quality of primary and secondary
education to provide a foundation for the knowledge-based economic and social development of the country. The project is organized under three components: (i)
promoting access to primary and secondary education; (ii) improving the quality of education; and (iii) strengthening governance and delivery of education services.
These are aligned with the themes of the government of Sri Lanka’s Education Sector Development Framework and Program for 2012-2016.
This $100 million project is helping the government to strengthen the country’s education system at multiple levels, including national and provincial educational
agencies, but especially schools. Several innovative reforms are being supported, including the establishment of a system for conducting national assessments of
learning outcomes, school-based management, and school-based teacher development.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
■■     The survival rate of students through grade 11 is 85 percent (88 percent for girls and 82 percent for boys).
■■     National assessment of learning outcomes of children at grade 8 were completed in 2012 and 2014, and at grade 4 in 2013.
■■     Schools in 44 percent of zones (4,509 schools) had completed the school-based management (PSI) program by December 2014. Schools in another 35 percent of zones (3,559
       schools) are implementing the PSI cycle in 2015.
■■     School-based teacher development programs (SBTD) had been conducted in 44 percent of education zones by the end of 2014. About 140,000 teachers (63
       percent of all teachers) had benefited from these programs. A further 35 percent of zones are (3,559 schools) are implementing SBTD in 2015.
■■     Approximately 79 zones (81 percent of zones) and their divisions have been strengthened through human resource development of staff, the construction and/
       or renovation of office space, and the provision of equipment and technology.
■■     The number of direct project beneficiaries is about 3 million students at present. The share of female beneficiaries is around 52 percent.

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
 As a lower middle-income country, Sri Lanka has achieved remarkable progress in maternal and child health and communicable disease outcomes, as indicated by its
 maternal mortality rate of 32.5 per 100,000 live births, infant mortality rate of 9.7 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy at birth of 75 years. Today, Sri Lanka is seeing
 the effects of demographic and epidemiological transitions -- an aging population, increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases, both chronic (diabetes, cancers,
 cardio-vascular diseases, mental health issues etc.) and acute (mainly injuries). The country continues to face emerging and re-emerging communicable diseases like
 tuberculosis, leptospirosis, dengue, and influenza. Furthermore, malnutrition among mothers and children has not improved adequately, with 17.9 percent of babies
 delivered each year born at a low birth-weight, and 18 percent of children under-five stunted. Fifty percent of outpatient, 95 percent of in-patient, and 99 percent of
 preventive-care needs of the country are provided by the public health system. The private health sector mainly provides outpatient care services, with expanding roles in
 in-patient, investigative, and laboratory services, largely in urban and semi-urban areas. The Ministry of Health finalized the National Health Development Plan under the
 guidance of the government’s national development strategy to improve the health sector to meet middle-income country standards.

 The Second Health Sector Development Project supports the implementation of the government’s National Health Development Plan. It aims to upgrade the standards of
 performance of the public health system and enable it to better respond to the challenges of malnutrition and non-communicable disease. More specifically, the project
 supports the implementation of interventions prioritized under the National Health Development Plan for: (i) addressing malnutrition: (ii) improving prevention and control
 of non-communicable diseases: and (iii) improving health systems. Funds are disbursed as budget support linked to agreed results achieved over the given period. The
 project also supports innovation, results monitoring, and capacity building in the health sector. A core team will be involved with monitoring and support, training, workshops,
 testing of innovative ideas, operational research, demographic and health surveys, base-line and end-line surveys and disbursement linked indicators’ results reporting.

 KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
 This project supports the implementation of 20 results (a subset of the National Health Development Plan results). So far, in the second year of implementation, the six
 project development objective indicators met or surpassed their targets for 2014 and progress against intermediate results indicators is also positive. Of particular note:
 ■■     Forty two percent (1,627) of the 3,883 Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinics across the country were supported to reach full capacity to provide MCH services, meet-
        ing the target set for the year,; 216 Medical Officer of Health areas out of 330 have at least three health and nutrition community support groups, surpassing the target.
 ■■     Forty nine percent (164) of the 330 Medical Officer of Health areas reported having at least two functioning Healthy Lifestyle Centers, surpassing the year-end target.
 ■■     National guidelines for rehabilitation services for disabled persons are developed.
 ■■     Forty three percent (371) of the 855 primary health care facilities have one-month buffer stock of 16 essential NCD drugs, surpassing the target.;.
 ■■     The percentage of hospitals linked to the quality assurance program for laboratory tests conducted by the Medical Research Institute surpassed the target, reaching
        94 percent in 2014.
 ■■     The tuberculosis case detection rate is 66 percent for 2014.
 ■■     Guidelines for quality management units have been prepared and training for administration of the guidelines has been completed, with Quality Management Units
        functional in more than 30 percent of secondary care hospitals.
 ■■     Nearly 30 percent of hospitals are reporting indoor morbidity and mortality data electronically in 2014, surpassing the target.
 ■■     Implementation of the Environmental Management Framework has commenced well, with 10 hospitals progressing with the procedure of obtaining Environmental
        Protection Licenses and Scheduled Waste Licenses. Obtaining these two licenses ensures availability of a safe sewerage disposal system, clinical waste management,
        and environment cleanliness.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Dams are part of the essential hydraulic infrastructure to store water for Sri Lanka’s irrigation, hydropower, and domestic and industrial water supply needs, as well
as to provide flood control. At present, about 85 percent of the developed water resources are used for irrigation in the dry zone, which covers nearly two-thirds of the
country. The dam network in Sri Lanka comprises over 270 medium and 80 large dams. Due to lack of maintenance over time, the dams pose an escalating public
safety threat. Many large dams are ageing and suffer from various structural deficiencies and shortcomings in operation and monitoring facilities, requiring urgent
attention. In addition, the country is in need of a “Dam Safety Secretariat” that would routinely monitor the performance and status of each dam.
This project, comprising an original credit and additional financing aims to: (i) establish long-term sustainable arrangements for the operation and maintenance of
large dams; and (ii) improve water-resources planning. More specifically, the project will: enhance public safety of 62 high-risk large dams through rehabilitation
and modernization; improve the basic facilities (roads, lighting, etc.) of 80 dams (including 32 high-risk dams); and establish sustainable institutional arrangements
for dam safety management and operation and maintenance. The project provides for the implementation of Livelihood Assistance Plans to assist communities at
seven dams where the reservoir has to be emptied in order to carry out the work. The project also sets out to enhance the institutional capacity, as well as the physical
and analytical infrastructure, for monitoring hydro-meteorological data, detecting and forecasting water hazards, and water resources planning and management.
Around 140 hydrometric stations will be established and upgraded, along with the establishment of a database at the Irrigation Department and establishment of a
groundwater monitoring system. The project will also help to strengthen the institutional capacity for integrated and multi-sector water resources planning, and assist
in the selection and prioritization of water resources development investments. The additional financing will support the rehabilitation of a number of dams in the
Northern and Eastern Provinces that could not be included in the original project due to conflict in the area at that time.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
The original credit of the project was fully disbursed and closed at the end of June 2015. Work at 28 high-risk dams has been completed. The rehabilitation and
modernization of seven dams is ongoing, while the preparation for the remaining 27 dams is at different stages, with some ready for procurement while others are at
design stage. Remaining Livelihood Support Assistance is expected for up to 7,400 families at three dams. The information, education, and communication campaigns
have been completed at two dams and baseline surveys have started. Although the proposed secretariat for dam safety, named “National Center for Dam Safety” is
still under consideration by government, its operation is expected to start by giving part-time additional charge to a few experienced staff in the Ministry of Mahaweli
Development and Environment. A total of 72 of about 140 hydro-meteorological stations have been completed and are transmitting data. Equipment for 50 stations is
already in the country, as is the stock of spare parts. The National Water Use Plan, the updated Mahaweli Water Resources Development Plan, and the river basin plan
for the Mundeni Aru River have been completed. The Secretary Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment is expected to submit a cabinet memorandum to
obtain approval of these three water resources plans.

KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
Implementing agencies include the Ministry of Irrigation and Agriculture, the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, the Ceylon Electricity Board, and
the Water Resources Board.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The IDA has moved swiftly to support Sri Lanka’s government as it implements the three main pillars of its short- to medium-term development plans for the Eastern
     and Northern Provinces. The recovery and community livelihoods projects cover infrastructure essential to recovery as well as the restoration of livelihoods in selected
     areas. There are, however, significant needs with respect to improving local capacity to effectively maintain and create local public goods and services for all conflict-
     affected citizens. As a complementary piece of the overall package, the North East Local Services Improvement Project addresses those needs, further helping to lay
     the foundation for long-term socioeconomic development of the two provinces. The project is designed to improve the delivery of local infrastructure services (such as
     rural roads, drinking water supply, drainage and waste disposal) by local authorities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces in an accountable and responsive manner.
     More specifically, the project aims to: (i) improve the quantity and quality of public goods delivered and maintained by local authorities; (ii) ensure that local authorities
     undertake public expenditures and deliver local services in a transparent and accountable manner; (iii) strengthen service delivery systems and build the capacity of
     local authorities to deliver their mandated services, as well as strengthen the monitoring capacities of the provincial and national level institutions; (iv) establish a
     comprehensive monitoring system, evaluate technical and social audits and prepare citizen scorecards and other needed analysis; and (v) support the key agencies
     at the central, provincial and local levels that are involved in the day-to-day management of the project to procure necessary consultant, equipment and operational
     support for the smooth implementation of the project.

     Additional IDA financing to the project that would cover a financing gap was approved in August 2015. Together with a DFAT grant, it will help to consolidate
     achievements in local service delivery in the country.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     ■■   Six hundred eleven km of inter-connective rural roads, 23 km of flood storm drainages, four rural water supply schemes, 400 common assets (such as markets,
          parks, playgrounds and cemeteries), and nine rural electrification schemes have been completed.
     ■■   Seventy percent of capital grants released against allocations.
     ■■   Eighty seven percent increased satisfaction of local people regarding local authorities.
     ■■   Seventy five percent of local authorities preparing annual financial statements within three months of closure.
     ■■   Seventy five percent acceptable financial audits of accounts.
     ■■   Forty five percent of local authorities with budgets prepared in a participatory manner.
     ■■   Seventy nine percent of local authorities whose revenues, expenditures and procurement decisions are publically disclosed.

 *As of August 31, 2015

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Sri Lanka needs competitive and dynamic cities to reach its aspiration of becoming an upper-middle-income economy. In particular, Sri Lanka needs to tap the
competitive advantages of the Colombo Metropolitan Region to accelerate growth. The CMR will continue to generate much of the capital, human resources,
technology and services needed for growth in the rest of the country. While the CMR covers only about 6 percent of the country’s total land area and is home to 28
percent of its population, it accounts for about 45 percent of national GDP and 80 percent of industrial value added. It is the country’s major urban agglomeration
and is growing faster than any other in Sri Lanka. A number of obstacles are preventing the CMR from realizing its full economic potential. These include: inadequate
infrastructure and services; significant vulnerability to flooding, the impacts of which are being exacerbated by climate change and sea-level rise; and poorly designed
and maintained drainage. In addition, limited financial and human resources available to local authorities, combined with their lack of coordination, hinder effective
delivery, and operation and maintenance of local infrastructure services. integrated planning, management and coordination at the metropolitan level are virtually
nonexistent. The project aims to support the government in reducing flooding in the catchment of the Colombo Water Basin, and strengthen the capacity of local
authorities in the Colombo Metropolitan Area to rehabilitate, improve and maintain local infrastructure and services through selected demonstration investments. The
project includes a component on flood and drainage management and one focused on strengthening strategic planning processes at the metropolitan level. This is
in addition to supporting local authorities to rehabilitate and manage streets and drainage infrastructure, and improve local public facilities and other urban services.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
■■   Early intermediary results achieved include improved coordination between central agencies and local authorities and among local authorities within the metro-
     politan area, and institutionalization of metropolitan level coordination agencies, such as the Metropolitan Wetland Management Department and the Colombo
     Metropolitan Unit of the Urban Development Authority. The project answered a presidential request to identify solutions to a Solid Waste Management emergency
     for the Colombo Metropolitan Area, and supported a feasibility study for a new engineered landfill for the metropolitan region.
■■   Good progress has been achieved in strengthening on-the-job capacities of local authorities in CMR, particularly in the areas of procurement, contract management
     for municipal roads, coordination with utilities, use of high quality design, and quality and safety standards of municipal roads.
■■   The large and most complex flood-reduction works (both from the engineering and safeguard points of view) are under preparation by the Sri Lanka Land Recla-
     mation and Development Corporation. The major technical assistance and feasibility studies necessary for the implementation of the flood and drainage manage-
     ment component are in place, although implementation has been delayed by the need for adjustments as a result of hydraulic modeling.
■■   The following results are anticipated from the project: (i) reduction in the area under risk of flooding (25-28-year return period) in the project area; and (ii) a 20 per-
     cent increase in the total urban roads maintained by the project local authorities that are in good and fair condition (indicating improved capacity of local authorities
     in operation and maintenance of critical municipal infrastructure).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project aims to expand the supply of skilled and employable workers by increasing access to quality and labor market–relevant training programs. It supports
     implementation of the government’s Skills Sector Development Program (SSDP) for 2014-2020. The project is comprised of two components:
     ■■   Under Component 1, the result–based funding component, the project supports three closely related types of interventions: (i) strengthening governance and
          management; (ii) enhancing the quality and relevance of training; and (iii) increasing access to training opportunities. Several innovative reforms are being
          supported under the project, including establishment of Industry Sector Skills Councils, introduction of performance-based funding for public training provides,
          introduction of employment-linked training programs to increase employer involvement in design and delivery of training programs, strengthening the monitor-
          ing and evaluation system of the skills sector, and improving labor-market information systems.
     ■■   Under Component 2, an innovation, results monitoring, and capacity development component, the project will help to strengthen implementation, coordination,
          and the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development, an implementing ministry.
     The IDA credit will be complemented by a $100 million loan from the ADB (through parallel financing). The ADB operation uses a Performance for Results lending
     instrument to finance the implementation of the government’s program. Both operations will rely on common institutional and implementation arrangements,
     including a set of similar disbursement-linked indicators and M&E arrangements, to ensure close harmonization.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     The project, which became effective in October 2014, is expected to achieve the following key results:
     ■■   Increase the number of trainees enrolled in public and private training institutions;
     ■■   Improve the completion rate of trainees enrolled in public training institutions;
     ■■   Improve the average earnings of graduates in skills development programs relative to earnings of GCE-O level graduates;
     ■■   Increase employer satisfaction with graduates from training institutions.

 *As of August 31, 2015

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
A well-functioning and productive system of urban centers is essential for catalyzing and supporting the transformation of the Sri Lankan economy and efforts to
translate economic growth into poverty reduction. A holistic, integrated and multi-sector approach is needed to improve the overall functions, competitiveness and
livability of these cities as well as strengthening the urban-rural linkages. This project will apply this approach and focus on the two key rapidly growing city regions in
the country, Kandy and Galle. The project’s overarching aim is to improve select urban services and public urban spaces in Kandy and Galle.

The project is comprised of three components: Component 1, encompassing interventions in Kandy City Region; Component 2, which focuses on interventions in
Galle City Region; and Component 3, which provides implementation support. In each city region, the project will target two broad categories of strategic investments:
(i) integrated urban services improvement -- with system-wide basic services improvement to enhance the functional aspects of the city; and (ii) public urban spaces
enhancement – with catalytic urban upgrading efforts to enhance the attractiveness and livability of the city. Specifically, the project in Kandy will focus on improving
deteriorated municipal infrastructure and services, such as traffic and public transport, water supply system, and major public urban spaces that will benefit local
residents as well as the commuting population coming to Kandy as a regional hub. Galle will see a reduction of flood inundation within the designated project area
and provision of public spaces for citizens.

The World Bank is leading the programmatic dialogue with the government of Sri Lanka regarding overall support to the national-level system of cities strengthening.
Going beyond Kandy and Galle, the Bank has recently been engaged with a preliminary diagnostic for urban development and rural-urban linkage in the Jaffna
Peninsula, consisting of the Jaffna Municipal Council as the capital of Northern Province and other semi-urban and agriculture areas. The outputs of this diagnostic
will serve as key inputs to the national level program, and will be crucial for identifying and tackling key development challenges in the Northern part of the country.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
The following are among the key results expected to be achieved:
■■   Improved urban services in Kandy, with 320,000 people expected to benefit from improved basic services by the end of the project.
■■   Improved urban services in Galle, and a reduction in area at risk of flood inundation within the designated project area in Galle (10-year return period flood for
     major canals and 5-year return period for local drainage).
■■   Access to enhanced public urban spaces in Kandy and Galle, through new or rehabilitated urban public spaces and pedestrian sidewalks and pathways.

KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
In order to realize the vision of a system of cities, the government of Sri Lanka has initiated a national-level program – the Strategic Cities Program – to manage the
development of strategic cities and to ensure a consistent and coherent approach in developing key cities. The Bank and government have embarked on the first phase
of development to support this program – the Strategic Cities Development Project, focused on Kandy and Galle, while other key development partners are focusing
on other secondary cities. The ADB is preparing for integrated urban development for Trincomalee, and the French development agency (AFD) is considering support
for Anuradhapura.

      *As of August 31, 2015

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project aims to reduce the vulnerability of exposed people and assets to climate risk and to improve the government’s capacity to respond effectively to disasters.
     These objectives will be achieved through evidence-based investment planning and urgent risk mitigation measures. The project has two main components.
     The first component ($13 million) will provide for analytical work and long-term basin development planning. The second component ($90 million) will involve
     urgent rehabilitation investment to increase the country’s resilience to climate risks. The project also has two additional components: $5 million to support project
     implementation and $2 million to provide flexible funding to help the country to recover from a flood event that occurs over the course of project implementation.

     Given the current lack of understanding of the multi-sector impacts of climate change, flood/drought modeling and scenario analysis work is required. This will be
     achieved through detailed flood and drought modeling and design of long-term sustainable mitigation interventions. Once completed, a larger climate resilience
     investment program would be identified and financed through multiple funding sources. Key line ministries would be brought together in the assessment of risks or
     impacts on particular sectors and an investment road map would be developed. This roadmap would be financed through follow-on investments from the World Bank
     and other development partners, as well as the government of Sri Lanka.
     While there is a lack of understanding of comprehensive climate and disaster risk, there are urgent climate risk mitigation investments required to ensure the short-
     term integrity of flood control and irrigation infrastructure, the transport network and critical education facilities at risk. Given the impacts of floods and landslides in
     the North Central, North Western, Central, and Eastern provinces in recent years, urgent investment is required to implement the immediate risk-mitigation activities.

     The overarching goal of this project is to provide an entry point for longer term, larger-scale investment and policy dialogue on climate and disaster resilience. The CRIP
     was approved, alongside a $102 million Development Policy Loan (DPL) with Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO) designed to increase fiscal resilience
     in the short term through a line of credit to be used in case of a disaster, and with associated technical assistance.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     A total of approximately 11.5 million people living and working in districts where these projects will be implemented are considered to be the indirect beneficiaries
     of this investment. The total direct beneficiaries from all the components of the project are estimated to be 450,000 spread out among 15 districts. Approximately 48
     percent of the beneficiaries will be women. The key results are expected to include:
     ■■   Development of nine basin investment plans that are based on an integrated understanding of climate risk.
     ■■   Decrease in expected annual flood loss across 123,000 hectares (10 percent of the arable land).
     ■■   Some 720,000 fewer people at high risk to climate-related transport interruptions.
     ■■   Reduced landslide risk at 18 schools, serving 25,000 students.

     KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
     This is a multi-sector project, being implemented by three line ministries and four departments. The project is being implemented through the Ministry of Irrigation
     and Water Resources Management, with support from the Ministry of Ports and Highways and the Ministry of Disaster Management. Participating implementation
     agencies include the Irrigation Department, the Mahaweli Authority, the National Building Research Organization, and the Road Development Authority.

     Japan is a key development partner under this program. The technical assistance that supports this program is financed by the government of Japan through the Tokyo
     Hub of the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery.

 *As of August 31, 2015

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The CAT DDO aims to strengthen the government’s fiscal resilience to natural disasters. This will be achieved by providing immediate liquidity to the government in
the event of a disaster within a policy framework designed to improve the government’s overall capacity to implement its disaster risk management program. The
government will be able to access funds from the facility upon declaring a state of emergency following an adverse natural event. The funds may be drawn down
over a three-year period, which may be renewed up to four times for a total of 15 years. The signing of the CAT DDO was contingent upon Sri Lanka developing a
comprehensive disaster management program.

The development policy loan with a CAT DDO instrument is designed to be a quick and flexible source of financing. The instrument is particularly well placed to provide
bridge financing while other sources of funding (for example, bilateral aid and reconstruction loans) are being mobilized following a state of emergency. The financial
features are similar to those available for the Deferred Drawdown Option for Development Policy Loans (DDO DPLs), with one exception: the DPL with a CAT DDO will
have a revolving feature; that is, amounts repaid prior to the closing date will be available for subsequent drawdown.

The overarching goal of this project is to provide an entry point for longer-term, larger-scale investment and policy dialogue on climate and disaster resilience. While
the CAT DDO will help to manage contingent fiscal risk in the short-term, technical assistance will be provided to the government to develop a series of financial
instruments to manage the long term liabilities associated with disaster risk. Parallel to the risk-financing instruments, physical investments will be financed under
CRIP to address both short-term system weaknesses and to increase the long-term resilience.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
This DPL with a CAT DDO will facilitate three key prior actions needed to operationalize the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Policy and National Disaster Management
Plan (NDMP), and will, in addition, foster improved data sharing within and outside government as a key tool for better disaster risk management. The prior actions are:
■■     Improved Institutional Capacity for Disaster Risk Management and Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI). This is being achieved by
       the first prior action: the adoption of a national policy and program on the management of disasters. This will be measured through the: (i) completion of fiscal
       disaster risk assessment; (ii) development of a national DRFI strategy; and (iii) issuance of a government circular on use of policies and guidelines on physical
       planning, resettlements, and local governance for disaster risk management.
■■      Increased capacity to ensure climate resilient development. This will be achieved by the second prior action: the approval of the National Disaster Man-
       agement Plan. This will be measured through: (i) nine basin-wide risk mitigation investment plans; (ii) guidelines issued on slope angles in new road construc-
       tion; and (iii) approval of a national monitoring framework to measure implementation of the Comprehensive Disaster Management Plan.
■■     Improved application of disaster information in policy making and development planning. This will be achieved by the third prior action: approval
       of the proposal to establish a steering committee to monitor the national program for the common use and sharing of spatial data and information. This will be
       measured through: (i) a geospatial-data-sharing platform established to share disaster risk information among relevant stakeholders; (ii) disaster risk profiles
       available at a national level and shared; and (iii) line ministries and agencies accessing the data-sharing platform

KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
This is a multi-sector project, being implemented by three line ministries and four departments. The project is being implemented through the Ministry of Finance
and Planning, and the Ministry of Disaster Management. Japan is a key development partner under this program. The Data Risk Financing and Insurance program that
supports this program is financed by the government of Japan through the GFDRR Tokyo Hub.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Sri Lanka has around 17,000 early childhood development (ECD) centers serving approximately 513,000 children in the 3-5 year age group. Evidence from a national
     survey of ECD centers indicates that less than half of them meet basic requirements for ECD instructional quality. The coverage of ECD services is also low, with only 65
     percent of the children in the 3-5 age group enrolled in ECD centers. ECD provision in Sri Lanka is largely dependent on the non-state sector, and public expenditure
     on ECD is significantly lower than that the expenditures in other middle-income countries. Recognizing the importance of the role of ECD in achieving the country’s
     long-term development goals, the government of has decided to increase its support to the sector through the Early Childhood Development Project, with the objective
     of enhancing equitable access to and improving the quality of ECD services across the country.
     The project is organized under two components: (i) expanding and strengthening the delivery of ECD services, and (ii) project management, and monitoring and
     evaluation. Recognizing that ECD services are provided primarily by non-state ECD centers, the project provides support to both state- and non-state managed ECD
     centers. The key activities in the project focus on improving the quality of ECD provision, expanding equitable access to ECD services, and improving the quality of
     ECD services in the plantation sector. In order to enhance the quality of ECD provision, the project supports quality management, facility improvement of ECD centers,
     training of ECD teachers and teacher assistants, and the training of trainers and government staff working in the ECD sector. It supports both supply- and demand-
     side interventions to enhance access to ECD services Such interventions include awareness programs, fee waivers to ECD center students from poor households, and
     establishment or extension of facilities in un-served and underserved areas. The design of the components and activities under the project draws upon the findings
     and recommendations from an ECD study conducted by the World Bank in FY2013/14.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     It is expected that, by the end of the project period, the following key results will have been achieved:
     ■■     661,150 children enrolled in ECD centers (Girls: 327,400).
     ■■     3,500 ECD centers in total and 550 ECD centers in plantations will have met national quality standards.
     ■■     5,000 ECD centers will have started conducting annual child development assessments.
     ■■     6,000 ECD centers will have received facility improvement grants, and teaching-learning material packages.
     ■■     500 ECD trainers will have completed training of trainers.
     ■■     6,000 ECD teachers and teacher assistants will have completed standardized short-term training.
     ■■     350 government staff will have completed standardized short-term training.
     ■■     25,000 poor children will have received tuition fee support to attend ECD centers.
     ■■     185 centers will have been established in unserved/underserved areas.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The government of Sri Lanka aims to provide access to safe drinking water for all its citizens, and is focused in particular on increasing the quality of service. Its medium-
term target is to increase piped water coverage from the current 45 percent to 60 percent by 2020. Improving water supply, sanitation and hygiene behavior are central
to progressing on the Millennium Development Goal for malnutrition and child mortality.
The Government set up a new department in September 2014, the Department of National Community Water Supply (DNCWS), with responsibility for ensuring the
long term sustainability of community water supply systems. The DNCWS is still in its infancy and needs support and capacity building to fully define and deliver its
envisaged role. The country is also increasingly focused on sustainable service delivery in the estate plantation sector, where access to water and sanitation services is
lower and poverty is higher than the national average.

This project aims to increase access to piped water services and improved sanitation in selected districts. It also seeks to help strengthen the capacity of associated
institutions. The project focuses on addressing the long term sustainability of water supply schemes managed by Community-Based Organizations (CBOs),
strengthening institutions involved in service delivery in the rural and estate sectors. The project will also support the systematic use of monitoring and evaluation data
to assess and enhance the performance of all CBOs and operations of the water supply schemes in rural and estate sub-sectors. Focused in particular on supporting the
country’s lagging regions, the project covers the following seven districts: Mullaithivu and Kilinochchi districts in Northern Province; Nuwara Eliya district in Central
Province; Badulla and Monoregala districts in Uva Province; and Kegalle and Ratnapura districts in Sabaragamuwa Province. The selection of the seven high priority
districts was based on three criteria: (i) percentage of people with access to unimproved/unsafe water; (ii) percentage of households with access to non-piped water
sources; and (iii) districts located in dry zones.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
Around 450,000 people are expected to benefit under the project from improved access to safe piped water, contributing to the Government’s national target of
increasing piped water coverage from the current 45 percent to 60 percent by 2020. The results of this project will be measured by monitoring the following indicators:
a)	   Direct project beneficiaries, including percentage of female beneficiaries;
b)	   People provided with access to “Improved Water Sources” (Urban), including female percentage;
c)	   People provided with access to “Improved Water Sources” (Rural + Estates), including female percentage;
d)	   People provided with access to “Improved Sanitation” (Rural + Estates), including female percentage;
e)	   A populated and functioning rural water supply and sanitation monitoring and evaluation system; and
The increase in the proportion of fully functioning CBOs

KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
Implementing agencies include the Ministry of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage; National Water Supply and Drainage Board; Department of National
Community Water Supply; Plantation Human Development Trust; Regional Plantation Companies; and targeted Communities.
