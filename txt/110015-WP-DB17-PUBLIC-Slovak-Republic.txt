This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

      connection and in addition, for the excavation of the road, prior consent
      of the road administrator (usually a municipality) is required.

      In case of a simple hook up customer needs to buy material only for
      his/her share of the grid (that begins behind the off-take point of the
      connection/electrometer).

      The material is available more than 50% of the time.

      expert who is hired by the warehouse owner, inspects the electricity
      wiring in the building, prepares a report and the report is then submitted
      to the Office for inspection of the safety. The Office for inspection of the
      safety issues its statement on the status of the electricity wiring in the
      building and this statement is then submitted by the warehouse owner

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                  commencement and notice is published in the Commercial Journal and an
                                insolvency representative who prepared the opinion is appointed as trustee.
                                  Creditors shall submit proofs of debt within 30 days of the approval of the
                               restructuring. Within 10 days after the deadline of the submission of proofs of
                                    debt, the trustee prepares a list of creditors. Then the 30-day period for
                              rejection of claims runs after the deadline of the submission of proofs of debt.
                              The trustee convenes the first Creditors´ Meeting (which is to elect a Creditors’
                                 Committee) within 30 days of the court´s approval of the restructuring. The
                               meeting should take place between the second and the seventh day after the
                                 deadline for the rejection of proofs of debt. The restructuring plan is being

                               approval within 90 days of the approval of the restructuring by the court. This
                                deadline may be extended by 150 days. A creditors´ committee may ask the
                                debtor or trustee to modify the plan within 15 days of receipt. If the CC does
                                   not approve the plan, the trustee has to file for bankruptcy. If the plan is
                                   approved by the CC, the Approving Creditors´ Meeting votes on the plan
                                within 30 days from the receipt of the request to vote on the plan. Then the
                              court approves the plan within 25 days of its approval by Approving Creditors´
                                   Meeting. Again, the court may reject the plan and then the proceeding is
                              converted into bankruptcy. In its decision on the declaration of bankruptcy, the
                                      court also appoints the trustee and the decision is published in the
                                Commercial Journal. Creditors submit proofs of claim to the trustee and the
                                court within 45 days of the declaration of bankruptcy. The trustee convenes
                                 the first Creditors´ Meeting within 55 days of the declaration of bankruptcy.
                               The meeting should take place between the 15th and 20th day after the lapse
                                 of the 30-day period for registration of claims. The bankruptcy proceedings
                                     usually take from one to several years. The longest part of liquidation

does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance

regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:

        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
