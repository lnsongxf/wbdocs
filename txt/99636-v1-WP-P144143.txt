Financial capability, as defined by the World Bank and in this report, is the capacity
to act in one’s best financial interest, given socioeconomic and environmental
conditions. It encompasses knowledge (literacy), attitudes, skills and behavior of
consumers with respect to understanding, selecting, and using financial services, and the
ability to access financial services that fit their needs (World Bank 2013d).

Financial capability has become a policy priority for policy makers seeking to
promote beneficial financial inclusion and to ensure financial stability and
functioning financial markets. Today people are required to take increasing
responsibility for managing a variety of risks over the life cycle. People who make sound
financial decisions and who effectively interact with financial service providers are more
likely to achieve their financial goals, hedge again financial and economic risks, improve
their household’s welfare, and support economic growth. Boosting financial capability has
therefore emerged as a policy objective that complements governments’ financial
inclusion and consumer protection agendas. To this end, policy makers are increasingly
using surveys as diagnostic tools to identify financial capability areas that need
improvement and vulnerable segments of the population which could be targeted with
specific interventions.

In response to a request of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and as part of a
broader engagement on enhancing financial consumer protection and education
in the Philippines, the World Bank has implemented a financial capability survey.
Financial inclusion, financial literacy and consumer protection are important priorities for
the BSP and the Philippines government. Consumer protection and education are critical
elements in building an inclusive financial system and BSP seeks to identify sustainable
methods of delivering financial education through effective partnerships. As the BSP’s
financial inclusion initiatives are expected to usher in more Filipinos, including the
previously marginalized sectors, to access a wide range of financial services from a
variety of financial institutions, they need to acquire knowledge and develop skills to
enable them to make better financial decisions. The proposed survey constitutes a key
diagnostic tool that aims to guide BSP on the models for delivering financial education
and to set quantifiable and concrete targets. Moreover, it serves as a baseline against
which the effectiveness of future financial capability enhancing programs can be
assessed. So far, no financial capability surveys have been conducted in the Philippines
and it is one of the very first such experiences in the East Asia and Pacific Region (EAPF).

The key findings and recommendations presented in this report cover 3 main
areas: 1. Financial Inclusion, 2. Financial Capability, and 3. Financial Consumer
Protection. The remaining chapters are structured as follows. Chapter 1 explores the


                                             1
financial inclusion landscape in the Philippines. Chapter 2 gives an overview of Filipinos’
levels of financial capability, in particular about their financial knowledge, attitudes and
behaviors. The last chapter investigates if the products which financially included
individuals use are effectively meeting their needs.

Approximately 42 percent of surveyed adults in the Philippines report owning
an account at a formal financial institution, a commonly used metric for
international comparison. As compared to other lower-middle income economies,
the Philippines have a relatively high level of financial inclusion though it does lag
behind the average level among East Asian and Pacific economies. This pattern is
consistent with the other financial sector indicators for the Philippines as compared to
its country peers.

When the definition of financial inclusion is broadened to include a more
complete range of financial products, participation in financial sector in the
Philippines is broader. Approximately 41 percent of surveyed Filipinos report
currently not using some type of formal or commercial financial product, including
mobile financial services, loans, pensions, car or building insurance, and money
transfer services.

Women in the Philippines are considerably more likely than men to be
financially included. Women are sixteen percentage points more likely than men to
be financially included, a difference that remains statistically significant even after
controlling for income, education, and a range of other individual characteristics. The
gender gap in the Philippines differs sharply from trends observed in other countries:
according to the 2011 Global Findex survey: 55 percent of men worldwide have an
account, compared to 47 percent of women, a gap which grows larger when the
sample is restricted to the developing world, and larger still when only those living on
less than $1.25 per day are considered.

There are significant differences across income categories in the use of
financial services, a potentially key obstacle to achieving inclusive growth.
While 82 percent of those in the top quartile of the income distribution use a formal
financial product, just 42 percent of those in the bottom quartile percent report the
same. Without the necessary tools to manage their day-to-day finances and make
important educational and entrepreneurial investments, the poor in the Philippines are
thus limited in their ability to improve their economic well-being and fully reap the
benefits of national economic growth.




                                           5
There is significant variation in financial inclusion across regions and
rural/urban lines within the Philippines. Inequality in access to financial services is
naturally exacerbated by the archipelago geography of the country, consisting of more
than 7,000 islands. While approximately 75 percent of adults living in the National
Capital Region (NCR) region report using a formal financial product or service, only
about 45 percent of adults in SOCCKSARGEN, Zamboanga, and Cagayan do the
same.

Mobile financial services (MFS) have found relative success in the Philippines
with 17 percent of adults reporting current use of an MFS product. This figure is
in line with data from the 2011 Global Findex survey which found that 15 percent of
adults reported sending or receiving money via a mobile phone. This sets the
Philippines apart from many other developing economies, where mobile financial
services (MFS) have struggled to take off. While there is some evidence that mobile
financial services have successfully reach otherwise unbanked adults, MFS, like other
financial services, are still used disproportionately by the wealthy. Approximately 28
percent of adults in the highest income quartile report currently using a mobile financial
service, as compared to 6 percent of those in the lowest income quartile.

Forty-nine percent of Filipinos report some type of borrowing, across a range
of formal and informal systems. Eleven percent of adults in the Philippines use
exclusively formal credit products (bank loan, microfinance loan, credit card,
mortgage, etc.) to borrow while and 22 percent of adults meet their borrowing needs
relying only on informal source such as a money lender, family member, or friend.
Approximately 16 percent of adults blend informal and formal sources of borrowing.
The prevalence of informal borrowing is considerably higher than the average in other
lower-middle income or East Asian economies (31 percent and 28 percent,
respectively). Given that 53 percent of “informal only” borrowers report having an
account, it appears that the prevalence of informal borrowing is driven both by
ineligibility and lack of physical access.

Fifty-seven percent of Filipinos report some form of saving or risk management
behavior, including formal and informal savings, investments, private pensions,
or car or building insurance. Thirty-four percent of adults report saving at home,
which is consistent with 2011 Findex results that show Filipinos are considerably more
likely than adults in other lower-middle income or East Asian economies to save
informally, that is, usually neither formal nor semi-formal (e.g. savings groups)
mechanisms. Formal or semi-formal saving instruments are reportedly used by 15
percent of the adult population. Sixty-two percent of informal savers have an account,
which suggests that the formal financial system is not fully meeting the savings needs



                                            6
    of its clients. Just under half of adults report using neither informal, semi-formal nor
    formal methods to save.

    The most commonly reported obstacles to formal account ownership are lack
    of enough money to use one – reported by 20 percent of adults without an
    account – and lack of need for an account – reported by 18 percent. A lack of
    trust in financial institutions is a significant obstacle for greater financial inclusion in the
    Philippines. Seventeen percent of unbanked adults report that they do not have an
    account due to a lack of trust. Other commonly cited barriers – such as distance and
    documentation – can be directly addressed by public policy. Sixteen percent of
    unbanked Filipinos are deterred from opening an account due to a lack of physical
    access.




There is a need to continue progress on expanding the physical reach of financial
access points. Sixteen percent of unbanked adults cite distance as a barrier to financial
access. This is of course challenging in a country with over 2,000 inhabited islands.
However, with 8.6 access points per 100,000 adults, the Philippines lags behind other
economies in the reach of the financial sector, including Indonesia and Malaysia,
countries that face similarly challenging geographic obstacles. Many of the existing
financial access points in the Philippines – which include commercial banks, thrift banks,
rural banks, cooperative banks, ATMs - are concentrated in urban centers. According to
BSP, as of end-September 2014, 595 of 1,634 cities and municipalities do not host a
single banking office. Agents, ATMs, and microbanking offices (MBOs) should be fully
leveraged to expand the reach of the financial sector in a cost-effective and sustainable
basis. Improved data on the precise location of all financial access points can help
policymakers to develop incentives – including waiving process fees - and help inform
investment and operational decisions of the private sector.

Public and private sector actors should take an evidence-based approach to the
development of financial products that meet the needs of consumers, particularly
those at the bottom of the pyramid. Despite banks’ efforts to extend products and
services to low-income clients, the survey data indicates a lack of suitable products
addressing the needs of large parts of the population. Research should be conducted to
understand the effectiveness of microdeposit accounts and associated public awareness


3It should be noted that the recommendations provided in this report mainly arise from this demand-side
assessment and can therefore not be seen as being exhaustive.



                                                    7
campaigns. Approximately ten percent of unbanked respondents report that high costs
are a main barrier to formal accounts and an additional ten percent report that
documentation requirements are significant obstacles. These findings suggest that the
costs associated with these accounts remain prohibitively high for a significant portion of
the population or that the availability of microdeposit accounts are not widely known.
Restrictions that may disproportionately affect poor adults in accessing and using mobile
financial services – such as the prohibition on agents performing account openings –
should also be reconsidered.

The achievement of scale through improving availability, product design, and
consumer choice for social transfer and remittances payment products can boost
financial inclusion. More than fifty percent of 4Ps payments are made over-the-counter
while the remaining payments are distributed through somewhat restrictive cash cards.
Improvements to the reliability, product choice, recipient financial education, and partner
arrangements of these systems could boost demand for other financial services among
program recipients. The formal financial system may also be able to further capture the
enormous regular transfer of domestic and international remittances. The SMART Padela
program and SMART’s partnership with the National Commercial Bank in Saudi Arabia
are good models.

To align and unite initiatives pursued by various agencies in the Philippines, there
may be merit to put in place a National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS). Such a
document can promote a more effective and efficient process to achieve significant
improvements in financial inclusion. An NFIS can also be a valuable mechanism for
aligning and scaling up initiatives from the public sector, financial and nonfinancial
institutions, and other stakeholders. A range of countries have now launched a NFIS,
including Malaysia, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Nigeria. A NFIS could also usefully set forth
ambitious but achievable quantitative targets for increasing financial inclusion in the
Philippines. Well-defined, publicized, and monitored targets can be a powerful tool to
translate the ambition of goals into practice outcomes. Tracking progress against targets
can provide valuable insights into obstacles and/or opportunities for financial inclusion.
Embedding financial inclusion modules into regular household surveys is a critical
element of a robust monitoring and evaluation framework for financial inclusion. An
effective secretariat empowered and enabled to monitor and measure progress towards
increasing financial inclusion is critical for the successful implementation of the NFIS.
Going forward, Philippines could build on the earlier data initiatives and leverage
expertise available in Inclusive Financial Advocacy Staff at BSP to facilitate NFIS
measurement and monitoring.

Knowledge of basic financial concepts is a significant challenge in the
Philippines which is mirrored in the fact that on average, Filipino adults were
able to answer less than half (3.2) out of 7 financial literacy-related questions
correctly. A more worrisome finding is that around a fifth of the surveyed population
did not answer more than one question correctly, while still a significant proportion
or respondents, one out of ten adult Filipinos, did not appear to have a sound grasp
of any of the basic concepts being tested. One of the most notable knowledge gaps
which deserve policy attention is that only around a third of the adult population
appears to be comfortable in solving simple numeracy task required to shop around.
The working of compound interest seems to be the most difficult to understand and
only 29 percent of the sample managed to answer the respective question correctly.

Segments of the population that appear to struggle the most to understand
basic financial concepts include adults who did not save as a child, non-
household heads, as well as men. Unlike most other countries where women
display lower financial knowledge than men, the gender gap identified in the
Philippines is in favor of women. For example, female respondents are four
percentage points more likely than men to understand the primary purpose of
insurance products as a risk management tool.

An international comparison to survey participants in eleven countries shows
that although survey participants in the Philippines outperform respondents
from eight other countries in their inclination to think about the future, this
forward-looking attitude does not translate into sound financial decisions.
Specifically, even though only 27 percent of the respondents think that the future will
take care of itself, less than a quarter of the surveyed respondents aged 60 and
younger do have sufficient provisions in place to cover their expected old age
expenses. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of those without any provisions are
either not worried at all or only a bit worried (64 percent) about their long-term
financial security. This low score is of particular concern and deserves policy
attention given its implications for people’s long-term wellbeing.

Two characteristics which are strongly correlated with better scores on
financial capability are people’s educational attainments and their financial
knowledge/literacy levels. Survey participants with higher educational attainment
outperform their counterparts with lower education in the areas of choosing financial
products, managing their daily finances, and in planning for old age expenses. The



                                           9
  most remarkable gap between highly educated Filipinos and those without any
  educational attainment can be observed in their ability to live within means. While
  those with completed tertiary education achieved a living within means score of 51,
  those with no schooling scored only half as high. Likewise, higher financial literacy
  is strongly associated with higher scores in several areas, in particular in those
  related to daily money management and planning for retirement age expenses.

  The survey results further suggest that a generational gap exists with the
  younger generation lagging behind older survey participants, in particular in
  their ability to manage day-to-day finance and to plan for old age expenses.
  For instance, while those aged 35 or younger achieved a score of 26 on planning for
  old age expenses, people between 35 and 55 scored 31, and those 55 and older
  scored the highest score (35).

  Savings habits and preferences formed in early life stay with Filipinos into
  adulthood and regular use of a broad range of media has profound effects on
  how they make financial decisions. Those who began savings habits as children
  display better attitudes towards savings than those who did not save in their
  childhood. Moreover, respondents who already saved in their childhood tend to
  outperform their counterpart group who did not form savings habits in early life in the
  areas of choosing financial products and services, monitoring expenses, and
  planning for old age expenses. Notably, as compared to those who do not use print,
  broadcast, and internet media at a regular basis, more active media consumers tend
  to score higher in almost all assessed financial capability areas, suggesting that any
  efforts to enhance financial capability in an effective manner should involve a very
  broad media engagement.




National Financial Education Strategy can be an important organizing framework
to scale up and maximize effectiveness of various interventions on financial
education in the Philippines. Such an effort at the national level can promote co-
operation between relevant stakeholders, avoid duplication of resources, and minimize
gaps and overlaps in addressing the challenges identified through this survey. The
strategy should outline a set of priority programs to enhance financial capability levels of
the overall population and specific subgroups. Priorities could be set based on a number
of criteria, including the need, goals, costs and availability of resources. Other essential
elements of such a document include the roles and responsibilities of all involved
stakeholders, the main groups which shall be targeted, a framework for monitoring and


                                             10
evaluation, and most importantly the resources for the implementation of the strategy. For
more information about the process of developing a NFES see OECD/INFE High Level
Principles on NFES.4

Use of mass media, and edutainment in particular, can be an effective channel in
delivering financial education to adults. The field of behavioral economics has
documented a plethora of behavioral biases which can prevent people from translating
their intentions into action. For instance, people tend to be biased towards the status quo
and to choose the default option. They may also suffer from self-control issues,
procrastination, overconfidence, or systematically underestimate the time to complete
tasks (Buehler et al. 2002). These behavioral biases may explain why the farsightedness
of Filipino adults does not translate into sound long-term decisions-making and why they
are more challenged in providing for old age expenses than survey participants in other
countries. Recent research has shown that conveying financial messages through
innovative ways such as using popular TV soap operas, films, videos or radio programs
can be quite effective, not only in improving knowledge but also in altering behavior (Berg
and Zia 2013). Edutainment programs are also presumed to be more effective if
messages are delivered in an engaging and entertaining manner through appealing
stories that stick to memories, and if they are repeated and reinforced over time. For
instance, in Kenya, a soap opera with more than six million viewers, ‘Makutano Junction’,
incorporated financial education messages into some of its stories. These messages aim
to encourage people to save regularly or to open a bank account, rather than to keep
money under a mattress. Other examples of the use of entertainment education for
finance are ‘Scandal!’ in South Africa or ‘Mucho Corazon’ in Mexico. As with other soap
operas, people watch these edutainment dramas because they identify with the
characters and enjoy the stories; but in the course of watching the shows, they benefit
from the financial capability enhancing messages and ultimately change their behaviors.
At the same time some research findings indicate a possible short-lived impact of these
interventions (Di Maro et al. 2014). Further review and analysis of experience and
exploring options for testing such methods in the Philippines in partnership with private
sector and NGOs could help establish information basis for determining the role such
methods could play in the broader financial education efforts.

In addition to TV and radio programs, possible channels to specifically reach out
to young adults include youth development associations; mobile applications, as
well as social media websites which are popular with the youth. For instance, in
Malaysia, the Credit Counseling and Debt Management Agency (AKPK) undertakes an
initiative known as ‘POWER!’, which is targeted at young adults and first-time borrowers

                                               11
and which aims to equip them with practical money and debt management skills, which
will help them to become more financially responsible adults. 5 AKPK also provides
briefings, docu-dramas, e-newsletters, a handbook, classroom exercises, and has also
created a social media website. In view of the fact that according to this survey around
85 percent of young adults use mobile phones on a regular basis, mobile applications
could be another promising outreach channel. A good example of a mobile app is the
mobile budget app (Mobile Financial Assistant – maFin) which has been developed for
young adults by the polish Financial Supervision Authority. This mobile app is designed
to help monitor and analyze personal spending and to facilitate budget planning and
which is available free of charge to users of mobile phones and other mobile devices.

Scaling up integration of financial capability programs into existing conditional
cash transfer initiatives (CCTs) in the Philippines can help improve long-term
financial decisions of vulnerable segments of the population. Around the world CCTs
have been shown to affect people’s investments in health and education (see Benhassine
et al. 2014). CCTs may also provide an opportunity to take advantage of so called
teachable moments which are moments in people’s lives when they are more receptive
to receiving information and are consequently more likely to acquire and retain
knowledge. The Pantawid Pamilya program in the Philippines with four million
beneficiaries may provide a good opportunity for enhancing the ability of beneficiaries
and their families to manage their daily finances and to make provisions for old age
expenses. BSP in collaboration with the Department for Social Welfare have already
introduced financial education elements in this ongoing CCT program. The next steps
could involve evaluation of the effectiveness of these efforts in particular in terms of the
suitability of learning materials and consistency of delivery.

Over the medium to long-term it is recommended to scale up and mainstream
initiatives for school-based financial education programs as the survey results
suggest that starting early can have large payoffs. If people form sound habits on how
to manage their money from a young age, they are more likely to adhere to them
throughout their lives. International evidence on the effectiveness of school-based
financial education programs in changing student’s behaviors is mixed. Nevertheless,
there are lessons learned from other countries which have implemented such programs.
For example, the rigorous evaluation of a large scale school-based financial education
program in Brazil showed that such programs are particularly effective when financial
education is provided in ways which students find relevant to their lives either currently or
in the near future, and if it is interactive (Bruhn et al. 2014). High-quality material or
textbooks are therefore required, and teachers need to be well-trained on the content and

techniques. There are a number of websites containing links to teaching resources.6 The
BSP collaborated with the Department of Education in the development and integration
of lessons on financial education in the elementary curriculum.7 BSP in partnership with
Department of Education may wish to explore a possibility of the development of a
curriculum that integrates financial education as one of the core subjects. This would not
only ensure that financial education is actually taught, but it will also provide sufficient
time for its teaching.

Moreover, it is suggested to go beyond financial capability enhancing programs
and evaluate possibilities of the use of nudges and reminders, default options, as
well as smart product design. Studies in Bolivia, Peru, and the Philippines show that
simple, timely text messages reminding people to save can boost savings rates in line
with earlier established goals (Karlan et al. 2010). Since Filipino adults struggle with long-
term financial decision making, periodic reminder messages could induce them to attend
to the benefits and tasks of saving regularly and putting money aside for old expenses.
Another experimental study from the Philippines shows that commitment devices can
have a strong and positive effect on people’s financial behavior. Specifically, the study
shows that individuals who had been offered and used savings accounts without the
option of withdrawal for six months, increased their savings by 82 percent more than a
control group that was not provided with such an account.

website (which lists a range of educational materials, each of which has been vetted by a quality assurance
process); the US Jump$tart Coalition Clearinghouse and the UK Personal Finance Education Group
(PFEG) website. Some resources are available free of charge and others are available for purchase. The
Citigroup Financial Education Curriculum contains interactive lessons, facilitator tips and printable lesson
plans (which are available in several languages) for use from kindergarten level upwards.
7 In May 2013, the Child and Youth Finance International (CYFI), presented the Country Award to the

Philippines for having the Most Outstanding National Child and Youth Finance Program. The award was
for the collaboration of BSP and Department of Education to implement a financial education program for
school children.

  A substantial proportion – almost one fifth – of the surveyed adult population
  reports a dispute with a financial service provider in the past three years. The
  incidence rate of reported disputes with providers of financial services is much higher
  in the Philippines than in the few countries for which a comparable indicator is
  available. Three quarters of those who experienced a dispute with a financial service
  provider did not pursue any actions to resolve it. The survey results suggest that low
  income segments and retirees are more vulnerable than the rest of the population to
  having faced a dispute with a financial service provider. High incidence of disputes
  could also be in part attributed to low levels of financial literacy and lack of
  understanding of financial products by population.

  In terms of actions taken in the event of a dispute few consider formal
  mechanisms, including those operated by BSP. Most of those who experienced
  a conflict and took any actions to resolve it, decided to approach the financial service
  provider through friends and family (50 percent), followed by a significant proportion
  that simply stopped using their services before contract expiration (44 percent). Only
  four percent of consumers actually used formal external systems of redress for
  settling financial disputes they encountered. Major reasons for not trying to solve a
  dispute include perceived lengthy time of proceedings, the view that financial
  providers are simply too powerful, as well as lack of trust in the efficiency and lack
  of awareness of the respective government authorities.

  The survey results suggest that despite serving more customers, banks
  appear to be less likely to cater the needs of their clients as compared to six
  other types of financial services providers. Specifically, while three quarters of
  MFI’s customers indicated to be satisfied with the product and services they provide,
  this number compares to only 43 percent among bank clients. A closer look into
  satisfaction rates among different user segments reveals that men and rural dwellers
  are compared to their respective counterpart groups not only less likely to participate
  in the formal financial sector but also less likely to benefit from it if they do.




These findings emphasize the need to complement financial capability enhancing
efforts by measures to strengthen the existing financial consumer protection
framework, including minimum requirements to meet internal complaints handling



                                             14
standards set by BSP. In line with the recommendations of the 2014 Philippines
Diagnostic Review of Consumer Protection and Financial Literacy8, legal or regulatory
provisions should require financial institutions regulated by BSP to provide customers
with information on internal complaints handling procedures (including contact
information and time limits). This information should not only be disclosed in their
products’ terms and conditions but also be visibly posted in branches and online. In
addition, customers should be informed about formal redress systems such as BSP’s
Financial Consumer Protection Department (FCPD) or legal courts to increase low
awareness levels of government agencies which can be approached for help in the event
of a dispute with a financial service provider.

It is further recommended that BSP considers making its external complaint
resolution scheme more effective, including for example by enhancing FCPD’s
power to make binding decisions and through awareness campaigns to inform the
public about FCPD’s role. In light of the fact that around 60 percent of those who
reportedly experienced a conflict but did not try to solve it because they think the
government agencies do not function properly, it appears to be critical to make formal
redress systems more relevant for those clients who experienced a conflict with a financial
service provider. Specifically, FCPD may be more effective if given powers for binding
decisions. Such reform would require legislative changes and may not be feasible in a
short term. Since around 40 percent of those who did not take any actions in the event of
a dispute indicated that they lack awareness of the respective government authority,
FCPD needs to re-assess its approach to conducting public awareness campaign to
inform consumers of their rights and mechanisms for conflict resolution.

Given the high rate of reported conflicts with financial institutions, BSP should
analyze consumer complaints statistics submitted by banks and other financial
service providers and use this information as inputs to their supervisory and
regulatory activities. All financial institutions and banks in particular, should be obliged
to share their complaints data with BSP. Based on the analysis of the consumer
complaints and inquiries, BSP could propose guidelines, instructions or conduct public
awareness campaigns that address the main problems identified in such analysis. For
instance, BSP may issue case studies based on real complaints that would explain in
plain language particular complaints, how they were dealt with and why. Such case
studies might be published on BSP’s website, in local newspapers and/or disseminated
through different alternative channels including local government structures and

communities. In addition, making complaints statistics available to the public could serve
as an effective tool to in promoting consumer protection through ‘naming and shaming’.

Mystery shopping and focus group discussions with consumers are powerful
supervisory tools to be used to gain additional insights into why banks and their
products appear to satisfy their clientele less than other type of providers. Mystery
shopping can be a very powerful tool to test bank’s compliance with specific requirements,
and to determine the quality and quantity of information consumers receive or if suitable
advice is given. However, to realize the benefits of this supervisory tool, mystery shopping
needs to be well structured, the shoppers need to ask the same questions at each
provider based on a simple and plausible scenario, and it needs to cover a reasonable
sample of providers. Focus group discussions with consumers of bank services are
another effective research technique which helps to delineate attitudes, motivations, and
opinions of the participants regarding the most important issues and concerns they have
with bank services and products.

The financial capability questionnaire used for this survey has been extensively
tested in the context of middle- and low- income countries. The survey instrument
used is based on a questionnaire developed with support by the Russia Financial
Literacy and Education Trust Fund and is tailored to measure financial capability in
low- and middle-income countries, although it can also be used in high-income countries.
Extensive qualitative research techniques were used to develop this survey instrument,
including about 70 focus groups and more than 200 cognitive interviews in eight countries
to identify the concepts that are relevant in middle- and low- income settings, and to test
and adapt the questions to ensure that they are well understood and meaningful across
income and education levels. The instrument is currently used or planned to be used in
14 countries in Latin America, Africa, Middle East and East Asia and the Pacific.

The survey instrument used allows financial capability, financial inclusion, and
consumer protection issues to be assessed and measured. Financial capability is
measured by knowledge of financial concepts and products, and by attitudes, skills and
behavior related to day-to-day money management, planning for the future, choosing
financial products and staying informed. In order to jointly analyze financial capability and
inclusion, the survey instrument captures information on usage of different kind of
financial products and providers. The financial consumer protection section gathers
information on incidence of conflicts with financial service providers and levels of
satisfaction with financial products offered by different financial institutions. To further
customize the survey instrument to the policy priorities of BSP, specific questions have
been added to the survey, for example relating to the usage of E-money.

The Philippines survey is representative of the financially active population of the
covered regions and comprises a total sample of 3,000 adults. To fulfill the
requirement of a scientifically sound survey which allows inferences to the whole universe
of financially active adults in the Philippines, probability sampling techniques were used
to select a sample of 3,000 adults. With a theoretical nonresponse rate of 25%, the target
sample was set at 4,000 households. The most recent 2010 Philippines Census of
Population and Housing, kindly provided by the Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA),
were used as a sampling frame. In order to prepare the sample frame adequately, some
barangays needed to be excluded due to Peace and Order Problems while others had to
be excluded because they were the hardest hit by Typhoon Haiyan.9 Once the population



9 Barangays in which more than 40 percent of families were seriously impacted by the typhoon were
excluded from the sampling frame. In total, around 16 percent of the targeted population had to be excluded
from the national frame.


                                                     17
size was finalized, the population was divided into strata based on urban/rural criteria.
Urban areas of the country were reorganized into the National Capital Region and all
other urban locations. Rural areas were regrouped by dominant economic activity of the
regions: agriculture, industry or services. Moreover, a housing score was also created per
household and then per barangay, corresponding to the average responses to certain
housing questions in the 2010 Census. 10 Each barangay was then characterized as
belonging to one of the four categories of housing. Finally, both urban and rural barangays
were distributed according to the housing score developed, resulting in a total of 20 strata,
8 of which were urban and 12 of which were rural.

The sample was selected through a three stage cluster sampling. The sample was
subsequently selected in a three-stage cluster sampling with probability proportional to
size (PPS) selection at the first stage, and with barangays being used as the primary
sampling unit (PSU). In total 200 PSUs were selected with PPS and the measure of size
for each barangay was based on its number of households. Following the first stage
selection of barangays, a household listing was conducted in the chosen barangays. In
each selected barangay, a sample of 20 households was selected from this list at the
second stage, out of which 15 were targeted for surveying and 5 were reserve households
for replacement purpose only. Finally, within each selected household, eligible adults
either responsible for personal or household finances were randomly drawn by means of
the Kish grid. Proper individual weights were calculated and used in the following analysis
to adjust for varying probabilities of selection (design weights).

Between February and September 2014, a Canadian survey firm implemented the
survey using computer-assisted personal interview methods (CAPI). Étude
Économique Conseil (EEC) Canada, a Montreal based survey firm, was hired to conduct
the Financial Capability Survey in the Philippines. To ensure highest data quality and
avoid common errors associated with paper-and-pencil surveys, an electronic version of
the questionnaire including consistency were programmed and the survey was
administered from tablet computers. Due to extensive efforts and different strategies used
(e.g. training of enumerators on refusal conversion strategies, letters which were in
advance to inform respondents about the surveys’ objectives, 5 contact attempts, etc.)
the total non-response rate was around 12 percent of the total targeted households.

The adult population to which the results of this survey are meant to extrapolate
has the following key characteristics which are in line with figures reported in the
2010 Population Census data: Half of the population lives in urban areas, while the
remaining 50 percent live in rural environments (see Figure 20 in Appendix A). Slightly


10 The highest scores reflected barangays that were composed mostly of homeowners, with houses made
of concrete/brick/stone walls that did not need repairs, and had roofs made of either iron/aluminum or tile
concrete/clay tile. As the housing score decreases, so does the overall average quality of housing.


                                                     18
less than half of the population are male (48 percent, see Figure 22 in Appendix A).
Ranking all individuals by their reported household income and dividing them into 4
groups, 22 percent of the population fall in the lowest income segment (less than 8200
PHP per month), 24 percent in the second lowest (between 8201 PHP and 14200 PHP),
25 percent in the second highest (between 14201 PHP and 23600 PHP), and 29 percent
in the highest income bracket (more than 23600 PHP, see Figure 21 in Appendix A).
Forty-six percent of the population is younger than 35, 39 percent ages from 35 to 55,
and 15 percent of the population is older than 55 (see Figure 23 in Appendix A). As
compared to many other countries, adult Filipinos have relatively high educational
attainments. Twenty nine percent of the population has some or completed tertiary
education including college-, master-, and doctorate degrees; 43 percent has some or
completed high school or vocational school education; 25 percent has some or completed
primary schooling, while only 2 percent of the population has no schooling (see Figure 24
in Appendix A). Less than half of the population is characterized as earning stable income
(48 percent), while 52 percent is facing irregular and uncertain income flows (see Figure
25 in Appendix A). The average number of adults per household is 3, whereas an average
sized household comprises 5 people. As shown in Figure 26 in Appendix A, 52 percent
of the respondents live in households with 4 to 6 members, 24 percent in households
comprising 7 or more members.

Expanding the breadth and depth of financial inclusion is a policy priority in the
Philippines. The Philippines launched a National Strategy for Microfinance in 1997 to
broaden access to basic financial services for low income populations. Over the years
Philippines supported innovation in financial services to expand access through
proportionate KYC requirements, mobile banking, flexibility in branch regulations and a
broad range of policies to expand access to financial services for unserved and
underserved segments of the economy. In 2011 Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the
central bank) joined many other countries and made a pledge to expand financial
inclusion under the Maya Declaration. The commitment reflected BSP’s leadership and
coordination role with respect to financial inclusion in the Philippines, as well as the
institution’s priority goals, which include: i) a wide range of financial services that serve
different market segments, ii) financial products that are appropriately designed, priced
and tailor-fitted to market needs; iii) a wide variety of strong, sound, and duly authorized
financial institutions utilizing innovative delivery channels; and iv) an effective interface of
bank and non-bank products, delivery channels, technology and innovation to reach the
financially excluded. These goals are mirrored in the Philippines Development Plan (PDP)
2011-2016, which envisions an inclusive financial sector that “provides for the evolving
needs of its diverse public.”

The Philippines has made positive progress towards achieving its financial
inclusion priorities in recent years. BSP has established a dedicated office for Inclusive
Finance Advocacy as well as a cross-bank group to coordinate financial inclusion
initiatives (The Inclusive Finance Steering Committee). Several reforms and initiatives
have significantly contributed towards meeting BSP’s priority goals. They include i) the
establishment of microdeposit accounts, which have removed barriers such as high-
balance requirements and dormancy charges; ii), a flexible regulatory approach for mobile
financial services, which has facilitated a range of bank-led and telco-led products, and;
(iii) approval of a general consumer protection framework to safeguard consumers of
financial services from abusive practices. The Philippines was recognized by the
Economic Intelligence Unit’s 2014 MicroScope report as having the third best enabling
environment for financial inclusion worldwide, behind only Peru and Colombia.

BSP recognizes that measuring progress is a critical component of advancing
financial inclusion in the Philippines. Though an explicit numeric target for financial
inclusion has not been set, BSP has demonstrated its commitment to measuring



                                                20
progress. IFAS of BSP have launched a number of initiatives in coordination with other
stakeholders including (i) the creation of a financial inclusion database; (ii) regular
updates on the state of financial inclusion; (iii) preparatory work for a national baseline
survey and product catalogues.

The analysis of the financial inclusion module serves to strengthen the
understanding of the state of financial inclusion in the Philippines and provide
valuable context for interpreting the results on financial capabilities. Collecting
survey data from individuals – that is, from the demand side - can provide valuable insight
into the usage, value and limitations of existing financial services. Demand-side survey
data also facilitates analysis of how patterns of financial inclusion vary across different
population segments, and the degree to which different financial behaviors – such as
saving, borrowing, and making payments – overlap. The data and analysis presented
below can be used to identify priority populations, set national financial inclusion targets,
and design reforms and interventions to advance financial inclusion in the Philippines.
Finally, the data can provide a baseline survey against which to measure progress of
reforms and initiatives. Future rounds of surveys will shed light on the degree to which
the financial inclusion landscape is shifting in the Philippines, and to what extent progress
is evenly distributed across different population segments and regions.




According to this 2014 Financial Capability Survey, approximately 42 percent of the
surveyed adults in the Philippines report owning an account at a formal financial
institution, a commonly used metric for international comparison. As compared to
other lower-middle income economies (World Bank classification), the Philippines has a
relatively high level of financial inclusion, although it does lag behind the average level
among East Asian and Pacific economies. This pattern is generally in line with the other
financial sector indicators for the Philippines as compared to its country peers (Table 1).11


11 According to the 2011 Global Findex survey in the Philippines, 27 percent of adults have a formal account.
The difference between the values likely reflects several factors: (i) the fact that some barangays needed
to be excluded from the WBG Financial Capability Survey due to Peace and Order Problems while others
had to be excluded because they were the hardest hit by Typhoon Haiyan, (ii) a three-year period during
which public and private-sector actions have focused on expanding financial inclusion, for example
according to supply-side data from BSP, registered e-money accounts increased 34% between 2010 and
2013; (ii) differences in methodologies between the surveys, for example the 2014 Financial Capabilities
survey is based on interviews with adults 18 years and older while the Findex includes adults ages 15 and
above. When comparing statistics within or across surveys, it is also important to consider margins of error.
For example, the 27 percent value in the Findex survey is associated with a margin of error (95%) of +/-
2.6 percentage points, and the 42 percent value in the 2014 Financial Capabilities survey is associated with
a margin of error (95%) of +/- 3.3 percentage points.

Yet when the definition of financial inclusion is expanded to include a more
complete range of financial products, participation in financial sector in the
Philippines is broader. Currently, approximately 59 percent of Filipinos reportedly use
some type of formal or commercial financial product, including mobile financial services,
loans, pensions, insurance, and money transfer services. This definition of financial
inclusion will be used throughout the rest of this analysis.

Unlike many countries, women in the Philippines are considerably more likely than
men to be financially included. Women are sixteen percentage points more likely than
men to be financially included, a difference that remains statistically significant even after
controlling for income, education, and a range of other individual characteristics. This is
consistent with findings from earlier surveys including the 2011 Global Findex which found
that women are fifteen percentage points more likely than men to report owning an
account at a formal financial institution (34 percent vs. 29 percent). This gender gap is in
contrast to the trend found in most countries: according to the 2011 Global Findex survey:
55 percent of men worldwide have an account, compared to 47 percent of women, a gap
which grows larger when the sample is restricted to the developing world, and larger still
when only those living on less than $1.25 per day are considered. However, the “reverse
gender gap” finding for the Philippines is consistent with other g ender-segregated
analyses. According to the World Economic Forum’s 2014 Global Gender Gap Report
which measures gender equality in health, education, economy, and politics, the
Philippines ranks ninth worldwide, above many developed economies.

There are sharp differences across income categories in the use of financial
services, a key obstacle to achieving inclusive growth. While 82 percent of those in



                                                           22
the top quartile of the income distribution use a formal financial product, just 42 percent
of those in the bottom quartile percent report the same. Without the necessary tools to
manage their day-to-day finances and make important educational and entrepreneurial
investments, the poor are limited in their ability to improve their economic well-being,
which may hinder progress towards achieving inclusive growth. Simple averages also
show variation across education and employment categories and these differences are
statistically significant even when controlling for a range of other demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics in regression analysis12 (see table 5 in Appendix B).

There is significant variation in financial inclusion across regions and rural/urban
lines within the Philippines. Inequality in access to financial services is naturally
exacerbated by the archipelago geography of the country, consisting of more than 7,000
islands. While approximately 75 percent of adults living in the National Capital Region
(NCR) region report using a formal financial product or service, only about 45 percent of
adults in Soccsksargen, Zamboanga, and Cagayan Valley do the same (Map 1).13 More
generally, Filipinos living in urban areas are significantly more likely to be financially
included: 70 percent of these adults report using a formal financial product compared to
47 percent of their rural counterparts.




12 The multivariate regression model includes the following control variables: age, gender, education,
urban/rural, income, household head status, employment, whether saved as a child, and media
consumption.
13 Due to relatively low population and therefore low sample sizes, it is not possible to present statistically

robust financial inclusion estimates for every region.

Approximately 23 percent of Filipino adults report that their household has
received money or in-kind payments or support from family or friends living
elsewhere. Seventeen percent of adults report receiving money from friends of family
living elsewhere within the Philippines and 10 percent report receiving money from
outside the country. Remittances have long been a crucial component of the Philippines
economy. The World Bank estimates that international remittances account for nearly 10
percent of GDP. Ten percent of adults report that money or in-kind payments from family
or friends living elsewhere is their main source of income.

Seventeen percent of Filipino adults report using a money transfer service, a
category that includes bank linked and stand-alone remittance service providers
and mobile-based services. The finding is consistent with results from the 2011 Global
Findex survey which showed that 14 percent of adults in the Philippines use a formal
financial institution to send money to or receive money from family living elsewhere. Yet,
money transfer services are not used equally among different segments of the population:
36 percent of adults in the richest quartile of the income distribution report using money
transfer services, but just 5 percent of those in the poorest quartile do. While the poor are
equally likely to receive money from family and friends living elsewhere as the rich (21

percent among those in the lowest income quartile vs. 24 percent among those in the
highest income quartile), the poor are likely to make more use of informal money transfer
mechanism (e.g. bus companies or via relatives) given the high costs of some money
transfer services and lack of physical access.

Mobile financial services (MFS) have found relative success in the Philippines with
17 percent of adults reporting current use of an MFS product. This figure is in line
with data from the 2011 Global Findex survey which found that 15 percent of adults
reported sending or receiving money via a mobile phone. This sets the Philippines apart
from many other developing economies, where mobile financial services have struggled
to take off.

A key enabler of mobile financial services in the Philippines has been BSP’s
willingness to enable non-banks to offer financial services. In 2005, BSP approved
a MFS product of GXI, a non-bank, which subsequently registered with BSP as a
“remittance agent” and met BSPs requirements for consumer protection, safety and
soundness, and AML / CFT issues. This was followed by BSP Circular Number 649, which
issued comprehensive guidelines governing the issuance of electronic money and the
operations of electronic money issuers. This regulation maintained the ability for non-
banks to issue electronic money. A GSMA report notes that in addition to the enabling
environment reforms, a high adoption of mobile phones and the ability of early entrants
(SMART and Globe) to design strong offerings and align the interests of supporting
ecosystems, have been important determinants of the success of mobile financial
services in the Philippines. Indeed, the GCASH product – launched in 2004 by telco Globe
– and SMART money – launched in 2001 by SMART Communications in partnership with
Banco de Oro - have been the dominant market players. The survey does not contain
data on the usage of product-specific MFS. Other key enablers include widespread


                                                           25
mobile coverage, SMS literacy, latent demand for financial services, prevalence of
international remittances, and an existing network of merchants accepting debit/credit
payments, according to a GSMA analysis.

The data does suggest that mobile financial services have, to some degree, been
successful in reducing traditional barriers to financial inclusion, including physical
access. An equal proportion of adults without a traditional account (e.g. in a bank or other
non-e-money account) report using mobile financial services as adults with a traditional
account. This may be explained by improved physical access associated with mobile
financial services. Approximately 11 percent of rural residents report having a traditional
account at a formal financial institution as compared to 33 percent of urban residents. Yet
rural residents and urban residents report using mobile financial services at rates that are
statistically indistinguishable: 18 percent and 16 percent, respectively.

Mobile financial services, like other financial services, are used disproportionately
by the wealthy. Approximately 28 percent of adults in the highest income quartile report
currently using a mobile financial service, as compared to 6 percent of those in the lowest
income quartile. Broadening the scope of mobile financial services to include savings and
credit – as M-Shwari and other products have done in Kenya – may improve the value
proposition for lower-income adults. While electronic transfer of social benefits is often
considered to be an effective method for increasing adoption of e-money services by the
poor, recent research has shown that the use of cash card systems in the Philippines –
mainly the 4Ps program - does not necessarily lead to great use of digital financial
products.

Forty-nine percent of Filipinos report some type of borrowing, across a range of
formal and informal systems. The prevalence of informal borrowing is considerably
higher than the average in other lower-middle income or East Asian economies (31
percent and 28 percent, respectively). Around 11 percent of adults use exclusively formal
credit products (bank loan, microfinance loan, credit card, mortgage, etc.) to borrow while
and 22 percent of adults meet their borrowing needs relying only on informal source such
as a money lender, family member, or friend. Approximately 16 percent of adults blend
informal and formal sources of borrowing. Given that 53 percent of “informal only”
borrowers report having an account, it appears that the prevalence of informal borrowing
is driven both by ineligibility and lack of physical access. Yet the majority of adults – 51
percent – do not report engaging in any borrowing behavior at all. Adults in the poorest
quintile are relatively unlikely to borrow, with sixty-six percent of this population segment
reporting no borrowing activities at all.

Loans from financial institutions, including microfinance institutions, are the most
commonly reported source of formal lending among Filipino adults. Approximately
11 percent of respondents report having a microfinance loan, which translates to
approximately 4.8 million adults.14 These demand-side findings show a larger prevalence
of microcredit than is reported in official figures: BSP data shows that the number of
microfinance borrowers increased by 191 percent between 2002 and 2012, reaching 1.1
million borrowers. However, official figures do not account for microloans from non-
supervised institutions. There are also challenges in measuring specific products from the
demand-side as respondents may not be fully aware as to what is considered a
microfinance institution. A spatial representation of formal credit usage confirms previous
findings that usage of formal financial services is concentrated in populous regions; the
map also shows that formal credit on average is less frequently used than informal credit
across the Philippines (Map 2, Map 3). Research also highlights that formal credit
products for the poor, often disbursed through microfinance institutions, have positive
impacts though often through unexpected channels. In a 2011 experiment in the
Philippines, researchers found that access to credit led to a decline in the number of
business activities and employees in the treatment group relative to controls. However,
the results did show that microloans increase the ability of consumers to cope with risk,
strengthen community ties, and boost the access to informal credit. 15 Just 5 percent of
adults report currently using a credit card. Housing finance remains a relatively

Fifty-seven percent of Filipinos reported some form of saving or risk management
behavior (e.g. insurance). Informal savings (e.g. saving at home) is the most commonly
reported behavior, reported by 34 percent of adults. Other activities, such as having
investments, private pensions, car or building insurance, or formal / semi-formal saving
are each reported by approximately 15 to 20 percent of the adult population. There are
significant differences across income categories in the degree to which adults engage
in savings or risk management activities. The poor, who arguably are most in need to
tools to help protect against income shocks and smooth consumption, are considerably
less likely to report savings or risk management activities. Forty-four percent of the
poorest 25 percent of adults report some form of saving or risk management behavior,
as compared to 76 percent of the richest quartile.

The use of informal financial management and planning techniques is common
among Filipino adults. Thirty-four percent of adults report saving at home, which is
consistent with 2011 Global Findex results that show Filipinos are considerably more
likely than adults in other lower-middle income or East Asian economies to save
informally, that is, usually neither formal nor semi-formal (e.g. savings groups)
mechanisms. Sixty-two percent of informal savers have an account, which suggests that
there is significant scope for financial service providers to mobilize additional savings
either through existing customers (those using both) or new customers who are already
engaged in regular savings behaviors. Of those with a formal bank, richer adults are in
fact more likely than poorer adults to also save informally. Just under half of adults report
using neither informal, semi-formal nor formal methods to save. Product design should

also reflect recent research, including experiments conducted in the Philippines that found
that accounts with savings reminders can lead to a boost in savings.16




The approximately 39 million adults without an account at a formal financial
institution in the Philippines are disproportionately poor, less educated and living
in rural areas. 17 Seventy-six percent of the poorest quartile of Filipinos report not
currently having an account at a formal financial institution. The same applies for 71
percent of adults living in rural areas. Yet, as stated in the Global Financial Development
Report 2014 (World Bank, 2013a), lack of usage of financial products does not
necessarily mean lack of access. While some people may have access to financial
services at affordable prices and may decide not to use them, others may lack access
because of constraints such as excessively high costs, or unavailability of the services
due to regulatory barriers or other factors. The Financial Capability Survey asked
respondents who do not have a formal account to report why.

The most commonly reported obstacles to formal account ownership are lack of
enough money to use one – reported by 20 percent of adults without an account –
and lack of need for an account – reported by 18 percent. Perhaps not surprisingly,


16Karlan and Zinman, 2010.
17Due to the design of the survey, obstacles to financial access are assessed specifically with respect to
account ownership and thus this may include adults who do in fact use other formal financial services such
as insurance, pensions, or mobile financial services.


                                                           31
respondents who report lacking enough money to use an account are disproportionately
poor: 28 percent of unbanked adults in the poorest income quartile report this obstacle,
while only 15 percent of those in the richest income quartile do the same. While these
answers could suggest voluntary exclusion from the formal financial sector, it does not
necessarily imply that these adults are unbankable. Instead, it may reflect a cost-benefit
analysis on the part of these adults and demonstrates that many adults perceive banking
services to be of little value, not in absolute terms, but for current levels of income and the
quality of banking products. This could be because of the nontrivial costs associated with
owning a formal account, from explicit costs like minimum balance requirements and
withdrawal charges to implicit costs such as transportation costs, but it suggests that, for
many adults, formal institutions do not offer sufficiently valuable services for day-to-day
transactions or savings, particularly those involving small amounts. The Philippines is not
an outlier in this regard: “lack of enough money to use an account” is the most commonly
self-reported barrier in 124 of 148 countries, according to 2011 Global Findex data. A
significant subset of unbanked adults in the Philippines do, however, explicitly cite the costs
associated with a formal account: nine percent of the unbanked report not having an
account because they are too expensive (Figure 6). It is notable, however, that this barrier
is ranked 7th, perhaps due to the microdeposit accounts that have successfully lowered
costs related to dormancy and minimum requirements.

A lack of trust in financial institutions is a significant obstacle for greater financial
inclusion in the Philippines. Seventeen percent of unbanked adults report that they do
not have an account due to a lack of trust. A lack of trust is positively associated with
income: 14 percent of adults without an account in the lowest income quartile report this
reason, as compared to 21 percent of unbanked adults in the highest income quartile.
Unbanked adults with a tertiary education are also more likely than lesser-education
Filipinos to report trust as a barrier. This finding is also linked to another reported
obstacle: nine percent of Filipinos without an account report that they are deterred due to
poor treatment by bank staff. Variations across income and education level are not
significant for this variable.

Other commonly cited barriers – such as distance and documentation – can be
directly addressed by public policy. Sixteen percent of unbanked Filipinos are deterred
from opening an account due to a lack of physical access. This is of course challenging
in a country with over 2,000 inhabited islands. However, with 8.6 access points per
100,000 adults, the Philippines lags behind other economies in the reach of the financial
sector, including Indonesia and Malaysia, countries that face similarly challenging
geographic obstacles. Many of the existing financial access points in the Philippines are
concentrated in urban centers. According to BSP, 604 of 1,634 cities and municipalities
do not host a single banking office – though this does represent a decline from 611 in
2012.

There is substantial evidence that lack of financial knowledge and skills
contributed to the recent global financial crisis. It is a well-accepted hypothesis that
limitations in consumers’ ability to fully understand the financial products and risks they
had taken on, contributed significantly to the worst financial crises since the great
depression (Geradi et al. 2010; Klapper et al. 2012).

Financial knowledge and skills are even more important in an environment where
financial products are increasingly complex and being delivered through new
distributions channels. Thanks to the launch of mobile banking services such as
GCASH and SMART money financial products and services are becoming increasingly
available to formerly disconnected segments. While these developments provide
benefits, they also bear risks which may be unfamiliar to existing and new customers. To
be able to benefit from these new opportunities without being exposed to undue risks, a
certain level of financial knowledge and skills is required.

In line with global trends, policy makers in the Philippines recognize the
importance of financial knowledge and skills (financial literacy) for peoples’ ability
to take informed financial decisions and to benefit from the financial services they
use. Financial supervisors in 81 economies are currently involved in financial capability
enhancing activities according to the WB’s 2013 Global Survey on Consumer Protection
and Financial Literacy which interviewed regulators involved in financial consumer
protection in 114 jurisdictions from all regions. Financial capability and education is an
important priority for BSP as it helps to empower people to become effective partners of
the BSP as productive economic agents and improves people’s lives. To this end, as part
of the ‘Maya Declaration 2011’, BSP has committed to promote financial capability and to
ensure that consumers are adequately informed and able to enjoy the full benefits of their
financial access. Since 2012, BSP has implemented the BSP economic and Financial
Learning Program across the country with the aim to promote greater public awareness


                                             33
and understanding of key economic and financial issues. This chapter focuses on gaps
in financial knowledge that need policy attention as well as vulnerable groups that display
limited knowledge and understanding of financial concepts and need to be targeted with
tailored programs.

To evaluate respondent’s financial knowledge and their basic numeracy skills, 7
questions were added to the 2014 Philippines Financial Capability Survey, covering
basic calculus and financial concepts such as simple interest rates, inflation, compound
interest, risk diversification, and the main purpose of insurance products. These questions
have been asked because they capture financial concepts and skills which are widely
considered as being crucial for informed savings and borrowing decisions as well as for
being able to mitigate risks more effectively and or to take advantage of investment
opportunities. We construct a financial literacy index based on the number of correct
responses provided by each survey participant to the seven financial literacy questions.
This index ranges from 0 to 7, whereby 0 indicates respondents who struggle the most
with correctly answering any of these questions. A score of 7 indicates survey participants
with good understanding of fundamental financial concepts and the ability to perform
simple mathematical calculations.




  Question 1 Imagine that five brothers are given a gift of 1,000 PHP. If the brothers
  have to divide the money equally, how much does each one get?

  Question 2 Now, imagine that the five brothers have to wait for one year to get
  their part of the 1,000PHP and inflation stays at 10%. In one year’s time will they
  be able to buy:
   More with their share of money than they could today
   The same amount
   Less than they could buy today
   It depends on the types of things that they want to buy (do not read out this
     option)

  Question 3 Suppose you put 100 PHP into a savings account with a guaranteed
  interest rate of 2% per year. You don’t make any further payments into this
  account and you don’t withdraw any money. How much would be in the account at
  the end of the first year, once the interest payment is made?

  Question 4 How much would be in the account at the end of five years? Would it
  be:
   More than 110 PHP
   Exactly 110 PHP
   Less than 110 PHP

   Question 5 Let’s assume that you saw a TV-set of the same model on sales in
   two different shops. The initial retail price of it was 1,000 PHP. One shop offered a
   discount of 150 PHP, while the other one offered a 10% discount. Which one is a
   better bargain, a discount of 1,50 PHP or 10%?
    A discount of 150 PHP
    They are the same
    A 10% discount

   Question 6 Which of the following statements best describes the primary purpose
   of insurance products?
    To accumulate savings
    To protect against risks
    To make payments or send money
    Other

   Question 7 Suppose you have money to invest. Is it safer to buy stocks of just one
   company or to buy stocks of many companies?
    Buy stocks of one company
    Buy stocks of many companies

The survey results suggest that on average, Filipino adults were able to answer 3.2
out of 7 financial literacy-related questions correctly. Although, the majority of the
population was able to answer between 2 to 5 questions correctly, only a meager
proportion of the sample population (10 percent) answered 6 questions correctly and
hardly anybody - 2 percent of the respondents - managed to provide correct responses
to all 7 questions. A more worrisome finding is that around a fifth of the surveyed
population did not answer more than 1 question correctly, while still a significant
proportion of respondents, one out of ten adult Filipinos, did not appear to have a sound
grasp of any of the basic concepts being tested.

A deeper exploration into the type of basic financial concepts known reveals that
Filipino adults are most comfortable with performing simple divisions but lack
specific knowledge required to make informed savings and borrowing decisions.
One of the most notable knowledge gaps which deserve policy attention is that only
around a third of the adult population appear to be comfortable in solving simple numeracy
tasks needed to shop around and to identify simpler bargains. A similar proportion of the
sample has a good grasp of the concept of risk diversification and understands that
holding stocks from different companies can usually be associated with less risky returns
than holding stocks from a single company. The working of compound interest appears
to be the most difficult to understand and only 29 percent of the sample managed to
answer the respective question correctly.

The fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of compound interest can have
far-reaching consequences in particular for long-term savings and the buildup of
wealth as evidence from recent field experiment in China shows. The experiment
studied the relationship between the understanding of the nature of compound interest
and retirement savings in China using a sample of thousand households. It concludes
that households which were randomly assigned to a financial education treatment that
emphasized the concept of compound interest increased their pension contribution by
roughly 40 percent as compared to a control group which did not receive this training
(Changcheng 2012).

An international comparison to respondents in 18 countries on key financial
literacy measures confirms that financial knowledge and awareness levels are a
significant challenge in the Philippines and require immediate policy responses.
Table 3 shows for 19 countries the proportion of adults with good grasp of basic concepts
such as inflation, simple and compound interest as well as those who are comfortable
with performing simple divisions. As can be seen, respondents in the Philippines perform
near the middle of the pack in terms of their understanding of simple and compound
interest, while their understanding of the effect inflation has on their savings and their
ability to perform simple divisions is lower than in most other countries in the developed
and developing world for which comparable indicators are available.

Segments of the population that seem to struggle the most to understand basic
financial concepts include those adults who did not save as a child, non-household
heads, as well as men (see figure 9). Moreover, unlike most other countries where
women display lower financial knowledge than men, the gender gap identified in the
Philippines is in favor of women: On average, women answered 3.2 questions correctly
as compared to men who provided on average 3.1 correct responses to the financial
literacy quiz related questions. Although this difference in the average number of correct
responses may not look substantial, it masks differences in the distribution of the financial
literacy quiz scores men and women achieve. Regression analysis reveals that even after
controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic factors men are more likely than
women to belong to the group of adults who scored the lowest on the financial literacy
quiz (2 or less correct responses) (see table 6 in Appendix B). Delving deeper into the
specific concepts women tend to be more knowledgeable about shows that female
respondents are four percentage points more likely than men to understand the primary
purpose of insurance products as a risk management tool.

In contrast, a better understanding of basic financial concepts is strongly
associated with individual characteristics such as completed tertiary education,
higher income, and the usage of print, broadcast, and internet media on a regular
basis. As may have been expected, those with highest educational attainment and
highest incomes provide significantly more correct responses on the financial literacy quiz
as compared to their respective counterpart groups with lowest educational attainment
and lowest incomes, even after controlling for other factors. Notably, regression analysis
reveals significant knowledge gaps between more active media consumers and those
who do not use print, broadcast, and internet media on a regular basis (see table 6 in
Appendix B). In addition, the survey results suggests that location matters and that those
who live in inner city areas achieve significantly higher financial literacy quiz scores as
compared to those who live in urban, peri-urban or rural areas.

Financial knowledge gap identified through the objective financial literacy quiz are
largely confirmed through participants’ subjective self-assessment of their levels
of awareness and understanding of financial concepts. With the view of comparing
objective findings of the financial knowledge quiz with subjective education needs,
respondents were also asked to self-assess their understanding of basic terms and
concepts such as interest rates, insurance products, exchange rates, and inflation. As
shown in figure 10, similar to the findings of the objective financial literacy quiz, awareness
of insurance and interest rates is relatively wide-spread. However, only 22 percent of the
surveyed population stated that they know what the term inflation means which is much
less than the 49 percent of the respondents who answered the inflation quiz question
correctly. Looking into the reasons behind this discrepancy the survey results indicate
that even among those who answered the inflation quiz question correctly and therefore
understand the underlying mechanics of how inflation affects their savings three quarters
seem to lack familiarity with the inflation term.

Even if people possess knowledge of basic financial concepts they may struggle
to translate it into adequate actions. To identify the role that attitudes play in shaping
individuals' financial decisions and to see if and how attitudes translate into financial
behavior, the survey contains questions on different aspects (components) of financial
capability that include attitudes/motivations and behaviors. This chapter gives an
overview of strengths and areas for improvements that surveyed adult Filipinos showed
regarding relevant financial behaviors and attitudes.

In the Philippines data set, 10 main components of financial capability can be
identified, some of which refer to behaviors, and others to attitudes or motivations.
Each financial capability component is measured through a combination of relevant
questions. These are identified by using a statistical technique called principal component
analysis (PCA). PCA is a data reduction method that finds a small number of linear
combinations of those variables that explain most of the variance in the data. The method
is used to aggregate the variables that measure different nuances of the same component
in order to obtain a single indicator (or score) for that component. Each component score
ranges between 0 (lowest score) and 100 (highest score).

The following seven components measure behaviors related to financial capability:
budgeting, not overspending, living within means, monitoring expenses, planning
for unexpected expenses, making provisions for old age, and choosing products.
More specifically, ‘budgeting’ measures the extent to which people plan how to use their
money and whether they adhere to the plan; ‘not overspending’ assesses whether people


                                                           40
have money left over after buying essentials and if yes, if they refrain from spending it on
non-essentials; ‘living within means’ measures whether adults run short of money after
buying essentials and why, their level of borrowing and whether people borrow to buy
food or to repay other debt; ‘monitoring expenses’ measures the ability to track expenses;
‘planning for unexpected expenses’ indicates whether people could cover an unexpected
expense equivalent to a month's income and whether they worry about it; ‘planning for
old age expenses’ indicates whether people have strategies in place that allow them to
cover for expenses in old age; and ‘choosing products’ indicates whether people search
for alternatives, check terms and conditions, get information before selecting financial
products, and search until they found the best products for their needs. The last score is
only calculated for those who have personally chosen a financial product in the past five
years.

Three financial capability components refer to underlying attitudes and
motivations that influence the way people behave, such as those related to
people’s farsightedness, their attitude towards savings, and their achievement
orientation. In particular, ‘farsightedness’ measures whether respondents agree or
disagree with statements such as ‘I live for today’, ‘The future will take care of itself’, ‘I
only focus on the short term’. The attitude towards savings score on the other hand is
based on respondents’ agreement or disagreement that statements such as ‘I try to save
for the future’, ‘I try to save for emergencies’, ‘I try to save even if a small amount’, and ‘I
am very disciplined when it comes to managing money’, describe them personally . The
achievement orientation score assesses whether respondents always look out for
opportunities for improving their situation, have many aspirations, and always work hard
to be among the best at what they do.

As compared to other aspects of financial capability, Filipino adults show relative
strengths in terms of their farsightedness, achievement orientation, as well as their
ability to plan for unexpected expenses. According to PCA analysis, Filipino adults are
most capable in the area of planning for unexpected expenses where they achieve the
highest score (67) of all aspects of financial capability being measured. This high score
reflects that fact that around half of the surveyed Filipino adults could reportedly cover an
unexpected expense equivalent to one month’s inco me without borrowing. Only 19
percent of them could not cover such expense and have not thought about doing anything
to make sure they could cover it. Listing all scores for different aspects of financial
capability in increasing order, figure 11 indicates that the second and third highest scores
can be found for respondents’ achievement orientation (66) and their level of
farsightedness (64). Although a significant proportion of adults reported some form of
saving (see chapter 1.5), Filipino adults score substantially lower regarding their
inclination to save (46), suggesting that average savings amounts may be low. As would




                                               41
be expected, Filipino adults with lower inclination to save are found to be less likely to
hold formal savings.

In contrast, financial behaviors related to day-to-day money management appear to
be a major challenge in the Philippines. Figure 11 further shows that Filipino adults
struggle with their daily money management, including their ability to budget (44), live within
their means (43), refrain from overspending (42), and monitor their expenses (38). More
specifically, regarding people’s ability to track their expenses, the survey results show that
over half of the surveyed respondents either did not know the amount of money they had
spent last week or the amount currently available to them. In terms of living within means,
the survey results suggest that 20 percent of the survey participants ran short of money
due to their overspending. Alarmingly, 19 percent of those who tend to overspend borrow
money regularly in order to cover their food expenses.

By far the lowest score is, however, found for behaviors relating to long-term
planning. Despite people’s forward-looking attitude and their ability to cope with
unexpected income shocks equivalent to one month’s income, the lowest overall financial
capability score indicates that people’s ability to procure for old age expenses is severely
constraint. A closer look into the variables based on which this low score has been
computed reveals that it reflects the fact that less than a quarter of the surveyed
respondents aged 60 and younger do have sufficient provisions in place to cover their
expected old age expenses. Moreover, a substantial proportion of those without any
provisions are either not worried at all or only a bit worried (64 percent) about their long-
term financial security. This low score is of particular concern and deserves policy
attention given its implications for people’s long-term wellbeing.

A comparison to survey participants in eleven countries confirms that Filipino
adults tend to be far-sighted, but they are among the most challenged with respect
to their daily money management and long-term planning. Table 4 compares the
average financial capability scores Filipino adults achieved in eight different areas to the
ones of respondents in various countries in which a similar survey has been conducted.
As can be seen, survey participants in the Philippines outperform respondents from eight
other countries in terms of their inclination to think about the future. However, the cross-
country comparison confirms that Filipino respondents display weaker performance in
their daily money management and lack far behind survey participants in other countries
in their ability to make provisions for their old age expenses.

Two essential personal characteristics which are found to be strongly correlated
with better scores in a number of financial capability areas are people’s educational
attainments as well as their financial knowledge/literacy levels. Survey participants
with higher educational attainment outperform their counterparts with lower education in
the areas of choosing financial products, managing their daily finances, and in planning
for old age expenses. The most remarkable gap between highly educated Filipinos and
those without any educational attainment can be observed in their ability to live within
their means. While those with completed tertiary education achieved a living within means
score of 51, those with no schooling scored only half as high (23). According to regression
analysis (see table 7, table 8 in Appendix B), this difference remains significant even after
holding income and other characteristics constant. Likewise, higher financial literacy is
strongly associated with higher scores in several areas, in particular in those related to
daily money management and planning for retirement age expenses.

The survey results further suggest that a generational gap exists with the younger
generation lacking behind older survey participants, in particular in their ability to
manage day-to-day finances and to plan for old age expenses. Figure 13 shows that
while those aged 35 or younger achieved a score of 26 on planning for old age expenses,
people between 35 and 55 scored 31, and those 55 and older scored the highest score
(35). With respect to day-to-day money management skills, younger adults struggle more
than their older counterpart groups when it comes to monitoring their expenses (34 vs
49), budgeting (38 vs 57), and not overspending (39 vs 53).

Starting early pays off since having saved as a child correlates with higher scores
in several financial capability areas. Respondents who already saved in their childhood
tend to outperform their counterpart group who did not form savings habits as a child in


                                                           45
the areas of choosing financial products and services, planning for old age expenses, and
monitoring expenses. As shown in figure 14, those who began savings habits as children
display better attitudes towards savings than those who did not save in their childhood.
Regression analysis confirms that these differences remain significant even after
controlling for other socio-economic and demographic factors (see table 7, table 8 in
Appendix B).

Another pattern which emerges is that regular usage of a broad range of media has
huge value. Notably, as compared to those who do not use print, broadcast, and internet
media at a regular basis, more active media consumers tend to score higher in almost all
assessed financial capability areas, except in the area of refraining from overspending.
This result suggests that any efforts to enhance financial capability in an effective manner
should involve a very broad media engagement.

In addition to peoples’ ability to take sound financial decisions, the recent global
financial crisis has highlighted the importance of financial consumer protection to
protect consumers from abusive sale practices and to level the playing field
between providers and consumers of financial services. Financial consumer
protection is about ensuring a fair interaction between providers and consumers of
financial services. An effective financial consumer protection regime is essential in
counterbalancing the inherent disadvantage of financial service consumers vis-à-vis the
power, information, and resources of their providers. Without basic protective measures,
consumers may find it difficult or costly to obtain sufficient information or adequately
understand the financial products that they use.

Effective financial consumer protection frameworks are also critical for instilling
trust in the formal financial system and for ensuring that expanded financial sector
outreach benefits consumers and the overall economy. A high incidence of conflicts
with financial service providers or low levels of satisfaction with financial products used
could undermine the trust in the formal financial system. Despite making existing
consumers worse off, it can also discourage potential new consumers to enter the market.
As indicated in chapter 1.5, this already appears to be the case in the Philippines since
seventeen percent of the unbanked population cited lack of trust as main obstacle to
formal account ownership.

This chapter assesses the effectiveness of the current financial consumer
protection regime from a demand-side perspective, with a focus on consumers’
satisfaction with financial products and service and consumer redress and dispute
resolution. In order to measure whether products that financially included Filipino adults
use are effectively meeting their needs, the financial capability survey sought to capture
the overall satisfaction of consumers with the eight most common types of providers and
their products and services. To examine the effectiveness of existing consumer redress
mechanisms, this survey asked users of financial services to share their experiences with
current internal and external redress mechanisms, and identified segments of the
population that are more likely to have encountered a conflict with a financial service
provider in the past three years.




The survey results suggest that although commercial banks have the highest
financial sector outreach, they appear to be less likely to cater the needs of their




                                             47
customers, as compared to six other types of financial service providers18. Figure 15
indicates that banks seem to meet the needs of only 43 percent of their client base, a
satisfaction rate which is only slightly higher than the 37 percent achieved among
brokerage services users. On the other side of the spectrum, MFIs achieved the highest
satisfaction rate among their clients (75 percent), followed by money transfers with 64
percent, and money changers with 57 percent. The usage of agents as distributors of e-
money has been favored by policy makers in the Philippines given cost and convenience
benefits of this distribution model. However, user experience with their services suggests
that not all of them meet their clients’ needs. Only around 50 percent of those who used
their services reported to be satisfied with providers of digital financial services.

A closer look into bank satisfaction rates among different use profiles reveals that
banks are less likely to cater the needs of men, young adults, and rural dwellers as
compared to their respective counterpart groups. Notably, women in the Philippines
are not only more likely than men to be financially included but they are also more likely
to benefit from their participation in the formal financial sector. This finding is mirrored in
the fact that female Filipinos are 12 percentage points more likely than men to be satisfied
with the bank services they used. As illustrated in figure 16, age also plays an important
role in explaining differences in bank satisfaction rates. Even larger differences in bank


18 It has to be noted that satisfaction rates are by nature subjective and the client pool differs between
different types of providers. However, this finding holds even if we look at the same pool of customers. For
instance, even if we compare holders of bank products who currently use products from other types of
providers, bank products still seem to relatively cater their needs less than products from other financial
institutions.

satisfaction rates can be observed between urban and rural dwellers suggesting that they
are not only less likely to participate in the formal financial sector but also less likely to
benefit from it once they do.

A big worry is that a substantial proportion – almost a fifth - of the surveyed adult
population experienced a dispute with a financial service provider in the past three
years, the large majority of which did, however, not pursue any actions to resolve
it. The proportion of reported disputes within the past three years in the overall population
is relatively higher in the Philippines than in those few countries for which similar survey
data is available. For example, a comparable survey in Mozambique revealed that in the
past three years 15 percent of the surveyed population encountered a dispute with a
financial service provider, while in Mongolia only five percent, and in Tajikistan only one
percent of the sample reportedly experienced similar disputes. Figure 17 shows that
inertia is the most common response in the event of a dispute and only around a quarter
of those who experienced a dispute actually tried to solve it. When asking those who had
not experienced a financial service provider conflict in the past three years about actions




                                                           49
they would take in the event of such a dispute, around half of them indicated that they
preferred not to take any actions.

Delving deeper into the characteristics of those who encountered a conflict, the
survey results suggest that low income populations and retirees are among the
groups most vulnerable to having faced a financial dispute. The bottom 25 percent
of the income distribution is not only less likely to use formal financial products and
services they are also more likely to experience a financial dispute once they participated
in the formal financial sector, as compared to the richest 25 percent. While only 16 percent
of the richest 25 percent encountered a financial service provider, around a fifth of the
bottom of the pyramid stated that they encountered a conflict in the past three years (see
figure 17). As compared to the active working force, retirees on the other hand enjoy
relatively better usage levels of financial services, they are, however, also more likely to
having encountered a financial dispute. Twenty three percent of retired population had
experienced such disputes in the last three years, compared to 18 percent for those who
were not retired. Regression analysis reveals that these differences are significant even
after controlling for other socioeconomic and demographic factors (see table 9 in
Appendix B).

Major reasons for not trying to solve a dispute include perceived lengthy time of
proceedings, the view that financial providers are simply too powerful, as well as
lack of trust in the efficiency of the respective government authorities. While two
thirds of the surveyed financial consumers stated that lack of time to go through the
process was the main reason for their inertia, 60 percent stated that lack of trust in the
effectiveness of government authorities was the main perceived obstacle to taking any
actions. Forty three percent indicated that they did not pursue actions to resolve the
dispute due to their lack of confidence. Nearly half of those who did not try to solve a
conflict stressed that they lack awareness of appropriate government agencies they could
approach for help. These findings are consistent with those of the 2014 WB Diagnostic

require financial institutions at a minimum to resolve complaints within a reasonable
timeframe and to raise public awareness about BSP’s FCPD, in particular about its
mission of providing a comprehensive external complaints resolution service. In addition,
in order to increase overall trust in FCPD’s effectiveness, it requires powers to make
binding decisions.




Source: WB Financial Capability Survey, Philippines 2014

In terms of actions taken in the event of a dispute, external systems of redress such
as BSP’s FCPD were barely sought by financial customers who experienced
conflicts with financial providers. Most of those who experienced a conflict and took
any actions to resolve it, decided to approach the provider through friends and family (50
percent), followed by a significant proportion that simply stopped using their services
before contract expiration (44 percent). Besides friends and family members, local power-
holders were also frequently sought in the event of a dispute to help those facing the
conflict in approaching the service providers (26 percent). Only four percent of consumers
actually used formal external systems of redress for settling financial disputes they
encountered: three percent submitted a claim to the appropriate government authority
including FCPD, while one percent approached the legal courts.
