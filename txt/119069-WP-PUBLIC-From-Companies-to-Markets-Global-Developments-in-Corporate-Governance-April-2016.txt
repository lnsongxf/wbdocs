            The Nordic solution is distinctly different from both of these more widely known models. It is neither
            a mixture of, nor a compromise between, the two. Instead it differs from both in three fundamental
            ways:

                • It allocates virtually all power to the general-meeting majority by placing this body on top of
                    a hierarchical chain of command in which each company organ is strictly subordinate to the
                                                                                  	 gure.

                • It vests the board with far-reaching powers to manage the company during its mandate
                    period. Still it may be dismissed by the shareholders at any time and without stated cause,
                    thus ensuring clear subordination to the general meeting and strict accountability to the
                    shareholders.

                • It makes a clear distinction between the non-executive board and the executive management
                    function, appointed and dismissed at any time at the sole discretion of the board, again entailing
                    a strict hierarchy that ensures accountability.

One of the corporate governance challenges companies
must deal with is to ensure that all shareholders are pro-
tected in the face of related-party transactions. RPTs can be
beneficial, but they are subject to conflicts of interest and             The number of jurisdictions in each category
are potentially abusive to some shareholders. The OECD                   and percentage share out of all 41 jurisdictions
recognizes the importance of RPTs and has introduced two
guidance papers on the topic (OECD 2009b; OECD 2012).               Source: (OECD 2015b).

  Some jurisdictions have legal definitions for independent directors which may or may not be as stringent as IFC’s definition. If such a definition
exists, consult with the Corporate Governance Group as to whether such definition would be appropriate. If, for a particular reason, the Investment
Department intends that the IFC Nominee Director be deemed to be an Independent Director, consult with the Corporate Governance Group
(www.ifc.org/corporategovernance).
2
  Depending on the availability of qualified independent directors in a particular country, the term could be shortened to seven (7) years. Consult
with the Corporate Governance Group if this is an issue.
3
  Consult with local counsel as to the relevant percentage, if any, specified by local law (which may apply to publicly listed or unlisted companies,
or both). For example, in the United Kingdom, a shareholder is treated as having a material (disclosable) interest in a publicly listed company if it
holds 3% of the shares; in the United States, the equivalent threshold is 5%.
