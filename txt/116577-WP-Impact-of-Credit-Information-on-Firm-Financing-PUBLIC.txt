Background
Firms, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) state that access to credit is one of the main
constraints on their growth.

The theoretical literature on credit information emphasizes that information sharing schemes can
impact firm financing (see Pagano and Jappelli, 1993; Padilla and Pagano, 1997; Klein, 1992;
Vercammen, 1995; Padilla and Pagano, 2000).

But the existing evidence is limited and, with few exceptions, subject to identification problems.

Objectives
This paper explores the impact of credit information sharing reforms on firm financing.

The study analyzes the effect of the establishment of private credit bureaus (CBs) and public credit
registries (CRs) on five measures of firm financing:

       Whether the firm has a loan.
       The interest rate charged on the latest loan.
       The maturity of the latest loan.
       The share of working capital (WC) financed by bank lending.
       The share of fixed (FA) assets financed by bank lending.

The study combines data from the Doing Business, Enterprise Surveys, and World Development
Indicators databases.

Doing Business: From internal raw data for the Getting Credit module the study is able to establish
which countries have a credit bureau (CB) and/or credit registry (CR) and the year of their introduction.
The study also collects data on the scope and quality of the credit information databases by using the
depth of credit information index and the percentage coverage of CBs and CRs.

Enterprise surveys: The study uses firm-level data for over 75,000 firms from 63 countries across the
period 2002-2013 where at least two surveys were conducted. The study focuses on five aspects of
firms’ access to finance:

       Whether they have a loan, line of credit or overdraft protection.
       Interest rate paid on the most recent loan.
       Maturity of the most recent loan.
       Fraction of working capital financed by banks.
       Fraction of fixed assets financed by banks

The study also obtains information on different firm characteristics including firm size, age, ownership
type, exporter status, and sector

World Development Indicators: The study used country-level data on inflation, GDP growth, and credit
to the private sector.

Methodology

The study’s identification strategy relies on the fact that there are countries in the sample that
introduced a CB/CR during the survey period and countries that never adopted such credit information
sharing schemes.

The study uses a quasi-difference-in-difference approach to estimate causal impact:

       Treatment group consists of countries where a CB/CR was introduced in between two or more
        available survey years.
       Control group consists of countries with two or more years of Enterprise Surveys, but where
        CBs/CRs were never introduced.

The study includes country fixed effects to control for time-invariant country characteristics that could
explain differences across countries in firms’ access to finance.

The study includes time fixed effects to control for common time effects that can explain differences in
firm financing over time (e.g., global crisis).

Finance indicator refers to the five measures of firm financing
Credit information reform is a dummy variable that take value 1 for treatment countries after reform
and 0 otherwise.

X is a matrix of firm-level characteristics including firm size, age, ownership type, exporter status, and
sector (manufacturing versus services).

Z refers to a matrix of country-level variables that might influence firms’ access to finance (i.e., inflation
rate, GDP growth rate, private credit/GDP).

 are the country fixed effects.

γ are time effects.

The credit information reform dummy can be thought of as the interaction between a treatment
dummy (1 for treatment countries) and a post reform dummy (1 for years after reform).

The reform variables along with two way country and time fixed effects makes our empirical
methodology akin to a difference-in-difference format, comparing countries with and without reform,
and years pre- and post-reform.

ε are robust standard errors clustered at country-year level.

Note: For the Credit Registry/Bureau reform regressions, the treatment sample consists of countries with a Credit
Registry/Bureau reform in between two or more years of available Enterprise Survey data. The control sample
consists of countries with two or more years of Enterprise Surveys, but where Credit Registry/Bureau do not exist.

Conclusions and Recommendations
CB reforms but not CR reforms have an effect on firm financing.

After the introduction of a CB:

          A larger share of firms has access to finance.
          Interest rates drop.
          Maturity lengthens.
          The share of working capital financed by banks increases.

Effects of CB reform are more pronounced the greater the coverage of the CB and the scope and
accessibility of the credit information sharing scheme.

Some evidence that CB reform effects are more pronounced for younger, smaller and more opaque
firms.
