Executive Summary

Introduction to the South Asia Regional Gender Action Plan (RGAP)

The South Asia RGAP for the period FY16-21 applies a gender lens to the World Bank Group
(WBG)’s work in the region. In doing so, it outlines a path to enhance the potential of women and
men as agents of change toward the World Bank Group’s (WBG) twin goals of poverty reduction
and shared prosperity. This Plan reflects and reaffirms the WBG’s strong corporate commitment
to gender equality, as articulated in the World Bank Group Gender Strategy (FY16-23): Gender
Equality, Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth (2015a); the World Development Report
2012, Gender Equality and Development (World Bank 2011a); and the South Asia Regional
Strategy Update for FY16.

The RGAP adapts the three-pillar framework (endowments, economic opportunities, and voice
and agency) of the WDR 2012 and the WBG Gender Strategy (FY16-23) to call for coordinated
efforts across GPs in three critical focus areas, which serve as three of the RGAP’s four pillars:
(1) human capital, which includes improved attainment and quality of education, development
of marketable skills, and improved health and nutrition outcomes; (2) economic empowerment
through more and better-quality jobs, and reduced disparities in access to finance and asset
ownership and control; and (3) voice and agency, to reduce the prevalence and social tolerance
of gender-based violence, as well as to enhance women’s roles in decision-making at the
household, community, and higher government levels. The RGAP captures the region’s most
critical gender inequalities within these focus areas, as addressing such inequalities is not only an
important goal in itself, but also key to achieving the aforementioned twin goals. In addition, the
RGAP has a fourth pillar related to building capacity for and communication about the WBG’s
gender work in the South Asia region (SAR).

In order to advance progress in these focus areas, the RGAP underscores the need for heightened
attention to three cross-cutting themes. The first is gender norms—that is, socially and culturally
constructed roles, responsibilities, and expectations attributed to men and women. Pervasive in all
aspects of life and reproduced across generations, men’s and women’s different aspirations and
responsibilities in traditional household roles play out in educational, career, and life choices. The
second theme is mobility, which relates to gendered rules and practices about movement, conduct
and access to public spaces that lead to gender inequalities in access to health, education,
employment, and social and professional networks; and the third is conflict-affected, fragile
and/or disaster-prone situations that characterize large parts of South Asia and can impose
severe constraints on development outcomes, especially for women and girls. Drawing from the
WBG’s work within and outside the region, the RGAP provides a number of good practice
examples of how to effectively address a range of gender issues in conflict-affected and fragile
contexts.

Using these organizing frameworks, the RGAP presents a cross-GP, cross-country plan whose
objective is to guide WBG staff and management toward addressing complex and persistent
gender inequalities in SAR. By understanding how gender plays a role in the sector-specific
technical issues of each GP and the development outcomes of each country, and through gaining
improved knowledge of evidence-based approaches that effectively reduce gender gaps, SAR can
address poor gender outcomes more strategically and collaboratively than ever before.


                                                                                                    7
       The centerpiece of this RGAP is the Country Gender Action planning activities outlined in
       Chapter 1, which are derived from the diagnostics and guidance presented in Chapters 2-4,
       and result in Country Gender Action Briefs (CGABs). Given significant variation across
       countries in gender outcomes and in country program resources to address them, the RGAP will
       ultimately contain country-level targets—rather than regional commitments—in its three main
       pillars. The fourth pillar on capacity building and communication has regional-level targets.

       Chapter 2 summarizes key gender issues in the region (with attention to contextual variations
       across countries). Chapter 3 discusses determinants of gender inequalities and effective
       approaches (“what works”) to address them. Finally, Chapter 4 helps prioritize objectives in
       tackling gender inequalities and offers recommendations on how the Bank’s GPs, cross-cutting
       solutions areas (CCSAs) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) can work with country
       teams to accelerate progress toward improving outcomes for both women and men, girls and
       boys, in SAR countries.

       Chapter 1. Regional Roadmap for Action, FY16-21

       Based on the diagnostics in Chapters 2-4, the RGAP’s first three pillars of human capital,
       economic empowerment, and voice and agency suggest priority outcomes on which to focus work
       on gender. Suggested priority outcomes within each pillar take into consideration the WBG’s
       comparative advantage and entry points where returns to investment can be maximized (see
       Chapter 1 for a discussion of this comparative advantage in reducing gender inequalities). The
       cross-cutting fourth pillar involves communication and capacity building to better equip SAR
       staff and management to reduce gender inequalities in the region, to share information across GPs
       about their work on gender, and to implement and monitor the RGAP (see Figure ES. 1).

Country-specific targets under Pillars 1-3 and final priority gender outcomes for the FY16-21
RGAP will be determined by SAR country teams themselves through country gender action
planning. Country-specific gender planning encourages country teams, who work more directly
than other staff on the gender issues in their respective countries, to draw upon their own
experience and knowledge—as well as the analysis and guidance provided by the RGAP—to
identify gender outcomes that require the most urgent attention in each country, especially
outcomes toward which the WBG has a comparative advantage in making progress. The country
planning process will result in a Country Gender Action Brief (CGAB) that outlines the
approaches and tasks that the country program will undertake to help address the priority gender
outcome/s selected by that country team. As summaries of decisions made during the planning
process, CGABs will be drafted by Country Gender Focal Points (GFPs) in collaboration with
Country Management Unit (CMU) Gender Anchors and, if time permits, GFPs from the GP/s that
are most relevant to the selected priority gender outcome/s. Practice Managers (PMs) from those
GPs and the Gender Anchor in each CMU will supervise the drafting of CGABs. The RGAP
aims to have all SAR countries complete their CGABs by mid-December, 2016 (FY17 Q2).
The RGAP’s proposed implementation structure relies on the active involvement and
contributions from all countries, GPs and management levels in SAR. With coordinative
assistance from the SAR Gender Team based in GSURR-Social Development, GPs and CMUs
will work with Country and GP Gender Focal Points (GFPs) to ensure satisfactory fulfillment of
targets outlined in CGABs and under RGAP Pillar 4. The SAR Regional Gender Coordinator and
Gender Team will oversee monitoring and reporting by GFPs, and in turn, will regularly report on
RGAP progress to the Regional Vice President and Gender CCSA.
Most country and regional tasks that meet the targets set by CGABs will have their own budgets
(i.e., loan amounts and preparation/supervision budgets of lending operations), as agreed in Work
Program Agreements (WPA) and other relevant discussions. The RGAP’s Chapter 1 provides
step-by-step instructions for creating CGABs, as well as cost estimates for different approaches
that GPs and country teams can take in order to deepen attention to gender in tasks. An estimate
of the additional budget required to meet targets under Pillar 4, as well as overall coordination
and monitoring of the RGAP, is also provided.

Chapter 2. Background: Progress and Challenges for Gender Equality in the
South Asia Region

South Asia has made substantial gains in certain areas of gender inequality, notably achieving
gender parity in primary education in most countries and narrowing the gaps in secondary
education, adopting progressive legislation to combat violence against women and girls, and
increasing opportunities for women’s participation in local governance. Despite these advances,
poor nutrition and reproductive health outcomes (especially among poor women and adolescents),
gender imbalances in access to economic opportunities and quality of engagement in the
workforce, and unacceptable levels of gender-based violence (GBV) reflect some of the most
glaring gender disparities in the region.

Most gender gaps in South Asia can be attributed, to a large degree, to pervasive and stubborn
social norms that privilege men’s and boys’ access to opportunities and resources over that of
women and girls. Such gender biases are also mediated by other social identities; caste, ethnicity,

                                                                                                  9
and religious affiliation produce heterogeneous experiences of gender norms based on where
women and girls are located within these social hierarchies. Much as macroeconomic growth in a
country does not guarantee the equal distribution of opportunities and resources in a society,
increases in female labor force participation and other improvements in women’s economic
empowerment do not guarantee progress in other gender outcomes. In fact, a growing pool of
research in the South Asia region suggests that meaningful and sustainable advances in women’s
economic empowerment may depend upon first reaching a threshold of decision-making power,
mobility and other indicators of voice and agency—as well as certain human capital attainments.
Many of the region’s success stories in improving and sustaining certain human development
outcomes have been effective largely because they use approaches that circumvent pernicious
gender norms. For example, Bangladesh was able to nearly halve its total fertility rate over two
decades by providing doorstep delivery of family planning services, thus working around
constraints on women’s mobility outside the household. Cash stipends given to poor families
under the well-known and well-evaluated conditional transfer programs in Bangladesh and
Pakistan (and less evaluated programs in Afghanistan and India)—that require families to keep
girls in school—have challenged social biases against girls’ education to significantly improve
schooling rates.

Compared to other regions, South Asia lags in reducing certain gender inequalities, especially in
the area of economic empowerment. Yet, country experiences provide important insights toward
building on and accelerating positive trends, while containing the negative. Looking forward,
regional work on gender must consider critical binding constraints and their underlying causes,
especially the role of gender norms, mobility constraints and the impact of conflict and fragility
that underlie continued gender inequalities in South Asia.

A. Human Capital: Social Norms and a Skills Mismatch Maintain Gender
Inequalities

Despite South Asia’s positive trajectory in narrowing gender disparities in primary and
secondary school enrollments, the significant challenges of school completion and the
quality of learning remain. Most South Asian countries, with the exception of Afghanistan and
Pakistan, have achieved gender parity in primary school enrollments. In secondary education,
school enrollments for girls are on the rise. In some countries, namely Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,
girls’ enrollments even exceed that of boys, raising concerns of a reverse gender bias. However, it
is in attendance and completion of secondary and post-secondary education that gender disparities
disadvantage women most conspicuously. Social norms that place a lower value on female
education and the high prevalence of child marriage in most countries prevent girls from staying
in and completing school. Country gender assessments of Pakistan and Afghanistan show that
gender norms can be exacerbated in conflict-affected and fragile contexts, where heightened
concerns for safety and security restrict girls’ access to education (World Bank 2005b, 2005c,
2014g). A major challenge confronting all South Asian countries today is the uneven and poor
quality of learning (Dundar 2014a). Although the evidence is mixed, girls’ achievement in South
Asia may be lower than boys’ due to gendered household dynamics, such as greater household
responsibilities and gendered expectations that have a negative impact on women’s educational
achievement (ibid.).

Skills development initiatives that pay attention to gender have yielded strong dividends for
women’s productive and sustainable employment. Even though vocational training is available
in all countries, these offerings have been inefficient at linking youth and women to employment
opportunities (Agarwal 2013). More gender analysis is needed to understand bottlenecks and the

                                                                                                 10
different ways in which they affect men and women. A study of Sri Lanka’s technical and
vocational education and training (TVET) programs finds that women who participate in such
programs tend to be limited to a narrower range of skills as compared to men, disadvantaging
their participation in the labor market (Dundar et al. 2014b). Experience from the Bank’s
Adolescent Girls Initiatives in Afghanistan and Nepal shows that addressing context-specific
gender constraints in skills’ training programs can substantially improve the odds of successful
school-to-work transition for young women.

Gender gaps in health outcomes present a larger demographic challenge for South Asia.
Overlooking or neglecting the particular health needs of girls is part of a systemic pattern that
begins in childhood and continues into adolescence and adulthood (Figure ES. 2). The most
measurable gender gaps in health are reflected in excess female child mortality and poor sexual
and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes. The female disadvantage in under-five mortality rates
is especially elevated in India but also high in Nepal and Pakistan, manifesting in high male-to-
female sex ratios and missing women. The prevalence of child marriage—which remains high in

                                                                                                                                           11
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and India—affects adolescent girls disproportionately by
increasing their risk of reproductive health problems, the likelihood of experiencing domestic
violence, and the odds that they will drop out of school before completing secondary or even
primary education. Progress in SRH has been uneven and varies substantially across the region.
Together with poverty and mobility constraints, the rural-urban divide, and differences in income
and education, gender norms hinder progress on SRH and other health outcomes.

The absence of a comprehensive gender lens in nutrition policies and programs is
contributing to the continuation of pervasive under-nutrition across the region. Under-
nutrition compromises the overall health and well-being of a large share of South Asia’s adult and
child population. Gender disparities in nutrition are the most pronounced for women in the
reproductive age group. In India, nearly 30 percent of adolescent girls are severely anemic. In
Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan over a third of all adult women are underweight; and in
Afghanistan, 48 percent of women who are not pregnant but are of childbearing age have an iron
deficiency. The region has the world’s highest prevalence of anemia, estimated in the range of 55
percent to 81 percent, and also records the world’s highest prevalence of child malnutrition and
micronutrient deficiencies, affecting both boys and girls. The poor nutritional status suffered by
most South Asian countries can be traced, in part, to women’s low health and educational status,
as well as gendered power dynamics within the household and community that determine feeding
and other nutrition choices. Compared to other South Asian countries, Sri Lanka’s relative
success in improving child nutrition outcomes (Figure ES. 2) is attributed not only to government
investments that enable better access to maternal and child health services, but also to greater
female autonomy in decisions related to personal and family health care (World Bank 2007).

Labor market segmentation that disadvantages women in access to employment, job
quality, and wages may also be understood in the larger context of South Asia’s urbanizing
economies and related changes in employment patterns. South Asia has the second-lowest rate
of female labor force participation (FLFP) of all global regions—at 32 percent—with women
being almost three times less likely to be employed in full-time jobs than men (World Bank
2014b). South Asian countries’ own estimates, from the most recent nationally representative
labor force surveys, show women’s participation to be substantially lower than men’s in all
countries except Nepal (Figure ES. 3). Moreover, in spite of robust economic growth, the steady
decline of FLFP in India and stagnation in Sri Lanka are significant matters of concern.

Bank-led research on female labor force participation dynamics in Afghanistan (World Bank
2014g), Bhutan (World Bank 2013d), India (Chatterjee et al. 2015), Pakistan (2005b), and Sri
Lanka (World Bank 2014a) suggests some common drivers for low rates of female labor force
participation in these countries: (i) women’s greater share of household responsibilities, including
caring for children and elderly family members; (ii) a skills mismatch between the education and
training girls and women receive and what employers seek; (iii) gender bias in parents’ and
employers’ expectations of men and women, which play out in life choice, job search and hiring
processes; and (iv) mobility constraints that limit women’s employment options due to poor
infrastructure, unsafe public transport, or increasingly distant job markets (World Bank 2006;
2013a). A recent study finds that the decline in FLFP in India can be explained by diminishing
prospects in the agricultural sector that are not met by corresponding increases in job
opportunities in other sectors considered suitable for women (Chatterjee et al. 2015). The
evidence points to the need for demand-side interventions, including boosting job growth to
counter negative FLFP trends. Developing a deeper understanding of the complex interaction of
opportunities and barriers affecting women’s access to and participation in labor markets,
particularly including unemployment patterns for educated and skilled women, and entry to and
exit from the labor market through the lifecycle, is critical to addressing the drivers of low FLFP
in the region. Such an understanding must be developed within the context of each country’s
unique and ongoing economic and social transformation.

Gender differences in access to, ownership of, and control over productive assets have
remained stubbornly persistent, continuing women’s financial exclusion. South Asia has the
world’s largest gender gap (16 percentage points) in having accounts at formal institutions (WDI)
and the lowest proportion of women-owned businesses of any region (WDI). Gender gaps in asset
ownership and control stem less from gender-unequal legal rights to inherit and own land or other
family property than from social norms that discourage the use and enforcement of legal rights.
On one level, legal reforms to remedy gender-biased laws have not kept pace with progress in
other regions (World Bank 2015h). Between 1960 and 2010, South Asia made the least progress
in removing restrictions on women’s legal capacity and property rights (Hallward-Driemeier et al.
2013). On another level, women’s own internalization of social hierarchies—together with lower
household bargaining power, literacy, mobility, and financial awareness compared to men—
contribute heavily to their financial exclusion in most South Asian countries. Research from
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka also shows that even when women have access
to microfinance services such as loans, non-financial barriers restrict the extent to which they are
productively used (Safavian and Haq 2013; World Bank 2005c; World Bank 2014c).

C. Voice and Agency: Signs of Increased Decision-making, though Violence Prevails

Consolidating gains in women’s representation from national to community-level political
and other decision-making institutions will be important for progress on gender outcomes

                                                                                                 13
in the region. Despite an increase in the proportion of seats held by women in national
parliaments—from 8 percent to 19 percent between 2000 and 2014—women continue to be
underrepresented in political institutions. In 2014, South Asia recorded the lowest proportion of
women in ministerial-level positions among all regions (WDI). Legislation in Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, and Pakistan that reserves seats for women in parliament and quotas in candidate
lists in Nepal are positive measures to encourage the expansion of female political representation.
Moreover, the introduction of quotas that reserve seats for women in local governance councils in
Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan carry enormous potential to drive improvements across a broad
range of gender outcomes. Evidence from India shows that women’s participation in Panchayats
(village councils) is associated with greater investment in infrastructure that serves the needs of
other women (Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004), increases in the likelihood of female engagement
in the labor force (Ghani et al. 2013c), higher aspirations of parents for their daughters and among
girls themselves (Beaman et al. 2012), and even increases in documented crimes against women
(Iyer et al. 2011). At the same time, research also points to a number of factors including low
literacy, inadequate training opportunities, household responsibilities, and negative attitudes
towards female representatives that constrain women’s participation in local councils (ICRW and
UN Women 2012). Evidence from large-scale programs that have mobilized women’s
participation in local development and governance, such as Jeevika in India, the National
Solidarity Programme in Afghanistan, and the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation program in
Nepal, bodes well for strengthening substantive opportunities to enhance women’s voice and
agency in community decision-making processes.

The tolerance of gender-based violence, prevalent in myriad forms in all eight SAR
countries, puts girls and women at risk throughout the life cycle (Figure ES 4). Starting from
birth, girl children are at high risk of infanticide, child abuse, and especially child marriage and
(compared to boys) excess child mortality due to relative neglect. Once women are engaged or
married, they become highly vulnerable to dowry-related violence, intimate partner violence, and
violence perpetrated by other family members in the marital household. Symptomatic of deeper
gender-based inequalities that disadvantage women in almost all spheres of life, the high
tolerance of violence against women and girls reinforces gender differences in voice and agency,
as well as in human capital accumulation and economic empowerment. All countries in the region
have laws against child abuse, child marriage, acts of sexual violence, intimate partner violence,
and trafficking. However, poor implementation of laws against such abuse, lack of awareness of
these laws among the general public and law enforcement, and structural weaknesses in police
and judicial systems render them ineffective, denying women access to justice (Solotaroff and
Pande 2014).
D. Gender in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations

The adverse repercussions of conflict, fragility, and violence cut across all three focus areas
identified in this RGAP and are felt across several countries in the region. As of June 2015,
Afghanistan and Pakistan were home to a majority of the region’s internally displaced persons
(IDPs) due to violent conflict (UNHCR 2015). Nepal and Sri Lanka have suffered heavily from
natural disasters in addition to experiencing protracted civil conflicts. In Chapters 2 and 3, the
RGAP underscores the gendered impacts of these shocks, which can result in fewer years of
schooling, lower access to health and other basic services, more vulnerable employment, reduced
opportunities for productive economic engagement, and a higher risk of gender-based violence.
The Bank’s expanded engagement in fragile and conflict-affected settings is increasingly helping
better understand the links between conflict and fragility and gender inequality, as well as
possible approaches to address them. Yet, evidence building on effective strategies and their
incorporation in operations merits greater attention—especially in South Asia—where the
knowledge base is currently very thin. Chapter 4 distills some promising practices that have been
implemented in South Asia and other regions and provides details of how progress has been made
in mainstreaming gender considerations in fragile contexts.

E. The Impact of Mobility Constraints on Gender Outcomes

Constraints on women’s mobility limit access to markets and essential services, which in turn
reinforce gender disparities. Such restrictions may arise from gender norms that prescribe
women’s movement and travel in specific ways. Poor infrastructure exacerbates these constraints.
For example, the absence of safe public transport or lack of proper streetlights, places women at
greater risk of experiencing violence and sexual assault, circumscribing women’s freedom to
travel. A lack of water infrastructure or access to energy sources makes South Asian women’s
household work more time-consuming, labor intensive, and physically and mentally exacting,
leaving less time to engage in educational or economic opportunities outside the house. Citing
evidence and good practice examples, the RGAP emphasizes the enabling role of infrastructure
towards improving gender outcomes in the region by easing constraints on women’s mobility.

Chapter 3. What Do We Know About What Works?

Operations’ preparation studies, Results Frameworks (RFs) and Impact Evaluations (IEs) of
operations and pilots offer lessons for taking successful approaches to scale and also for

                                                                                                 15
accelerating gender-relevant data collection and analysis. The RGAP draws on evidence from the
region to highlight effective approaches to reducing gender inequalities. Based on a review of
robust empirical evidence from IEs of Bank pilots and operations, and drawing from program
evaluations by external sources where rigorous impact evaluations do not exist, some key lessons
have been identified. These are:

1. Education and Skills Development

   Cash transfers—especially those which are conditional—have significantly improved girls’
    enrollment and retention rates, while simultaneously reducing instances of child marriage.
   Cash transfers have been seen to positively influence other gender outcomes too, especially
    those related to women’s voice and agency.
   Awareness raising programs can improve communities’ knowledge about issues of gender—
    including child marriage.
•   Promoting local female leadership can help prevent instances of child marriage.
•   Some evidence indicates that life-skills and livelihoods training can impact rates of child
    marriage.
•   School based programs that provide mentoring, counseling, and psychological support can
    improve girls’ attendance and retention rates by helping redress incidences of child abuse and
    parental and societal pressures.
•   When tailored to the specific needs of young women, market appropriate skills training can
    effectively facilitate girls’ transition from school to productive employment.
2. Health and Nutrition
   Conditional cash transfers can promote greater investments in young girls’ health and
    mitigate excess female child mortality in the short term.
   Investments made early in the lifecycle are critical entry-points for addressing adolescent
    sexual and reproductive health.
   Increased attention to women’s household autonomy and economic empowerment is needed
    to improve nutritional outcomes.
   Interventions are more successful when men engage other men on issues of nutrition and
    family planning.
   Interventions are more successful when they utilize a positive deviance approach to engage
    other household members.
   Engaging health workers, education practitioners, media and community groups through
    cross sectoral interventions can promote gender-sensitive health and nutrition awareness.

3. Economic Empowerment

   Childcare interventions show positive impacts on women’s labor market outcomes.
   Parental and community awareness programs can support women’s participation and
    perseverance in employment.
   Enabling access to employment networks and leveling the playing field by creating merit-
    based opportunities can advance career access and employment for women.
   Improvements in infrastructure not only help reduce women’s time poverty—they can also
    help ease the mobility constraints that prevent women and girls from accessing income
    earning opportunities and other services.
•   Infrastructure interventions also provide evidence of a wide array of gender-related benefits
    beyond reductions in women’s time poverty.

                                                                                                16
•   Community-Driven Development (CDD) approaches that make finance more readily
    accessible to women can promote their economic and social empowerment.
•   In post-conflict contexts, women’s economic and social welfare may be measurably enhanced
    via CDD interventions that promote female engagement in local institution building and
    governance.
•   Measures that secure women’s right to and ownership of land not only have important
    economic benefits; they also shape the gender dynamics that influence human capital and
    empowerment outcomes.
•   Interventions that provide training and financial support to female entrepreneurs show limited
    success, due in large part to the interference of intransigent gender norms.
•   Inversely, when certain gender norms—which often limit voice and agency—are addressed,
    gains in economic empowerment occur.


4. Voice & Agency

   Interventions that increase women’s political leadership demonstrate a wide range of positive
    outcomes for both women and girls.
   Positive messaging through mass media, information campaigns, and/or training on issues
    related to women’s rights and autonomy can improve women’s independent decision-making
    and political participation.
   Engaging men and boys is a promising way to address the attitudes that underlie gender-
    based violence.
   Engaging men in sexual and reproductive health, as well as in family welfare programs shows
    positive outcomes on GBV.
   Engaging girls and boys at an early age increases success in challenging trenchant gender
    norms.
   Promising approaches to address GBV also include creating gender-sensitive platforms
    (online and offline) for information sharing and identification of response services and
    support.

Chapter 4. Where Do We Stand and How Can We Do Better?

In the final chapter, an assessment of South Asia’s performance in meeting corporate
requirements on gender mainstreaming shows that attention to gender in SAR country strategy
documents remains high. The region met the corporate and IDA16 commitments for gender-
informed Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) in FY11, FY12, FY13, and FY15, with 100
percent of CASs, Country Partnership Strategies (CPSs), Country Partnerships Frameworks
(CPFs), and Interim Strategy Notes (ISNs) rated as gender-informed by meeting at least one of
three gender requirements along the following dimensions: analysis, action, and monitoring and
evaluation. SAR has also surpassed the Corporate Scorecard and International Development
Association (IDA) commitments for mainstreaming gender in operations, with 92, 89, and 97.5
percent of lending operations for FY13, FY14, and FY15 rated as gender-informed in at least one
dimension, respectively. SAR is third among regions, behind only East Asia and Pacific (EAP)
and Middle East and North Africa (MNA) in the proportion of gender-informed operations, with
63 percent of operations gender-informed in all three dimensions in FY15.

In spite of increasing proportions of SAR operations being “gender-informed,” it is unclear how
effective these operations are at helping narrow gender gaps that persist in the areas of human
capital, economic empowerment, and voice and agency that are relevant to the sectors/GPs of

                                                                                               17
these operations. Lending operations and other instruments in SAR’s country programs can have
a much greater positive impact on sector-relevant gender outcomes by ensuring that they are more
directly addressing the determinants of gender inequalities and “sticky” gender issues.

Drawing from the review of what works to successfully address key determinants of poor gender
outcomes and improve these outcomes, Chapter 4 discusses the implications of successful
initiatives for GPs seeking to strengthen their impact on gender issues in South Asia. Good
practice approaches are offered for each GP and the IFC to address the priority gender outcomes
on which their work can have the greatest impact. This section also introduces several relevant
indicators for each GP; to the extent possible, these indicators include Corporate Scorecard Tier
2 indicators (World Bank 2015f). These indicators can help GPs better understand, track and
address the determinants of sector-relevant gender inequalities in the long term, including
inequalities that derive from social norms. Suggested indicators are intended to either:
(a) inform design and be incorporated into RFs of relevant GP operations;
(b) inform the design of advisory services and analytics (ASA), especially technical assistance
     (TA) interventions and economic and sector work (ESW); and/or
(c) serve as the basis of hypotheses that are tested in IEs or other evaluations of interventions.
The discussion also features innovative examples of how some GPs already have begun
enhancing their attention to gender in SAR. Many of these examples show how GPs can
effectively work around trenchant and restrictive social norms in the short term, using culturally
appropriate, gender-sensitive approaches to improve outcomes for female as well as male
beneficiaries.

Introduction
Gender equality is integral to the World Bank Group’s goals of eliminating extreme poverty and
enhancing shared prosperity in sustainable ways.

        No society can develop sustainably without transforming the distribution of
        opportunities, resources and choices for males and females so that they have equal power
        to shape their own lives and contribute to their families, communities, and countries.
        Promoting gender equality is smart development policy.

        -   World Bank Group Gender Strategy (FY16-23): Gender Equality, Poverty Reduction,
            and Inclusive Growth, p. 8.

Given the importance of gender equality to the reduction of poverty and shared prosperity, all
World Bank regions are required to produce and monitor a Regional Gender Action Plan
(RGAP). Having completed its first RGAP (FY13-15) as per IDA 16 cycle, the South Asia
Region has now developed its next RGAP (FY16-21) in line with the IDA 17 requirement. The
SAR RGAP presents a cross-global practice (GP), cross-country plan whose objective is to guide
staff and management in the Bank’s South Asia region (SAR) toward addressing the most critical
and persistent gender gaps in South Asia. By understanding how gender plays into the sector-
specific technical issues of each GP and the development outcomes of each country—and through
improved knowledge of evidence-based approaches that effectively reduce gender gaps—SAR
can address poor gender outcomes more strategically and collaboratively than ever before.

The centerpiece of this RGAP is the country gender action planning activities that will draw
from the diagnostics and guidance presented in this document. Due to significant variation
across countries in gender outcomes and in country program resources to address these
outcomes, the RGAP will ultimately consist of country-level targets and commitments in its
three main pillars, rather than regional commitments. During the November 3, 2015 South
Asia Regional Management Team retreat in New Delhi, it was agreed that the RGAP would be
country-driven, with Country Directors leading country teams in planning meetings to decide on
at least one gender priority outcome for the country, from among suggested gender priorities in
the RGAP’s three main pillars. The suggested gender priority outcomes derive from the analysis
and arguments presented throughout the RGAP. Country Teams will then agree on the tasks,
activities and resources needed in country portfolios to make progress in the priority gender
outcome/s. The output of this process will be a Country Gender Action Brief, which is essentially
a country-specific Theory of Change and/or Results Framework toward the desired outcome/s.

Step-by-step guidelines for the Country Gender Action planning process can be found in Chapter
1; a flow chart of the process can be found in Figure 1.3. This RGAP also provides considerable
substantive guidance for Country Gender Planning through: (a) an exhaustive description of
gender issues in the region across development dimensions, with country comparisons from the
latest available data (Chapter 2); (b) examples of rigorously evaluated interventions that have
effectively made progress on various gender outcomes (Chapter 3); (b) guidance for each GP on
which priority outcome/s it is best placed to support, given its sector-relevant gender issues, and
good practice examples of how to make progress (Chapter 4); and (c) statistical gender country
profiles to convey the gender issues in which each country needs to make the most progress
(Annex G).




                                                                                                 22
The document as a whole provides a regional storyline about the continuing challenges for
women’s and girls’ empowerment and reduced gender inequalities, with attention to contextual
variations across countries. Organizing gender issues under the three pillars of human capital
development, economic empowerment, and voice and agency, it employs and adapts the three-
pillar framework (endowments, economic opportunities, and voice and agency) of the WDR 2012
on Gender and Development (World Bank 2011a) and the recent WBG Gender Strategy FY16-23
(2015e).

Most gender gaps in South Asia can be attributed, to a large degree, to pervasive and stubborn
social norms that privilege men’s and boys’ access to opportunities and resources over women’s
and girls’. Much as macroeconomic growth in a country does not guarantee the equal distribution
of opportunities and resources in a society, increases in female labor force participation and other
improvements in women’s economic empowerment do not guarantee progress in other gender
outcomes. In fact, a growing pool of research in the South Asia region suggests that meaningful
and sustainable advances in women’s economic empowerment may depend upon first reaching a
threshold of decision-making power, mobility and other indicators of voice and agency—as well
as certain human capital attainments.

In the South Asia region in particular, gender norms can be so intractable that they obstruct
progress across all dimensions: endowments, economic opportunities, and voice and agency—for
men as well as women. For example, although there are few gender gaps in nutritional outcomes,
the poor nutritional status suffered by all South Asian countries can be traced, in part, to gendered
power dynamics within the household that determine feeding and other nutrition choices. The
most pronounced, measurable gender gaps in other aspects of health include excess female child
mortality and poor sexual and reproductive health (especially among adolescents). High
prevalence of child marriage among girls in most South Asian countries raises their risk of
reproductive health problems, their likelihood of experiencing domestic violence, and the odds
that they will drop out of school before completing secondary or even primary education.

Low rates of educational attainment and poor quality of education—especially at secondary and
higher levels— restrict youth from obtaining decent and sustainable employment. Women’s
larger share of low and vulnerable employment compared to men’s is as much an issue of labor
demand as it is of labor supply. Market failure stems in part from demand-side factors of
women’s labor—the combination of a lack of marketable skills and shrinking employment
opportunities for women as labor moves from rural to urban economies (Chatterjee, Murgai and
Rama 2015)—and is exacerbated by constraints on women’s labor force supply. These
constraints are explored in Chapter 3, and the means by which to address these constraints are
discussed extensively in Chapter 4. Given the rapidly urbanizing context of South Asia,
governments and development partners need to ensure that women are acquiring the appropriate
skills and have access to the supporting infrastructure that will allow them to obtain jobs in
growth sectors, as well as enforce laws that protect women in the workplace. At the same time,
creating more jobs in growth sectors can help secure an increase in women’s employment (ibid.).

Gender gaps in asset ownership that stem, to a large degree, from gender-unequal legal rights to
inherit and own land and other family property, or from failures to enforce equal rights and
ensure other forms of financial inclusion, further constrain women’s economic empowerment in
South Asian countries. Reform of formal and informal institutions such as laws and social norms,
respectively, will be necessary to engender long-term improvements in women’s voice and
agency, especially in mitigating gender-based violence (GBV) and enhancing women’s decision-
making roles in the household and community, and at various levels of government. Gender-
biased social norms work on these multiple levels to undermine women’s voice and agency,

                                                                                                  23
reinforcing the cycle of gender inequality and reproducing it across generations. Challenging
these trenchant norms will require multi-sectoral programs that combine awareness-raising
efforts, targeted interventions to close gender gaps in endowments and economic opportunities,
and legal and institutional reform that supports women’s ability to exercise their agency as equal
citizens to men.

In the near term, gender-aware interventions in transport, water and other infrastructure sectors
can reduce the time-burden on women and improve their safe access to markets and services.
Such interventions can bring more rapid improvements to women’s and girls’ endowments,
economic opportunities, and other measures of empowerment. In particular, these interventions
help support policy and programmatic interventions on demand and supply-side labor market
constraints to more successively achieve improvements in women’s economic empowerment.

Based on agreements made during the September 16, 2015 Draft RGAP Decision Meeting,
the subsequent November RMT retreat, and the Review Meeting on February 8, 2016, this
document is organized into the following four chapters.

1. Chapter I-The South Asia Regional Roadmap for Action, FY16-21 identifies priority
   gender outcomes for each of the four pillars; the first three of which correspond to the
   analysis presented in Chapters 2–4. It also discusses the planning process and commitments
   at the country level for Pillars 1-3 and regional-level targets and activities for Pillar 4, which
   addresses the training and capacity building needs of SAR staff and management to work on
   gender using sector-relevant, strategic approaches. Finally, Chapter I outlines roles and
   responsibilities of SAR staff and management in the implementation and monitoring of the
   RGAP, then estimates associated costs of implementing the Plan. The chapter additionally
   suggests budget resources to cover these costs.
2. Chapter II-Background describes in detail the critical gender inequalities that prevail in
   South Asian countries, including gender gaps in endowments (specifically, human capital
   development), economic opportunities (specifically, economic empowerment), and voice and
   agency (specifically, gender-based violence, political participation, and household and
   community level decision-making). Discussion of determinants of these gender gaps and
   issues is left for the following chapter, allowing for an in-depth, research-driven discussion of
   the factors that underlie these gaps.
3. Chapter III-What Do We Know? first summarizes research findings that identify
   determinants of poor gender outcomes and key persistent gender gaps in South Asia. It then
   reviews the evidence on what we know works to effectively address key gaps.
4. Chapter IV-Strategic Attention to Gender: Where Do We Stand and How Can We Do
   Better? provides a review and assessment of progress made on integrating gender into Bank
   operations and ASA throughout the previous RGAP, during FY13-15. Drawing from the
   findings of Chapter II, it then offers selected good practices for each of the Global Practices,
   suggesting indicators that GPs could track to help address sector-relevant gender outcomes.
   Innovative examples from each GP’s work in South Asia are also provided.

Chapter I. The South Asia Regional Roadmap for Action, FY16-21

A. Regional Gender Action Plan: Focus Areas, Pillars and Priority Outcomes

The RGAP for the three-year period, FY16-21, applies a gender lens to the World Bank’s work in
South Asia in order to enhance the potential of women and men as agents of change. This Plan
reflects and reaffirms the World Bank Group’s strong corporate commitment to gender equality,
as articulated in the new WBG Gender Strategy FY16-23; the World Development Report 2012,
Gender Equality and Development, and the Regional Companion Piece to the WDR (“Gender in
South Asia: Gaining Ground)”; as well as in the Implications Paper, Corporate Scorecard, IDA 16
and IDA 17 commitments; the South Asia Regional Update for FY16; and the new IEG report,
which call for key WBG sectors to better integrate gender and report on related outcomes.1
The following chapters describe the region’s most egregious gender gaps and their determinants,
present the evidence base on effective means of addressing these determinants, and provide
guidance for GPs to tackle sector-relevant determinants and improve key gender outcomes. This
chapter draws on all of the above in restating the RGAP’s three key focus areas—Human Capital;
Economic Empowerment; and Voice and Agency (see Figure 1.1).
The RGAP’s three focus areas correspond loosely to the conceptual framework laid out in the
WDR 2012 (with its pillars of Endowments, Economic Empowerment, and Voice & Agency) and
are aligned with the priorities of the WBG Gender Strategy FY16-23. Most importantly, the focus
areas capture the critical gender issues that that the region must address, as argued in the
following chapters (Figure 1.2).

   To summarize: improving human capital will require attention to gender gaps in school
   enrollment and completion rates, especially for secondary school; education and skills training
   curricula need to better ensure that girls are acquiring marketable skills to ease transition into the
   workplace; and advancements in the region’s persistently poor nutrition and sexual reproductive
   health outcomes will require more tailoring of interventions to reach adolescents and to challenge
   gender norms that underlie excess female child mortality and child marriage, among other social
   ills. Increasing women’s economic empowerment is dependent upon bringing more women
   into the labor force—in large part by reducing their time poverty—and aligning their skills,
   interests, and aspirations with jobs in economic growth sectors, particularly within the private
   sector; and upon their greater financial inclusion through increased access not only to credit and
   supporting financial services, but also to ownership and control over land and other assets.
   Enhancing women’s voice and agency in South Asia necessitates challenging gender biases and
   other social norms that exclude women from decision-making dynamics in households, political
   bodies, and workplaces; and that curtail their mobility and deny their safety from neglect and
   violence in every stage of their lives.

                                                                                                           27
Based on these considerations, the RGAP has four (4) pillars. The first three pillars identify
priority outcomes that respond to the key issues in the three focus areas. These are suggested
outcomes on which SAR could focus in the coming years to effectively and sustainably address
gender issues that are critical for reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity.

Priority outcomes within Pillars 1-3 account for the WBG’s comparative advantage and
entry points where returns to investment can be maximized. Cross-cutting Pillar 4 involves
capacity building and communication to better equip SAR staff and management to implement
the RGAP.
Unlike the fourth pillar, which has well-defined regional targets for the RGAP period (See
Section C, below), Pillars 1-3 do not have specific targets for the region. Instead, targets will
be country-specific, to be determined by SAR country teams themselves once they have agreed
upon the priority gender outcome (or outcomes) to work toward in the FY16-21 country
portfolios (see Section B, on Country Gender Action Planning, below).

The RGAP pillars also take into account the three cross-cutting themes of (i) gender norms;
(ii) mobility; and (iii) conflict-affected, fragile and/or disaster prone environments, seeking
to strategically address them in ongoing and future work to ensure greater impact on priority
outcomes (see Chapter 3 for detailed discussions on these themes).

B. RGAP’s Intended Audience and WBG Comparative Advantage

Regional Gender Action Plans are internal documents that serve to guide WBG regions—and
specifically the countries within them—in progressing toward improved gender equality in
regional and country programming and through such mechanisms as greater gender-informed
design of operations, improved monitoring and evaluation of gender-relevant outcomes in
operations and technical assistance, practical gender diagnostics, and capacity building and
information sharing. The primary audience for this RGAP is thus everyone working within the
WBG’s South Asia region: management as well as staff, regional and country teams as well GP
teams. However, in its dialogue with government clients, the WBG could use the RGAP as a tool
to leverage greater government buy-in to strategic integration of gender concerns into policy and,
in particular, programming. The RGAP FY16-21 is suited to encouraging government ownership
in offering the following:
         (i)      Diagnosis of which gender outcomes need most urgent attention in SAR
                  countries (Chapter 2 and Country Gender Statistical Profiles in Annex G);
         (ii)     Evidence base on what causes countries to lag in these outcomes and—more to
                  the point—what works to improve them and through which sectors (Chapters 3-
                  4);
         (iii)    Proof of SAR country management’s commitment to and prioritization of
                  improving particular gender outcomes.

Because the WBG’s comparative advantage in gender work manifests through its operations,
analytics, and other technical support, the RGAP can drive or inform discussions between TTLs
and their counterparts in line ministries about operations or other WBG assistance. Moreover, the
RGAP can and should help stimulate dialogue between CDs and Ministries of Finance in making
the case that “gender is smart economics” and deserves greater attention in lending portfolios.
CMUs and the rest of country teams also may choose to share this RGAP with donor agencies

                                                                                                28
and other development partners to convey the WBG’s commitment to strategic gender work in
SAR countries and to strengthening capacity (both internal and external) to closing critical gender
gaps in the countries.

Using the RGAP as a guide for discussions with client counterparts may be most effective when
discussing policy or programming that falls in the RGAP’s first two pillars: in human
development and economic empowerment. The WBG has a comparative advantage in both—in
improving select human development outcomes, especially through conditional cash transfer
programs, and in its longstanding global expertise in economic development and poverty
reduction (see Chapters 3 and 4 for a detailed discussion of WBG-supported achievements in both
of these areas). As for the third pillar, the WBG is a relative newcomer to the development
dimension of voice and agency, especially in comparison to civil society organizations (CSOs)
and women’s movements that have been active in this area for decades—through GBV
prevention and response programming, advocacy efforts for women’s greater voice and agency in
government and work spaces, and countless other initiatives. More recently and on a lesser scale,
governments in South Asia also have been addressing GBV issues through legislation and, in
some countries, through multi-sectoral programs on violence against women and girls (e.g., in the
Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, Government of Bangladesh). Select countries also institute
quota systems to ensure women’s representation in government bodies (see Chapter 2 for details),
thus challenging social norms that are biased against women’s voice and agency in the public
sphere.

Discussed at length in Chapter 3, societal norms are at the heart of most persistent gender gaps. A
survey of men and women in 20 countries (including Afghanistan, Bhutan and India in SAR), done
as background to the WDR 2012, confirms that gender norms, beliefs, and attitudes dictate both
what is acceptable behavior for men and women and, by implication, what is permissible for them
to do.2 The WDR 2015 on Mind, Society and Behavior describes how a behavioral lens can be
central to achieving development outcomes. This lens and approach is even more relevant for
complex and deeply rooted beliefs, attitudes and behaviors such as on gender.
In its gender work on voice and agency issues (especially sensitive issues such as GBV), the WBG’s
greatest value-added has always been through its operations (for example, when organizing women
into self-help groups as a part of rural livelihoods projects or, more recently, through GBV
interventions in the relevant sectors) and analytical works like those mentioned above. Advocacy
is not an area in which the Bank works; this is the comparative advantage of local stakeholders in
SAR countries, such as CSOs.
While a focus on changing norms—more specifically behavior change—is quite new in the Bank,
the organization has begun to develop expertise in this area, especially in its ability to design
innovative programs and rigorous means to measure changes in behaviors. For example, the
Global INsights Initiative (GINI) team in the Development Economics Department (DEC) is in
the process of designing behavior change pilots, a team in the Development Impact Evaluation
Initiative (DIME) is utilizing rigorous evaluation methods to evaluate the impact of entertainment
education programs on HIV/AIDS and GBV, and in India, the WEvolve initiative (see Box 4.2) is

using the creative sector and storytelling to raise awareness and change gender norms. World
Bank operations present a valuable—yet mostly untapped—entry point not just for piloting
behavior change interventions, but also for measuring behaviors over the longer term. In South
Asia, for example, many of the livelihoods and conditional cash transfer programs have multiple
phases which can allow for evaluation of behavior change interventions to capture short, medium
and long term results. Moreover, the South Asia Gender Innovation Lab (see Chapter 4) is
piloting new survey techniques to more accurately estimate the prevalence of GBV (see details in
Chapter 4 and Annex C).


C. Country Gender Action Planning (Pillars 1, 2 and 3)

Country gender action planning takes into consideration the variation among different SAR
countries in many of the priority gender outcomes suggested in Pillars 1, 2 and 3, as well as
differences in each country program’s resources to aggressively address gender issues. Country-
specific gender planning encourages country teams, who work more directly than other staff on
the gender issues in their respective countries, to draw upon their own experience and knowledge
in identifying the crucial gender outcomes that need most urgent attention in each country.
The output of gender planning is a Country Gender Action Brief (CGAB), which each
Country Director (CD) delivers to the SAR Vice President (SARVP) for final approval. The
Gender Team in GSURR-Social then incorporates CGAB targets into RGAP Pillars 1-3. CGABs
can be accompanied by substantiating material if necessary; however, countries are encouraged to
produce 1-2 page briefs, rather than full Country Gender Action Plans, for the following reasons:
      All SAR countries have sufficient existing diagnostic materials (e.g., country gender
          assessments, policy reports on key gender gaps in the country, sector-specific gender
          analyses, gender technical staff working on country teams, etc.) to identify the most
          critical, country-specific gender issues—that is, without needing to undertake the
          substantial gender analysis usually involved for Gender Action Plans;
      The RGAP presents country-level comparisons to highlight critical gender issues in SAR
          countries (see Chapters 2-3) and already has compiled the relevant country data for the
          full range of development dimensions (see Country Statistical Profiles in Annex G);
      The RGAP identifies successful (evaluated) programs and good-practice examples of
          how GPs can improve sector-relevant gender outcomes (see Chapters 3-4);
      The CGAB conforms with the examples and guidance presented in the WBG Gender
          Strategy FY16-23 for country gender action planning (see Figure 1.3, below)
      The RGAP offers step-by-step guidance to ensure country teams follow an efficient and
          inclusive process for delivering CGABs.

Suggested step-by-step actions, reference materials, and related outcomes and outputs for the
country planning process are described below (see also Table 1.1). Country Gender Focal Points
(GFPs, listed in Table 1.2) organize the process and are the main authors of CGAB drafts. CMU
Gender Anchors provide oversight and liaise between (i) the CD and Practice Managers (PMs) of
the GPs leading CGAB tasks; and (ii) the CD and GFPs. For rapid development of Draft 1
CGABs to share with SARVP, countries need only follow Step 1. Steps 2-3 (light shading) are
recommended for revised CGABs, and Steps 4-6 (dark shading) are optional.

Step 1: Country Team Meeting to Select Priority Gender Issue/s and Outcome/s
Output: Draft 1 CGAB (deadline: July 31, 2016)
From May to July 2016, each Country GFP will be in touch with the CMU Gender Anchor
to organize and facilitate an initial meeting of the CD, Country Management Unit (CMU)
and rest of the Country Team to engage in planning for the CGAB. It is mandatory that the
CD or Acting CD chair an in-person meeting with the entire country team. Early in the meeting
the Country GFP will present a zero draft of the CGAB (see example in Figure 1.4, below) to
guide the discussion. This first draft CGAB will display the following in five columns: (i) the
country’s most critical gender issue/s; (ii) primary determinants and causes of the issue/s; (iii)
suggested instruments (kinds of interventions) that effectively address these determinants and
causes; (iv) suggested WBG tasks through which GPs/the IFC incorporate effective instruments
to work toward a priority outcome or outcomes for each gender issue; (v) the suggested priority
outcome/s, or targets, for the CGAB. Depending on when the country gender planning occurs
relative to the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) cycle, the priority outcomes may reflect
current CPF priorities or inform future CPF priorities. The Country GFP is tasked with
developing the first draft CGAB and populating each column with suggestions—that is, for every
suggested key gender issue, there are suggested causes of the issue, instruments, country program
tasks (either specific ongoing and pipeline tasks or potential tasks launched in later FYs), and the
desired outcome, respectively. GFPs are expected to draw from their own knowledge of country
gender issues as well as reference materials (e.g., the country’s SCD or CPF, if applicable; all
four chapters of this RGAP and the relevant country gender statistical profile in Annex G; and
existing country-specific or sector-specific gender diagnostics) to draft the CGAB and present it
to the Country Team. Depending on the critical gender issue/s for that country, suggested priority
gender outcomes may include any of the three Pillars in Figure 1.2 (Human Capital, Economic
Empowerment, Voice and Agency) or Country Gender Planning may yield an alternative gender
outcome that best reflects the agreed-upon gender issue/s of focus.
During this first meeting, each Country Team will select at least one key gender issue
(Column 1) and corresponding priority gender outcome (Column 5) on which the CGAB will
focus. At this stage, outcomes likely will be expressed in general terms, as in the 3 Pillars (Figure
1.1). It must be noted that the country’s selection of a priority gender issue and related priority
gender outcome/s for the CGAB does not preempt country program work to address other gender
issues; the CGAB is simply a commitment on the part of Country Management and team to
devote resources toward improving one or a few gender outcomes in particular. GPs across the
country portfolio will collaboratively work toward improving the outcome/s throughout the
CGAB implementation cycle, which concludes on June 30, FY21 and begins whenever the
CGAB receives CD approval and is finalized (by March 31, FY17).
After agreeing upon the priority gender issue and outcome/s, the meeting discussion may center
on revising the causes, instruments and program tasks (columns 2-4) for the CGAB. Selection of
priority gender outcomes and suggested tasks will need to take into account existing or
anticipated client demand for WBG support on the related gender issues.

By the end of the country-wide meeting and based on the instruments and suggested program
tasks discussed for each outcome, there also will be general consensus on which GPs (and
possibly the IFC) will be leading, co-leading or providing cross-support to suggested tasks.
[Though not required, at a later point in the CGAB process (see Steps 4-6), each brief could
include estimates of resources—including costs of tasks (ASA in particular), IEs or other studies
within operations, and any staff or consultants needed in addition to the core task team—required
for the efforts made to meet targets.] Figure 1.5 displays an example of a first draft CGAB,
which is essentially the summary table of a Country Gender Action Brief as discussed in the
WBG Gender Strategy FY16-23.
Step 2: Country and GP GFPs Flesh Out First Draft CGAB
After revising the draft CGAB according to the country-wide meeting’s discussion and decisions,
the Country GFP calls a meeting with the GFPs of the GPs (including the IFC) involved in the
tasks that support the priority outcome/s. Together, these GFPs will discuss and then refine the
CGAB’s lists of causes (Column 2), instruments (Column 3) and candidate tasks (Column 4),
conducting desktop research as necessary. Candidate tasks can include ongoing or pipeline tasks
in the country portfolio, as well as possible new tasks that would be launched with the particular
objective (or as part of the project development objective) to further progress toward the priority
gender outcome/s. For each suggested candidate task, there should be some indication of how
(using which instruments or interventions) the task will help achieve the priority outcome.
Suggested resources for this step (listed in Table 1.1) include the Global Gender Leads for the
involved GPs (see Table 1.3). When refining the priority outcome/s so that progress toward them
can be measured, the GFPs will need to consult with their Practice Managers and the CMU
Gender Anchor, and they may choose to contact the Regional Gender Team and/or the Gender
Leads for the concerned GPs (see Table 1.4) if additional guidance and materials are needed.
GFPs may need to work on the CGAB iteratively, receiving feedback from the Gender Anchor
and PMs between iterations.
While it is encouraged that numerical targets are set for priority outcomes (e.g., for all
MSMEs that are newly registered in a particular state or province over a five-year period, 30
percent are owned by women), this is not required. Progress toward a priority outcome may
be any measurable increase (or decrease) in the priority outcome indicator. The example
draft CGAB in Figure 1.4 contains both types of outcomes: one with a numerical target and one
stipulating an increase in the outcome indicator. Most importantly, targets related to improving
outcomes should be realistic—that is, achievable within the agreed-upon time frame and using
resources that are available from Country and Regional Budgets, GP budgets, and/or Trust Funds
(see Step 4). Most targets should be set for achievement by the end of the FY16-21 RGAP cycle
(i.e., by June 30, FY21), although some targets may be set for achievement after FY21—as long
as the deadline date is specified.
Step 3: Country Management Meets with GP PMs about Candidate Program Tasks, Outcomes
Output: Revised CGAB (deadline: December 14, 2016)
Once the Country GFP has shared the CGAB draft resulting from Step 2, the CMU Gender
Anchor organizes a meeting with the PMs of the concerned GPs, the CD, and (at the CD’s
discretion) any other concerned CMU members. The objective of this meeting is to review the
candidate tasks suggested in the latest draft CGAB (resulting from Step 2) and agree upon which
of these tasks will be part of the multi-year CGAB program to support the priority outcome/s. To

                                                                                                 35
maximize their impact, some of these tasks may need to undergo pre-effectiveness revisions (for
pipeline tasks), retrofitting (for ongoing tasks), or consideration for when they will enter the
pipeline (nor new task concepts). PMs and the CMU also will need to review and confirm the
measurable outcome indicators, and in some cases may decide to revise the indicators based on
client demand, achievability within the CGAB time frame, or other considerations. Once the
necessary changes are made to the CGAB draft (either by the Gender Anchor or the Country
GFP, if the Gender Anchor chooses to delegate), this version of the draft CGAB can be
submitted to the South Asia Regional Vice President (SARVP) for a CGAB learning event
or other activity preferred by the SARVP.

Step 4 (optional): Country and GFPs Estimate Budgets for CGAB Implementation
While encouraged, estimating CGAB budgets is not required. It is helpful to get a sense of BB
and TF costs of implementing CGABs, especially for the first year (FY17). At the CD/CMU’s
discretion, Country and GP GFPs may be expected to meet and draft estimates (indicative after
the first year) of BB and TF budgets to support costs of: (a) ASA conducted as part of the CGAB
program; (b) preparation and supervision of operations under the program; and (c) coordination
and reporting on CGAB development and progress. Averages costs of different degrees of gender
technical support to operations can be found below, in Section D3 (RGAP Costs and Budget).
Step 5 (optional): CMU Meets with GP PMs about Budgets, Shares with GP Sr. Management
Once the GFPs have delivered a draft budget to the CMU, the CMU Gender Anchor can organize
a meeting between the CMU and PMs of the concerned GPs to discuss and refine budget
estimates. Alternatively, CMUs may decide to either (i) draft budget estimates themselves; or (ii)
conduct budget discussions about supporting CGAB tasks and coordination through the regular
Work Program Agreement (WPA) process for each FY after FY17.

                                                                                                36
Step 6 (Optional): Delivery of final CGAB with Budget Estimates, Agreements from GPs
Output: CGAB with attached budget estimates (deadline: March 31, 2017)
Once all budget estimates are incorporated into the CGAB, the CD/CMU shares it with SARVP
and the Regional Gender Team GSURR/Social. In turn, the Gender Team incorporates the
CGAB’s outcomes/targets into RGAP Pillars 1-3. The CGAB process, as a part of the RGAP
process, can be visualized as in Figure 1.5.


During Country Gender Action Planning, GFPs, CMU Gender Anchors and others on Country
Teams are encouraged to consider the following principles, to help guide task selection.

Guiding Principles:
1. Increase the number of operations that incorporate gender indicators—beyond the percent of
   female beneficiaries—to measure how the project addresses sector-relevant gender gaps in
   human capital, economic empowerment, and/or voice and agency;

2. Strengthen the evidence base for gender considerations in lending operations and help expand
   government ownership of evidence-based gender considerations in lending operations and
   analytical work that address the three focus areas;

3. Build up Bank and client willingness and capacity to integrate gender considerations into
   Bank supported operations and ASA.
To operationalize these principles, Country Teams are encouraged to use a range of products: (i)
Stand-alone gender tasks (lending operations and ASA that have gender as the main focus,
including impact evaluations [IE] of stand-alone tasks); (ii) Strategic mainstreaming: Global
Practice (GP) or country-led operations/other tasks in which GP-relevant gender issues are
addressed and integrated (including Systematic Country Diagnostics [SCDs], and select IEs); (iii)
Communication, partnerships, capacity building of internal and external partners to work on
gender and improve access to gender-focused data and outcomes.

D. Pillar 4: Communication, Partnerships and Capacity Building

Pillar 4 activities, for the most part, will be led and monitored by the SAR Gender Team in
GSURR. While the CGAB has a set process to come up with country-level targets that eventually
will populate Pillars 1-3, the communication, partnerships and capacity building efforts of Pillar 4
will be targeted internally to Bank staff across GPs and countries in SAR, and externally to client
counterparts in government, development partners (communication and partnerships only) and
other country stakeholders. Rather than undertake stand-alone activities only, tasks under this
pillar will focus on creating synergies between internal and external audiences in four areas:
(1) Strengthening buy-in and capacity for strategically integrating gender in operations and ASA;
(2) Monitoring and evaluation of results from a gender perspective;
(3) Collecting and analyzing sex-disaggregated data and gender-relevant indicators;
(4) Setting up a formalized system of sharing information/data on gender work among all SAR

Proposed actions go beyond training to include opportunities for sharing knowledge,
communicating lessons and best practices; building partnerships; and fostering collaboration and
learning. Information sharing would include updating statistics for gender indicators in SAR
countries, giving RGAP updates including posting completed Country Gender Action Briefs,
featuring new innovative approaches on gender work in SAR GPs and countries, and possibly
making some of this information publicly available. All actions proposed under Pillar 4 will build
on the proactivity and commitment of Country Directors and Practice Managers to increase the
interest, willingness, and capacity of Bank staff to address gender in the three focus areas/pillars.
This RGAP proposes the following Pillar 4 targets for FY16-21:
Target 1
   All SCDs and CPFs delivered in FY16-21 incorporate analysis to identify (a) the critical
   gender issues for that country under each RGAP focus area (human capital, economic
   empowerment, voice and agency); and (b) actions to address and monitor priority gender
   outcomes.

Country partnership Frameworks (CPFs) as well as Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs)
produced in FY16-21 will address gender issues with particular attention to the RGAP focus
areas. CPFs are the Bank’s new approach to making its country-driven model more systematic,
evidence-based, selective and focused on the goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing
shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. CPFs take the place of the Country Assistance
Strategies (CASs) and Country Partnership Strategies (CPSs) and guide the Bank Group's support
to member countries. Each Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) informs each new CPF by
identifying the most important challenges and opportunities at the country level. Table 1.2 lists
the countries preparing CPFs and SCDs in FY16-19.

Target 2
 Delivering CGAB drafts:
        o By July 31, 2016, each country has delivered a first draft CGAB to SARVP;
        o By December 14, 2016, each country has delivered a revised draft CGAB to SARVP
          (to be shared at Spring Meetings) and SAR Gender Team (Social);




                                                                                                  41
        o    Optional: By March 31, 2017, each country that has conducted a budget estimates
             exercise for its CGAB (optional) delivers CGAB budget estimates to SARVP and the
             SAR Gender Team.
The CGAB can be used as a guiding framework for future CPF commitments to addressing
critical gender issues and monitoring progress toward priority gender outcomes.

Target 3
 By end-FY17, a SAR gender website is created/transformed to, inter alia:
        o Feature good-practice gender work across GPs and countries;
        o Keep data for gender indicators in SAR countries up-to-date;
        o Provide updates on RGAP commitments (including posting of completed Country
          Gender Action Briefs and updates on progress toward meeting CGAB targets);
        o Make information publically available, or at least to select development partners.

The following is in response to country team and GP GFP requests—made during the 2015-2016
process of developing the RGAP FY16-21—for sector-specific gender training and capacity
building on how to gender-inform operations.

Target 4
 By end-FY17, SAR country teams or GP teams have received orientation on the Gender Tag;
 By end-FY18, all SAR staff have received some type of capacity building for addressing
   sector-specific gender issues. Each SAR GP or country team can choose from among several
   approaches to build staff and management knowledge/capacity to address sector-specific
   gender issues in operations, for example:
        o Receive sector-specific in-person or e-module training;
        o Receive sector-specific guidelines on gender;
        o Hire dedicated staff/consultants with gender technical expertise in that GP or country
           to be embedded in projects, building team capacity through “learning by doing.” 3

E. Governance Structure: Roles, Responsibilities, and Resources

This final section discusses roles and responsibilities of SAR staff and management in the
implementation and monitoring of the RGAP. Implementation of the RGAP includes not only
development and implementation of CGABs; as stipulated in Pillar 4 targets, it requires
greater attention to and integration of gender into country portfolios, regional initiatives,
and dialogue—at the very least—with government counterparts. Figure 1.3 illustrates the
links between GPs, CMUs/Country Teams, South Asia Regional Management and the Gender
CCSA in their roles and responsibilities for RGAP implementation, monitoring and outputs—
with particular attention to the Country Gender Action Planning process.

1. Implementation

Implementation of the RGAP will rely on active involvement and contributions from all
countries, GPs and management levels in the WBG’s South Asia Region. With coordinative

        implementation and M&E of CGAB tasks are:
            o As gender-informed as possible; and
            o Sufficiently gender-informed to help achieve CGAB targets.
       Helping build the will and capacity of client counterparts to incorporate gender concerns
        into policy and programming—whether on CGAB tasks or other stand-alone and gender
        mainstreamed projects, pilots, and ASA—through dialogue, “learning by doing” on
        Bank-supported tasks, and dissemination of findings that support the business case to
        address gender issues in the sector;
       Maximizing opportunities to add to the evidence base on effects of gender-focused
        interventions in sector programs;
       In collaboration with country GFPs, keeping Ministries of Women’s Affairs in the
        respective client countries apprised of standalone gender tasks and, as relevant, CGAB
        tasks. Country GFPs and CMU Gender Anchors are available to provide guidance to
        TTLs on liaising with Women’s Ministries.


The SAR Chief Economist (SARCE) office is responsible for:

       Reviewing and clearing drafts RGAP in advance of RLT review;
       Vetting and approving any proposed regional ESW and ensuring their attention to critical
        gender issues that are relevant to the scope of the task;
       Ensuring that the use of regional gender funds (e.g., regional allocations of the Umbrella
        Facility for Gender Equality) are used to directly support priorities outlined in the RGAP;
       Keeping the SAR gender team apprised of any new gender-related regional ESW.



                                                                                                  45

2. Monitoring and Reporting

GP GFPs will coordinate with Country GFPs to complete RGAP update templates and report
on various RGAP and CGAB targets, and on any other developments in GP and country gender
work. The SAR Gender Team will conduct a brief bi-annual “check-in” with GFPs to collect any
news on major developments. GPs will complete more detailed templates once per Fiscal Year
and submit them to the Regional Gender Coordinators and Gender Team (see Table 1.5).


                                                                                                46
The Regional Gender Coordinator and SAR Gender Team will oversee monitoring and
reporting by GPs and GFPs, and in turn, will regularly report on RGAP progress to the SARVP
and Gender CCSA. The Coordinator is responsible for monitoring and reporting of budget
dedicated to meeting Pillar 4 targets.
3. Costs and Budget

a. Pillars 1-3 (CGAB tasks and targets)
Most country tasks that meet the targets set by CGABs (which relate to Pillars 1-3) will have their
own budgets, as agreed in WPA and other relevant meetings (i.e., loan amounts and
preparation/supervision budgets of lending operations).
The provision of thorough gender technical support is estimated to cost about US$ 50,000
per project/operation, as a rule of thumb. Itemized costs of this support are detailed below:
    -   Desk level reviews ($2-5K per project): Screening PCNs, PADs, TORs, conducting
        background research on potential interventions, meeting with teams, brainstorming, etc.
            o Resources: Staff time to supervise or conduct this work; 1-3 consultants (GF/GG
                 level).
            o Costs: Depends upon the number of projects; “screening” one project will take at
                 least 1-2 days of time – review documents, provide a write up and meet with the
                 TTL, participate in review meetings, etc.
    -   Gender integration ($15-40K per project) – Goes beyond screening to having the
        gender technical expert join the project team to design and implement a specific gender
        activity within the project.
            o Resources: Staff time to supervise; 1-2 consultants to do the work (HQ STC –
                 potentially same person who screened) and then usually a local STC will be hired
                 for the more day to day field work).
            o Costs: Mission travel is involved, and discussion with the project TTL will be
                 required about how to appropriately budget days accordingly About 20 STC days
                 are estimated to start, depending on the scale of work.

Deeper attention to gender issues in the operation, such as studies to identify and measure gender-
relevant indicators (beyond the standard sex-disaggregated percent of the beneficiary population),
or a standalone analytical piece for the GP/sector, come at additional cost.
    - Reports/Knowledge work ($50-100K per piece) – For example, notes based on field
         work assignments or desk reviews (e.g., focused M&E studies, sector guides on gender)
             o Resources: Staff time to supervise; 1-2 consultants to do the work, plus the costs
                 of editing/publishing.
             o Costs: STC time ranges from $20-50k (does not include travel) and costs
                 increase depending on depth of research and process (e.g., primary data
                 collection, travel, etc.).


b. Pillar 4 Tasks/targets
Targets under Pillar 4, as well as overall coordination and monitoring of the RGAP, will require
additional budget. These additional funds will come from a combination of Bank Budget (BB)
and Trust Funds (TFs) from various sources:




                                                                                                47
         Target 1: Gender-informed development of SCDs and CPFs
             o Estimated cost: TBC
             o Budget source: CMU
         Target 2: Cross-country, cross-GP SAR integrated gender website/data source
             o Estimated cost: $50,000 to design website, $50,000 per FY to maintain website;
                 Total cost: $300,000 for 5 FYs
             o Budget source: Combined—SARVP regional budget; GSURR budget for gender
                 coordination; OPSPQ learning budget; and dedicated TFs, if available
         Target 3: SAR GP team training for knowledge/capacity to address sector-specific
          gender issues (choose one from among three training modes)
                      Sector-specific in-person or e-module training
                      Sector-specific guidelines plus on-call/Just-in-Time support from gender
                          specialists equipped to practically apply guidelines
                      GP team hires dedicated staff/consultant(s) with gender technical
                          expertise in the GP, who is embedded in project teams and teaches teams
                          through “learning by doing” for FY17-18
             o Estimated cost: $100,000 each method (one-time cost for entire RGAP cycle))
             o Budget source: GP learning budget and select contributions from SARVP, CMUs

     By end-FY18, each SAR GP team chooses from among several approaches to build staff and
      management knowledge/capacity to address sector-specific gender issues, for example:
          o Receive sector-specific in-person or e-module training on gender issues.
          o Receive sector-specific guidelines on gender issues.
          o Hire dedicated staff/consultants with gender technical expertise in that GP to be
             embedded in projects and build team capacity through “learning by doing.”


b. SAR Gender Team Coordination, Monitoring and Reporting for RGAP FY16-21
                  o   Cost: $50,000 per FY
                  o   Total cost: $250,000 for 5 FYs
                  o   Source: Combination of SARVP regional budget and GSURR budget to
                      support gender coordination

Chapter II. Background: Description of Progress and Challenges for
Gender Equality in the South Asia Region
South Asia has made substantial gains towards gender equality, notably achieving gender parity
in primary education and narrowing the gaps in secondary education, adopting progressive
legislation to combat violence against women and girls, and increasing opportunities for women’s
participation in local governance. There is wide variation in progress achieved, however, with
certain inequalities persisting particularly among population segments disadvantaged by
geography, low levels of education, and poverty. Social norms interlock with religion, ethnicity,
caste, language and geography to promote some groups and exclude others. Despite advances in
certain pockets and sectors, large parts of the region continue to be affected by child malnutrition
and poor reproductive health (especially among poor women and adolescents), imbalances in
access to economic opportunities and quality of engagement in the workforce that disadvantage
women, and unacceptable levels of gender-based violence (GBV).

While reasonably strong economic growth has occurred across most parts of South Asia, mixed
and uneven progress on gender issues reflects a complex relationship between gender outcomes
and economic growth (see Figure 2.1).5 The South Asian experience, as that of other regions,
indicates asymmetries in this relationship, where gender equality contributes strongly to
economic growth but the reverse is not always true; economic growth alone has simply not been
sufficient in improving gender equality outcomes (Kabeer and Natali, 2013; World Bank 2011a).

Figure 2.1 GDP per Capita in South Asian Countries: 2002 and 2012

 All South Asian countries experienced a GDP per capita increase of at least 28 percent from 2002-2012.
In India and Bhutan, GDP per capita was as high as 84 percent in the same period.

                                                                                                      50
       A. Gender and South Asia in Perspective: Regional Comparisons and Regional
          Trends


1. Regional Comparisons of Key Gender Outcomes

a. South Asia Lags Most Regions in Terms of Women’s Economic Empowerment

Comparatively low female labor force participation—in spite of robust economic growth in the
region—and a steady decline in participation from 2005-2013, driven largely by India, is one
such example of how macroeconomic gains in South Asia seem divorced from patterns of
women’s empowerment. (see Figure 2.2). Female labor force participation, employment in both
formal and informal markets, and other forms of women’s economic empowerment are a key area
in which South Asia (SAR) most lags other regions, with the frequent exception of the Middle
East and North Africa (MNA). As of 2014 (see Figure 2.3), the gender gap in youth employment
actually is slightly larger in SAR (29.6 percentage points) than in MNA (27.8 percentage points).
The gender gap in youth employment is concerning for many reasons, including the fact that
many South Asian countries face rising ratios of the dependent-to-employed population and will
need young women to increasingly join and remain in the workforce to support growing numbers
of children and the elderly. Recent estimates of labor force participation rates among youth show
the gender gap in SAR to also be larger than in MNA—at 29.1 and 27.8 percentage points,
respectively (see Figure 2.4).

Across the globe, women tend to face financial exclusion. This is another area in which women
remain less economically empowered than men in South Asia; for example, they hold accounts in
formal financial institutions at lower rates than do men—especially in comparison to other
regions (see Figure 2.30 in Section C, below). In certain types of formal financial account
holding—for example, in holding credit card and debit card accounts—gender gaps persist in
South Asia, although not necessarily at higher rates than in other regions (see Figure 2.5). It is in
accounts used for business purposes, however, where the gender gap is most pronounced in South

In the past quarter-century, South Asia has made remarkable strides in select human development
indicators (see Section B for a more thorough discussion). Chief among these are its total fertility
rate (TFR) and, even more so, its adolescent fertility rate (Figures 2.7 and 2.8, respectively).

Whereas South Asia had the second-highest adolescent fertility rate in 1990—better only than in
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)— SAR’s rate was fourth-highest among development regions in 2012,
with much smaller differentials between SAR and those regions with even lower adolescent
fertility rates. Fewer (and safer) births per woman—especially in adolescents—has contributed to
greater life expectancy for women.

In education, South Asia appears to be performing as well as other regions in effectively
transitioning children from primary to secondary school (Figure 2.8). Along with lower its
fertility rates, narrowing gender gaps in secondary school enrollments has been one of SAR’s
great achievements regarding human capital development (Figure 2.9).

Although South Asia increasingly succeeds in fulfilling the rights of women and girls to
education and some aspects of health (see Section C below for details), it appears to face greater
challenges than most regions in meeting other basic rights such as survival in childhood, freedom
from violence, and other key aspects of agency and voice—for instance, in political
representation. Sections B and D, below, elaborate on South Asia’s relatively poor track record in
this area, particularly in terms of having the greatest excess female child mortality in the world
(Figure 2.20) and among the highest prevalence of child marriage and violence against women
the world (Figures 2.19 and 2.33-34). These incursions on the agency of women and girls in life
choices such as marriage and even in the ability to survive infancy are mirrored by severe
restrictions on the female voice.

Section D below and Chapter 3 explore the nuances of how lack of voice manifests within the
household and at local levels of political participation and representation. Here, we briefly
consider how South Asia fares in aspects of voice of agency that are easier to measure—that is,
through political representation on national-level government bodies. While women in South Asia
tend to serve as parliamentarians at similar or even higher rates than in other regions (Figure
2.11), they are not as well-represented at the ministerial level—a trend that has varied only
slightly in the past decade (Figure 2.12).


2. Regional Trends Reflecting Macro-level issues vs. Micro-level Interventions
South Asia’s marked progress in the education and health outcomes discussed above has been
reflected in each of its eight countries, albeit with variations among them (see Section B, below,
for more details). Most of this progress can be attributed to programmatic interventions at the
country level—or initially as state and provincial or even lower-level operations that eventually
were scaled up. As discussed in the next chapter, conditional cash transfer programs—in
Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and especially Bangladesh—can be credited with the region’s gains
in girls’ education (see Chapter 3). This is particularly true of Bangladesh, which has managed to
reverse the gender gap in secondary enrolments such that girls now outnumber boys. High
educational attainments for girls in Sri Lanka are attributed to state policy, since the early 1970s,
that girls and boys receive universal and free primary and secondary education. Wide-reaching
interventions, again at the project level, also have been hugely successful in lowering high
fertility rates in Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal and Pakistan.
What these successful programmatic interventions tend to have in common is a consideration of
various socially-constructed biases against women and girls – in particular, against their pursuit
of education, their mobility outside of the household, and their access to family planning methods
– and making their own choices about reproductive health – and program design that addresses or
compensates for these biases. By giving households cash grants as long as girls stay in school,
conditional cash transfer programs improve the value of girls’ education and ultimately reduce
the stigma against it. By bringing female health workers to households and local communities,
doorstep service delivery programs in Bangladesh and Lady Health Workers in Pakistan have
been able to work around mobility constraints and other biases against women’s agency.
Such biases – or gender norms – also drive the most stubborn gender gaps and sticky gender
issues in South Asia, particularly in the areas of economic empowerment and political
representation, and in the region’s pernicious practice of child marriage and high prevalence of
violence against women and girls. While micro-interventions have brought marginal
improvements in women’s voice and agency at the local level, such as through self-help groups in
rural livelihoods programs or women’s quotas on local councils in some countries, program
design has not sufficiently accounted for the undermining influence of traditional gender norms
on women’s economic empowerment and/or decision-making power at the household and higher
levels. Interventions that have seen some success—for example, projects that train women in
business and technical skills provided by female trainers in Afghanistan, or school curricula in
India that give young girls and boys new perspectives on traditional gender roles—have not been
brought to scale.
Chapter 3 contains a more thorough examination of the gender norms and other societal factors
that perpetuate regional trends against greater gender equality, as well as interventions that may


                                                                                                   57
be most effective at reducing them. For now, we move on to our description of the gender gaps
and issues within the region’s countries, as organized in three sections.

3. Adapting an Organizing Framework to the South Asian Context

The World Development Report 2012 on Gender Equality and Development provides a
conceptual framework to understand the multi-faceted interaction within and between
households, markets, formal and informal institutions, as well as ways in which constraints in one
or more of these domains can inhibit progress on gender issues (World Bank 2011a). In the case
of South Asia, substantial progress on gender issues has taken place alongside economic growth,
but inequalities in certain “sticky” areas also persist, as identified in the WDR 2012 under
endowments (education and health), economic opportunities, and voice and agency.

With an eye to reducing gender disparities across endowments and economic empowerment, and
ultimately to improve women’s voice and agency, the SAR RGAP FY16-21 has adapted the
WDR 2012 framework to the South Asian context in order to focus on gender work, and calls for
coordinated efforts across GPs and countries in three critical areas: first, human capital, which
includes improved access to and attainment in education, skills development, and health and
nutrition; second, economic empowerment through more and better quality jobs, and reducing
disparities in access to finance and asset ownership and control; and third, voice and agency,
with attention to enhancing mobility and safety through, for example, improved access to and use
of infrastructure and reduced risk of any form of GBV. Opportunities for human capital
development, income-earning, and improved safety and mobility are not only important rights in
themselves; they also are necessary for economic empowerment and achievement of the World
Bank’s twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

Making advancements in these focus areas requires attention to three cross-cutting themes
pertinent to the South Asian landscape:
    1. Gender norms, that is, socially and culturally constructed roles, responsibilities, and
        expectations attributed to men and women. Pervasive in all aspects of life and reproduced
        across generations, men’s and women’s different aspirations and responsibilities in the
        home and outside play out in educational, career, and life choices;
    2. Mobility, relates to gendered experiences of public spaces and movement, which affect
        access to health, education, employment, and social and professional networks; for
        example, safety concerns as well as time costs of travel constitute a barrier to equal
        opportunities in education and employment; and
    3. Conflict-affected, fragile and / or disaster-prone situations characterize large parts of
        South Asia and impose additional constraints on men and women; for example, women
        and girls are disproportionately affected by and at heightened risk of experiencing GBV
        in situations of instability or insecurity. Heightened attention to the dynamics of human
        capital, economic empowerment, and safety and mobility for both men and women in
        conflict-affected settings is imperative.

Greater consideration of these themes is necessary because of their multi-dimensional and
profound influence on human capital formation, economic empowerment, and voice and agency
for men and women in the region (see Chapter 3 for details). Taking gender norms, mobility, and
conflict-affected, fragile and / or disaster-prone situations into account as cross-cutting
themes/issues will enable a better understanding of context-specific gender constraints, allowing
the Bank to more effectively apply a gender lens to its development work in South Asia. With
these themes in mind, we move to a discussion of gender gaps in the various dimensions of South
Asia’s development.

                                                                                                58
B. Human Capital: Gender Gaps in School Completion, Poor Nutrition for All

1. Education and Skills Development: Gains in Enrollments

Gender gaps in primary education have decreased region-wide, with all countries except
Afghanistan and Pakistan achieving gender parity in primary education enrollment rates. South
Asia’s ratio of female-to-male primary school net enrollment in 2012 was 100.2 percent,
compared to 85.6 percent in 2002, an improvement of approximately 15 percentage points.
Primary school completion rates have risen as well, from 65 percent in 1999 to 85 percent in
2009, falling 3.5 percentage points short of the world average of 88.5 percent (UNESCO 2012).

South Asian countries also have made progress is closing gender gaps in secondary and
tertiary education. On average, 87.7 percent of girls and 86 percent of boys who complete
primary school progress to secondary school. Nevertheless, overall secondary-level enrollments
are still lower for girls compared to boys, which may suggest that girls are dropping out of the
higher grades of secondary education at higher rates than boys (see discussion in Chapter 3). The
female-to-male ratio of enrollment at the secondary level is 93.4 percent and 78.2 percent at the
tertiary level (WDI), with some countries performing better than others (Figure 2.3).6 Sri Lanka is
an outlier with a female-to-male enrollment of 106.1 percent at the secondary level and a
remarkable 165.7 percent at the tertiary level. Sri Lankan girls’ and boys’ high educational
attainment—especially relative to other countries in the region—can be explained by the
country’s approach to education as a basic right since 1945. In Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives,
Nepal, and Sri Lanka, girls outnumber boys in secondary school enrollments, while in India the
percentage of girls in secondary education has increased from 60 percent in 1990 to 74 percent in
2010 (Dundar et al. 2014a). Progress is lagging in Pakistan and Afghanistan, which exhibit the
highest gender disparities in the region in terms of secondary education enrollment rates.

There is considerable room for improvement in other aspects of secondary and tertiary education.
Retaining students at higher levels is a major challenge (Dundar et al. 2014a). This is also where
gender disparities are more pronounced (see Figure 2.14).

South Asia has made considerable progress in some health outcomes, but must sustain the
momentum to address critical gaps. On average, women and men in the region live longer, with
life expectancy at birth increasing from 58.5 years to 65.1 years for men and from 59.4 years to
68.3 years for women between 1990 and 2012. Country-level data show that improvements in life
expectancy have largely been gender equitable or in favor of women. In the area of reproductive
health care and nutrition, the region’s performance has been mixed (Figure 2.15).

Overall, South Asia recorded the sharpest fall in maternal mortality globally over the past two
decades, averaging an annual decline of 4.4 percent and a cumulative reduction of 65 percent
from 1990-2012.7 Still, South Asia is home to the second-highest Maternal Mortality Ratio
(MMR) in the world after Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 2.16), and nearly one-third of the world’s
maternal mortality occurs in South Asia (WHO 2015). MMR varies considerably across
countries—from 42 per 100,000 live births in Sri Lanka to 400 Afghanistan. Almost half of all
deaths among Afghan women age 15 to 49 are pregnancy and childbirth-related (Figure 2.17).

The region’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) declined from 4.2 in 1990 to 2.6 in 2012 (WDI). While
access to modern family planning methods has improved in recent years, significant urban-rural
disparities remain as well as disparities between women from high and low-income households,
and between more educated and less educated women. Disparities are pronounced in India—
where families in the top income quintile average a fertility rate of 1.8, compared to 3.9 in the
bottom—and in Pakistan, where the wealthiest couples have a contraceptive prevalence of 46
percent, as opposed to 21 percent for the poorest (India DHS 2005-06; Pakistan DHS 2012-13).
Despite a decline in the Adolescent Fertility Rate from 80.6 percent in 2000 to 38.8 percent in
2012 (WDI), high prevalence of child marriage in the region is associated with high fertility rates

has the world’s greatest share of girls married by age 15, at 42 percent (Bangladesh DHS 2011).

Adult Nutrition: Poor for All, Severe for Women of Reproductive Age

Lack of adequate nutrition compromises the overall health and well-being of a large share
of South Asia’s adult population, and outcomes are especially poor for adolescent and
young women. Malnutrition is an economic as well as a health issue: it directly inhibits economic
growth and poverty reduction. Poor physical status directly undercuts schooling, productivity
among workers, household income due to increased health costs, and poor cognitive function.
Lower productivity is associated with an estimated loss of 10 percent of lifetime earnings, hitting
the most vulnerable families. When micronutrient deficiencies are taken into account, South
Asia’s malnutrition rate is the highest among all regions. Gender disparities in nutrition are the
most pronounced for women in the reproductive age group. In India, nearly 30 percent of

women are underweight; and in Afghanistan, 48 percent of women who are not pregnant but are
of childbearing age have an iron deficiency. South Asia has the world’s highest prevalence of
anemia, estimated in the range of 55 percent to 81 percent.

Closure of Some Gaps in Child Health, but Nutrition Remains Poor for All Children

Progress has occurred in equalizing girls’ and boys’ access to basic vaccinations. In most South
Asian countries, the difference between male and female immunization rates has declined
substantially. In Pakistan, the difference between males and females receiving vaccines decreased
from 7.8 percentage points in 1990 to 4.5 in 2012 (WDI); in Bangladesh, the reduction was from
6.2 in 1993 to 2.6 percentage points in 2011; and in Nepal from 6.8 in 1996 to 2.5 in 2011.

Despite progress, gendered disparities persist in children’s overall health outcomes. South
Asia accounts for the second-largest share of under-five child mortality globally after Sub-
Saharan Africa (UNICEF 2012) and the largest share of excess female child mortality in the
world (Solotaroff and Pande 2014). This indicates insufficient progress in child well-being,
health, and nutrition, especially for girl children. Female disadvantage in the under-five mortality
rate is high in most countries, with the region averaging 101.7 percent (Figure 2.10), but it is
consistently greater in India and Pakistan than in Sri Lanka (Alkema and Sawyer 2012).
Pronounced excess female child mortality is part of a larger demographic problem in the region
that manifests in high male-to-female sex ratios and vast numbers of missing women (Box 2.1).


Box 2.1 South Asia’s Missing Women

 The World Development Report 2012; Gender Equality and Development defines missing
 women as: “The number of excess female deaths in a given year represented by women who
 would not have died in the previous year if they had lived in a high-income country, after
 accounting for the overall health environment of the country they live in.” The global count of
 missing women is estimated at 3.9 million each year (World Bank 2011a). India accounts for
 almost one-fourth of the annual global burden. Pakistan and Bangladesh are also among
 countries with the highest numbers of missing women each year. Excess female deaths take
 place throughout a woman’s life cycle but most markedly at birth and infancy due to sex-
 selective abortions and lack of care during infancy, and in the reproductive years due to maternal
 mortality. The resulting rise in sex ratios and “masculinization” of populations create a larger
 demographic imbalance in South Asian countries where these trends are more pronounced.
 Deviations from natural sex ratios are associated with increased risk of human rights violations
 against women including abduction, trafficking and the sale of women and girls for the purposes
 of marriage or sexual exploitation (UNFPA 2012).


In terms of nutrition, South Asia has the world’s highest prevalence of child malnutrition
and micronutrient deficiencies, affecting both boys and girls. An overwhelming 42 percent of
all South Asian children under five years are underweight, compared to 23 percent in West and
Central Africa (UNICEF 2012). Across countries, under-five malnutrition rates by height and
weight are similar for boys and girls. Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bhutan fare much better in under-
five malnutrition rates, according to most recent data available for each country (see Figure 2.21).

C. Economic Empowerment: Stubborn Gender Gaps in Jobs and Formal Finance

1. Labor Force Participation and Employment: Some Success, Though Large Gaps Persist

Despite improvements in education and skills development, women’s participation in the
labor market and access to employment opportunities continue to be a major challenge.
South Asia’s overall labor force participation rate was 56 percent in 2013, ranging between 48
percent in Afghanistan to 83 percent in Nepal. The region has the second-lowest rate of female
labor force participation (FLFP), 32 percent, after the Middle East & North Africa with 21
percent (see Figure 2.2). The female-to-male labor force participation gap is 39 percent (2013)
(WDI).8 These rates are based on International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates, which
account for informal as well as formal sector jobs. ILO-modeled estimates are harmonized to
ensure comparability across countries and regions, as different countries may use different
methods to collect data on labor force participation and other facets of labor markets within the
country. As a result, modeled estimates of FLFP may differ from government estimates. For
example, in Bangladesh national estimates reflect an increase in FLFP from 26 percent to 36
percent between 2003 and 2010 (World Bank 2015d), while modeled estimates do not reflect
FLFP increases to the same degree. This difference suggests the need for more universal methods
of collecting data on labor, especially across developing countries. Figure 2.22 below, however, is
included to show each country’s own estimates, from the most recent nationally representative
survey data, of labor force participation rates for men and women age 15 and above in South
Asian countries. Figures 2.13 and 2.14 show modeled ILO estimates for comparison purposes.

8 The World Bank WDI defines labor force participation (LFP) rate as the proportion of the population ages 15+ that is
economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period.
The ILO defines LFP rate as the ratio of labor force to working age population, expressed as a percentage. Labor force
is the sum of the number of persons employed and number of persons unemployed (ILO, Key Indicators of the Labour
Market, KILM, database; http://www.ilo.org/empelm/what/WCMS_114240/lang--en/index.htm. Accessed Aug 2005).

Using ILO estimates for comparison purposes, FLFP rates and trends vary widely among South
Asian countries, ranging from about 16 percent in Afghanistan to 83 percent in Nepal (WDI) (see
Figure 2.23). With the exception of Nepal, men’s labor force participation rates are much higher
than women’s and concentrated at around 80 to 90 percent.

Between 1990 and 2013, Maldives and Bhutan recorded a significant expansion of women in the
labor force (29.7 and 22 percentage points, respectively) followed by Pakistan, which added 12.7
percentage points, taking its FLFP to 25.6 percent in 2013 (see Figure 2.24). In Bangladesh too,
growth of the ready-made garment sector and the microfinance industry contributed to increases
in female labor force participation and employment between 2003-3013 (World Bank 2015d).

                                                                                                                          66
Despite this, overall FLFP rates remain low and in some countries trends show a stagnation or
decline. This is most evident in India, where female and male labor force participation has
decreased over the last decade, despite robust and sustained economic growth.

The reduction has been more severe for women—from 37 percent in 1990 to 29 percent in
2013— compared to men, from 86.2 percent in 1990 to 82.5 percent in 2013 (Figures 2.14 and
2.15). Much of the decline in the average regional FLFP rate is driven by labor force participation
trends in India. While trends in FLFP vary widely across countries, male participation remained
quite high and stable between 1990 and 2013, ranging between 82 and 92 percent in most
countries except the Maldives, where it dropped as low as 73 percent in 2000 (see Figure 2.25).

2. Labor Demand—More and Better Jobs Needed

South Asia is also confronted with the challenge of improving the range and quality of
available job opportunities for women, and the conditions under which they work. Even
when women participate in the labor market, adequate employment opportunities may be limited.
While the 77 percent (un-weighted) average male employment rate in the region is not low
compared to international averages, women’s un-weighted average employment rate is 21
percent, which is lower than comparator countries (Bolivia, Cambodia, China, Ghana, Guatemala,
Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Nigeria, and the Philippines). The male-female
employment ratio in South Asia is 2.2 compared to 1.3 for comparator regions (Nayar et al.
2012). As Figure 2.26 shows, the proportion of overall employment rates for women is much
lower than men in all countries except Nepal. The largest gender gaps are in Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.

In the category of wage and salaried workers, the proportion of female and male wage and
salaried workers in the region varies, but the male rate is always higher (see Figure 2.27). The
gender gap (difference between male and female wage and salaried worker rates) ranges from a
high of 27 percent in Bhutan to as low as 0.50 percent in Sri Lanka (WDI 2011). Not only are
women’s employment rates lower then men’s; traditional norms and gender bias in the household
and in labor demand, together with mobility constraints, reinforce occupational segregation at
multiple levels and in different ways. As in other regions, men tend to dominate burgeoning
economic sectors such as construction, transport, and communication, while women’s
employment largely remains consigned to the sectors they have traditionally occupied, i.e.,
agriculture, sales and basic services, and handicraft manufacturing (ibid; Chaudhary and Verick
2014).

Accurately measuring gender gaps in labor force participation and employment can be
extremely challenging, especially in the agricultural sector, where a large proportion of the
South Asian population remains employed. Even as most South Asian countries continue to
urbanize, agriculture still employs the greatest share of national workforces, except in Maldives
(see Figure 2.28). Both women and men are most likely to be employed in agriculture (except in
the Maldives and Pakistan), although women are more likely than men to hold farming jobs
(WDI). The bulk of those working in the agricultural sector, therefore, are women. In fact, in
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan, the share of women working in agriculture is
greater than the shares of women working in the industrial and services sectors combined. These
estimates are derived from formal national surveys that, while estimating some portion of

women’s agricultural labor, have likely underestimated such figures. This is because national
labor force surveys tend to ask questions regarding work activity in the week or month prior to
the survey’s enumeration only. With such a short time reference, these questions fail to capture
the seasonal variations that characterize agricultural labor. They also do not capture unpaid work,
which most women involved in agricultural activities on household farms are engaged in, even
though their activities include productive labor such as cropping and livestock care. Such labor is
categorized as household chores, which continue to be performed primarily by female household
members in the region. All such household labor, including child and elder care, is unpaid.
Formal national surveys thus tend to undercount women’s participation, even when taking both
formal and informal labor into consideration.

More than 80 percent of informal and vulnerable workers in South Asia are women,
according to UN Women (2015). Women in South Asia are almost three times less likely to be
employed in full-time jobs than men (World Bank 2014b). Both men and women are
disproportionately occupied in vulnerable employment in South Asia, which has the highest share
of vulnerable employment of all regions.9 However, the share of women in such employment, at
83.5 percent, is greater than the share of men, at 76.4 percent (WDI). Regional averages mask
important gender differences across countries (see Figure 2.29). In Bhutan and Maldives, which

have lower rates of vulnerable employment overall, women are much more likely than men to
hold vulnerable jobs. In Nepal and Pakistan, with high overall vulnerable employment rates,
women are also more likely to be in vulnerable jobs than men. In Bangladesh and India, where a
large majority of workers hold vulnerable jobs, the gender gap in vulnerable employment is the
lowest. Sri Lanka stands out as a country with low overall vulnerable employment and also low
vulnerable employment rates among women.

Women in South Asia are on the losing end of gender wage gaps. Granted, the past decade has
seen increases in wage and salary employment (12 to 15 percent from 2005-2010) and in non-

9Vulnerable employment is the sum of own-account workers and contributing family workers. They are less likely to
have formal work arrangements and more likely to lack decent working conditions and adequate social security.
Vulnerable employment often results in inadequate earnings, low productivity and difficult working conditions that
undermine workers’ fundamental rights (ILO, Bureau of Statistics: http://laborsta.ilo.org. Accessed August 27, 2013).

                                                                                                                                               70
agricultural employment (30 to 40 percent from 2005-2012) among employed women in the
region (WDI). However, the gender pay gap in South Asia remains the greatest of all regions,
with women earning 33 percent less than men on average, compared to a world average gender
gap of 24 percent (UN Women 2015).

Women workers are also relegated to the lower levels of production value chains. For
example, even though more than 50 percent of Afghanistan’s agricultural workforce is female,
their work focuses on performing household tasks such as weeding, harvesting, and minimal
processing. Men engage in activities at higher levels, linking households with the market to
obtain inputs and sell agricultural products as middlemen, village-level traders and processors,
wholesalers, retailers, or exporters (World Bank 2011b). Similar patterns are documented in a
field-based assessment of gender issues in the micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME)
sector in India, where women workers are predominantly clustered in low and unskilled jobs all
along the value chain of production (ICRW forthcoming).

3. Asset Access, Ownership, and Control: Deficiencies Stifle Entrepreneurship

Significant gender differences exist in access to productive assets across many countries in
South Asia, a trend that has persisted over the past decade. Despite the exponential growth of
the microfinance industry, women’s financial exclusion remains pronounced across the formal
banking sector and within the microfinance space itself. South Asia has the world’s largest gender
gap (16 percentage points) in having accounts at formal institutions (WDI) (see Figure 2.30). Not
surprisingly, the proportion of women who obtain loans from financial institutions is also lower
(7.9 percent), compared to men (9.5 percent) (WDI). Only 1.7 percent of female account holders,
compared to 6.3 percent of males, take loans for business purposes—the lowest rate among all
regions.

Women’s exceptional access to microfinance is especially evident in some South Asian
countries, although such access does not imply their productive use of these resources. The

                                                                                               71
proportion of women borrowers as a percentage of total borrowers is as high as 99 percent in
Nepal, 96 percent in India, and 94 percent in Bangladesh (see Figure 2.31). In Pakistan and
Afghanistan women’s access to microfinance is significantly lower at 53 percent and 40 percent,
respectively (World Bank 2014c). Recent research shows that even when women have access to
microfinance services such as loans, financial and non-financial barriers restrict the extent to
which they are productively used. A forthcoming World Bank study assessing women micro-
entrepreneurs’ access to finance finds that financial products offered by microfinance providers
are not tailored to the needs of women micro-entrepreneurs, even though they are mainly targeted
to female clients. Another study assessing women’s access to microfinance in Pakistan found that
the majority of female clients were not the final users of loans but rather conduits to male
household members (Safavian and Haq 2013). Similar practices of loan diversion to male or other
household members or lack of control over microfinance loans is also documented in Bangladesh
and Sri Lanka (World Bank 2014c). In addition, lack of access to or of productive use of financial
services inhibits entrepreneurship opportunities among women.

South Asia has the lowest proportion of women-owned businesses of any region. The number
and proportion of formal small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with one or more women owners
(200,000 and 8-9 percent respectively) is close to that of the Middle East and North Africa
(300,000 and 12-15 percent), but much lower than East Asia (which has the highest number and
proportion—4.8 to 5.9 million and 38-47 percent respectively) and all other regions (IFC 2011).
As in other developing countries, women-owned businesses in South Asian countries are
typically informal and concentrated in traditional sectors and in small-scale retail and services.
They usually emerge out of necessity in the absence of other income-earning opportunities for
women, and are characterized by low capital requirements, low barriers to entry, and low income.
In India, for example, women own only 13.7 percent of registered micro, small, and medium
enterprises (MSMEs) and 9.7 percent of unregistered MSMEs. Moreover, female ownership has
the highest concentration in the micro-enterprises domain (14.2 percent) with much lower rates of
ownership in small (5.1 percent) and medium (4.2 percent) scale enterprises. Women
entrepreneurs also tend to lack the combination of resources needed for developing highly
productive businesses, including education, vocational and technical skills and work experience

                                                                                               72
(World Bank 2013b). These constraints explain why female-owned businesses operating in rural
areas in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are less profitable than male-owned businesses (Costa and
Rijkers 2011). South Asia has also made the least progress in removing restrictions on women’s
legal capacity and property rights from 1960-2010 (Hallward-Driemeier et al. 2013). Bhutan,
where inheritance of family property is matrilineal by both law and practice, is the exception.

D. Voice and Agency: Limited in Public Spheres, Obstructed in Private Spheres

Women in South Asia lack voice and agency on multiple fronts—from decision-making in the
household and the political arena to access to justice (World Bank forthcoming)—and face a
persistent threat of gender-based violence throughout their lifetimes (Figure 2.32).

1. Political Participation and Decision-Making: Limited at All Levels

Women’s political representation is low at all levels. The translation of de jure power into
de facto decision-making authority among female representatives remains weak. Women are
generally underrepresented in political institutions in the region. In 2014, South Asia recorded the
lowest proportion of women in ministerial-level positions of all regions, at just 7 percent. On
average, women also hold a low share (19 percent) of seats in national parliaments, with Sri

Cycle Stage

Lanka recording the lowest share and Nepal the highest at 6 percent and 30 percent, respectively
(WDI). Legislation in India and Pakistan that institute reservation quotas for women’s
participation at lower levels of government are positive measures that encourage expansion of
female political representation and participation. However, research has also found that low
literacy, inadequate training opportunities, household responsibilities, and negative attitudes
towards female representatives constrain women’s decision-making authority and/or capacity to
meaningfully participate in local councils (ICRW and UN Women 2012).

                                                                                                 73
2. Gender-Based Violence (GBV): Prevalent in Spite of Legal Protections

GBV is prevalent in myriad forms in all eight SAR countries, putting girls and women at
risk throughout their life cycles. GBV generally takes distinctive forms—physical, sexual,
emotional, and economic—and occurs in the home, in public settings and in institutional
surroundings. In South Asia specifically, GBV is widespread and persists in many forms,
including physical and sexual abuse, acid attacks, dowry-related murders, honor killings,
trafficking and enslavement, and custodial violence (see Figures 2.32, 2.33, 2.34).

The economic, social, and development costs of GBV are substantial. Research shows that the
prevalence of GBV has deleterious effects on at least six of the eight Millennium Development
Goals (Solotaroff and Pande 2014). At the household level, monetary costs of GBV include lost
wages from work absences, medical fees to treat injuries, and legal and judicial fees.

Such violence occurs in spite of numerous legal protections. All South Asian countries have
enacted progressive laws to deter most types of violence against women and girls. For example,
female infanticide is prohibited across the board. Each country also contains protections against
child abuse, child marriage, acts of sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and trafficking.
Poor implementation, lack of awareness of these laws among the general public and law
enforcement, and structural weaknesses in police and judicial systems deny women access to
justice, however, rendering the laws ineffective.

Violence against women and girls starts early, with South Asia having the world’s highest
prevalence of excess female child mortality and child marriage, as illustrated earlier in this
chapter. According to countries’ most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), half of
surveyed married women aged 15-49 in Bangladesh, one-third in India, and one-quarter or more
in Nepal and Pakistan report having experienced physical violence committed by an intimate

partner (Figure 2.33). Due in part to high rates of child marriage, intimate partner violence tends
to be even more prevalent among adolescent girls than among adult women in both Bangladesh
and India (Figure 2.34).

E. Linkages between Gender and Fragility, Conflict, and Disaster

The devastating impacts of conflict and fragility have affected many South Asian countries.
South Asia is home to vast numbers of people affected by conflict; by earthquakes, tsunamis,
floods and other natural disasters; and by climate change,10 political and economic instability, and
other drivers of fragility. Because of the damage inflicted upon families, community institutions,
infrastructure, and service delivery mechanisms, conflict, fragility and natural disaster all have
the power to make conditions extremely unstable and untenable for sizeable populations. Such
circumstances force individuals to reside in unsafe or even life-threatening conditions, or to leave
their residences and communities altogether. According to the Migration Policy Institute (2014),
violent conflict is the catalyst for most of the region’s refugees and internally displaced persons
(IDPs). Afghanistan and Pakistan account for the majority of these: as of June 2015, more than
1.2 million Afghan IDPs reside in the country, and more than 2.6 million Afghan refugees
originate from the country; Pakistan has over 1.5 million IDPs (UNHCR 2015).

Conflict, fragility, and natural disaster all are likely to exacerbate gender disparities by
exposing men and women to varied and gender-specific risks and vulnerabilities. It is also
important not to resort to gender stereotypes in these situations. For example, loss of livelihoods

10South Asia is among the regions to be most affected by climate change, with Bangladesh and India likely the hardest
hit. Rising temperatures and sea levels, more extreme weather, intensified cyclonic activity in the Arabian Sea and Bay
of Bengal, and floods from intricate river systems threaten to undermine existing initiatives for poverty reduction and
development. Given South Asia’s high population density, climate shifts will bring complex humanitarian, security,
and environmental challenges (Bhattacharyya et al 2012).

                                                                                                                    75
and consequent changes in social dynamics of conflict situations can leave men feeling
disempowered and more prone to involvement in armed activities. Women who are commonly
seen as victims of conflict can also be actively engaged in fighting. In Sri Lanka and Nepal, one-
third and one-fourth of combatants, respectively, were women (Arino 2008; World Bank 2005a).
Women in conflict-affected and other fragile settings face a much higher risk of sexual violence,
but men can be victims of such violence as well (World Bank 2005a). Displacement and
disrupted access to public services such as health care affects everyone, but more so women by
increasing their household burden and formal sector participation (UNDP 2002).

People who migrate due to displacement, extreme poverty, or other fragile situations are
also vulnerable, and women face specific risks. Not only do migrants risk losing access to
public services and the possibility of not finding paid work in their destination sites, but they also
risk losing social and emotional support from families, home communities, social networks and
other sources of identity and protection. This is true for both those who migrate internally and
those who migrate outside of their countries of origin. In South Asia, compared to male migrants,
female migrants are at higher risk of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and trafficking
(Solotaroff and Pande 2014). Collecting reliable data on migrants is challenging at best, but
according to the latest available UNHCR estimates, South Asia was the origin of more than 34
million internal and external migrants in 2013. Countries originating the lowest shares of
migrants, using gender-disaggregated estimates, were Maldives (157 female; 711 male); Bhutan
(47,372 female; 42,751 male); and Sri Lanka (252,784 female; 663,186 male). Most migrants
came from India (5.2 million female; 8.95 million male); Bangladesh (2.6 million female; 5.16
million male); Afghanistan (2.13 million female; 2.98 million male); and Pakistan (1.37 female;
3.71 million male). Between these two groups is Nepal (419,053 female; 545,497 male). Bhutan
was the only country home to more female than male migrants (though not by much), although
male-female shares of migrants were fairly balanced in Nepal and (slightly less so) in
Afghanistan. Programs serving migrant workers can sensitize service providers to the heightened
risk of SGBV among women, in addition to other types of violence and exploitation.

Attention to gender and context-specific disadvantages can help mitigate the negative
impact of fragility, conflict, and natural disasters. Gender-sensitive recovery and
reconstruction processes carry significant potential to sustain positive changes created by shifts in
gender roles in conflict or disaster-affected and fragile areas (UNDP 2002). For example,
vocational training and skills development programs that are implemented during recovery
periods can create new avenues for women’s participation in the labor market, and activities
conducted in post-conflict situations can offer greater opportunities to participate in formal and
informal peace processes. Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) programs, as
well as post-disaster work, should therefore take into account the legal, economic and
psychosocial needs of both men and women and society as a whole (World Bank 2005a). The key
development challenge is to utilize post-conflict/disaster momentum to address gender equality
issues and to increase the involvement of marginalized groups—including women—in the
recovery process. For example, in an earthquake recovery project that provides housing grants to
families, the World Bank is encouraging the Government of Nepal to support joint ownership of
houses – thereby facilitating equal asset ownership for male and female beneficiaries.

Chapter III. What Do We Know?
The past several years have yielded a rapidly growing base of evidence – much of it generated by
the Bank itself – that aims to identify the determinants of gender gaps in South Asia, particularly
those that can be addressed through the Bank’s work in the Global Practices. Part A of this
chapter begins with an overview of how gender roles and social norms continue to perpetuate
inequalities across different dimensions, and the broader demographic and economic costs of
such gender-based exclusion in region. It then summarizes research findings that identify
determinants of poor gender outcomes in South Asia. The following section, in Part B, brings
together evidence from what we know about effective approaches to addressing key gender gaps
in the region. Highlighting findings from impact and other program evaluations of promising
interventions, this section sheds light on what has and has not worked towards improving gender
outcomes. Some of the evidence has come from analytical tasks and evaluations that are paid for
by a combination of (i) Bank Budget (i.e., country or regional budget allocations) or project funds
that support evaluation; and (2) Trust Funds. A majority of the funding for this research comes
from dedicated Trust Fund programs, namely the Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality (UFGE),
the South Asia Gender (SAGE) Initiative, and the South Asia Food and Nutrition Security
Initiative (SAFANSI) (see Annex A for details on these Trust Fund sources).

A. Determinants of Poor Gender Outcomes are Linked to Stubborn Norms

1. Gender Roles and Social Norms: Pervasive, but Potential for Change

Gender roles and social norms underlie many of the prevailing gender gaps in the region.
The normative framework governing gender relations ascribes different sets of roles,
responsibilities, and characteristics to men and women, resulting in an underlying gender bias that
is responsible for many of the trenchant gender gaps in human capital, economic opportunity, and
voice & agency in South Asia.

Box 3.1 Gender Roles and Son Preference

 Gender roles in the family can be traced back to a patrilineal mode of social organization in which
 the lineage of the clan system is carried through men. In this structure men gain primacy owing to
 their ability to ensure the continuation of the clan through ownership and transfer of assets and their
 lifelong allegiance to one clan. Girls and women do not have the same privileges. Regarded as
 property, they follow the clan custom of shifting from their natal home to serve the needs of their
 marital homes. As Das Gupta et al. (2003) describe, “[m]en are the fixed points in this social order,
 and women are the moving points…” and are valued primarily as “…the means whereby men
 reproduce themselves.” This fundamental gender-based dichotomy perpetuates son preference and
 devalues the role of girls in the family, manifesting in a myriad of social practices and attitudes that
 come to bear on gender-unequal outcomes in the three focus areas of this plan.

We take the economic sphere as an example to illustrate the complex ways in which gender roles
and social norms reinforce gender gaps across different realms. Historically, men’s productive
labor, which allows the generation of assets and /or income, is assigned greater value in the
household when compared to women’s reproductive and productive labor (often related to
childcare and housework; see Box 3.1). The behaviors and characteristics associated with this
division reinforce male-biased norms. Masculine attributes of “breadwinner” or “provider” give

                                                                                                       77
men precedence in the family and more power in decision-making and control over household
resources, while feminine attributes of “caretaker” or “nurturer” are associated with a more
subordinate position in the family, diminishing the extent of women’s decision-making in the
family and over their own life choices.

Social norms play an integral role in maintaining the gender division of labor and the power
imbalance associated with it. For example, one of the reasons that girls’ and women’s
educational attainment and skills development receives less priority, compared to that of boys and
men, is the perception that these investments will yield lower returns given the loss of daughters
to marital households. Similarly, according to country-specific Bank-led studies of women’s
economic opportunities in Sri Lanka (World Bank 2013a), Bhutan (World Bank 2013d), and
Pakistan (World Bank 2005b), the expectation that women are in charge of maintaining the house
and rearing children is partly responsible for the region’s extremely low rates of female labor

Box 3.2 Social Exclusion Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI)

 Exclusion based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) in South Asia manifests
 through social stigma, discriminatory laws, and homophobia at many levels, creating barriers for
 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) people in accessing markets, services, and spaces.
 Discrimination against LGBT people is deeply entrenched in legislative, cultural and religious
 arenas; however, recent legislation does signal a trend in support towards transgender communities.
 India (2014), Bangladesh (2013) Pakistan (2012), Nepal (2007) accorded legal status to transgender
 populations, making provisions to recognize a ‘third gender’ in national documents and censuses of
 India, Nepal, and Pakistan. The official recognition of transgender people is an affirmation of their
 rights as equal citizens and an important first step to countering discrimination and marginalization
 they face in all aspects of life: from mainstream employment and education to accessing essential
 services and legal protections. Pakistan’s Supreme Court has directed national and provincial
 authorities to safeguard rights to inheritance, employment, and election registration, and has also
 introduced preferential treatment for transgender persons in civil service jobs (Foreign Policy
 2012). India is now in the process of instituting affirmative action measures for transgender people
 in educational and economic opportunities (FSRN 2015). These positive developments have also
 created opportunities for data collection to better understand the impact of SOGI based exclusion.
 LGBT disaggregated data on education outcomes, health, poverty and safety would be especially
 useful for better estimating the costs of exclusion. While recent research suggests that SOGI based
 exclusion is costly in human and economic terms, not only for LGBT communities but also for the
 nations in which they live, there is a need for better data and more rigorous research to elucidate
 exactly what these costs are, and how they can be mitigated (Badgett 2014).

Also constraining women to the private sphere are social norms that seek to protect their
chastity or regulate sexuality. Prescriptions range from limited contact with men outside the
family and extend to socially determined constraints on behavior, dress and / or mobility.
Attempts to deviate or break away from these pre-defined roles or norms can be punished or met
with resistance. For example, women seen as violating mobility restrictions are at higher risk of
sexual harassment and other forms of gender-based violence. In many cases these types of
violence are condoned or overlooked as deserving of punishment for defying societal norms. The
continued practice of gender-based norms can be so deeply ingrained in socialization processes
and societal practices that they are widely accepted and adhered to—sometimes even by those
they disadvantage. They are also replicated and reproduced across formal and informal
institutions and markets, as seen in constraints on women’s asset ownership and inheritance, and
extend to other groups who do not conform to accepted gender roles and norms. Such responses
can be especially pronounced among those in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)

                                                                                                    78
community, who face a range of social sanctions due to their departure from accepted forms of
masculine and feminine identities and behavior. In recent years, several South Asian countries
have taken positive action to recognize the rights of transgender people (Box 3.2).

Over the years, greater awareness of gender inequality, market forces and globalization
have played an important role in making gender roles and social norms more equitable.
Expansion of the garment-manufacturing sector in Bangladesh, for example, has increased the
demand for women workers in the labor force. In India, mandatory quotas for women’s
participation in Panchayats (Village Councils) have been implemented to address low levels of
female participation in local governance. However, the grip of social norms and the values
associated with them can be highly resistant to change. The World Values Survey (2010-2014)
shows the extent to which the distinction between male and female gender roles is still upheld.
The majority of people surveyed in India and Pakistan (50 percent and 75 percent, respectively)
believe that in times of job scarcity, men have a greater right to employment than women. Of the
surveyed population, 63 percent in India and 51 percent in Pakistan either agree or strongly agree
to the statement that a university education is more important for a boy than a girl. In India and
Pakistan, 62 percent and 72 percent, respectively, agreed that on the whole, men make better
political leaders than women.

Box 3.3 Addressing Issues of Masculinity and Male Identities in Fragile and Conflict-
Affected Settings

 Conflict and fragility can create a dissonance between normative perceptions of masculinity and
 what men experience in reality (Lwambo 2013). For example, conflict-inflicted losses—
 particularly in education and employment—marginalize men’s roles as primary breadwinners or
 providers in ways that are contrary to social expectations. Bank supported analytical work shows
 that in post-conflict Somalia, changes in gender relations that increase men’s economic
 dependence on women and lowers their social standing in the household and community instills
 disillusionment. These factors expose men to a range of vulnerabilities such as psychological
 stress social insecurity (Gardner and El-Bushra 2015). Research from Pakistan finds that
 insecure environments increase the pressure among men to prove their masculinity, which may
 be channeled into greater violence and aggression (Aslam 2012). Younger men—facing
 unemployment and few avenues for professional and personal development—are at higher of
 risk engaging in violent and criminal activities (Narayan and Petesch 2010). Thus, a holistic
 view of gender that considers the differentiated needs of men along with women is crucial for
 peaceful social change and transition in societies recovering from conflict and fragility.
 Programmatic approaches addressing issues around masculinity and male identities in fragile
 contexts have included integrated approaches that combine behavior change components—such
 as the provision of cognitive therapy and psychosocial services—together with activities aimed
 at men’s economic empowerment, including livelihood development, skills training, as well as
 financial and other forms of assistance for starting new enterprises (see Chapter 4).



Expanding the understanding of the negative impact of gender roles can provide more
nuanced insights into gender relations and how they may relate to gender inequalities. A
forthcoming World Bank study on “Masculinity, Gender Norms, and Development in South
Asia” explores how masculinities manifest in South Asian societies and how they impact poverty
reduction and shared prosperity. Other research also suggests that the power, control and
dominance ascribed to masculine identity partly underlie the high prevalence of violence against

                                                                                                 79
women and girls in the region, particularly when it is perpetrated by a spouse or an intimate
partner (Nanda et al. 2012). Moreover, childhood experiences can be pivotal in shaping men’s
attitudes towards violence later in life. A study from Sri Lanka finds that men, who are subjected
to abuse, neglect or trauma as children, are more likely to perpetrate violence against women in
adulthood (De Mel et al. 2013). It is evident that men suffer from gender norms as well: the
expectation that they not show “weakness” means that they tend not to seek needed healthcare,
particularly for depression, substance abuse, stress, and reproductive health. Gender norms
associated masculine identities are further challenged in conflict and fragile contexts and
exacerbate male vulnerability (Box 3.3)

2. The Cost of Gender-based Exclusion in South Asia: Stifled Development and Growth

Over the next 20 years or so, South Asia will have the demographic advantage of 20 million
young people entering the workforce each year (Ghani 2011). Estimates suggest that the region is
poised for strong economic growth. Granted, much of it will be driven by India; as the largest
country it accounts for 80 percent of the regional economic output. Nonetheless, overall growth is
expected to accelerate for the region as a whole (ibid.) How fully South Asia realizes the
tremendous potential of its young demographic will depend on a number of factors. These
include, for example, policies that can positively shape and augment human capital or
opportunities that spur innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic activity. An equally important
pillar in this dynamic is gender inclusion, an area in which the region lags.

South Asia has fallen behind all other regions on gender equality indicators. In 2011, the region
had the lowest scores on the Gender Inequality Index (GII), measured by labor force
participation, maternal mortality, adolescent fertility, educational attainment at the secondary
level or above, and parliamentary representation (WDI; Sen and Hook 2012). Additionally, South
Asia has made the least progress in reducing physical, economic, social, political, and legal
gender-based inequalities, as measured by the Gender Parity Score, which is comprised of 15
indicators across these different realms (McKinsey Global Institute 2015).

A 2015 report by McKinsey Global Institute quantifies the cost of gender gaps in the economic
sector. The report estimates that the benefits of reducing gender inequality in labor markets could
add $3.3 trillion from the region to global GDP. India is by far the biggest contributor ($2.9
trillion), followed by other South Asian countries ($0.4 trillion). Similarly, an analysis by the
OECD Development Centre suggests that South Asian economies lose as much $888 billion in
income as a result of gender discrimination in social institutions alone (Ferrant and Kolev 2016).
Other estimates also point to significant losses because of poor health, under-nutrition, low levels
of education, and violence driven by gender disparities. For example, a household survey-based
study in Bangladesh finds that in 2010 the total national cost of domestic violence equaled 2.10
percent of the country’s GDP (Siddique 2011). There is substantial literature on different
approaches to estimating the cost of gender exclusion along various dimensions, although many
of these estimates are likely to underreport given the difficulties in accounting for the intangible
and indirect burden of gender inequality (Solotaroff and Pande 2014). Given the profound
consequences of such exclusion, the extent to which the South Asian countries are able to better
understand and mitigate them will be crucial for the region’s future growth and prosperity. The
following sections in this Chapter summarize key findings from the literature that identify the
underlying causes of gender gaps and as well as the extensive negative externalities arising as a
result of gender-based inequalities.

3. Human Capital: Social Norms and a Skills Mismatch Maintain Gender Inequalities

a. Education and Child Marriage: Gaps in Education, High Rates of Child Marriage Stifle
Outcomes

Most girls still leave school too early. In spite of improvements in female-to-male secondary
and tertiary enrollment rates, ensuring student retention and progression to higher levels of
education is still a challenge in most South Asian countries. Absolute rates of completion at the
secondary and tertiary levels remain low for both boys and girls in the region, with the exception
of Sri Lanka. However, gender constraints are reflected in higher dropout rates and lower
completion rates among school-going girls in the region. Constraints on mobility—arising out of
concerns for safety and security and cultural norms that place lower value on female education—
prevent girls from completing higher education. An analysis of national labor force and
household surveys by Nayar et al. 2012 shows that over a period of time, completion rates in
primary education have improved for both boys and girls (see Figure 3.1: the lighter vs. darker
shades of red and blue refer to the earlier vs. later year of measurement in each country, during
which rates changed for each cohort). Still, in Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, fewer girls
complete primary education compared to boys. The gender disparity in completion of lower-
secondary education is much greater in most countries with the exception of the Bangladesh and
Sri Lanka, where girls have higher completion rates in lower secondary education.

Education in South Asia, by Gender and Country

Child marriage is undermining girls’ educational and other outcomes. The continuing high
prevalence of child marriage in South Asian countries is associated with lower educational
attainment, as well as poor outcomes in reproductive and other areas of young women’s health

                                                                                                          81
(see Health section below for more details). Studies from India, Bangladesh, and Nepal—
countries with the highest rates of child marriage in the region—find that one of the major risk
factors for early marriage at the household level is poverty (Santhya et al. 2006; Dasgupta et al.
2008; ICRW 2011; Bajracharya and Amin 2010; ICRW and Plan 2013). For example, poor young
women in Nepal are three times more likely to be married by the age of 18, and twice as likely to
become mothers, than women in the top wealth quintile (Aguilar and Cortez 2015). The financial
burden of having to pay higher dowries when girls are older pushes poor households into
marrying daughters early (Solotaroff and Pande 2014). A study from Bangladesh also found that
concern for maintaining the chastity and sexual safety of daughters was another factor driving
child marriage (Schuler et al. 1996). Closely tied with socio-cultural customs and traditions,
gender norms around child marriage have been slow to change. The incentives for families to
marry off daughters vary, and deserve further country-specific research if policy and
programmatic interventions are to effectively address them.


b. Quality of Education and Skills: Those Who Stay in School Lack Proper Training

Despite South Asia’s considerable progress in improving access to education, there exists an
uneven quality of education at all levels. Graduates also are not acquiring the right skills for
productive and sustainable employment, especially outside of agriculture. These deficiencies
undermine the region’s competitiveness, economic growth, and efforts to alleviate poverty.
Institutional factors that contribute to overall low learning outcomes for young men and women
in South Asia include poor teacher quality and absenteeism, insufficient financing focused on
education quality, and low spending on teaching resources (Dundar et al. 2014a). Evidence of
gender gaps in learning outcomes is mixed, but research does point to gendered household
dynamics; for example, greater household expectations and responsibilities for women can have a
negative impact on educational achievement (ibid.). Further, gender constraints are reinforced
when they intersect with other disadvantages; for example, girls belonging to rural areas, low
socioeconomic backgrounds or conflict areas are more likely to have substandard learning
outcomes (ibid.).

From a young age, gender biases limit educational and career aspirations. In addition to
closing gender gaps in secondary and tertiary education, South Asia must work toward changing
gender biases in education. Social and cultural expectations about what girls and boys should
study in school and which jobs they should look for affect women’s educational outcomes and
opportunities. The Gender at Work report states, “Young women and men often follow different
educational streams and develop differences in aspirations and skills that underlie occupational
segregations later in life” (World Bank, 2014b). This type of streaming is seen in Sri Lanka,
where parental aspirations for their children’s careers influence educational choices differently
for men and women (World Bank, 2013a). Survey results in Sri Lanka show that teaching jobs
are considered ideal for daughters, while engineering jobs are preferred for sons. Conversely, a
very small proportion of parents preferred teaching jobs for their sons and engineering jobs for
their daughters (ibid). In most South Asian countries, achievement tends to be higher among male
rather than female students– mainly in mathematics and science, but sometimes also in reading
and language (Dundar et al. 2014a).

An increase in educational attainment and improved learning quality must be combined
with more job-oriented education for girls. Girls’ educational attainment is linked to the
building of employment-related skills, which enhances their overall quality of life and helps them
become productive citizens. A review of investments in women’s education, including skills
acquisition, notes significant improvements in various aspects of economic empowerment, voice

                                                                                               82
and agency, and even in reproductive and other health outcomes (Malhotra et al. 2003). However,
despite their availability in all countries, vocational training offerings have been inefficient at
linking women to sustainable employment opportunities (Agarwal 2013). More nuanced forms of
gender bias connected to gender norms could explain some of these disparities. For example, Sri
Lanka’s technical and vocational education and training (TVET) programs follow country-wide
trends towards achieving gender parity in enrollments, but closer examination shows that women
are limited to acquiring a narrower range of skills that disadvantage their participation in the labor
market (Dundar et al. 2014b). Women’s participation has been concentrated in areas considered
more ‘feminine,’ such as sewing, home science and secretarial work. Recent trends show more
women enrolling in computer, accounting, management, and commerce courses; however, these
programs are not always equipped to meet the needs of female school leavers (ibid.).

c. Persistent Poor Health Outcomes and Systemic Gender Bias

Poor health outcomes in the areas of reproductive and child health, as detailed in Chapter
2, are part of a systemic pattern of overlooking or neglecting the particular health needs of
girl children, female adolescents, and women. Household practices that relegate women’s
health needs are determined by son preference. Male children have greater value in the family
because of their expected higher income-earning potential and support to elderly parents, while
male-biased cultural practices around dowry and inheritance make girls less wanted (Das Gupta
2003). These norms underlie household-level gender-based discrimination in access to a range of
preventive and curative health services throughout a woman’s life cycle. Excess female child
mortality in South Asia is particularly attributable to the discrimination and neglect of girls at
younger ages, which is prevalent in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. According to
evidence in India, hospitalization rates to treat diarrhea, respiratory disease and other illnesses are
substantially lower for girls than boys. In Bangladesh, female children are more likely to die of
diarrhea because of delays in timely hospitalization (Bhan et al. 2005; Mitra et al. 2000). Other
studies find that nutrition deficits and lower immunization rates among girl children are strongly
associated with gender bias (Singh 2012; Borooah 2004).

The incidence of female child mortality is not driven by poverty alone. In fact, in certain parts
of India and Bangladesh, higher levels of female child mortality and neglect take place in
wealthier households (Murthi et al. 1995; Pal 1999; Bairagi 1986). An important determinant
underlying excess female child mortality is the sex composition of children in the household;
second or higher order daughters are more likely to be unwanted and at greater risk of suffering
greater neglect or mortality (Pal 1999; Pande 2003; Mishra et al. 2004; Corsi et al. 2009).
Discrimination against girls also extends to unborn female children, as seen in the growing
imbalance in sex ratios at birth. The problem is particularly acute in India, where the low value of
girls in the family combined with declining fertility and greater access to sex determination
technologies has led to an increase in sex-selective abortions. Worsening child sex ratios,
occurring in the context of greater economic affluence and rising incomes in India, show that
there is a need to focus on changing pernicious gender norms that stall progress on gender
equality across all income categories.

d. Low Birth Registration, Poverty, and Mobility Constraints

High rates of excess female child mortality, among other poor outcomes for girls, have been
linked to low rates of birth registration. Without birth registration, there is no formal record to
recognize a child’s rights and practical needs, including access to basic health and education
services, and protection from child labor and child marriage. As adults, having a birth certificate
enables one to obtain a passport, vote, and otherwise participate fully in society.

                                                                                                    83
Although South Asian countries tend to have laws requiring birth registration, enforcement
is low. With only 36 percent of births registered for children less than five years old, South Asia
lags all other regions (UNICEF 2011). The countries with the lowest rates are Afghanistan and
Pakistan, which have less than 30 percent of all births registered. Bangladesh has made rapid
progress in recent years, having increased birth registration from under 10 percent to more than
50 percent between 2006 and 2009.

India and Nepal have registered less than 50 percent of all births (UNICEF 2011). According to
Child Line India, an NGO that works to improve the country’s birth registration rates, one of the
challenges is that registration is generally not associated with children’s access to health care or
education (Childline India). Other reasons include low public awareness of birth registration; lack
of political motivation or infrastructure to improve the registration system; limitations on poor
families who cannot afford registration; and gender bias, which inherently restricts the pathway
for girls at various points throughout the registration process.

Poverty and mobility constraints are significant determinants of poor reproductive health
care and other health outcomes. There is substantial variation in health outcomes within the
region, and even within countries, income, education, and the urban-rural divide mark the largest
disparities. Those belonging to lower wealth quintiles in rural areas are most affected by the poor
quality of healthcare, lack of access, and low uptake in the utilization of health services. DHS
data show that in India, women in the wealthiest quintile are 80-90 percent more likely to give
birth in a health facility than women belonging to the poorest quintile (Tey and Lai 2013).
Similarly, the probability that a rural woman delivers in a health facility is 50 percent lower than
that of urban women (ibid). Poverty strongly restricts the uptake of health services: 39 percent of
women in Pakistan and 22 percent of women in India cite high costs as the primary reason for not
using health services (ibid.). Poor infrastructure and other constraints on mobility further
undermine access to health care (Andres et al. 2013; Biller et al. 2014). In Pakistan, for instance,
women living in villages without road access are significantly less likely to have prenatal
consultations and are more likely to deliver at home in the absence of a skilled birth attendant
compared to women in villages with road access (World Bank 2006). Thus, together with
interventions for better health care, infrastructure interventions that provide better links to health
services can contribute significantly to improving health outcomes.

e. Nutrition, Adolescent Health Programs Lack Consideration of Gender Dynamics

Adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs of boys and girls have not received
adequate attention. Given that the region has the world’s largest population of working-age
youth, meeting adolescents’ SRH information and service needs will be crucial for their
productive development. Recent research notes a dearth of opportunities and venues for
Maldivian youths – both girls and boys – to access information on sexual and reproductive health
(World Bank 2014a). Around a quarter of young men (21.9 percent) and young women (25.3
percent) do not discuss reproductive health issues with anyone (Maldives DHS 2009).

Attention to adolescents’ particular needs is especially important given the high rates of
child marriage in the region. Poor sexual and reproductive health has a disproportionate impact
on adolescent girls due to their early initiation into sexual activity and childbearing in the context
of marriage. Early marriage places women at a significant disadvantage by exposing them to a
host of risks and vulnerabilities at a young age. It is associated with a higher risk of sexually
transmitted infections, increased likelihood of intimate partner violence and coercive sex, and
adverse maternal and child health outcomes—including unplanned pregnancy, improperly spaced

                                                                                                   84
repeat childbirths, and inadequate use of maternal health services (Cortez et al. 2015). It also
impedes autonomy, knowledge, resources, and decision-making power among young women
(Aguilar and Cortez 2015). In Bangladesh, where adolescent girls are on average married by age
15, 70 percent have had their first child by the time they reach age 19 (Cortez et al. 2015).

Poor nutrition is a gender issue. Women’s status in the family and society are key predictors of
improvements in nutrition outcomes in the region (Blumberg et al. 2013). Gender dynamics
within the household and in the community—especially with respect to women’s health,
education and autonomy—contribute to nutrition outcomes among young children (Sen and Hook
2012). For example, women who are undernourished have a higher likelihood of giving birth to
children with lower than normal birth weight and increased risk to survival, leading to under-
nutrition during adolescence and adulthood. These deficiencies are then transmitted to subsequent
generations. High fertility combined with malnutrition in women and adolescent girls heightens
the risk of both maternal and infant mortality. Women also play a critical role in influencing the
nutrition outcomes of their children (Blumberg et al. 2013). Recent research suggests, moreover,
that involving fathers and other household members—in addition to mothers—in feeding
practices of infants and young children can further improve nutritional outcomes for children
(Sen and Hook 2012). In spite of this evidence, a mapping of nutrition initiatives in South Asia
finds that gender considerations are not adequately addressed in the design and implementation of
nutrition programs (ibid.).


4. Economic Opportunities: Gendered Supply and Demand Factors in Labor, Land and
Financial Markets


a. Labor Demand and Supply

As South Asia urbanizes, both demand- and supply-side factors further undermine
women’s labor market outcomes. In their efforts to identify determinants of South Asian
women’s low labor force participation rates, the Bank’s country-specific studies reveal a complex
story of mutually reinforcing constraints that result in low female labor force participation rates
and unsatisfactory job outcomes, even when women do participate at higher rates in comparison
to men.

Recent studies reveal several common drivers for low rates of female labor force
participation in South Asian countries. Bank-led research on female labor force participation
dynamics in Sri Lanka (World Bank 2014a), Bhutan (World Bank, 2013d), and Pakistan (2005b)
suggests several common drivers for low rates of female labor force participation in these three
countries: (i) women’s greater share of household responsibilities including caring for children
and elderly family members; (ii) a skills mismatch between the education and training that girls
and women receive and what employers seek; (iii) gender bias in parents’ and employers’
expectations of men and women, which play out in life choice, job search and hiring processes;
and (iv) mobility constraints that limit women’s employment options due to poor infrastructure,
unsafe public transport, or increasingly distant job markets (World Bank 2006; 2013a).

These determinants of women’s labor supply (namely, household responsibilities; mobility
constraints; and gender norms that orient boys and girls differently in their education, skills
attainment, employment, and career aspirations) conspire with demand factors for women’s labor
(i.e., the gap between skills acquired by women and skills sought by employers, especially in
growth sectors of economies; occupational segregation; employers’ calculus of how women’s

                                                                                                85
family roles might affect their productivity; and other attitudes in the workplace that may
undermine demand for women workers) to limit both women’s incentives to seek sustainable
employment and employers’ incentives to recruit, hire and promote them.

In Sri Lanka, for example, having a child under the age of five in the household lowers the
likelihood of FLFP by 33 percentage points, but has no significant impact on men’s participation
(World Bank 2013a). In Bhutan, even though gender gaps in labor force participation have
narrowed substantially, women’s responsibilities for child care and domestic work continue to
keep them in lower paid and less secure jobs compared to men, because they have less time to
devote to higher education, seek employment, and pursue opportunities for career advancement
(World Bank 2013d). Taking such effects into consideration, addressing the aforementioned
determinants will be critical to the expansion of FLFP and women’s employment in the region.

Key research suggests potential policy options, but also reveals knowledge gaps. A study of
the determinants of low female labor force in India has proposed a number of policy initiatives to
increase women’s participation. These include: (i) increased labor market flexibility, which could
lead to the creation of more formal sector jobs, to which women working in the informal sector
could apply; (ii) supply-side reforms to improve infrastructure and address other constraints to
job creation; and (iii) higher social spending, including investment in education, which can boost
women’s human capital and lead to higher female labor force participation (Das et al. 2015).
More research is also needed to understand the complex interaction between opportunities and
barriers that affect women’s access to and participation in labor markets, including
unemployment patterns (particularly for educated and skilled women), availability and access to
child care services, and entry to and exit from the labor market through the lifecycle. Such
research must take into consideration each country’s unique and ongoing economic and social
transformation as well as country and context specific-constraints such as those imposed by
conflict and fragility (see Box 3.4).

Urbanization is associated with gender-specific changes in labor demand. Groundbreaking
new research highlights the role of urbanization and related changes in labor demand in
understanding FLFP trends in India. The study finds that the decline in FLFP in India—especially
among rural women—can be explained by diminishing employment prospects in the agricultural
sector that are not met by corresponding increases in job opportunities in other sectors that are
considered suitable for women (Chatterjee et al. 2015). The study also indicates that FLFP in
India is likely underestimated by household surveys, which are not yet accounting for the
increasing range within the urban-rural classification system brought about by rapid urbanization.
This suggests that India needs to consider not only supply-side interventions to improve FLFP
rates, but—more to the point—to intervene in demand-side factors and encourage the creation of
jobs that better reflect variations in local economies along the rural-urban gradation (ibid).

Box 3.4 Gender dimensions of economic constraints in fragile and conflict-affected states

 Conflict and fragility impose additional economic hardships for men and women living in such
 contexts. The loss of regular employment often forces people to migrate in search of jobs or
 find alternate sources of income to fulfill basic economic necessities. An analysis of household
 data from Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, finds that conflict-affected zones in these
 countries display higher rates of vulnerable employment, especially among women (Iyer and
 Santos 2012). In Sri Lanka, the likelihood of being an unpaid family worker increases by seven
 percentage points as a result of armed conflict (ibid). Further, the loss of men’s identities as
 primary breadwinners can give rise to feelings of disempowerment and frustration, which is

                                                                                                86
 also associated with increases in violence against women and girls. Given the typically higher
 rates of mortality and migration among men during armed conflict, women are often left to
 fend for themselves and their families, increasing the share of female-headed households. In
 post-conflict settings, these households are much more vulnerable to social exclusion and
 extreme poverty.
 Programmatic approaches to addressing economic constraints in conflict-affecting settings
 have involved better targeting of livelihood and income-generation activities to vulnerable
 households (see ENReP in Chapter 4). Programs have also sought to diversify economic
 opportunities by supporting women’s engagement in non-farm enterprises through micro-credit
 instruments (see AREDP in Chapter 4). Involving the private sector in gender-inclusive job
 creation is yet another promising approach being implemented by the IFC in conflict-affected
 African countries (See CASA in Chapter 4). Finally, integrated approaches that address gender
 norms in programs geared towards economic empowerment can help transform the deeper
 social norms that underlie gender-constraints in conflict-affected situations.



b. Gender Exclusion in Financial Services and Asset Ownership

Formal and informal constraints undermine women’s ownership, access to, and productive
use of financial services, land, and other inherited property. Underlying socio-cultural factors,
such as gender norms that impose mobility restrictions on females, lower average literacy rates,
and a general lack of financial awareness contribute heavily to the financial exclusion of women
in most South Asian countries. Lack of access to financial services also inhibits entrepreneurship
opportunities among women. Regulatory barriers derived from male-biased gender norms, such
as requiring a male household member as a guarantor, and stringent collateral requirements make
it difficult for women to start businesses and participate in the more remunerative ends of value
chains and small trade; the deleterious effects of such requirements are further exacerbated by the
fact that most women in South Asia lack collateral due to male-biased inheritance patterns
(Safavian and Haq; see also World Bank 2014c). Even when women are able to undertake
business activities, the nature, scale, and location of their enterprises are influenced by such
constraints.

Recent research shows that access to financial services alone does not ensure women’s
control or decision-making power over their utilization. A study assessing women’s access to
microfinance in Pakistan found that the majority of female beneficiaries were not the final users
of loans, but rather conduits to male household members (Safavian and Haq 2013). In Sri Lanka,
a field experiment assessing the impact of cash or in-kind grants on female and male business
owners found that the intervention, while successful in increasing profits for men, did not show
any improvements in income earned by female-owned enterprises (de Mel et al. 2009). Having
controlled for entrepreneurial ability, the authors suggest that inefficient intra-household
bargaining and social constraints—such as restricted mobility and limited access to professional
networks—could underlie the observed gender differences.

Even if laws allow women to inherit, customary practices still favor male inheritance in
most countries. Many women who are aware of their land ownership and inheritance rights
choose not to claim them, either because of local customs and practices, or due to the fear of
reprisal from other family members, especially brothers (World Bank 2005b). Instruments to


                                                                                                  87
address these inequalities need to consider formal (legal) and informal mechanisms (i.e., attitudes
that spring from biased gender norms) to address male bias in lending and inheritance practices.

A range of Bank instruments including research, technical assistance and lending
operations can directly address gender gaps in access to and use of finance, and in asset
ownership. For example, the Bank’s Land Administration and Land Certification Projects help
women better understand their land rights and secure clear land title to their properties. Recent
research also suggests the need to enhance incentives and skills for women to use finance
productively, create enterprises, and claim rights to assets (Safavian and Haq 2013; World Bank
2014c). Simultaneously addressing these needs, as well as gender gaps in labor force participation
and asset ownership, will serve to improve women’s ability to start small businesses and
participate in trade, which can lead to greater economic growth and well-being for their families.


c. The Role of Infrastructure. Environment and Climate Change

Poor infrastructure exacerbates socially determined constraints on women and girls,
hindering their access to income-earning opportunities and essential services. Poor
infrastructure reinforces gender disparities by increasing the time women spend on household
chores and by placing additional constraints on their mobility. South Asian women, who are
responsible for most household chores that require energy and/or time (i.e., cleaning, cooking,
washing, and fetching fuel and water), lack water infrastructure or access to energy sources,
making their household work more time-consuming, labor intensive, and physically and mentally
exacting. Further, the absence of safe transport or other public infrastructure—such as street
lighting—places women at greater risk of experiencing violence and sexual assault. Safety threats
constrain mobility, thus limiting educational and economic opportunities available to women. A
recent World Bank study estimates that closing the region’s total infrastructure gap in water,
sanitation, electricity, transport and telecom access, will require a total investment in the range of
US $1.7–2.5 trillion (at current prices) until 2020 (Andres et al. 2013).

Inadequate infrastructure in the region has an important bearing on sustained gender disparities in
household labor and resource allocation, labor force participation, and access to social and
professional networks and essential services. The gender implications of inadequate infrastructure
are discussed below, on a sector-by-sector basis.

Transport: Social restrictions on women’s mobility are amplified in the absence of safe, reliable,
and affordable transport options. As South Asia undergoes rapid urbanization, it is necessary to
address travel needs and other challenges faced by women in both rural and urban contexts.
Studies find that women and men’s experience of public spaces, mobility patterns, and travel
needs differ to a great extent. Women in urban areas are more likely than men to make multiple
trips and use public transportation in order to complete household chores or travel to work. A
report on gender and transport in Nepal finds that both male and female commuters tend to feel
insecure due to overcrowding and lack of safety in public transport (World Bank 2013c).
However, women are disproportionately affected by the risk of inappropriate touching, sexual
harassment and gender-based violence (ibid; Solotaroff and Pande 2014). Problems of petty
harassment, teasing, groping, and, in extreme cases, violence or rape on public transport are
serious concerns for women commuters in urban and rural areas. These difficulties constrain
women’s labor force participation by limiting their ability to commute to work. In some cases,
girls are unable to continue their schooling because of parents’ concerns for their safety on public
transport. A small but growing body of evidence shows that gender-aware transport interventions
ease some of these barriers, especially those related to safety and the time burden of travel. For

                                                                                                   88
example, in Sri Lanka, the provision of emergency transport services has made a significant
contribution in the reduction of MMR (Pathmanathan et al. 2003).

Water Supply and Sanitation: Despite improved water availability, supply is intermittent and
piped water reaches only a quarter of the population in South Asia (WHO/UNICEF Joint
Monitoring Program). The absence of adequate water infrastructure often requires that individuals
travel long distances on foot and make frequent trips to fetch water, which increases time spent
on completing these tasks. According to a Water GP-led global review of gender dimensions in
country water, sanitation and health policies (yet to be published), the time and opportunity cost
of these activities is borne primarily by women, as are the health costs arising from the physical
strain of travelling long distances and the mental stress of ensuring that domestic water needs are
fulfilled. A study in Pakistan finds that having a water source located further away from the home
increases the likelihood of women spending more time on water collection and reduces the
likelihood of women engaging in income-generating work (Ilahi and Grimard 2000). However, a
more recent study evaluating the impact of improved water infrastructure in nine developing
countries including India, Nepal, and Pakistan finds no evidence of an increase in women’s labor
market participation as a result of time saved. Yet, the study does note an 8-9 percent increase in
school enrollment for both girls and boys associated with a one-hour reduction in time spent on
water collection (Koolwal and van de Valle 2010). Moreover, the lack of sanitation facilities
burdens women to a greater extent by exposing them to an increased risk of gender-based
violence, as they must often travel additional distances and utilize secluded areas.

Energy: Energy sector initiatives that expand access to electricity, cleaner fuels, and new
technology have significant potential to increase gender parity across multiple dimensions.
Access to affordable modern energy services—and to the mechanization fueled by them—can
decrease both effort and time spent in productive and reproductive labor—which
disproportionately falls upon women in South Asia. A review of rural electrification projects in
the region finds that women are the key beneficiaries of productivity and efficiency gains from
motive power in the household, which effectively reduces the burden of household chores
(Kohlin et al. 2011). In Bangladesh, time saved from such interventions increases the likelihood
of women being employed or involved in income-generating activities (Chowdhury 2010).
Studies also establish the links between electricity and improved measures of women’s
empowerment. In rural Bhutan, women in households that have access to electricity play a greater
role in health and education-related decision-making (ADB 2010) and in India, access to cable
television and mass media—made possible as a result of electrification—is associated with lower
acceptance of spousal abuse, lower son preference, more autonomy, and a greater likelihood of
young girls attending school (Jensen and Oster 2009). Evidence also suggests that street lighting
increases women and girls’ mobility after dark and in the early morning (Cecelski 2005). By
improving security, street lighting may also reduce the risk of gender-based violence (Doleac and
Sanders 2012). Access to electricity also has powerful implications for women’s reproductive
health: health facilities with electricity are associated with higher numbers of successful
childbirth deliveries, particularly at night, as adequate lighting, sterilization, and obstetric
equipment all require electricity.

Environment: Access to natural resources and their utilization for either domestic purposes or
livelihoods have significant gender implications. Research from India and Nepal shows that the
growing scarcity and reduced accessibility of wood fuel, resulting from the degradation of natural
forest cover, is associated with an increase in time spent by households on fuel collection
(Amacher et al. 1999). A disproportionate amount of this burden falls on women (Kohlin et al.
2011), potentially slowing down progress in reducing gender disparities across many
dimensions—especially in education and employment. Furthermore, women constitute a sizeable

                                                                                                89
share of labor in occupations based on forestry, fisheries, and agriculture, and make crucial
contributions at different points in the production value chain; for example, 80 percent of
working-age women in India’s coastal communities work in retail fishing and related vocations.
In addition to the fact that environmental degradation adversely impacts such labor, gender-
sensitive analyses and evidence on effectively enhancing productivity in these sectors remains
limited.

Additionally, carbon emissions and indoor pollution from traditional wood fuels used in food
preparation are a major cause of respiratory illness among rural women, given that they are
responsible for most cooking within the home (ICMR 2009). Better linking these issues to energy
sector initiatives can alleviate the negative impacts of pollution in households; for example, the
introduction of new technologies such as modern cook stoves and alternative fuels that are
cheaper, cleaner, and more efficient can have a significant impact. However, stronger evidence on
the gender-differentiated impacts of such interventions is needed in order to better understand
their benefits, and to substantiate and promote these areas of intersection (Kohlin et al. 2011).

Climate Change: Within the context of climate change and natural disasters, attention to linkages
between environment and gender is critical, as the impacts of such shocks are also mediated by
gender. Research shows that women are more vulnerable and have lower resilience to climate-
related risks (World Bank 2011c). For example, during the cyclone that hit Bangladesh in 1991, a
substantially larger number of women died as compared to men, partly due to mobility
restrictions that require women to tend to the household in such situations or be accompanied by a
male relative when moving to safer zones (ibid; Ahmed 2012). More recently, the World Bank
team that conducted the post-disaster needs assessment following the Nepal earthquake of 2015
found that more women and girls died than men and boys, in part because of gender roles that
disproportionately assign indoor chores to female household members. Gender-related
disadvantages also decrease women’s uptake of practices that help mitigate and manage risks to
livelihoods that result from climate change. In the agricultural sector, for example, women’s
relatively lower training and skills development, constraints on mobility, and limited access to
assets and inputs means they have lower adaptive capacity and are less likely than men to
successfully adopt climate-smart agricultural approaches and practices (World Bank, FAO, and
IFAD 2015). Gender-responsive climate interventions that take into account men and women’s
different needs and circumstances therefore have tremendous potential to address gender
disparities (ibid.).

5. Voice and Agency: Signs of Increased Decision-making, though Violence Prevails

In South Asia, women’s voice and agency is undermined by widespread gender-based violence
and constraints on decision-making. These factors play a critical role in determining women’s
mobility and access to public spaces, services and markets.

a. Widespread Acceptance of Violence against Women and Girls

The determinants of GBV are many and multi-faceted. The prevalence of GBV in South Asia
is symptomatic of deeper gender-based inequalities that disadvantage women in almost all
spheres of life. The high tolerance of violence against women and girls, held intact by social
norms and discrimination in formal and informal institutions, reinforces gender gaps in voice and
agency. GBV arising from gender constraints on voice and agency is linked to women’s low
levels of education, lack of control over resources, and limited agency in decision-making. Child
marriage is one of the best documented examples of GBV that results from the combination of


                                                                                                90
these factors. The risk of violence is twice as high for girls who marry before the age of 18 in
India; at younger ages women have lower levels of agency and decision-making power (ICRW
2005). Similar arguments have been extended to the relationship between GBV and control over
resources, though the evidence here is more mixed. In India’s state of West Bengal, the incidence
of violence was higher among women who did not own property or housing compared to women
who did (Agarwal and Panda 2007). In Sri Lanka and Kerala, however, women’s property
ownership was associated with higher levels of violence against women (Klugman et al. 2014).

Gender norms supporting GBV prevail among the general public (Table 3.1). These norms
are accepted not only by perpetrators of the abuse, but also among family and community
members who witness it, and by the women who experience violence (Solotaroff and Pande
2014). Analysis of DHS data from 54 countries shows a high correlation between lower education
levels and control over resources and the justification of wife beating (Klugman et al. 2014).

While there are many legal protections against GBV, implementation remains inconsistent.
At the institutional level, it is not the absence of legal protections against violence but the
widespread disregard of laws and mechanisms to enforce them that fuels GBV (Solotaroff and
Pande 2014). For example, legal provisions instituted to protect children from violence and abuse
may be rendered ineffective because SAR countries do not have adequate systems in place to
monitor their implementation (ibid; Heiberg and Thukral 2013). Research in India and Pakistan
has shown these gaps to be one of the major risk factors in the continuation of high levels of child
physical and sexual abuse (Iravani 2011; HRW 2013; Hyder and Malik 2007). In conflict-affected
and fragile contexts such gaps are exacerbated, thereby increasing the risk of sexual gender-based
violence (see Box 3.5). Moreover, many cases of violence either go unreported or are not
properly investigated because the police are often not trained to deal with cases of sexual assault
or violence against women, which in turn discourages women from seeking assistance. A study
conducted in Bangladesh found that only two percent of abused women reach out to institutions
for help (Singh and Kapur 2001; Naved et al. 2006).

b. Qualitative and Quantitative Gender Gaps in Decision-making

When women engage in decision-making at the household level, there are a wide range of
positive outcomes. The level of independent decision-making power women exercise in the
household is positively correlated with improved access to services, expanded educational and
economic opportunities, as well as better welfare outcomes for women. In Pakistan, a one percent
increase in women’s decision-making power is associated with increases of up to 10 percent in
the uptake of pre and postnatal health services (Hou and Ma 2013). Moreover, female autonomy
at home has beneficial spillover effects on the health, nutrition, and well-being of children. An
evaluation of the Integrated Child Development Services program in India finds that infants are
less likely to be underweight and wasted if their mothers are more involved in decision-making
within the household (Shroff et al. 2011). Despite such evidence, women’s lack of say in
household decision-making is extensive.
Educational attainment and wage employment are generally accepted as key determinants of
women’s decision-making power in the household. Studies also show that land ownership or
greater control over assets tends to shift the household decision-making dynamic in favor of
women. In Nepal and rural Karnataka in India, women who own land are more likely to influence
decision-making at home (Allendorf 2007).
Box 3.5 Sexual gender-based violence (SGBV) in fragile and conflict-affected states

 The increase in gender-based violence that occurs in conflict and fragile situations stretches
 already tenuous environments. A higher proportion of women and girls are vulnerable to
 SGBV, however, men can be victims of such violence as well. In addition to the amplified
 threat and incidence of rape and sexual abuse during armed conflict, increases in intimate
 partner violence, trafficking, and sexual exploitation of displaced populations makes post-
 conflict settings highly prone to sexual violence as well (Anderlini 2010). Moreover, weakened
 administrative and judicial protections and strained social relations in such situations may add
 to the impunity of perpetrators. SGBV has a debilitating impact on survivors and their families
 while also undermining social cohesion and the development goals of communities affected by
 it.

 Hence, the complexity of the problem requires multi-sectoral approaches covering the
 provision of immediate and longer-term health care, access to justice and institutional support,
 economic and social integration of survivors, and the involvement of community stakeholders
 in prevention and mitigation efforts. Examples of gender-sensitive institutional reform come
 from Nicaragua, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, where the introduction of female staff in the police
 force and other government agencies and departments created a more female-friendly
 environment for the reporting and handling of cases involving sexual violence (World Bank
 2011a). In Nepal and Liberia, fast-track courts were established to accelerate decisions on rape
 cases involving women and children. Direct support to survivors of SGBV through the
 expansion of health and psychosocial services, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy, have led
 to substantial improvements in the mental and physical health outcomes of beneficiaries.
 Programmatic approaches have extended to the sensitization and capacity building of key
 stakeholders, especially men, boys and influential community leaders, to support the
 reintegration of survivors into mainstream society, and to help change social taboos around
 those who have suffered such abuse (see Chapter 4).




                                                                                                92
Many challenges restrict women’s equal participation and decision-making outside of the
home. Limits on female mobility, low access to social networks, and other restrictions on voice
and agency undermine women’s equal participation and decision-making in the community and
in higher-level leadership positions. Social norms about gender shape negative attitudes with
regard to women’s representation in public roles (Klugman et al. 2014). These perceptions can
further limit participation. For example, countries in which a higher proportion of respondents
believe that men make better political leaders tend to have lower shares of women
parliamentarians (World Bank 2013e). Studies evaluating the expansion of women’s political
representation through mandatory quotas in India’s Panchayats (Village Councils) have shown
positive gender impacts, including changing negative opinions towards women’s decision-making
and leadership ability.


B. What Do We Know About What Works? Impact Evaluations Shed Insights,
Reveal Gaps

With increasing gender integration in areas beyond human development—such as microfinance,
land management, infrastructure, and voice and agency—we know more about effective
approaches to reducing gender inequality. The following section draws on evidence from the
region to highlight interventions that clearly demonstrate positive gender impacts, as well as those
where results are mixed or inconclusive. We rely as much as possible on rigorous empirical work
from impact evaluations (IEs) of Bank pilots and operations, giving priority to those involving
randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Where evaluations with this degree of rigor do not exist, we
have drawn from program evaluations by external sources, using a well-defined methodology. In
order to improve gender outcomes in the region and to achieve the WBG Gender Strategy FY16-
23, it will be necessary to build on these lessons, take successful approaches to scale, and increase
gender-relevant data and analysis through operation’s preparation studies or results frameworks.
Similarly, it will be important to conduct new pilots, as well as IEs of projects in order to better
understand what works and what doesn’t.


1. Education and Skills Development: Changes in Perception Needed for Social and
Economic Progress

a. Conditional Cash Transfers
Cash transfers—especially those which are conditional—have significantly improved girls’
enrollment and retention rates, while simultaneously reducing instances of child marriage.
Such programs address numerous drivers of early marriage, including access to education,
poverty, and limited livelihood opportunities. Cash transfer programs which aim to decrease child
marriage show positive impacts among girls involved in the interventions.
For example, the Female Secondary School Assistance Program (FSSAP) has had a significant
impact on educational enrollment and age of marriage in Bangladesh. Since 1994, the program
has engaged 5,000 target schools in 118 districts, providing tuition fees and monthly stipends for
rural girls until class 10—conditional on the fact that they maintain a 75 percent school
attendance rate, maintain some level of measured academic proficiency, and remain unmarried.
As a result of the program, female enrollment more than doubled in secondary school, and
women’s overall educational attainment increased by 1.6 to 2 years (Khandker et al. 2003). The
program also increased enrollment among girls aged 11-18 by 12 percentage points—yet it had
no impact on men (Khandker et al. 2003). Furthermore, women’s age of marriage of increased by

                                                                                                  93
1.4 to 2.3 years; some evidence indicates that the age of marriage for men also increased
(Khandker et al. 2003). FSSAP is also likely to have reversed the gender gap in secondary school
enrollment (Fuwa, 2001; Asadullah and Chaudhury, 2009; Patrinos, 2008).

Another successful example from the region is the Female School Stipend Program on Public
School Enrollment in Punjab, Pakistan, which led to a 9 percentage point increase in the
enrollment of eligible girls in middle school (Alam et al. 2011). Under the program, girls are
eligible for stipends if they are enrolled in a participating government school for grades 6-8, and
retain an average class attendance rate of 80 percent or higher (Chaudhury and Parajuli 2006).
Four years after implementation, a number of results are evident: participating girls are 3 to 6
percentage points more likely to complete middle school, and younger cohorts with exposure to
the program are 4-5 percentage points more likely to transition to high school and 5 percentage
points more likely to complete one year of education at that level (Alam et al. 2011). The
program has also had a slight impact on early marriage and fertility rates—participants in the 15-
19 year old age bracket are seen to delay their age of first marriage by 1.4 years, as well as to
have 0.3 fewer children (Alam et al. 2011).

Overall, results from various IEs in South Asia suggest that the most effective way to improve
girls’ enrollment and retention is through a multi-level approach that incentivizes attendance and
retention through cash transfer programs (Alam et al. 2011; Baird et al. 2010, 2011; Heath and
Mobarak 2012; Khandker et al 2003).

Cash transfers have been seen to positively influence other gender outcomes too, especially
those related to women’s voice and agency. This is exemplified by the Benazir Income Support
Program in Pakistan (BISP), which directly provides unconditional cash transfers (a monthly
value of 1,000 Pakistani rupees) to any female head of family.11 Implemented since 2008, the
program targets the poorest 25 percent of the country’s population and reaches nearly five million
beneficiary families. The program’s impact evaluation indicates that a majority of female
beneficiaries (64 percent) retain control of the cash transfer—in terms of how the funds are
spent—suggesting an increase in their decision-making power within the household. In
beneficiary households, there are also increased proportions of women who vote (Cheema et al.
2014). Other impacts include an increase in women’s mobility, as well as an overall positive shift
in community perceptions about women’s mobility. Additionally, reduced rates of malnutrition
were evident amongst girls aged 0-59 months (Cheema et al. 2014).

b. Changing Community Perceptions to Prevent Child Marriage

Awareness raising programs can improve communities’ knowledge about issues of
gender—including child marriage. One such example is BRAC’s Gender Quality Action
Learning Program, which sought to promote gender equality both within households and
communities in Bangladesh. In 2005 and 2006, the program provided gender training to 1,200
men and women, who subsequently went on to work as educators for others, conducting 7,200
uthan baithaks (courtyard meetings) (Alim 2007). The program also utilized videos on gender-
based violence and discrimination, as well as popular theater on gender equity (Alim 2007).
Findings from an IE show that villagers’ knowledge of a number of issues—including nutrition,
inheritance and divorce laws, as well as punishments for giving and taking dowry—had improved
(Alim 2007). Notably, 51.3 percent of respondents indicated an increased level of knowledge on


11Under BISP, “female had of family” is defined as every ever-married woman in the household in possession of a
valid Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) (Cheema et al. 2014).

                                                                                                                  94
the legal age of marriage for men, and 33 percent indicated increased knowledge on the legal age
of marriage for women.

Promoting local female leadership can help prevent instances of child marriage. As
community leaders are in many instances the principal upholders of social norms at the local
level, shifting their attitudes can have a cascading effect throughout communities. In an effort to
challenge gender stereotypes, Oxfam sponsored a community-based rural livelihoods program
that trained women to be community veterinarians, traditional birth attendants and community
health workers. Male and female shura (councils) were established to implement Oxfam
programming, and in particular, the female shura were tasked with creating awareness about safe
child delivery, resolving disputes between women and stopping child marriage (Gandhi and
Krijnen 2006). The program evaluation notes that women have reported success in stopping child
marriage, and that the age at marriage has increased from 10-12 years to 18-20 years—although
the evaluation does not thoroughly document this shift (Gandhi and Krijnen 2006). Furthermore,
women indicate that they have begun to experience a voice in household decision making,
particularly with regard to stopping child marriage (Gandhi and Krijnen 2006).

Some evidence indicates that life-skills and livelihoods training can impact rates of child
marriage. Also in Bangladesh, the Kishori Abhijan program increased knowledge of gender-
related issues among girls, as well as led to improved outcomes. Among other objectives, the
program sought to lower school dropout rates, increase girls’ independent economic activity, and
raise the age at which girls marry; this was accomplished through a combination of life-skills and
livelihoods training (Amin 2011). The life-skills training component included education on
gender roles and discrimination, health and nutrition, and on legislation and legal rights—with a
special focus on early marriage and girls’ and women’s rights. In addition to improving
knowledge in several gender-relevant areas, as well as increasing employment and mobility, there
were specific benefits observed for younger girls (12-14 years). In the poorest district, these girls
saw improved rates of educational enrollment, as well as lower marriage rates (Amin and Suran
2005a).

c. Improving the Transition from School to Employment

When tailored to the specific needs of young women, market appropriate skills training can
effectively facilitate girls’ transition from school to productive employment. This has been
best exemplified by recent programming conducted through the World Bank’s Adolescent Girls
Initiative (AGI). The AGI works to promote the transition of adolescent girls and young women
from school to productive employment through the use of a number of interventions, including
business development and technical and vocational training that targets high demand skills.
Additionally, all programs incorporate life skills training. Piloted in eight countries—
Afghanistan, Jordan, Lao PDR, Liberia, Haiti, Nepal, Rwanda, and South Sudan—each program
is designed and implemented according to the respective country context, so as to better address
the different constraints girls face in accessing and sustaining productive employment.

In Nepal, the Adolescent Girls Employment Initiative (AGEI) targeted young women with
livelihood trainings, spanning 39 occupations. Trainees also received life skills training and
assistance with job searching and placement, or were otherwise provided with the support needed
to start their own businesses. One year later, the treatment group increased their non-farm
employment by 14 percentage points, with a total gain in employment of 47 percent as compared
to the control group. Average monthly earnings increased by approximately 45 percent for the
2010 cohort and 66 percent for the 2011 cohort. In contrast, limited effects were found on
empowerment, reproductive health and household-level outcomes (World Bank 2015a).

                                                                                                  95
Also conducted under the auspices of the AGI, the Economic Empowerment of Adolescent Girls
and Young Women (EPAG) project in Liberia provided 6 months of training, followed by 6
months of placement and support, to assist in a smooth transition from the classroom to wage or
self-employment. Under the program, 70 percent of girls received training in business
development skills, and 30 percent received job skills, tailored to high demand sectors.
Participants were also provided with life skills training and stipends. Subsequently, the training
led to a 50 percent increase in employment. Strong employment outcomes are seen for business
skills trainees, as 87 percent are self-employed. Overall, the provision of skills training through
the EPAG project significantly improved employment, earnings and savings outcomes for girls
(World Bank 2012).

2. Health and Nutrition: Promote Incentives and Inclusive Engagement

a. Incentivize Families to Value Welfare of Young and Adolescent Girls
Conditional cash transfers can promote greater investments in young girls’ health and
mitigate excess female child mortality in the short term. Conditional cash transfers have been
successful in increasing the uptake of health and education services across a variety of contexts
(Fiszbein and Schady 2009). In a similar effort, the Government of Haryana in India, launched a
cash transfer scheme in 1994—Apni Beti, Apna Dhan (ABAD)—with the intention of improving
parents’ attitudes towards girl children. The program offers a cash grant to families upon the birth
of a daughter, as well as a long-term savings bond, which can be redeemed if the daughter
remains unmarried until her 18th birthday. An IE of the program finds that poor households
respond positively to this incentive; families in the program are more likely to bear daughters,
potentially shifting sex ratios in favor of girls. Recipient parents also make greater investments in
the health needs of female children after their birth. Results however, do not show any significant
change in mothers’ preference for male children, suggesting that financial incentives alone may
not be sufficient in changing gender norms which place a lower value on girls as compared to
boys (Sinha and Yoong 2009).

Another government effort in Tamil Nadu, India included a series of measures to specifically
target female infanticide in the state. These measures included conditional cash transfers to
families below the poverty line who had only daughters, a scheme under which the government
sheltered and helped find adoptive homes for unwanted female infants, programming to increase
community awareness on the value of the girl child, improved enforcement of birth registration,
and death audits to investigate the causes of infant fatalities. Comparisons between 1996-1999
and 2003 show a 46 percent drop in the female-to-male infant mortality ratio, indicating that these
interventions—in tandem—may have influenced the rate of post-birth female infant mortality.
However, there does not seem to be any significant effect on pre-birth sex ratios, which are
skewed in favor of male children (Bedi and Srinivasan 2012; Srinivasan and Bedi 2009, 2010
cited in Solotaroff and Pande 2014). Hence, while evidence certainly indicates that CCTs can
mitigate excess female child mortality in the short term, they may not inherently transform the
pernicious attitudes that lend to such practices.

Investments made early in the lifecycle are critical entry-points for addressing adolescent
sexual and reproductive health. CCTs for education, vocational training, and skills
development represent some of these entry-points. For example, the aforementioned Female
School Stipend Program on Public School Enrollment, a CCT program for education in Punjab,
Pakistan, was demonstrated to have a positive impact on the sexual and reproductive health of
adolescent girls. The program’s evaluation found that providing stipends—conditional on school

                                                                                                  96
attendance and performance—has a measurable effect on marriage and fertility decisions.
Participants are more likely to marry later and have fewer children. On average, girls in the
treatment group have 0.3 fewer children than girls in the control group, suggesting that over time,
girls from the program tend to delay subsequent births (Alam et al. 2011).

Increased attention to women’s household autonomy and economic empowerment is needed
to improve nutritional outcomes. Given that South Asia has the world’s highest rates of
undernourished children, the Bank currently maintains substantial programming to address
nutrition in the region. However, as previously mentioned, many programs have not been as
successful as originally hoped, due to a narrow focus on gender in most interventions, and
inadequate attention to the gender dynamics around feeding. Moreover, few evaluations explore
the gendered determinants of nutrition outcomes. Given the dearth of more rigorous evidence, a
mapping of nutrition programs in South Asia finds that while gender-aware nutrition programs
address mothers’ knowledge, skills and physical health, they often exclude important factors such
as household support, community support, autonomy to make decisions and allocate resources,
and mental health (Sen and Hook 2012). A number of other important factors affect the
nutritional outcome of women and children, including: gender norms (such as the preferential
treatment of male children), early marriage and childbirth, a woman’s low standing within the
family, and a woman’s ability to care for herself and her children pre- and post-childbirth. Special
attention needs to be given to adolescent girls, as they are ascribed an especially low status in
many South Asian societies. Furthermore, adolescent girls who have high rates of
undernourishment are more likely to bear underweight children or die in childbirth, which leads
to a cycle of undernourishment (Sen and Hook 2012).
b. Involve Men and Other Household Members to Improve Health and Nutrition Outcomes
Interventions are more successful when men engage other men on issues of nutrition and
family planning. Men with little knowledge about maternal health or nutrition often make
household decisions in these areas—hence it is critical to shift their perceptions and beliefs.
Programs are now responding to this reality, such as Concern Worldwide’s Male Health Activists
project in Odisha, India. The program utilizes male health workers who work directly alongside
their female counterparts, to provide maternal health and nutritional information to husbands.
These male health workers act as peer counselors, and have demonstrated more success in
reaching out to men on nutrition and family planning issues than female health workers (Concern
Worldwide 2013). Results from an early evaluation indicate that a greater number of men living
in project blocks are more aware of basic reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health
issues; as the evaluation indicates, “they encourage facility-based care, lend support within the
household, and provide more food of higher nutritional content (Concern Worldwide 2013).”
There is also an increased uptake of male contraception, as indicated by female health workers
and other local stakeholders (Concern Worldwide 2013).
Similarly, interventions are more successful when they utilize a positive deviance approach
to engage other household members. Information on feeding and care practices are often
delivered by female community health workers via behavioral change communications (BCC)
programs, which typically focus on pregnant women or mothers. Some BCC programs have seen
improved nutrition outcomes by adapting a positive deviance approach that engages other
members of the household.12 Save the Children’s Child Survival 19 Project, implemented in
Northwestern Afghanistan, utilized such an approach to spread household behaviors that lead to
good nutrition outcomes among mothers, mothers-in-law, and other caregivers. A mid-term

12Positive deviance approaches facilitate peer-to-peer learning among high performers in communities, so that they can
share good practices and thus have a positive influence on others.

                                                                                                                   97
revaluation indicated significant weight gain among 90 percent of children enrolled in the
program (Ihsan 2006). In neighboring Pakistan, Save the Children also implemented the Saving
Newborn Lives initiative, which decreased the number of mothers who gave pre-lacteal feeds to
newborns within 3 days of birth by 45 percent. This was accomplished through the use of positive
deviance trainings with mothers, mothers-in-law, fathers, fathers-in-law, and unmarried men and
women (Sen and Hook 2012).
3. Economic Empowerment: The Path is Multi-faceted and Dynamic

a. Reduce Women’s Time Poverty: The Care Economy
Childcare interventions show positive impacts on women’s labor market outcomes. By
reducing the time mothers spend on unpaid care work, early childhood development and childcare
interventions appear to increase women’s availability for other activities (Box 3.6). The impact of
such programs on women’s labor force participation and employment is especially evident. In
India, the government sponsored Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) runs
Anganwadis (village centers) that provide free health, nutrition, and informal pre-school
education services for children below the age of six years. Mothers who avail these services are
able to leave their children at an Anganwadi center for up to three hours a day. An evaluation of
the program’s impact across rural regions finds that the regular use of either preschooling or daily
supplementary feeding activities increases maternal labor supply by 12 percent (Jain 2012).
Although impacts vary by location and household characteristics, there is an overall 17 percent
increase in employment among mothers who use ICDS services more intensely (Jain 2012).
Outside of South Asia, the Early Childhood Development Program in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil also
shows large gains in women’s economic participation. The program maintains centers with full-
time daycare and health services for children between the ages 0-3 years, who reside in low-
income neighborhoods. A randomized controlled trial shows a 27 percent increase in
employment, an 8 percent increase in labor force participation and a 16 percent decrease in
maternal unemployment among treated mothers. Results are stronger among women who had not
worked during the six months preceding the program; women belonging to this group experience
a 97 percent increase in employment (Barros et al. 2013).

Box 3.6 Early Childhood Interventions


 In South Asia, low rates of active female participation in the labor force can be attributed in
 part to women’s traditional role as caregivers. Hence, the persistent lack of childcare services
 has been seen as a potential cause for low female labor force participation in many countries.
 World Bank research from Sri Lanka suggests that working women who leave the workforce
 during pregnancy often do not return after having children (World Bank 2013a). In light of
 such concerns, a handful of developing countries—including India, Guatemala, Colombia,
 Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil—have created publicly financed childcare
 models. In most of these countries, mothers’ labor force participation is not typically the key
 focus of such programs, and targeting is often based on the income of parents rather than the
 probability of employment for mothers. Yet, many of these programs provide support to
 working mothers and encourage non-working mothers to participate in the job market.




                                                                                                    98
b. The Enabling Role of Infrastructure

Improvements in infrastructure not only help reduce women’s time poverty—they can also
help ease the mobility constraints that prevent women and girls from accessing income
earning opportunities and other services (Box 3.7). Lack of proper roads and other
transportation infrastructure creates physical barriers to women and men’s participation in
economic opportunities and access to essential services. Several evaluations assess the gender-
disaggregated impacts of interventions that improve connectivity, while a number of other
evaluations are currently in progress. During 1995-96, the World Bank supported Rural
Development Project (RDP) in Bangladesh undertook efforts to improve the quality of rural roads
and markets. An IE of the program finds that in RDP treatment villages, female labor supply
increases by 51 percent and male labor supply by 49 percent. The program also shows positive
impacts on both girls and boys’ schooling (Khandker et al. 2006).
Such benefits, however, are not always equally distributed between women and men. Additional
measures may be needed to address norms, which prevent the social and economic gains of
improved connectivity from being fully realized. In India, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak
Yojana (PMGSY) is a rural roads program that aims to connect all Indian villages to markets and
other services. Although an evaluation which assesses the gender impact of this program is
currently ongoing, villagers have reported a number of benefits in a preliminary social impact
assessment—including new employment opportunities, higher household income, a reduction in
travel time for children to school and adults to work, as well as better access to health care
facilities, especially in the event of an emergency. Survey responses show that the extent to which
these benefits are distributed between men and women vary by state, but overall men are able to
better exploit economic opportunities as a result of improved connectivity. Moreover, households
with better resources, capabilities, skills and higher class standing seem to benefit more from the
PMGSY than those belonging to scheduled castes (SCs), scheduled tribes (STs), other backwards
classes (OBCs), and female-headed households. The study recommends that in addition to
improving connectivity, context specific policies—such as access to credit or the provision of
skills or productivity training—are also needed, to enhance opportunities created by the program
among poorer and disadvantaged groups (World Bank 2014f).

Infrastructure interventions also provide evidence of a wide array of gender-related
benefits beyond reductions in women’s time poverty. Implemented from 2009 to 2012, the
World Bank supported Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Nepal created local
water and sanitation user groups to plan and implement water supply and sanitation infrastructure
operations, thus delivering sustainable health, hygiene and productivity benefits to rural
households. The intervention reached 1,140,892 beneficiaries from rural households, including
those of lower caste groups, the poor, minorities, and women. The project resulted in significant
time savings, of which 90 percent was women’s time. The reduction in time poverty led to a 24
percent increase in the income of women engaged in economic activities; women engaged in
income generating activities mobilized 24 million Nepali rupees. Furthermore, the project’s
requirement for female representation in the Water Supply and Sanitation Users committees
enabled 11 percent of chairperson and 98.2 percent of treasurer positions to be occupied by
women (World Bank 2013f).
In another example, the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project
(RERED) in Bangladesh provided affordable solar home system (SHS) units for poor households
in rural areas through subsidies and microfinance loans. An IE of the project finds that as a result
of SHS adoption there is nine percent reduction in the time women spend on fuel collection. The
study however does not discern a pattern in how these time-savings are utilized. Other benefits


                                                                                                  99
include a 1.2 percent reduction in respiratory disease for women above the age of 16 years and an
in increase in women’s decision-making power when SHS adoption is coupled with exposure to
television (Samad et al. 2013).

Box 3.7 Safety and Mobility: “Pink Buses”


 While mobility plays an important role in the educational and health outcomes of women, the safety
 of women in transportation has become a pressing issue. The lack of reliable and safe modes of
 transportation has significant socio-economic effects on education, earnings and employment
 outcomes, as well as on civic participation and cultural involvement. Female participants from the
 recent Lahore mobility study, “Assessing Female Mobility in Lahore, Pakistan,” identified security,
 road safety, transport environment and accessibility of transport as the primary hindrances to
 mobility. Female students and employed women are the primary targets of unwanted physical and
 sexual advances, and women may have to forgo schooling or career opportunities due to safety and
 mobility constraints (World Bank 2014e).

 In order to address safety issues in transportation, various cities around the world have launched
 “pink buses” (women-only busses). Pink bus schemes have succeeded in some cities, but have not
 had the desired impact in other cities. Successful programs have started at a modest level and then
 expanded in accordance with the needs of female commuters. Both studies suggest that a pink bus
 service is only practical if it is subsidized by a public entity, as private bus operators often bear
 huge financial burdens. Another recommendations is that buses should run on routes that
 specifically meet the demand of the female population. Segregated waiting areas, shelter, lighting
 and accessibility of bus stops are also key for success. While the high demand for pink busses
 provides a temporary solution to safety and mobility constraints for women, long-term solutions
 will require interventions that challenge and change the gender norms that impair women’s
 mobility and safety. More gender disaggregated data collection and evidence is needed to enhance
 our understanding of effective approaches to address gender issues in transportation.



c. Community Approaches in Rural Livelihoods Programs
Community-Driven Development (CDD) approaches, that make finance more readily
accessible to women can promote their economic and social empowerment. For example,
CDD interventions launched as part of a rural livelihoods project in Andhra Pradesh, India
involved the creation of new self help groups (SHGs) and building the capacity of those already
in existence. SHGs typically consisted of 10-15 members and would meet regularly to discuss
social issues, contribute to group savings, and draw loans from internal and external sources of
finance. The intervention also included public awareness campaigns to expand SHG participation
among marginalized women from tribal areas and those belonging to lower castes. Although the
program evaluation does not show significant impacts on income or asset accumulation, it does
note improvements in women’s social capital and economic empowerment. Specifically, findings
show that a higher proportion of women save money for their own use, attend village meetings
more frequently, and have greater agency in other social and economic activities. These findings
apply to both participants and non-participants, suggesting positive social externalities even for
women who do not directly receive program benefits (Deininger and Liu 2009).

Similarly, the Jeevika Rural Livelihoods Program in Bihar, India mobilized women from
impoverished households into SHGs. These groups engaged in microfinance activities, received
technical assistance for agricultural livelihoods, and information on the availability of various


                                                                                                     100
public services. IE results note positive changes in empowerment measures pertaining to
women’s mobility to health centers, Panchayat meetings as well as visits to neighbors and
relatives outside the village. Results also suggest increases in women’s household decision-
making and a higher inclination among treated women to take collective action on issues of
domestic violence and other village level problems (Datta 2015).
In post-conflict contexts, women’s economic and social welfare may be measurably
enhanced via CDD interventions that promote female engagement in local institution
building and governance. The National Solidarity Programme (NSP) implemented in
Afghanistan exhibits such impacts. The NSP was responsible for the formation locally elected
and gender-balanced Community Development Councils (CDCs) at the village-level. Once
elected, CDCs receive block grants to undertake village level infrastructure development projects.
An evaluation of the initiative notes that the program results in women being more positive and
optimistic about the current and future state of the economy. Results also show a positive shift in
community perceptions regarding women’s role in public affairs owing to their greater
participation and decision-making in local governance. More substantively, the program increases
female mobility, improves access to healthcare and counseling services for women, and raises
school enrollments for girls (Beath et al. 2012).
d. The Empowering Effects of Land Ownership
Measures that secure women’s right to and ownership of land not only have important
economic benefits; they also shape the gender dynamics that influence human capital and
empowerment outcomes. One such example in the region relates to amendments in the Hindu
Succession Act that granted daughters the same rights to family property as sons across several
Indian states. An evaluation of this reform in Maharashtra and Karnataka finds that eliminating
gender discrimination in inheritance rights substantially increases likelihood of women’s
ownership of family property and as a result the total value of asset transfers to women. Further,
as a result of the legal amendment girls—but not boys—possess significantly higher levels of
primary education (Deininger et al. 2012).
Additionally, a large body of evidence outside South Asia attests to the gender benefits of land
titling programs. For example, in 1996, the Peruvian government began a national registry to
formalize property ownership. Project teams worked from neighborhood to neighborhood within
cities in order to allocate land titles swifts and at considerably reduced cost. Findings from an IE
show a significant increase in property titles given to women alone or jointly with their spouses.
In addition living in a treated neighborhood is associated with a 21 percent lower probability of
giving birth. This change is closely linked to households that obtain property titles under female
names. Survey results suggest that this impact is driven by increased equality in decision-making
within the household (Field 2003).
Another evaluated example is the National Land Tenure Regularization Program in Rwanda.
Under the program local surveyors coordinated the delineation of land and produced a public
record of ownership to pave the way for formalization of land holdings. Evidence from a pilot of
the program implies productivity benefits through increased investments in soil conversation and
maintenance. These impacts are significant for female-headed households. Results show a
particularly large increase in the documentation of married women’s land ownership.
Additionally, female children are less likely to be discriminated against in matters of land
succession as a result of the program (Ali et al. 2011).




                                                                                                 101
e. When Economic Empowerment of Women is Not Enough

Interventions that provide training and financial support to female entrepreneurs show
limited success, due in large part to the interference of intransigent gender norms. Evidence
from South Asia suggests that improvements in the economic outcomes of female entrepreneurs
are linked to number of other determinants, especially those related to voice and agency. For
example, a field experiment in rural Pakistan provided an eight-day business training course, in
combination with and access to a microfinance loan lottery. The study finds that the impact of the
intervention among female clients is limited to improvements in business knowledge. In contrast,
the benefits of the intervention to male clients are wide-ranging, including increased business
knowledge, better business practices, higher household spending, improved group unity and a
more positive outlook on life. Authors attribute women entrepreneurs’ poorer outcomes to
restrictive social norms and their burden of household responsibilities. These additional time
constraints and women’s relatively lower decision-making power or control over their own
businesses affect the productivity of female-owned enterprises (Mansuri and Gine 2014). Another
study in Sri Lanka finds that provision of cash grants to female-owned microenterprises results in
virtually no increase in profits. Despite economic empowerment, women are unable to generate
further profits due to various social constraints, including restricted mobility, limited access to
professional networks and a lack of intra-household bargaining capacity (de Mel et al. 2009).

Similarly, social and cultural factors also appear to influence the impact of such
interventions. An IE in Ahmedabad, India assessed the ways that traditional religious and caste
institutions impose restrictions on women’s behavior and influence their business activity. A
randomly selected sample of poor self-employed women from key social groups (Scheduled
Caste, Upper Caste, and Muslim) were trained in basic financial literacy and business skills.
Subsequently, they were encouraged to identify concrete financial aspirations. After receiving
training on business income, there is a 25 percent increase in odds that Upper Caste women will
engage in labor market activity. No significant results are shown for Scheduled Caste and Muslim
women. The training helps Upper Caste women, whose businesses are often held back by social
restrictions, but Muslim women—who faced more stringent restrictions in this study—appear to
have too little agency to easily change their goals and activities. This IE reinforces the idea that
economic empowerment is not always enough to challenge gender and other norms that restrict
women from effectively participating in market-based activities (Field et al. 2010).
Inversely, when certain gender norms—which often limit voice and agency—are addressed,
gains in economic empowerment occur. Results from the aforementioned and various other
studies suggest that other outcome measures—such as women’s political participation, mobility,
and intra-household bargaining among others—are strongly correlated with FLFP and women’s
business ownership and play a role in facilitating increased economic empowerment. This points
to the critical imperative of addressing norms that keep women from more fully realizing their
voice and agency, in spite of achieving economic empowerment.


4. Voice & Agency: Communication, Political Presence are Key

a. Women’s Leadership, Messaging Challenge Norms Underlying GBV




                                                                                                102
Box 3.8 Enhancing voice and agency in fragile and conflict-affected states
 Socio-political transitions in societies emerging from conflict offer opportunities to change the
 status quo on women’s otherwise limited voice and agency. Peacebuilding and reconstruction
 processes are effective entry points to advance gender-sensitive actions, and provide a space
 for women’s greater participation, leadership, and voice in dialogue and decision-making
 around recovery efforts (Anderlini 2010). However, progress on this front has been limited: a
 review of 24 peace processes conducted between 1992 and 2010 finds that women’s
 engagement in these processes was substantially low (World Bank 2011a). In some post-
 conflict countries, including Uganda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal,
 women’s representation in national and local governance has been supported through legal
 reform and affirmative action. Such systemic reforms can be enhanced through supplementary
 measures that also improve the quality of female participation in politics and governance.
 Similarly, post-conflict demographic changes and shifts in household dynamics can bring
 about positive changes, with women often assuming greater roles in decision-making at home
 and in the public sphere; sustaining these positive shifts after conflict has ended is key to
 reducing gender inequalities in the long-term. Experience from the Bank’s work shows that
 community development approaches present important opportunities towards this goal by
 creating formal and informal spaces for women’s equal participation in local administration.
 Examples from the National Solidarity Programme in Afghanistan and the Inclusive
 Development Program in Papua New Guinea are provided in Chapter 4.

Interventions that increase women’s political leadership have demonstrated a wide range of
positive outcomes for both women and girls. Increasing women’s presence in the political
domain is an important goal in itself to ensure that, as equal citizens, women have voice in
influencing public policy and programs. As seen from the impact of mandatory quotas that
reserve seats for women in India’s panchayats (village councils), women’s political participation
can have a particularly transformational influence in reducing gender disparities. For example,
female led panchayats in West Bengal and Rajasthan make greater investments in infrastructure
that directly serve women’s needs (Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004). Having women leaders in
panchayats also has a positive influence on the aspirations of parents for their daughters and
among girls themselves (Beaman et al. 2012). Furthermore, female political participation
improves women’s labor market outcomes; in India, regular exposure to female politicians
increases the likelihood of other women participating in the labor force (Ghani et al. 2013c). In
post-conflict and fragile contexts, leadership opportunities not only help change the status quo on
women’s limited voice and agency but are also critical to the advancement of peace building and
reconstruction efforts (see Box 3.8).

Positive messaging through mass media, information campaigns, and/or training on issues
related to women’s rights or autonomy can improve women’s independent decision-making.
Positive messaging on women’s rights or status in society can improve the conditions under
which women exercise agency and enhance their ability to make decisions that are empowering.
Increased access to mass media, such as television, has been particularly influential in changing
gender norms and attitudes. Evidence from Brazil documenting the impact of ‘telenovelas’ notes
a decline in fertility and an increase in divorce rates as a result of exposure to TV shows that
feature female characters with greater decision-making power (Chong and La Ferrara 2009; La
Ferrara et al. 2008). Another study finds that increased cable television penetration in rural India
has led to changes in deep-seated gender attitudes. Results from the study reveal that, among
women, there was a reduction in the acceptability of wife-beating, reduced son-preference, and
increased autonomy in household decision-making and mobility (Jensen and Oster 2009).


                                                                                                103
Messaging has also proven an effective tool in expanding women’s political participation.
During the 2008 national elections in Pakistan, a field experiment used visual aids with messages
on the importance of voting and on the significance of anonymous ballots. A study found that
voter turnout among women in treated households increased by 12 percent, with larger effects for
women exposed to both messages, while male voter turn-out remained unchanged (Mansuri and
Gine 2011). The evaluation also confirmed substantial spillover effects among close friends and
neighbors who did not receive the treatment.

Another intervention in Pakistan shows the positive impact of providing direct training on
women’s rights. The Gender Justice Program in Pakistan reached out to adolescents, community
organizers and religious leaders with training and sensitization activities to promote women’s
right to inheritance and agency in marital decisions. Findings indicate a 10 percent increase in the
number of women who received their share of inheritance, and a reduction in the incidence of
nonconsensual marriages (Norwegian Church Aid 2013 cited in Solotaroff and Pande 2014).

b. Engage Men and Boys in GBV Interventions

Engaging men and boys is a promising way to address the attitudes that underlie gender-
based violence. There is increasing evidence on the promising results of interventions that
specifically engage men and boys; the premise of such programs is that they instill a stronger
awareness about harmful gender norms, thus diminishing the high tolerance for and practice of
GBV. Some of these interventions focus directly and exclusively on addressing gender norms that
give rise to violence against women and girls, while others strategically integrate issues of
violence in the design of sector-specific interventions. Although there is some evidence from
South Asia, more rigorous IEs are needed to better understand the impact of these programs in
different contexts, and their efficacy in transforming gender norms in the long term.

In a prominent example, Instituto Promundo engaged panchayat leaders in India to generate
awareness on the consequences of gender-based violence among men and boys. Under this
program, educational workshops and community wide campaigns were held on themes related to
gender norms, violence against women, and sexuality. An IE of the program finds a decline in
spousal violence and greater awareness about laws pertaining to violence against women,
abortion laws, and women’s property rights, as well as changes in attitudes and behaviors—
inclining toward more gender equitable practices in the household (Instituto Promundo 2012).

Similarly, the Action for Equality program in Pune, India finds that involving men in group
trainings on preventing violence against women is associated with positive changes in attitudes
and behavior towards violence, as well as increased support from men who participate in
domestic work (Equal Community Foundation 2011 cited in Solotaroff and Pande 2014). A
reduction in self-reported violence against partners and greater support for gender equitable
norms is also noted in the evaluation of the Yaari-Dosti intervention in India. In addition to
encouraging men to rethink gender norms, this intervention promoted gender-equitable attitudes
by encouraging better communication between spouses.

Engaging men in sexual and reproductive health, as well as in family welfare programs, also
shows positive outcomes. In Sri Lanka, World Vision and Instituto Promodo engaged fathers in
group education sessions to improve children’s education and family well-being. Discussions
were held on violence in the household and on nonviolent approaches to parenting. In addition,
the program covered a number of other topics, ranging from gender equality to sexuality, couples’
communication and family planning, corporal punishment and children’s rights, and alcohol and
drug abuse. Interviews with stakeholders and participants in Sri Lanka show a decrease in alcohol

                                                                                                104
and drug use—both key risk factors for violence against women in the country. The review
underscores the critical need to work with fathers on addressing violence in the home.

Through a multipronged intervention in India, Program H addressed sexual and reproductive
health, violence against women and men, and substance abuse. Activities included interactive
group education, videos, social marketing campaigns, focus groups with youth and a community-
level mass-media campaign. The corresponding end line study indicates that a significantly
smaller proportion of respondents support inequitable gender norms. A year later, these changes
were found to have remained consistent in both intervention sites (Pulerwitz et al. 2006).

Engaging girls and boys at an early age increases success in challenging trenchant gender
norms. Evidence from India suggests that reaching girls and boys during adolescence is an
effective way to challenge gender-biased norms. Early childhood interventions can potentially
help break the intergenerational transmission of negative gender norms, although better evidence
is needed to substantiate these links. The Gender Equality Movement in Schools (GEMS)
program engaged young school-going girls and boys (between the ages of 12-14) in discussions
on gender norms, as a means to encourage critical reflection on inequitable gender practices. An
evaluation of the program finds a positive shift in students’ attitudes toward gender equality. For
example, exposure to the intervention shows an increase in the number of students willing to take
action against sexual harassment, and greater support among students for delaying girls’ marriage
until the legal age of 18 years (Solotaroff and Pande 2014).

Chapter IV. Strategic Attention to Gender: Where Do We Stand and
How Can We Do Better?

A. Where Do We Stand? Meeting Corporate Requirements on Gender

Overall, the region is performing well in terms of considering gender in country strategy
documents, and relatively well in meeting corporate requirements for gender-informed
operations.
Box 4.1 Gender Rating Criteria for Country Strategies and Operations

World Bank corporate commitments, as outlined in the Corporate Scorecard (CSC) and IDA16,
require tracking the integration of gender issues in country strategy documents and operations along
three dimensions: analysis, actions and monitoring and evaluation (see Annex B for details on the
Gender Tag, including revisions prompted by the WBG Gender Strategy to create a “new” Gender Tag
in the Operations Portal in FY16). The CSC calls for 100 percent of country strategy documents and
66 percent of operations to be gender-informed by FY17. Additionally, the CSC sets a target of 75
percent of operations reporting on gender results during implementation by FY17. The IDA16
framework required that all country strategy documents and 60 percent of operations in IDA countries
be gender-informed.
Prior to FY15, operations were deemed gender-informed if at least one of the aforementioned
dimensions systematically considered gender. From FY15 onwards, operations need to address gender
issues in all three dimensions in order to be considered gender-informed. For consistency, this
document utilizes the rating methodology used prior to FY15.




                                                                                                105
1. Country Strategy Documents

Attention to gender in SAR country strategy documents remains high. The region has
consistently met the corporate and IDA17 commitments for gender-informed CASs since FY11
(see Box 4.1).13 Attention to gender in SAR country strategy documents was primarily focused in
the areas of education, health and women’s economic empowerment. The FY13 Country Strategy
(CS) for India, for example, prioritizes reducing gender disparities in labor force outcomes
through skills development and promoting higher education, while the FY15 CPS for Pakistan
aims to increase women’s access to finance, decrease their vulnerability to income shocks, and
increase girls’ gross primary enrollment. Other examples of good practices in country strategy
documents are included in Table 4.1.


2. Gender-Informed Operations in SAR, by Country and Global Practice

SAR has surpassed the Corporate Scorecard and IDA16 commitments for mainstreaming
gender in operations with 92, 89, and 98 percent of lending operations in FY13-FY15 rated
as gender-informed (incorporating at least one gender dimension). Attention to gender in the
region’s operations was also high before the adoption of the CSC and IDA requirements and
targets. Progress in country lending portfolios is greatest in India, where all but two projects (one
in FY12, another in FY14) were gender-informed. This is impressive, especially when
considering the large number of operations that are approved each fiscal year. Bangladesh, which
has expanded its lending portfolio over recent years, also has consistently performed well (see
Figure 4.1).

3. Gender Informed Operations by Region: How Does SAR Compare?

SAR has consistently had a majority of its operations classified as gender-informed in at least one
of the three dimensions, as shown in Figure 4.4. However, under the FY15 rating methodology—
which defines a gender-informed operation as one where gender is integrated in all three
dimensions—the region comes in third behind EAP and MNA. Though SAR still meets the IDA
requirements, it falls below the CSC target for operations (Table 4.2).

                                                                                                      108

B. How Can We Do Better? Deepening the GPs’ Work on Gender to Improve
Outcomes

Despite the region’s progress in integrating gender in operations at the design stage, it is unclear
how effective these operations are in narrowing persistent gender gaps in the critical areas of
human capital, economic empowerment, and voice and agency.



                                                                                                                                                         109
This section provides guidance to the GPs on how to better contribute to the region’s
priority gender outcomes using sector-relevant approaches. This section draws from the
discussion in Chapter 3 (What do We Know About What Works?) to describe specific areas of
focus for each GP, with an aim to address gender disparities, promote equal opportunities for the
socio-economic growth of women and men, improve voice and agency and change gender norms.
We highlight good practice examples that are part of each GPs ongoing portfolios and, whenever
possible, present innovative programs that can be adapted by the GPs. Additionally, in an effort to
further allow for this section to be used by the GPs to plan their gender programs, this section
introduces relevant indicators that are aligned with the respective GP’s development objectives as
well as with the Corporate Scorecard Tier 2 indicators (World Bank 2015f).15 Suggested
indicators are intended to:
     (a) inform design and be incorporated into Results Frameworks (RF) of relevant GP
         operations;
     (b) inform the design of ASA, especially TA interventions and ESW; and/or
     (c) serve as the basis of hypotheses that are tested in impact evaluations or other rigorous
         analysis of interventions in operations or TA.
This section begins with the Human Development GPs (Education; Health/Nutrition; and Social
Protection) and follows with guidance for the Sustainable Development GPs (Agriculture/Rural
Livelihoods; Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience; Transport and ICT; Water; Energy and
Extractives; and Environment and Natural Resources), Equitable Growth, Finance and
Institutions GPs16 (Governance; Poverty & Equity; Trade & Competitiveness; Finance &
Markets) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC); and concludes with regional initiatives
that involve multiple GPs.
Following this consideration of the various global practices and the IFC, section 4 of this chapter
focuses attention on promising approaches emerging from conflict-affected and fragile contexts
in South Asia and other regions.

collection of gender-disaggregated indicators. This will enable teams to enhance the design of
operations (including targeting of beneficiaries), allow for mid-course corrections, and to gain a
better understanding of program impact.
Project teams are encouraged to use gender/social assessments and consultations to identify
constraints to school enrollment and completion. This would include gathering information on:


15 World Bank Corporate Scorecards, including the most recent (World Bank Group 2015), can be found at
http://corporatescorecard.worldbank.org.
16 The Macroeconomic & Fiscal Management GP is not included, as its operations tend not to directly

involve beneficiaries (i.e., men, women, boys or girls) and thus do not provide logical entry points for
gender-focused interventions.

                                                                                                    110
mobility and other safety-related constraints on travel to and from school for girls and boys; and,
gender-based constraints related to the safety and social acceptability of school environments (for
example, a lack of lavatories for girls; a lack of boundary walls around girls’ schools in fragile or
otherwise insecure community environments; and the threat of sexual harassment or violence in
schools or on the way to school).

                                    What’s Working in the GP
Since 2001, Bank-supported education programs in Afghanistan—particularly the series of
Education Quality Improvement Projects (EQUIP)—have helped girls’ enrollment rates soar at
the primary and secondary levels. The ratio of female-to-male primary enrollment has increased
from 0 percent in 2001 (at the end of Taliban rule, when girls were officially excluded from the
country’s education system) to more than 72 percent in 2012. The ratio of secondary enrollment
has increased to over 55 percent. In spite of girls being allowed to reenter the education system
following the fall of the Taliban, enrollments remained low for several years due to inappropriate
environments for girls’ education (e.g., a lack of gender-segregated schools or classrooms; a lack
of female teachers; the absence of girls’ separate washroom facilities in schools) and security
concerns (violent attacks on girls’ schools and female teachers). EQUIP has helped address these
constraints through ensuring greater attention to appropriate facilities for girls in schools,
constructing boundary walls around girls’ schools, and establishing community-based School
Management Committees that ensure security in schools.


b. Help girls make the transition from school to work:
Increasing women’s labor force participation in the region will require greater support for
women’s entry into tertiary education and skills development programs. On one hand, tertiary
education programs should include activities that focus on facilitating the increased entry of girls
and women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers, in addition to
supporting the development of women’s networks—an important factor in finding suitable
employment. On the other hand, skills development programs should combat occupational
segregation by implementing training programs for women that have a stronger link to the types
of skills and knowledge that are rewarded in labor markets. All programs working in this area
should also place a particular emphasis on addressing gender norms that may restrict women’s
access to such programs. Programs should work with parents and communities, as well as with
students, to challenge traditional norms regarding the value of educating girls and perceptions of
what girls and boys should learn in school. Evaluations of programs in South Asia suggest that
involving community leadership (such as religious leaders or local councils) to challenge gender
norms can bring about significant changes in attitudes and behaviors, leading to more gender-
equitable outcomes in communities (see Chapter 3).

                                    What’s Working in the GP
The Second Technical Engineering Educational Quality Improvement Project in India has
undertaken a gender analysis to inform project design, monitoring and evaluation. The main
development objective is to strengthen selected institutions so that they can increasingly produce
employable and high-quality engineers. Further, the project seeks to address the shortage of
faculty in these types of institutions by cultivating post-graduate students as future instructors.


                                                                                                 111
c. Improve gender-disaggregated data collection:
Relevant indicators in education projects include the following:17

        Rate of girls’ and boys’ completion of primary and secondary education
        Dropout rates of boys and girls from all levels of education
        Rate of girls’ and boys’ successful transition to secondary school (from Grade 5 to 6)
        Gender differences in attendance and completion of STEM courses
        Gender differences in attendance and completion of TVET programs
        Gender-disaggregated data on students attending business training courses
        Gender-disaggregated data on post-graduation outcomes for secondary school graduates
        Distribution of male and female tertiary graduates by field of study

                           Innovation – Facilitating Careers in STEM
Programs that support the development of networks and links with mentors or role models are
facilitating the entry of women and girls into STEM studies and careers. The Girls Advancing in
STEM (GAINS) Scholar Network, for example, connects young women in secondary schools
across the US with women leaders in STEM careers around the world. In doing so, the program
allows young women to maintain their interest in STEM careers.



1.2. Social Protection and Labor
a. Help the poorest girls stay in school and acquire skills for employability:
Like Education, the Social Protection sector in SAR has considerable experience and success in
improving girls’ school attendance and completion rates. Social Protection could scale up
conditional cash transfer programs across the region, especially in countries where girls still lag
significantly behind boys in attendance and completion of primary (Afghanistan, Pakistan) and
secondary school (all countries except Maldives and Sri Lanka). Conditional cash transfer
programs can also present unique opportunities to pilot a number of innovations, such as
educational entertainment or behavioral change interventions. Such interventions can serve to
reduce the prevalence of child marriage or to change the norms and beliefs that favor educating
boys over girls.
Stand-alone ASA or operations that help the poorest girls acquire employment skills can also be
an area of focus in the region. Social Protection has already demonstrated its success with the
well-evaluated, small-scale Adolescent Girls Employment Initiative (AGEI) in Nepal—one of 8
Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI) projects implemented across World Bank regions to help
adolescent girls and young women successfully navigate the transition from school to work (see
below). Given the success of these interventions, there is considerable scope for scale-up in
countries where they have been implemented (Afghanistan and Nepal), as well as to replicate
them in new countries where there is considerable interest by governments for support to improve
women’s economic empowerment or labor force participation.


17
  Examples of these and related indicators can be found on the UNESCO data website:
http://data.uis.unesco.org/

                                                                                                 112
                                    What’s Working in the GP
The Adolescent Girls Employment Initiative (AGEI) in Nepal targets adolescent girls with
livelihood trainings, including technical life-skills training and assistance with job placement
across 39 different occupations—such as carpentry, tailoring, welding and masonry. The design
of the program is adapted to local socio-cultural conditions, in order to ensure the effective
recruitment and successful participation of girls. An impact evaluation confirms considerable
gains on the labor market outcomes of program beneficiaries. Girls who participated in the
program experienced an overall 47 percent increase in non-farm employment and a 45 percent
increase in their monthly-income.
With a view to replicate the initiative in India, the Jharkhand Capacity Building Program is
conducting a survey of 4000 adolescent girls and young women to explore the role of young
people’s socio-emotional resources on their educational and employment aspirations. Preliminary
analysis suggests that these “hidden forms of human capital” could be crucial points of
intervention in efforts to alter the educational and economic attainments of girls and young
women. In conjunction with lessons emerging from other AGI pilots, the findings of the survey
are helping guide the overall design of the program.


b. Help reduce excess female child mortality and child malnutrition:
Conditional cash transfer programs can also create positive impacts that extend well beyond
improving girls’ schooling. For example, conditional cash transfers that target families with
daughters have the power to change family attitudes about girls’ value and status in the household
(see Chapter 3). Such approaches can provide mothers and other family members with the
information and encouragement necessary to improve attention to the health needs of girls as well
as boys.



                                    What’s Working in the GP
The Income Support Program for the Poorest project in Bangladesh provides incentives to
pregnant women and mothers in the poorest households to use services that support child
nutrition and cognitive development. Drawing on lessons learned from the literature and
operational know-how of conditional cash transfer (CCT) initiatives, the program integrates a
number of suggested good practices in its design. These include: addressing supply side
constraints in conjunction with the CCT to enhance the effectiveness of the program; targeting
transfers to women as it increases the likelihood of benefits reaching children and shows positive
outcomes for women on empowerment measures; implementing clear and transparent rules and
ensuring that beneficiaries are aware of these rules to build the program’s credibility; and
instituting a strong accountability mechanism that facilitates the timely flow of information to the
operational and management teams.



1.3. Health and Nutrition
a. Improve health outcomes for girls through birth registration:

                                                                                                113
Birth registration is a promising approach for encouraging parents to provide greater attention to
the health of daughters. As discussed in earlier chapters, although South Asia’s poor child
nutrition outcomes tend not to vary greatly by sex, research suggests that in households with
multiple children, parents prioritize the health outcomes of sons over daughters. In addition to
supporting better health outcomes for girls, birth registration also helps prevent child labor and
GBV—particularly child marriage.
Between 2006 and 2009, Bangladesh achieved rapid progress in increasing registration rates by
tying birth registration to immunization programs—rather than to births—since access to pre-
natal and ante-natal care is still low in the country and women tend not to give birth in health
centers.18 Evaluations conducted by UNICEF, Plan International and the Government of
Bangladesh indicate that universal birth registration can be achieved when birth registration
systems are decentralized, national and local officials are trained to provide birth registration,
essential services are tied to birth registration and cannot be accessed without registration, and
deterrents are in place for families who neglect to register (Muzzi 2010). Making birth
registration a requirement for beneficiaries to access health care services could bring great returns
to scale in Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan, for example, where less than 30 percent of all births
are registered.
Behavioral change interventions, such as educational entertainment or mass media campaigns,
can also complement birth registration efforts. Such interventions can be used to encourage
families to register births and raise awareness about the benefits of registering children, so as to
make birth registration a routine part of accessing government or health services.



                                Innovation–Global Birth Registration
In May 2014, the World Bank and the World Health Organization launched the Global Civil
Registration and Vital Statistics Plan, which aims to achieve the universal civil registration of
births, deaths, marriages and other vital events by 2030.



b. Improve sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes by targeting adolescents:
Adolescents are a critical, though often overlooked, target group. Deferring childbearing and
precluding unintended pregnancies promotes better health outcomes and enhanced opportunities
for education and income generation for young women, as well as for young men (Yarger et al.
2015). It is imperative to target this age group, especially given the high prevalence of early
marriage in the region and its links to a range of poor SRH outcomes, including high adolescent
fertility rates, high maternal mortality ratios, low access to SRH services, and a higher risk of
intimate partner violence (Cortez et al. 2015; Solotaroff and Pande 2014).


18
  As detailed in Chapter 3, a health program in Tamil Nadu included birth registration among several
interventions, ultimately influencing a 46 percent drop in female-to-male infant mortality within 5-7 years.
In Hyderabad, India, conscientious tracking of all births as part of implementing the 1994 Pre-Conception
and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act helped improve its
abysmally high sex ratio of 943 girls to 1,000 boys (age 0-6 years) by 21 percentage points in just four
years (Hindustan Times 2007).

                                                                                                         114
Improvements in health outcomes—such as lower total fertility rates in Bangladesh and increased
uptake of family planning methods and immunization services in Pakistan—have been attributed,
in large part, to the direct delivery of health services to households by female health workers, thus
circumventing constraints on women’s travel outside the household (Amin and Lloyd 2002;
World Bank 2005). Delivery of services at the local level would be particularly useful for projects
that are implemented in conservative communities, where there are challenges to reaching
adolescent girls. In such communities, these girls’ mobility tends to be highly restricted, as they
have reached puberty but must retain their sexual innocence until marriage, in order to protect
their own honor, as well as that of their family (Kapur 2014).
Improving attention to adolescents in SRH programs will require more research to better
understand patterns in adolescent SRH behavior and attitudes, as well as ensuring the collection
of gender-disaggregated data on:

       Percent of total female/male beneficiaries who are female/male adolescents;
       Percent of female/male adolescent beneficiaries who are married; and,
       Percent of female/male adolescents who are receiving any of the following education,
        awareness-raising, or other SRH services:
                o Basic fertility awareness education
                o SRH information only
                o SRH information and services, particularly receipt of modern family
                     planning methods
                o Awareness-raising about child marriage
                o Awareness-raising about son preference and other male-biased gender norms
SRH programs also present an opportunity to address male gender issues. Targeting young men
and boys in SRH programs can, for example, improve the impact of HIV or STD prevention
programs, reduce GBV, and most importantly, do away with the notion that SRH is only a
women’s health issue.


                                    What’s Working in the GP
Adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) is one of five focus areas in the Bank’s
Reproductive Health Action Plan 2010-2015, which emphasizes the important role of ASRH in
reducing poverty. The GHNDR team in SAR is part of the team leading the global analytical
program, Paving the Path to Improved Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health, which has
already produced a series of briefs intended to inform operations in the sector. These include
briefs on “Family Planning: The Hidden Need of Married Adolescents in Nepal” (Aguilar and
Cortez 2015) and “Socioeconomic Differences in Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health:
Marriage” (Cortez et al. 2015).



c. Improve nutrition outcomes for adolescents and young children: The evidence base for what
is effective in nutrition interventions remains small, especially when considering evidence on
interventions that address household gender dynamics around feeding and other child care
behaviors, as this is a relatively new field of study in health research (Sen and Hook 2012).
Adolescence is one of the most critical windows for nutrition interventions—second only to


                                                                                                 115
infancy and early childhood. Nutrition interventions during adolescence not only help
undernourished children “catch up” on nutrition outcomes, but they also protect against poor
outcomes for young mothers and their infants—another problem in the region, especially given
the high prevalence of early marriage (Blumberg et al. 2013). In order to improve nutritional
outcomes for adolescents, nutrition interventions will need to target fathers and other household
members, not just mothers; they will need to undertake consultations with both adolescent girls
and boys in order to better target programs for this population; and they will need to ensure a
higher frequency of contact with this target group.



                                   What’s Working in the GP
The SPRING (Sustainable Program Incorporating Nutrition and Games) program in India and
Pakistan supports the implementation of an affordable and innovative home visit program
delivered by community-based agents. The intervention follows women and their children from
pregnancy through the first two years of life (the first 1,000 days), with the aim of promoting
optimal practices, including the feeding of infants and young children, encouraging interaction
and play between mothers and their young children, and promoting the support and involvement
of other family members in childcare practices. The program’s impact evaluation will measure
outcomes in the areas of child-parent play and interaction, breastfeeding and complementary
feeding behaviors; identify the mechanisms that drive behavioral change; estimate the cost
effectiveness of the intervention and project costs for upscaling delivery; and determine the
coverage, quality and acceptability of home visits that the community-based agents achieved.


2. Global Practices in Sustainable Development

2.1. Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods
a. Increase asset ownership, productive capacity and the value of goods produced by women
farmers and rural (non-farm) entrepreneurs, and expand the evidence base on women’s
contributions to agricultural labor:
The Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods GP covers a broad range of areas in which attention to
sector-relevant gender issues could not only improve women’s empowerment (especially
economic empowerment), but also help operations more efficiently and sustainably achieve their
development objectives. The potential points of engagement and tailored interventions—in crop
production, livestock production, aquaculture and fisheries, non-agricultural rural livelihoods,
rural finance and enterprise creation, etc.—are so numerous that it falls beyond the scope of this
document to enumerate them. The excellent Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook (World Bank et
al. 2009) and its latest module, Gender in Climate-Smart Agriculture (World Bank et al.
2015), contain specific guidance and good practice examples for each of these sub-sectors of
agriculture and rural livelihoods.
In more general terms, Bank-led operations and ASA across sub-sectors can help improve key
gender outcomes (in bold below) that are relevant to this GP, through specific measures, where
relevant. These outcomes primarily fall under the umbrellas of labor force participation and
employment (more and better jobs) and asset ownership. Overall, key guidelines suggested for


                                                                                               116
this GP are to: (a) be cognizant of women’s vast presence in agricultural value chains, especially
the initial steps; (b) help rural women aspire to be not only income generators, but also business
owners and employers; and, (c) use culturally appropriate means of connecting rural women with
economic opportunities, especially in very conservative areas where women’s mobility is highly
limited.
Increasing asset ownership among women farmers and rural (non-farm) entrepreneurs can
be achieved by:

       Facilitating women’s access to credit, using group savings approaches in areas where
        constraints on women as individual clients are prohibitively high (e.g., requiring
        collateral);
       Facilitating rural women’s access to product and land markets (with an emphasis on
        productive land and land ownership or long-term user rights); and,
       Providing women credit-holders access to financial and business training to help them
        generate income and even create sustainable enterprises that can employ other women
        (and men).
Increasing women farmers’ productive capacity and the value of products they sell or trade
can be achieved by:

       Expanding women farmers’ access to more productive inputs (i.e., farming tools,
        fertilizers and pesticides);
       Providing extension training and other rural advisory services that can actually reach
        women farmers (e.g., access to information through mobile phones or, in areas with poor
        cellular coverage, using female extension trainers); and,
       Increasing women farmers’ access to information on markets, weather and climate using
        ICT approaches where possible.
Expanding the evidence base on women’s contributions to agricultural labor can be
achieved by:

       Increasing the recognition of women’s roles in agricultural labor and other rural
        livelihoods, through standalone ASA or gender or social assessments conducted during
        project preparation; and,
       Enhancing the understanding of physical and social limitations on women’s mobility in
        the rural communities being covered (through ASA or preparation phase assessments), as
        well as culturally acceptable short-term and long-term compensation for these limitations.



                                   What’s Working in the GP
In May 2011, the Agriculture and Rural Development team in SAR began facilitating a regional
network of NGOs and World Bank clients. The objective of Business, Enterprise, and
Employment Support for Women in South Asia, or BEES, is to provide a forum for learning,
knowledge-sharing, collective action, and advocacy for women’s economic empowerment. BEES
promotes the sharing of good practices and the scaling up of effective interventions that enable
women to climb out of poverty. BEES collectively reaches more than 100 million women in the
region (World Bank 2015b).

                                                                                                117
2.2. Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience
Urban Development
Rapid urbanization in South Asian countries—especially in India—has led to a vacuum in
available jobs for women. Decreasing employment opportunities in agriculture have not yet been
replaced with expanding opportunities in urban and peri-urban areas, and many growth sectors in
destination sites may still be regarded as inappropriate for women (Chatterjee et al. 2015). Urban
areas also present particular safety risks for women on their way to and from work, markets,
schools and health service centers. Whether through Urban GP-led operations or in
supporting/co-leading operations with other GPs, the Urban Development sector has a powerful
role to play in helping create a broader range of employment opportunities and safer public
facilities and services for women and girls, as well as for men and boys. The Urban Development
sector can improve gender outcomes by:
a. Addressing urban infrastructure constraints on the safety and mobility of women:
Urban development programs can include measures to ensure the safety and security of women in
urban spaces, as well as in transport. Such measures can include utilizing ICT (e.g., call boxes
placed throughout cities, cell phone applications) to allow individuals whose safety is threatened
to quickly contact public security forces, and ensuring that urban spaces are property lit during
nighttime, among others.
b. Reducing constraints to women’s employment:
Urban sector interventions working in slums and other pockets of extreme poverty can support
public-private partnerships to pilot, evaluate and scale-up child care programs, urban transport
initiatives, interventions to mitigate GBV and other programs to address the main constraints to
female labor force participation in the region.
c. Closing gender gaps in voice and agency:
This can be achieved by ensuring that young and adult women make meaningful inputs during
consultations and are more effectively included in feedback processes during program
implementation. Urban sector programs can also include specific measures to prevent GBV or
ensure that support services reach survivors of such violence. Such programs can include
educational entertainment or mass media campaigns, ensuring that urban infrastructure includes
safe spaces for women and girls, and making support services easily accessible (e.g., well-lit
areas, including information on support services in bus stops and other public spaces, or reducing
physical barriers that do not allow survivors of violence to reach support services in a timely
manner).

                                    What’s Working in the GP
The 100 Smart Cities & 500 Cities Program in India provides coordinated, multi-sectoral
technical assistance to India’s Ministry of Urban Development, as well as to states and cities that
express an interest in adopting the program’s agenda. Urban Development coordinates with the
Water, Transport and ICT teams to share international and national expertise on policy
development, programmatic design and program management at the national, state and city
levels; to facilitate and deliver international knowledge exchange; and, to encourage the cross-
fertilization of ideas across states.

                                                                                                118
Resilience/Disaster Risk Management
The instability and insecurity that coincide with conflict-affected, fragile and/or disaster-prone
conditions can exacerbate already tenuous situations. For example, the increased vulnerability
and risk faced by individuals in these situations can make travel more hazardous, thereby
jeopardizing access to essential services, education and employment. Advance preparation of
gender-informed protocols for responding to natural disasters or conflict, for instance, as well as
addressing broader gender-based inequities in society, can help mitigate the disproportionate risks
of destitution and GBV faced by women and girls in such conditions.
Having plans in place that respond to the particular needs of women, men, girls and boys—
should armed conflict or natural disasters occur—ensures that the most vulnerable
members of society are protected from the disproportionate risks associated with these
situations. Such plans should recognize that women and girls, in particular, have unique
capacities to drive the resilience-building of communities, and need to be better engaged in
disaster risk management and response training efforts. Furthermore, such plans should include
protective measures—for example, ensuring that new home purchases or home building finance
are conducted on the condition of joint-spouse ownership or full ownership for female household
heads and single women.



                                   What’s Working in the GP
The Bank-led Post Disaster Needs Assessment, undertaken in the aftermath of the 2015
earthquakes in Nepal, included a detailed gender analysis which found that:

       Women’s lack of house and land ownership, resulting from discriminatory property
        ownership rights, increased the likelihood of their marginalization in post-disaster
        reconstruction programs;
       Female-headed households sustained the greatest losses in damages, estimated at
        approximately NPR 85.28 billion in the 14 most affected districts;
       Time poverty of women and girls was disproportionately affected (up to five hours of
        extra time cost per day), which meant that they bore the greatest responsibility for
        clearing debris, salvaging household items buried under rubble and salvaging home
        construction materials for shelter construction; and,
       Women and girls faced elevated risks—compared to males and compared to pre-
        earthquake settings—of experiencing trafficking and other forms of GBV.




c. Social Development
As a sector that focuses on development issues surrounding gender and social inclusion, the
Social Development team is especially adept at addressing gender issues in operations. This is
evidenced by the team’s expertise in providing social safeguards and analytical support to
operations across GPs, the leadership of stand-alone country and regional operations, analytical
work that addresses constraints on women’s labor and mobility, and improved attention to GBV


                                                                                               119
in regional operations, to name a few. There is scope for the team to replicate and/or scale up the
efforts described in this section.
a. Address multiple drivers of low female labor force participation rates:
The Social Development team has undertaken a number of studies across the region to understand
the particular constraints to women’s labor force participation. The team can address the multiple
drivers of low female labor force participation by piloting projects that address such constraints,
including those that focus on the care economy, migration or promoting women’s employment in
urban areas or specific sectors.

                                    What’s Working in the GP
In Bangladesh, the Social Development sector is implementing the Northern Areas Reduction-of-
Poverty Initiative (NARI), a standalone operation that provides recruitment, housing and job
placement services, in addition to training young women who wish to enter the garment sector.
The program is unique, as it includes training in both soft and technical skills, and it focuses on a
high growth sector in Bangladesh’s economy.



b. Support other GPs through the implementation of regional gender programs:
The Social Development team is uniquely placed to continue to implement regional initiatives
that improve gender outcomes across GPs. Such programs include the South Asia Gender
(SAGE) Initiative (see Annex A), the regional program on GBV (see Box 4.2 and Annex E) and
the South Asia Gender Innovation Lab (see section D, below).
c. Change attitudes toward and lower the prevalence of gender-based violence:
In January 2013, the World Bank’s South Asia Region made gender-based violence a new area of
strategic focus by launching a multi-pronged regional program on GBV as part of its broader
efforts toward achieving gender equality (Box 4.2). Potential entry points for work on GBV exist
in most GPs. Given the regional program, which includes analytical work that identifies entry
points for interventions in various development sectors, SAR is well prepared to begin
strategically incorporating GBV interventions into those operations where the impact will be
greatest. In terms of longer-term solutions, standalone programs that address gender norms also
are necessary. In order to better understand the impact of GBV on development—and on
interventions in target populations—the region will need to undertake further data collection and
program evaluations.

Box 4.2 Addressing Gender-Based Violence in South Asia

 Led by the Social Development unit, South Asia’s Regional Program on Gender-Based
 Violence aims to identify and test effective practices for preventing and responding to GBV
 in the region. Directly informed by the Bank’s regional report, Violence against Women and
 Girls: Lessons from South Asia (Solotaroff and Pande 2014), the program is framed by three
 pillars: (i) integrating GBV interventions into Bank operations and evaluating these
 interventions where possible (see Annex E for details on cross-GP support); (ii) developing
 partnerships, communications and knowledge products; and, (iii) designing and launching
 the ‘WEvolve’ program—a multi-year campaign that targets youth and focuses on raising

                                                                                                 120
 awareness and changing unequal gender norms that lead to GBV. The regional program
 deliberately takes a broad approach—focusing on GBV and not just violence against women
 and girls—as this allows for greater involvement and attention to male gender issues.

 To date, the program is working with operations across three Global Practices—Agriculture,
 GSURR and Health—and is in the process of identifying operations in the Water and Energy
 Global Practices. The program supported a mapping of over 700 organizations in the region
 that are working on violence against women, which served as part of the background work
 for the regional report on violence against women and girls. The program also successfully
 launched the WEvolve program in March 2015, which takes an innovative approach to GBV
 prevention, by partnering with the creative sector and utilizing storytelling to raise awareness
 and change the attitudes and behaviors that underpin GBV. WEvolve was launched in India
 with original videos, blogs and a fashion show, which reached over 3.5 million social media
 users (www.wevolveglobal.org). In the future, the Regional Program will provide support to
 disseminate and operationalize the Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) Resource
 Guide, which was developed by the World Bank Group in partnership with the Global
 Women’s Institute at George Washington University, the Inter-American Development Bank
 (IDB) and the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW). Drawing from global
 evidence and emerging promising practices, this guide provides accessible information and
 resources on how to integrate VAWG prevention and the provision of quality services to
 violence survivors within a range of development projects (see Annex F more details).

 Further, the Social Development Unit is implementing the Integrated Platform for Gender
 Based Violence Prevention and Response Project in Nepal, a stand-alone GBV program that
 seeks to raise awareness and improve the national response to GBV. The project seeks to
 improve the quality and reach of services to survivors through the establishment of a national
 GBV helpline, to support awareness raising activities among key stakeholders and vulnerable
 populations, and to strengthen the capacity of the National Women Commission as the nodal
 agency responsible for responding to GBV in the country.


d. Improve measurement and evidence on what works to address gender gaps:
The South Asia Gender Innovation Lab (henceforth the Lab) aims to empower women and girls
by identifying innovative approaches to measure and address gender gaps across the region,
primarily through the development, testing and use of robust diagnostic tools. The Lab was
launched in FY14, as a collaboration between SAR’s Social Development and Water sectors to
support the South Asia Regional Gender Action Plan’s (RGAP FY13-15) three pillars: i) access
and use of infrastructure services; (ii) gender-based violence; and (iii) labor force participation
and access to economic opportunities. The Lab prioritizes country-based agendas, focusing on
sectors and problems for which current evidence is most lacking, or where there is an opportunity
to build upon existing evidence to test promising interventions. In order to do this, it coordinates
with each CMU in the region to determine which pillar(s) will be of particular focus in each
country. Most activities in the Lab’s portfolio are IEs of large, multi-year operations that either
have not yet, or have only recently begun implementation. Definitive findings from most tasks are
thus forthcoming.19 Annex C lists the Lab’s current activities.

19
  Interim findings from a couple of the “fast -moving” impact evaluated operations are available upon
request. Briefs on the operation’s development objective and actions—together with details on the methods
and sampling used for each evaluation—are being drafted for each activity in the Lab’s portfolio. They will
be disseminated individually or in a series, in FY16 Q3 and Q4.

                                                                                                       121
                                      What’s Working in the GP
In addition to measuring impact, the Gender Innovation Lab aims to test innovative approaches
for data collection. In Kerala, India, for example, a household survey on migration used
randomized listing to measure the prevalence of GBV—specifically, domestic violence and
harassment on public or private transportation—in the state. Because GBV is a highly sensitive
issue in South Asia, it is difficult to estimate its prevalence through traditional survey questions.
As a method for measuring more sensitive information, list randomization attempts to manage
sensitivities and give a more accurate measure of the incidence of GBV. Dividing respondents
into treatment and control groups, the survey asks the control group three questions with binary
(yes/no) responses, but also asks the treatment group four binary questions: the same three
questions as the control group plus a sensitive question regarding GBV.
Analysis of data collected through the list randomization method suggests a much higher
prevalence of violence than that calculated when using the direct question method (the latter of
which is used in the Demographic and Health Surveys’ domestic violence modules). The direct
question method estimates a 5.6 percent rate of domestic violence based on questions regarding
knowledge of physical violence perpetrated by a husband in the household, whereas the list
randomization method estimates a 15 percent rate of domestic violence as assessed by the
response to similar questions. The large, statistically significant difference in domestic violence
rates estimated by these methods is true for both male and female respondents: the direct question
method suggests a domestic violence rate of 5.6 and 5.7 percent among female and male
respondents, respectively, while the list randomization method estimates domestic violence rates
of 17 and 12 percent among female and male respondents. These results suggest that the most
commonly used methods may be underestimating the prevalence of GBV. The randomized listing
method for estimating GBV will be tested again in another survey administered by the Lab in
Tamil Nadu.


2.3. Transport and ICT (GTIDR)
A number of Bank-led studies on gender and transport in urban areas of SAR countries
(Bangladesh, Bhutan India, Nepal) suggest that gender-segregated public transportation is, at
best, a temporary measure for overcoming gender-based mobility constraints and providing
women with safe and convenient access to markets and services. In Lahore, Pakistan, this
measure was not successful—even in the short term—but lessons learned from Pakistan and other
country studies outline the necessary conditions for this short-term solution (see Chapter 3, Box
3.7).
For transport projects to help improve and sustain women’s mobility in the long-term, it is
necessary to develop a better understanding of how transport interventions affect male and
female beneficiaries differently, and of what works to challenge the social norms that inhibit
women’s travel outside of the household. There are a number of good practice operations in the
Transport and ICT sector, both implemented by the Bank in other regions, as well as by external
partners, that can be adapted and replicated in Transport sector operations in SAR. As in other
sectors, data collection will be critical. Collection of data in transport projects could serve as part of

                                                                                                      122
additional studies in transport operations, especially when rigorous impact evaluations are not
possible. Specific gender indicators that can be included in Transport sector operations include:

       Reduction in hours spent by male and female beneficiaries traveling to school, health
        services, work and/or markets; and,
       Increased frequency of women’s and men’s trips to access financial or product markets.


                                       Innovation – SafetiPin
SafetiPin is an ICT-based platform that utilizes technology to promote public safety. The platform
was first launched in India, and allows users to conduct safety audits of public spaces based on a
number of criteria, including the availability of street lighting, pedestrian pathways and public
transport. A user’s feedback is then compiled in order to assign a color coded safety score to the
location where they conducted a safety audit. For instance, a red pin indicates a low aggregate
safety score for a given location. Data from the SafetiPin platform is shared with civil society and
relevant government agencies, and is used to provide recommendations on actions that can be
taken to make public spaces safer and more inclusive.



2.4. Water
There are multiple levels at which Water GP operations and analytical work can improve
attention to gender, as described below. The evidence base on the benefits of integrating gender
issues into water supply and sanitation (WSS) projects is still extremely thin—especially in South
Asia. It is therefore recommended that projects in this sector focus on tracking gender-relevant
indicators, ideally through impact evaluations, or through less rigorous studies if resources do not
allow for IEs. At the highest level, policy makers in government need to better understand the
value of attending to gender issues in water supply and sanitation programming—that such
attention enables more efficient achievement of program goals and brings empowerment benefits
to women.
a. Reduce women’s time poverty:
As with Transport, Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) can significantly lessen women’s time
burden by reducing the time needed to access water for household needs, as well as clean and safe
sanitation facilities. Projects are encouraged to measure the effects of these interventions with the
following outcomes in mind:

       Reduction in female beneficiaries’ hours spent collecting water;
       Reduction in female beneficiaries’ hours spent accessing sanitation facilities;
       Reduction in percentage of beneficiary households with water-borne illness; and,
       Improved efficacy of training and education programs provided by WSS projects.
b. Improve voice and agency:
In addition to reducing time poverty, WSS projects can be critical for improving women’s voice
and agency. Requiring the representation of women in community water committees and using
women trainers to provide training on sanitation and hygiene not only encourages the
participation of women, but most importantly, builds their leadership skills. With regards to

                                                                                                    123
women’s agency, WSS interventions can reduce GBV—in particular harassment and non-
intimate partner violence—through the provision of safe and accessible sanitation services.

                                    What’s Working in the GP
The Second Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project uses a decentralized and demand-
responsive approach for expanding access to improved and sustainable water supply and
sanitation services in Kerala. As part of its objective of strengthening community involvement in
the management of water supply and sanitation services, the project emphasizes collaboration and
networking with existing women’s networks throughout the preparation, implementation and
post-implementation phases of sub-projects.



2.5. Energy and Extractives
Like transport and water operations, energy operations have substantial potential to reduce the
time burden of women, improve their access to basic services such as health and education, and
promote greater voice and agency (see Chapter 3 for more details).
a. Support activities that ensure that women benefit from energy sector interventions:
It is important that energy projects make efforts to reach the poorest families. Female-headed
households, which tend to be over-represented in low-income quintiles, may be deterred from
accessing modern energy services due to the associated up-front costs (Alstone et al. 2011).
Recognizing that women in South Asia often lack access to finance from formal institutions (see
Chapter 2), some energy initiatives in South Asia have begun to introduce various financing
schemes that match women’s capacity to pay these costs. This includes two well-known
programs: Grameen Shakti in Bangladesh, which offers solar home systems, and the Asia/Pacific
Development Centre and UNDP’s ENSIGN project, which collaborates with India’s Self-
Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank to provide process heat technologies (Ramani
2002).
b. Create jobs for women:
Energy initiatives can provide job opportunities for women. Across the globe, an increasing share
of energy enterprises are employing women as sales representatives and producers of energy
efficient cooking and lighting solutions. This is a sound investment for these enterprises—women
help ensure that the priorities and concerns of female users are reflected in energy products,
thereby raising the odds of adoption and use. In Nepal, for example, the Centre for Rural
Technology employs women artisans to disseminate improved cook stoves (CRT/N 2014).
c. Collect gender-disaggregated data:
Energy initiatives that use sex-disaggregated indicators can make invaluable contributions to data
in the gender and energy sector, especially where data is severely limited or non-existent.
Indicators that operations can use to track gender-disaggregated access, time use, mobility and
health/safety include the following (existing sources of national-level data for these indicators are
in parentheses):

       % of households (HH) with access to electricity, by sex of HH head (UN Women)
       Use of electrical appliances available in HH, by sex of HH member

                                                                                                 124
       % of HHs using modern solutions and primary cooking solutions, by sex of HH head
        (UN Women; available data tracks solid vs. non-solid fuels)
       % of micro and small businesses with access to modern cooking/electricity and heating
        solutions, by sex of business owner
       Average time per week spent on fuel collection, by sex and age of HH member (UN
        Women; data limited to specific surveys)
       Average time per week spent on water collection (including time waiting at public supply
        points), by sex and age of HH member (UN women; data limited)
       Average time per week spent on reproductive work, by sex and age of HH member (UN
        Women; data limited)
       Average time per week spent on hand processing of grain/tubers, by sex and age of HH
        member
       % of births supported by electricity
       Rates of mortality and morbidity due to indoor/outdoor air pollution, by sex (WHO)
Indicators to use in tracking the impact of energy initiatives on female employment include:

       % enterprises owned by women (ILO)
       Women’s share of employment in the energy sector (ILO)
       Women’s share of employment in energy enterprises
       Number of energy entrepreneurs, by sex


2.6. Environment and Natural Resources
a. Recognize women’s role in the sector and enable them to generate income from their work:
Patterns in access to natural resources and their utilization for either livelihoods or domestic
purposes have significant implications for gender. Environment operations tend to offer entry
points for gender-aware actions that can improve the economic empowerment—and health and
safety—of women, as well as men. Environmental interventions that clean up hazardous waste
sites, dump sites, or other manifestations of legacy and ongoing water and ground pollution, for
example, present opportunities to safeguard the health of beneficiaries. This has been one of
several gender-responsive benefits provided by the Capacity Building for Industrial Pollution
Management Project (CBIPMP) in India, which provides rag pickers (scavengers) on large
dumpsites—most of whom are women—with alternatives for improved livelihoods, and also
encourages families to keep their children in school, instead of having them work on the toxic
dumpsites. CBIPMP takes advantage of the most common entry point to empower women
through GENDR operations: providing new or improving existing income streams (World Bank
2015c).

                                   What’s Working in the GP
The Integrated Zone Coastal Management (ICZM) Project aims to build the Government of
India’s capacity to implement comprehensive coastal management approaches in Gujarat, Orissa
and West Bengal. Studies undertaken during the project’s preparation found that women played
important roles in the use, management and conservation of coastal zones. Roughly 80 percent of
working-age women in the coastal communities engaged in small-scale retail fishing and similar
work, however, they exercised minimal control over household resources and were exposed to

                                                                                               125
considerable occupational health hazards (such as gynecological and skin diseases, and shark and
snake bites). Pilot investments from IZCM have been identified in the three states and activities
are being integrated under each proposed investment to address women’s needs. For example, in
Orissa and West Bengal, there are efforts to advance fisher women’s opportunities to market their
wares (e.g., raw fish and more value-added products such as fish pickles or traditional
handicrafts) in areas with existing and relevant forward linkages. In Gujarat, selected women-led
community based organizations undertake and manage investments along the Gulf of Kutch.



3. Global Practices in Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions

3.1. Governance
a. Make service provision more gender-responsive and enhance knowledge about what works:
In South Asia, one-quarter of the population lives on less than $1.25 per day. Even incremental
improvements in how governments manage resources and deliver basic services have enormous
potential to achieve transformational change, by lifting millions of people out of extreme poverty
and improving their quality of life in inclusive ways. Providing education, health and water
services to the poor is difficult to achieve because interventions are subject to the “triple
challenge” of state, market and community failure.20 Ensuring that women and girls have access
to these services is particularly challenging, given male-biased social norms, the concentration of
women in informal work sectors, and the fact that their work often goes unrecognized—as is the
case for women farmers in many South Asian countries.

Among the various approaches taken to improve governance and service delivery in SAR
countries, the most common are decentralization, democratization, public sector management
reforms, and community-driven development. Many have included various efforts to improve the
gender-inclusiveness and gender-responsiveness of service provision, including gender-
budgeting, creating gender-specific sub-divisions in public administration, reserving seats for
women in national parliaments and local councils, and creating women’s quorums in community
meetings and women’s self-help groups (SHGs).
The evidence base for “what works” among these approaches is still very limited and, where it
does exist, offers mixed findings. However, conventional wisdom and select evaluations (see
Chapter 3) suggest that the formation of SHGs, as well as including women in local councils and
meetings, are among the more successful approaches to improving social capital and economic
empowerment outcomes for women. Gender budgeting and seat reservation (particularly at
national levels) are among the least successful. More rigorous evaluations are needed—ideally
impact evaluations using randomized selection methods—but in the absence of such evaluations,
operations can contribute by tracking gender-disaggregated indicators, including the following:
     % of female members and % of committee/council leaders who are women;
     % of grievance redress mechanisms that have women staff members;
     % of grievance redress mechanisms that incorporate gender-responsive measures; and/or

20
  Due to market failure, the private sector is unable to provide these services to a socially desirable extent.
Further, the state is not very effective in service provision, as services need to be provided daily—even to
remote communities—throughout the highly populous countries in most of South Asia, and in ways that
require discretion yet lack standardization, particularly for demand-driven services. Communities and
NGOs can serve as alternative service providers, but also have the potential for failure due to capacity
constraints and capture by local elites (World Bank and IFPRI et al. 2010).

                                                                                                            126
       % of women in self-help groups who generate income as result of interventions to
        improve access to finance.
Collection of the quantitative data above can be supplemented with low-cost qualitative research,
such as focus group discussions or structured interviews with key informants (for example,
council members or council leaders) to obtain informed views on whether economic or other
empowerment improvements for women can be attributed to project interventions. Furthermore,
given the demand from client counterparts, Governance operations and ASA may also provide
guidance on how laws and policies can be more gender-responsive in the areas of human capital
development, women’s economic empowerment and voice and agency. The types of laws that are
regularly considered and on which Governance teams could give guidance include:
            o   Family law (divorce, marriage, alimony, inheritance, child support, child
                custody);
            o   Labor law (retirement ages, family benefits, restrictions on women in certain
                professions, safety in the workplace);
            o   Nationality (equal rights to pass nationality for mothers and fathers);
            o   Housing (passing leases to widows or divorcees); and
            o   Laws governing GBV.

                                    What’s Working in the GP
It is estimated that one-third of the world’s poor live in India, where society remains highly
segmented and income inequalities continue to rise. The SAR Governance Practice has four
projects in the pipeline in India that target women among its beneficiaries. The projects adopt an
inclusive approach to growth, which entails improving the quality, access and efficiency of
services for all Indian citizens, in order to ensure that prosperity is shared. Among these projects
is the Service Delivery Reform project in India’s North East, which takes place in two states that
are geographically isolated—Assam and Mizoram—with Assam being the largest, most
populous, and one of the poorest in the region. It promotes a citizen-centric approach to service
delivery by engaging and targeting underserved groups (of which women are identified as a sub-
set). Further, it aims to increase these groups’ awareness and access to various key and pro-poor
public services, as well as their participation in the monitoring of such services.



3.2. Poverty and Equity
a. Work with national statistics bureaus to improve their capacity to collect gender-
disaggregated data:
Given its mandate, the Poverty GP is best suited to meet the critical need of improving the
measurement of female labor force participation in South Asian countries. Attention to this issue
will help countries in the region achieve the target set forth in Sustainable Development Goal 5
(achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls). In line with this target, the
International Labour Organization (ILO) has already adjusted its definitions of work and labor,
with that of “work” now expanded to include household chores and care, and with the definition
of employment narrowed to refer only to those “engaged in any activity to produce goods or
provide services for pay or profit (ILO 2015).” The Poverty GP can support this effort by


                                                                                                 127
carrying out analytical work that aims to improve the recognition, value and measurement of
unpaid care and domestic work in South Asia.
Box 4.3 Improving Gender Data and Statistics in South Asian Countries

 Gender data and statistics make it possible to identify and measure the key gender issues or
 gaps in a country. They provide the basis for understanding women’s and men’s actual situations
 and differences, enable the monitoring of progress towards reducing gender disparities, improve
 project design and implementation, and enhance the development of recommendations for policy
 makers.
 Gender data and statistics are about both women and men. They comprise data disaggregated
 by sex, and regard gender-relevant issues such as access to clean water and reproductive health.
 Such data is collected by national statistical offices, other national data collectors, sectoral or
 administrative government agencies (e.g., ministries or public registrars), as well as through
 development projects and programs.

 Despite progress in producing gender data and statistics, important data gaps remain.
 Globally, close to 80 percent of countries regularly produce sex-disaggregated statistics on
 mortality, labor force participation, and education and training, but less than a third produce
 disaggregated data on, for example, informal employment, entrepreneurship, earnings, unpaid
 work, assets (property or financial) or gender-based violence. In addition, data is often collected at
 the household and not the individual level; even administrative data collected by government
 entities may not identify the sex of the individuals whose information they collect.

 Available sex-disaggregated and gender-relevant data are not exploited to improve
 development projects or to influence public policies. Even when national statistical offices or
 other data collectors gather gender-relevant data, they often do not conduct gender analysis, report
 or disseminate the results within their countries, provide such information to project teams in order
 to improve implementation, or use findings to inform or influence public policymakers.

 The RGAP for FY16-21 suggests supporting countries to increase and improve gender data
 (particularly in key sectors where there are data gaps), conduct gender analysis of the data,
 and disseminate their results among data users and policymakers. This suggested work would
 include providing technical assistance on gender analysis, on convening data producers and users to
 improve the quality and relevance of such data, on using the results to improve project design and
 implementation, and on presenting findings in policy dialogues with key public decision makers.
 This task could take advantage of the Bank’s considerable experience in data collection and
 analysis, especially on gender, and partner with existing Bank initiatives on data collection and
 statistical capacity building in South Asia.



                                     What’s Working in the GP
The ASA, Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Maldives, has two components that aim to: (i)
expand knowledge on household welfare in Maldives to improve the understanding of recent
trends and the nature of economic opportunities and poverty; and (ii) support Maldives’ National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in measuring poverty. The second component will support the design
of Maldives’ new household survey, using gender-informed approaches that allow for improved
gender analysis.

3.3. Trade and Competitiveness (T&C)
a. Facilitate the creation of more and better jobs for women in trade and related enterprises:
Gender plays a strong—though often unrecognized—role in the trade and competitiveness sector,
which is integral to economy-wide efforts to spur growth, productivity, and job creation in South
Asia. Macroeconomic stability, property rights, rule of law, and well-functioning input markets
for labor, land, and capital all have a gender dimension, as do well-functioning product markets
and their institutional and policy underpinnings: competitive markets, open trade regimes,
favorable investment climates, and national innovation capacities (World Bank Group 2015i).
These aspects of national economies enable integration with global value chains (GVCs), expand
investment volumes and returns, reduce business costs, and encourage the formation of
enterprises—only a small share of which are owned by women in South Asia, as discussed in
Chapter 3.
Industry-level regulations, standards, and support institutions can bolster the entry and growth of
firms that are owned by women or employ women, but unless these are deliberately gender-
informed, they have the tendency to exclude women from business and trade activities in South
Asia. Provision of common-usage and public infrastructure can help exploit agglomeration
economies around industrial clusters—which research suggests can promote women’s business
entry into women-dominated (mostly informal) clusters (Ghani et al. 2012)—and connect lagging
regions to markets.
Interventions at the firm level also can influence growth prospects, especially for new women
entrepreneurs, given the barriers they face in the region. Access to finance, skills and services, as
well as regulations and governance, all shape firm-level incentives for female entrepreneurs, just
as they do for male entrepreneurs. Specialized efforts to influence entrepreneurial intent and
strengthen firm capacities will all need to tailor efforts in gender-informed ways, so that they
substantially increase and sustain the presence of women in the MSME space as remunerated
agents along value chains and in trade dynamics.
T&C in SAR can substantially contribute to these aspects of women’s economic empowerment in
numerous ways, and on multiple levels. In particular, the forthcoming South Asia Regional Trade
Facilitation Program (SARTFP) will provide a unique window of opportunity for T&C to
improve economic opportunities for women in the subcontinent’s Northeast region (Box 4.4).



                                    What’s Working in the GP
The Punjab Jobs and Competitiveness Program for Results, which will launch in FY16, aims to
improve the business environment and support high-growth potential industrial clusters in the
province of Punjab, Pakistan. Through dedicated efforts in design and preparation, this project
has integrated attention to gender issues in all three of its results areas: (i) Business Environment
Reforms; (ii) Spatial Development; and (iii) SME Development. In the first area, the project
supports the Women Development Department of Pakistan in reforming obsolete legislative
provisions that restrict women’s employment in factories. For instance, the country’s Factory Act
requires women to obtain authorization from their male guardian (husband, father or brother) to
access working women’s hostels. The project also aims to reduce the time and costs associated

                                                                                                  129
with business permitting and compliance, which will particularly benefit women, who tend to be
less familiar than men with bureaucratic procedures and more at risk of harassment by public
officials. By improving the design and siting of industrial estates, the project also will provide
ancillary support services that facilitate women’s work needs, such as transport, housing, and
daycare facilities. Finally, the project’s support to private training providers and industrial
clusters will involve special efforts to target women, as well as men.



3.4. Finance and Markets and the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
As in the Trade and Competitiveness GP, Finance and Markets and the IFC have a critical role in
promoting women’s economic empowerment. Because so few women inhabit the MSME space
in South Asian countries—as both employees/income generators and employers/enterprise
owners—there is tremendous potential for women’s greater employment in economies and for
women’s productive contributions to these economies.
a. Leverage the private sector to reduce gender inequalities in economic opportunities:
The slow pace of structural and legal reforms for increasing women’s economic opportunities
compounds progress on gender equality in the region. According to the most recent Women,
Business, and the Law report, South Asia has introduced the least number of reforms in the last
two years to address gender inequalities in the economic sphere (World Bank Group 2015h). The
female disadvantage—whether in employment, entrepreneurship, asset ownership, or access to
financial services—remains large, and necessitates concerted efforts among a range of
stakeholders in different sectors.
Engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in tackling gender issues is a critical lever and
can yield considerable rewards. The Finance and Markets GP and IFC-led knowledge products
underscore the untapped business and profit potential that women-owned businesses hold for
financial institutions. A number of ongoing and pipeline initiatives are building partnerships with
corporate and financial institutions to expand women’s access to finance. The recently approved
investment in Yes Bank Ltd. in India, under IFC’s Banking on Women program, includes a $50
million loan to fulfill the unmet finance needs of women-owned SMEs. The project will also help
Yes Bank create the necessary lending and supervisory infrastructure to develop women-owned
businesses as a new and specialized line of business. In Sri Lanka, the IFC is scaling up access to
finance through a partnership with SANASA Development Bank. The program emphasizes
gender equitable finance opportunities; of the 21,000 loans disbursed in post-conflict districts to
date, 11,000 have been granted to women. In order to further promote women’s economic
empowerment, other IFC programs in Sri Lanka are creating links with stakeholders beyond
banking institutions. These include a collaboration with Women in Management and UNDP to
provide business skill-building and training to women entrepreneurs, as well as a partnership with
Coca-Cola Sri Lanka that will deliver financial and training services to 4,000 female
entrepreneurs in post-conflict districts who are part of the company’s supply and distribution
chain.
The Finance and Markets GP’s India program also has a strong focus on facilitating finance
targeting to women entrepreneurs. The MSME Growth Innovation and Inclusive Finance Project,
launched with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), includes a component on
promoting finance to women-owned/managed MSMEs. The Bank is providing advisory support

                                                                                               130
to expand SIDBI’s female clientele and will help create financial products tailored to the needs of
women-owned MSMEs, in addition to extending a credit line to 400 women-led/owned MSMEs.
Expanding such partnerships and replicating successful models for deeper penetration and wider
reach would extend crucial support to the large number of underserved women in the region.
Recent research shows that constraints arising from gender norms can be more significant than
financial barriers in hindering the uptake of financial services among women-owned SMEs. In
light of these findings, greater consideration of non-financial barriers in projects and partnerships
can be particularly meaningful in expanding women’s access and productive use of financial
services (IFC 2014). Attention to inhibiting factors—such as women’s lower mobility, lack of
opportunities for business skills development, and limited professional networks—will
complement the work of other GPs, including Education, Social Protection and Labor, and
Transport and ICT in reducing gender disparities.
Finance and Markets and the IFC can use many of the approaches suggested in the Trade and
Competitiveness section, above. In addition, Finance and Markets and IFC projects with male and
female beneficiaries in the private sector (e.g., employment in firms, enterprise creation,
microfinance or other financial services) can effectively track gender outcomes using one or more
of the following monitoring and evaluation indicators:

       Number and percent of women with accounts in formal financial institutions;
       Percent of female and male microfinance clients (individual or community) whose funds
        generate income; and,
       Number of female and male farmers or other workers linked to operations of IFC client
        companies.


                                    What’s Working in the GP
The Finance and Markets GP is taking a comprehensive approach to gender finance in India,
focusing on both low-income households and MSMEs. At the household level, a large part of the
program focuses on developing the capacity of the Indian microfinance sector, nearly 97 percent
of which is comprised of women borrowers. Three complementary initiatives seek to improve
access, usage and the quality of demand-driven financial services among underserved market
segments, with a strong focus on gender: (i) A sector wide program aims at facilitating the
adoption of best practices in responsible finance by the Indian Microfinance Sector. A key focus
of this initiative is stronger consumer protection through greater customer centricity, effective
self-regulation, and an improved credit infrastructure; (ii) An ongoing initiative aims to increase
microfinance borrowers’ awareness around issues such as savings, borrowings and insurance, as
well as around the management of household finances. This is expected to help women clients
make better informed financial decisions; and (iii) The government to persons payments (G2P)
program is being implemented in the low income states of Bihar and UP, where by 2019 it is
estimated that over five million women recipients—comprising frontline health workers and
program beneficiaries—will receive payments directly into their bank accounts, reducing delays
and overhead costs. Initial results have been positive, with evidence of expanded financial access
to an additional 122 million adults within a three-year time period. Country-wide gender
outcomes related to financial access have also been promising—as per the Global Financial
Inclusion Database, the proportion of women who report having an account at a bank or any other
financial institution increased from 26 percent in 2011, to 43 percent in 2014.

                                                                                                 131
4. Supporting Gender Outcomes across the Region


A number of regional activities are supporting the various GP activities described above; these
include the South Asia Food and Nutritional Security Initiative (SAFANSI, see Annex A), the
Gender Innovation Lab (see section 2.2) and the South Asia Regional Trade Facilitation Program
(SARTFP; see Box 4.4). Although such regional initiatives can serve as models for programming
in particular areas, it will be increasingly critical for the GPs to collaborate across practices. For
instance, Energy and WSS operations have similar gender outcomes and are reaching the same
populations, creating a number of potential opportunities. Likewise, Transport, Urban
Development and Social Development can collaborate to promote long-term results in women’s
labor force participation, to eliminate mobility constraints, and encourage gender equitable
behavioral change—among other potential points of collaboration.


Box 4.4 South Asia Regional Trade Facilitation Program (SARTFP)

SARTFP is a cross-sectoral program led by South Asia Regional Management. Its’ overriding
objective is to enhance shared prosperity and gender equality through increased regional integration,
focusing on the trade corridors connecting Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. By supporting
greater physical connectivity, lower man-made barriers to trade, and stronger networks to encourage
entrepreneurship and economic opportunities, the program should lead to increased international
trade and faster economic growth (please see SARTFP Theory of Change, Annex D).

In particular, SARTFP seeks to actively address the market and institutional failures that prevent
women and the poor from taking advantage of regional integration; removing constraints and
proactively promoting the participation of women and the poor will expand economic activity.
Encouraging entrepreneurship and women’s labor force participation will also increase income-
earning opportunities and improve the social status of women, both in the household and in society.

SARTFP will include rigorous evaluations of interventions, to help build the evidence base on
effective approaches for economically empowering women through regional integration. For
example, increased economic opportunity can be measured against a set of higher-level outcome
indicators in key areas, including the time and cost of cross-border trade, labor earnings along
priority corridors, and increased female labor force participation, as put forward in the theory of
change (Annex D). In the 2016 calendar year, SARTFP will invite technical and financial proposals
for the relevant GPs to undertake operational and ASA initiatives in support of program objectives.
SARTFP is made possible by a dedicated trust fund contribution from the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Government of Australia.

a. Learning from effective approaches and good practices that address gender disadvantages in
fragile and conflict-affected contexts:
This RGAP places emphasis on the linkages between gender and conflict and fragility. Chapter 1
establishes conflict and fragility as having cross-cutting relevance to gender, while Chapters 2
and 3 underscore the gendered impacts of these shocks in different domains. As part of the World
Bank’s engagement in fragile and conflict-affected settings, projects led by various GPs in South
Asia and in other regions are taking proactive measures to address gender-constraints in conflict,
post-conflict, and fragile contexts. As such, there is enormous scope to build on emerging lessons
and pilot innovative approaches through increased collaboration and knowledge exchange across
GPs. The following section distills some good practice examples that have effectively integrated
gender considerations in projects operating in areas affected by conflict and fragility.
Helping adolescent girls navigate the pathway from school to productive and sustainable
employment:
The Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI) pilots were implemented in eight low-income countries
emerging from conflict, namely Afghanistan, Haiti, Jordan, Lao PDR, Liberia, Nepal, and
Rwanda. With opportunities for education and skills acquisition substantially diminished in
fragile settings, employment oriented training for adolescents responded to the critical need of
equipping youth with life skills and technical training for productive employment. The AGI’s
implementation in diverse settings involved adapting the pilot to local socio-cultural conditions,
and accounting especially for gender constraints that may restrict the effective recruitment and
successful participation of girls in post-conflict scenarios. In Afghanistan, the AGI provided
dedicated transportation to adolescent girls to and from training sites, in order to overcome
mobility constraints arising out of security concerns. The program also worked extensively
through local mobilizers and community organizations (shuras) to gain the support and trust of
families for girls’ participation in the program. In other pilots, participants were offered childcare,
food and transport allowances, as well as literacy training. Training hours were also adjusted to
accommodate other commitments, such as schooling and chores. Attention to such operational
aspects that help overcome gender constraints can be particularly effective for engaging women
and girls in areas affected by conflict and fragility.
Supporting rural women to become entrepreneurs of sustainable businesses:
In countries such as Afghanistan, where there is dearth of employment opportunities outside of
agriculture, diversifying the economy puts the country on a stronger path to economic
development, while also contributing to sustaining peace (Iyer and Santos 2012). The Afghanistan
Rural Development Program (AREDP) has successfully operationalized this finding by
supporting rural women to become entrepreneurs of sustainable businesses. AREDP operates in
733 villages, spread among five provinces, to create networks of community level Savings
Groups (SGs) and Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs). Locally-owned and
managed by members, these groups mobilize savings, which are then offered as loans to other
members for new entrepreneurial ventures. The program has had a positive impact on women in
the community, by ensuring their equal participation in SGs and encouraging their involvement in
entrepreneurial and employment opportunities. Women comprise 55 percent of borrowers; this
high share is a striking achievement in a country where the female labor force participation rate is
a mere 16.2 percent. By helping overcome cultural and regulatory barriers, as well as mobility


                                                                                                   133
constraints in accessing financial institutions, the program serves as a model for targeting
financial services and economic opportunities to women.


Embedding a gender focus in private sector growth and development:
The IFC’s Conflict Affected States in Africa (CASA) Initiative is supporting gender inclusive
private sector growth and job creation in eight conflict-affected and fragile African countries. The
initiative is guided by a gender framework comprised of three pillars: (i) making a business case
for gender equality in engagements with private sector clients and partners in fragile and conflict-
affected states; (ii) catalyzing interest among operational teams across the WBG to adopt gender
inclusive approaches in private sector oriented activities in these countries; and (iii) using gender
sensitive conflict assessments, country diagnostics and research to identify transformational
instruments that place women and girls onto a sustainable economic trajectory, alongside men.
Further, CASA aims to ensure that 40 percent of all jobs created under the program go to women,
and it maintains a number of other activities to support women entrepreneurs in fragile states,
including business training and financial services tailored to local contexts. For example, in Sierra
Leone, the IFC has developed a database of female entrepreneurs to help provide more targeted
and needs-based support for growing women-owned businesses. In South Sudan, the IFC helped
create a professional network for female businesswomen by launching the South Sudan Chamber
of Women Entrepreneurs. Now in its second phase, CASA II has extended programs into other
conflict-affected countries in Africa—including Mali, Somalia and Zimbabwe—that will
mainstream gender in private sector development.
Targeting benefits of relief initiatives to vulnerable women:
The Emergency Northern Recovery Project (ENReP) in Sri Lanka was developed in response to
the Sri Lankan government’s request for assistance to rapidly resettle internally displaced persons
(IDPs) in the conflict-affected northern provinces of the country. As one of the largest relief
programs among the country’s post-conflict reconstruction efforts, the Cash for Work (CfW)
initiative, a component of ENReP, prioritized the targeting of benefits to vulnerable women—
including female heads of household and elderly women. Approximately 65 percent of all
participants were female, with many playing leadership roles in CfW committees and in
administering the program. CfW revealed that opportunities for employment, leadership, and
decision-making in difficult environments—if they are more equally distributed between men and
women—can accelerate the path to recovery and resettlement. For example, many women were
able to locate other sources of employment in the area after their participation in ENReP. The
program’s completion report notes the scope for strengthening gender-aware design and
implementation of the program: monitoring of outreach and targeting to vulnerable women, as
well as reporting on gender-disaggregated impacts could have been conducted in a more
systematic fashion, and the presence of a gender specialist on the team would have helped
strengthen the program’s approach to gender integration.


Prioritizing gender issues in post-conflict reconstruction efforts:
The North East Local Services Improvement Project (NELSIP) in Sri Lanka improves the
delivery of a range of basic services to alleviate the poverty and hardship faced by communities

                                                                                                 134
in the conflict-affected north and eastern provinces of the country. Based on social impact
assessments and surveys, the project developed a gender action plan to ensure the systematic
integration and prioritization of gender issues in implementation activities. For example, the
social protection component targets a range of safety net programs to women headed households,
war widows, and elderly women, whose situations have become markedly more vulnerable
because of the conflict. At the local level, infrastructure construction projects take into account
the disadvantaged position of women within their communities, in order to identify concrete sub-
projects which can improve equitable access to basic public services—including healthcare, water
and sanitation—as well as physical access to markets.
In addition to physical interventions, the project also emphasizes enhancing women’s
participation in strengthening accountability at the local level, by promoting the participatory and
demand driven development of infrastructure. As a result, female representation in participatory
planning processes and institutions—such as social audit committees and grievance redress
mechanisms—has been relatively high. Since 2011, more than 90 percent of Public Relations
Officers appointed at the project level are young women, many of whom are also focal points for
local authorities who manage grievance redress mechanisms. Moreover, with 30 percent female
participation in Social Audit Committees, women are also playing an active role in monitoring
local interventions. As demonstrated by NELSIP, such systematic gender analyses and actions in
projects can significantly catalyze gender relations, enabling a more gender-balanced approach to
reconstruction and development in post-conflict settings.
Facilitating female participation in local governance:
Afghanistan’s flagship initiative, the National Solidarity Program (NSP), focuses on the
reconstruction and development of community level institutions and governance processes that
were ravaged by a prolonged period of war and civil conflict spanning close to three decades.
Implemented since 2003, NSP is operationalized through the creation of locally elected
Community Development Councils (CDCs) across all provinces in the country. Provided with
block grants of $200 per family, CDCs are empowered with the jurisdiction of managing the
spending of these funds towards small-scale infrastructure and development works, based on
local priorities. The program has successfully introduced a number of substantive measures to
ensure the qualitative representation and participation of women in CDCs, including provisions
which make it mandatory for elected councils to be gender-balanced. At the project level, formal
institutional mechanisms such as the Gender Advisory Office and the NSP Gender Working
Group have been created to oversee and ensure that gender considerations are rigorously
identified and mainstreamed into project activities.
Each level of implementation—beginning with the identification and mobilization of
communities, followed by CDC election and membership, to training, capacity building and
monitoring and assessment—lay out clearly defined criteria for female participation. Moreover,
to effectively involve women in the program, NSP addresses women’s disadvantaged position in
Afghan society, as well as socio-cultural variations in gender norms. For example, the program
garners the support of men and other influential community members to alleviate opposition to
women’s participation as CDC members. Evaluations of the NSP have noted positive
improvements in women’s education and mobility, as well as enhanced community perceptions
of women in community leadership roles.




                                                                                                135
Amplifying women’s voices and roles local development:
The Inclusive Development in Post-Conflict Bougainville, Papua New Guinea project is enabling
women to drive development in post-conflict Bougainville by (i) strengthening the capacity of
women’s organizations to undertake development activities which are inclusive of women; (ii)
providing small grants to women’s groups for high priority community development projects; and
(iii) monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of these specific approaches. By proactively
involving women as key stakeholders in the development process, the project is helping
strengthen the social and political voice of women in the rebuilding of a society emerging from
conflict.
Addressing male gender norms for youth at risk:
The Comprehensive Socioeconomic Support for Male Youth at-risk in Conflict-affected
Karamoja, Uganda intervention builds on gender-informed approaches to address gender norms
and support young men in conflict-affected areas. This is done through a combination of
livelihood diversification activities and behavior change programming. Life skills training and
gender-focused participatory community sessions were conducted in order to enhance skills and
confidence, as well as to promote an understanding of prevailing norms, customs and societal
expectations among male youth. An evaluation of the intervention shows positive changes in
perceptions around domestic violence, reduced acceptability of using violence against spouses
and improvements in interpersonal relationships. Evidence on whether these positive perceptions
were translated into sustained actions was mixed, due to the short timeframe of the intervention
and because of the complexity surrounding attitudes and behaviors around violence. However,
targeting youth cohorts with gender-sensitive integrated programming offers a promising
approach to address gender issues in conflict-affected and fragile contexts.
Providing timely support to survivors of Sexual Gender-Based Violence:
Implemented in the aftermath of the conflict in Congo’s eastern province of South Kivu, the
Assisting Survivors of Sexual Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) program serves as a promising
model for providing timely support to survivors of such violence. Under this program, the Bank
partnered with the International Rescue Committee to provide psychosocial support to nearly
4,000 survivors, including victims of SGBV, female heads of households, teenage mothers and
war widows. The provision of Cognitive Processing Therapy services under the program led to
substantial improvements in beneficiaries’ health outcomes; their probability of experiencing
depression or anxiety decreased from 71 percent to 9 percent, and the likelihood of Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder fell from 60 percent to 9 percent. Further, a high proportion of
survivors of GBV received timely medical support and care within the recommended 72 hour
timeframe. To strengthen these rehabilitative measures, the project forged successful partnerships
with local groups to address gender-based violence and created Village Savings and Loan
Associations (VSLAs) to maintain social cohesion. The project demonstrates a low-cost and
scalable model to improve the psychological, social, physical and economic well-being of
survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.
Facilitating knowledge exchange and learning on innovative approaches and good practices:
Established in 2013, the Global Platform on Addressing Sexual and Gender Based Violence
(SGBV) advances the World Bank’s commitment to strengthen efforts towards addressing gender
issues, including SGBV, in the context of fragile and conflict-affected states. The Global Platform

                                                                                               136
builds on recommendations from the 2012 WDR on Gender Equality and Development by
promoting gender equality through pilots and scalable innovative approaches, with the
overarching objectives of: (i) contributing to SGBV prevention and the provision of services to
survivors of SGBV across regions and practices, (ii) fostering South-South knowledge sharing
and learning, to strengthen client capacity to address SGBV, as well as to inform future Bank
programming, and (iii) producing learning through pilot assessments and impact evaluations on
what works and what does not, also to inform future Bank programming. An example of an
ongoing program being implemented under the Global Platform is the Integrated Platform for
Gender Based Violence Prevention and Response Project in Nepal. The program is helping to
establish a national GBV helpline, in order to improve the quality and reach of services to
survivors, in addition to conducting a range of activities that raise awareness and sensitivity on
issues of GBV among key stakeholders.

Annex A: Trust Fund Programs Supporting Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA)
in South Asia

1. South Asia Gender (SAGE) Initiative
South Asia’s gender program has grown tremendously over the last five years, with the greatest
period of growth attributable to the South Asia Gender (SAGE) Initiative. Launched in FY11
with a large grant from AusAID (now the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade—DFAT—in
the Government of Australia), SAGE has promoted gender equality and the empowerment of
women and men in South Asia by providing funding, capacity building support, and a space for
information exchange. The previous (FY13-15) and current RGAP are envisioned as essential and
integral parts of the SAGE Initiative. With subsequent additional funding from Bank resources
and other Trust Fund sources, the SAGE Initiative focuses on:

       Strategic stand-alone tasks that target the most salient gender issues;
       Strategic mainstreaming of gender in SAR operations and CASs/CPSs/ISNs;
       Research and analytical work–including Impact Evaluations—to push forward the thinking
        and approaches to redress gender issues in the region; and,
       Communication and capacity building of SAR World Bank staff and external partners.


The portfolio of SAGE activities includes 19 activities, for a total of US$2.5 million in grant
funding. These include at least one ASA for each of SAR’s eight countries and 4 regional ASA.
SAGE activities have focused largely on the topics areas of labor force participation, safety and
mobility, social inclusion, and gender relations. For example:

       In Bangladesh, SAGE supported a training on gender in housing issues, as well as a study
        on the gender-related implications of access to housing finance and slum upgrading. Study
        results have directly informed a FY16 lending operation on slums in the country.
       In Sri Lanka, a study of female labor force participation used analysis of quantitative
        (primary and secondary) and qualitative (primary) data to find three main drivers of low
        participation rates. Findings and recommended actionable interventions to address these
        drivers were shared with government and other in-country stakeholders at a May 2013
        workshop in Colombo. In September 2013, the findings were discussed in a national
        parliament session. Since then, discussions between the team and government counterparts
        have centered on how to pilot some of the study’s recommendations.
       An analytical activity focusing on masculinity, gender and development in South Asia was
        completed in 2014. This activity identified how masculinities and related gender norms
        impact development outcomes, including the well-being of males, females and children
        within households and at the community level.

Gender-based violence also was included as a theme in the SAGE portfolio. The 2014 report,
Violence Against Women and Girls: Lessons from South Asia, was funded by a combination of
Bank Budget and SAGE Trust Funds; it aimed at creating a better understanding of the drivers of
VAWG and best practices to address it, and to share this knowledge with government and other
key stakeholders. The report’s process included thorough consultations with experts in the region,
ongoing communications with stakeholders, and a published book.



                                                                                              151
2. Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality (UFGE)
The UFGE, a Multi-Donor Trust Fund managed by the Gender CCSA, has provided catalytic
resources for the South Asia region (SAR). In particular, the UFGE has strengthened the impact
of the SAR Regional Gender Action Plan (RGAP) FY13-15, by allowing for additional
investment to help unlock new ways of engaging with partners, at both the regional and national
level in South Asia.
The South Asia RGAP FY13-15 and the current RGAP apply a gender lens to regional work,
targeting both women and men as agents of change. A total allocation of $2.4 million in UFGE
funds has allowed the region to support key gender priorities in SAR. In fact, two major regional
programs were launched with the first allocation of UFGE funds to SAR, in FY14: the South
Asia Regional Gender Innovation Lab (SAR-GIL) and the Regional Program on Gender-Based
Violence (see Annex C and Box 3.3, respectively). These funds have also enhanced the
generation of gender-relevant data in half of the region’s countries.
The most recent UFGE allocation to SAR, in early FY16, will allow the region to grow the
portfolio of the SAR-GIL, among other tasks. In early calendar year FY16, the SAR-GIL will
issue its first open call for proposals—to all countries and GPs (including the IFC) in the region—
to competitively select and evaluate operations that focus on women’s empowerment. Special
preference given to operations that incorporate interventions to address GBV and other areas of
women’s voice and agency.


3. South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI)
Ending extreme poverty and hunger is the First Millennium Development Goal. Yet, 23 percent
of the people who are routinely hungry—336 million people—live in the South Asia region.
These are among the highest rates of hunger in the world, and new threats are emerging to
intensify the situation. These figures even underestimate the true extent of food insecurity, which
includes hidden hunger: micronutrient deficiencies that, beyond calories, limit potential for active
and healthy lives.
Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to
sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for active and
healthy lives. In South Asia, national food security has largely been achieved, though nutrition
security below the national level has not, which undermines development (see Chapter 2).
Established in 2010 by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DfID),
SAFANSI is a multi-donor trust fund21 and joint undertaking by both the World Bank and DfID
that seeks to promote coordinated efforts within and between countries to improve food and
nutrition security (FNS) in South Asia. SAFANSI was formed with the recognition that ending
the “South Asian Enigma” of poor nutrition will take wide-spread reform and innovation in
policies and programs. In particular, there is a pressing need to undertake cross-cutting action

21
  In 2010, DfID made an initial contribution to SAFANSI of USD 7 million. This was followed in 2011 by
USD 9.2 million from DFAT to finance a new window, Scaling Up Nutrition Initiative Technical
Assistance (SUNITA). The 2015 launch of SAFANSI’s second phase brought another contribution from
DfID, in the amount of £16.0 million, as well as €7.5 million from the European Commission.


                                                                                                  152
(involving multiple sectors and stakeholders) in order to enable the collaboration that can
effectively solve this shared problem (World Bank 2015g). SAFANSI’s goal is to foster the
cross-cutting interventions that will lead to measurable improvements in Food and Nutrition
Security. Towards this end, SAFANSI undertakes activities within three broad program areas:
Analysis (improving analysis and evidence on the most effective ways to achieve FNS outcomes
in SAR); Advocacy (improving awareness of FNS-related challenges as well as advocacy for
action among relevant stakeholders); and Capacity Building (strengthening regional and in-
country policy and programming capacity to achieve FNS outcomes).
Gender issues—many of which stem from women’s lack of agency—feature prominently in
several factors that contribute to insufficient food availability for poor and marginalized
populations in South Asia (World Bank 2015g). In many households across the region,
customary practice requires that women eat last and eat least. This severely affects their
nutritional status, as well as overall household nutrition in households where women lack any
decision-making control over income spending (ibid). The region’s high rates of early marriage
and adolescent pregnancy contribute to a downward spiral of intergenerational malnutrition that
passes from mother to child. More than one-third of adult women in Pakistan, India and
Bangladesh are underweight, and the region’s incidence of anemia from iron deficiency ranges
from 55 to 81 percent across countries. In spite of these abysmal outcomes, safety net programs
tend to neglect the gender-informed design of programs that is necessary to increase women’s
access to food (ibid). One of these activities supports the Government of Pakistan in addressing
food and nutrition security, with particular attention to gender, geographic location, and poverty.
This approach provides a gender-informed framework in which government and development
partners can direct their investments.

Annex F: Violence Against Women and Girls Resource Guide

This Violence Against Women and Girls resource guide was developed and launched by the
World Bank Group in partnership with the Global Women’s Institute (GWI) at George
Washington University, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 2014. The
International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) joined the partnership in June 2015. The
primary audiences for the guides are IDB and WBG staff and member countries, as well as other
development professionals who do not yet have experience addressing violence against women
and girls (VAWG). The purpose of this guide is to provide the reader with basic information on
the characteristics and consequences of VAWG, including the operational implications that
VAWG can have in several priority sectors of the IDB and WBG. The guide is designed to offer
accessible guidance on how to integrate VAWG prevention and the provision of quality services
to violence survivors within a range of development projects. The guides highlight potential
entry points and partners to engage with, while recommending strategies for integrating VAWG
into policies and legislation, as well as sector programs and projects.

This resource guide draws on existing global evidence and emerging promising practices. It
should be noted, however, that the vast majority of the evidence (80%) on what works to
prevent or respond to VAWG comes from high-income countries, according to a recent
systematic review of reviews on this topic by GWI and WBG22. The review also found that less
than a quarter of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies assessed
interventions in developing countries. Nonetheless, the current evidence, combined with
promising initiatives, provides robust entry points for action while the insufficiency of data is
overcome.

International financial institutions (IFIs), other multilateral institutions, and bilateral donors have
a vital role to play in preventing and addressing VAWG in both low- and middle-income
countries. These institutions are in the unique position of having the global reach to generate
and disseminate knowledge, leverage partnerships with governments and a range of other key
stakeholders, and lead by financing innovative programming.23

Because of their global influence, IFIs are uniquely positioned to promote evidence-based good
practices. Not only can they leverage partnerships with governments to create a space for policy
dialogues on addressing VAWG, they can also act as pioneers in promoting integrated and multi-
sectoral approaches to addressing this issue. Lessons learned and evaluations of VAWG projects

promote investment in effective strategies for preventing and responding to violence.

To better equip staff for beginning to innovate and integrate the prevention and response to
VAWG within their sector programs we encourage readers to review the Resource Guide
Introduction along with their sector specific brief. The VAWG Resource Guide Introduction is an
essential piece of the resource guide, relevant and applicable to all team leaders, specialists, and
program managers, irrespective of their sector. It outlines the magnitude of VAWG, key
definitions, risk and protective factors, socio-economic costs, the needs of survivors, as well as
the role and value-added of international finance institutions in supporting VAWG prevention
efforts. In addition, it includes:

       Guiding principles for data collection and working with VAWG survivors
       Guiding principles for VAWG programming

The Sector Briefs provide guidance to help development professionals understand how VAWG
affects programming in their sector, and offer suggestions for integrating VAWG prevention and
response activities within each sector at the policy, institutional, and community level. The
briefs also provide some detail about lessons learned from previous efforts to integrate VAWG,
including those centered on working across multiple sectors. This resource guide is grounded in
the understanding that the reader is not a specialist on preventing violence against women and
girls, and in the recognition that the strategic objectives of many development projects will not
be centered on VAWG prevention and response. However, beyond being a violation of human
rights, VAWG can impede development projects from achieving the greatest possible impact by
hindering the contribution of beneficiaries, particularly women, to project goals. In light of this
fact, the basic principles of this resource guide are that a) not all suggested activities need to be
(or should be) implemented at once; one or two may suffice to start; and b) project staff should
harness the available evidence, expertise, and experience to assist them with operationalizing
some of the suggestions in each sector. To date the partnership has created seven sector briefs
to build the operational guidance aimed at assisting development professionals with integrating
violence prevention and response into their programming. On the VAWG Resource Guide
website you will find briefs for:

     Citizen Security, Law, and Justice
       Disaster Risk Management
       Education
       Finance & Enterprise Development
       Health
       Social Protection
       Transport
       We also provide a specific guidance note on how to work with Sexual and
        Gender Minority Women

      Annex G: Country Gender Profiles
                           Annex G1: Afghanistan Country Gender Statistical Profile


 I.        Introduction

      The Afghanistan Country Gender Statistical Profile provides an examination of the nation’s
      progress on social and economic indicators, from a gender perspective. The following sections
      provide sex-disaggregated data and analysis on health and nutrition, education, economic
      participation, and voice and agency—along with insights on laws and regulations. The profile
      concludes with an overview of observable gaps in data and recommendations for future research.

      Afghanistan falls behind regional averages concerning health and nutrition, with particularly wide
      gaps in maternal mortality and adolescent fertility. In education, females lag behind in enrollment
      rates at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, although gaps between females and males are
      comparatively lower when considering primary and secondary completion rates. Labor force
      participation rates are much lower for women, who also lag behind on various indicators of
      access to finance. Female political participation, however, exceeds regional averages.

      Over time, Afghanistan has shown improvements in areas of health and nutrition, education, and
      voice and agency, but has not shown much progress with regard to indicators of female economic
      participation.

      Overall, there is enough data available to support policy development in Afghanistan, but areas
      for further research include data on employment (by sector and employment type) and on gender-
      based violence.

II.        Legal and Political context24

      Currently, Afghanistan does not ensure gender neutral protection or access to institutions, nor
      does the constitution contain a clause to prohibit gender discrimination. Married and unmarried
      women cannot apply for a passport or national ID card in the same way as their male
      counterparts. Moreover, due to various constraints, married women cannot travel outside their
      home, nor can they choose where to live in the same way as men.

      In terms of access to property, women do not have the same ownership rights as men. Similarly,
      sons and daughters do not have equal rights to inherit property from their parents. In terms of
      access to justice, the law does recognize personal law25 courts, and a woman’s testimony does not
      carry the same weight as that of a man.

      The current work environment in Afghanistan also necessitates improvement. There is no law
      mandating equal remuneration for work of equal value or prohibiting gender-based discrimination
      in hiring. Employers are also not prohibited from asking about family status during hiring, nor are
      they prohibited from dismissing pregnant workers.

        Personal law refers to non-customary legal systems that stem from tradition or doctrinal texts, which are
      sometimes uncodified.

                                                                                                              164
    Annex G1: Afghanistan                                                        Country Gender Profile


    Improvement is also needed in terms of laws and regulations pertaining to gender-based violence.
    There is no law covering domestic violence or sexual harassment. Furthermore, there is no
    legislation that criminalizes marital rape. The legal age of marriage for girls is 16, and the law
    does not explicitly criminalize child marriage. The legal age of marriage for boys is slightly
    higher, at 18 years.

III.    Endowments: Health and Nutrition

    1. Summary of current status

    Afghanistan performs below regional averages in key indicators of health and nutrition. The
    female life expectancy is 62 years. While roughly on par with that of males (59 years), it is
    considerably lower than the regional average of 68, recorded in 2012. The nation’s fertility rate
    was 5 births per woman (2012), which is also behind the regional average of 3 (2013). The gap
    between Afghanistan and the region is even wider when considering adolescent fertility rates; in
    2012, Afghanistan’s adolescent fertility rate was approximately 87 births per 1,000 women ages
    15-19, much higher than the regional average of 39, recorded in 2013.

    This pattern of deficiency is also reflected in low rates of pregnant women receiving prenatal care
    and the low percentage of births attended by skilled health staff. The indicators for maternal
    mortality are also particularly high; Afghanistan’s maternal mortality ratio was 400 per 100,000
    live births in 2013, compared to the regional average of 190, also recorded in the same year.
    Detailed indicators on health and nutrition in Afghanistan are provided in Table 1.

    2. Trends through time

    Afghanistan has improved on several key indicators in health and nutrition over time. The female
    under-5 mortality rate dropped from 131.3 in 2000, to 93.8 in 2013. From 2000 to 2012, the
    country also successfully decreased its adolescent fertility rate from 158 to 87 births per 1000
    women, ages 15-19. The overall fertility rate, however, has not decreased as much—moving from
    roughly 8 to 5 births per woman between 2000 and 2012. Afghanistan has also improved on a
    number of other health indicators, with the proportion of women receiving prenatal care
    increasing from 36.9 percent in 2000 to 47.95 in 2011. Similarly, the proportion of births attended
    by skilled staff has increased from 12.4 percent in 2000 to 38.6 percent in 2011. With regard to
    health indicators, perhaps the most astonishing improvement has been seen in the maternal
    mortality ratio, which has steadily declined from 1100 per 100,000 live births in 2000, to 400 in
    2013. Contraceptive prevalence has also seen a sharp increase, from 4.9 percent in 2000 to 21.25
    percent in 2011.

IV.     Endowments: Education

    1. Summary of current status

    Female enrollment rates are considerably low in Afghanistan. About half as many young females
    are as literate as young males. Moreover, the ratio of female to male primary and secondary
    enrollment rates are 71.81 and 55.34 percent, respectively—far below the regional averages of
    100.17 and 93.29 percent (2012). This pattern continues for tertiary enrollment, with the ratio of
    female to male gross enrollment rates at 33.23 percent (2011), much lower than the region’s
    78.22 percent (2012). These figures, along with further details on education indicators in
    Afghanistan can be found in Table 2.

      2. Trends through time

      Afghanistan’s key indicators in education have improved over time. The ratio of female to male
      primary enrollment increased from 44.85 percent in 2002, to 71.81 percent in 2012. The same
      ratio for secondary enrollment also increased from 33.76 percent in 2003, to 55.34 percent in
      2012. The ratio of female to male tertiary enrollment increased slightly less, from 27.25 percent
      in 2003, to 33.23 percent in 2011. The available data for completion rates is not recent enough to
      assess trends over time.

 V.       Economic Opportunity: Labor Force Participation and Employment, and Access to
          Finance


      1. Summary of current status

      Few women participate in the Afghan labor force; females constitute only 16.38 percent of the
      total labor force. Moreover, the female labor force participation rate in Afghanistan is only 18.5
      percent, compared to 80 percent for males (2011). This is especially pronounced for younger age
      cohorts—according to ILO estimates (2013), the labor force participation rates for females and
      males in the 15-24 year old age bracket were 13.3 percent and 60.9 percent, respectively.
      Employment to population ratios in Afghanistan are also higher for males than for females, in
      both the 15+ and 15-24 year old age groups. Moreover, unemployment rates are higher for
      females.

      Women also have limited access to finance. According to data from 2011, only 2.62 percent of
      Afghan females hold an account at a financial institution, compared to 15.42 percent of males.
      This figure is also far lower than the regional average of 25.02 percent. Similarly, only 0.27
      percent of females in Afghanistan maintain an account at a financial institution for business
      purposes, as compared to 5.18 percent of men—lower than the regional average of 1.71 percent.
      Detailed indicators for economic opportunity in Afghanistan are provided in Table 3.

      2. Trends through time

      Over time, Afghanistan has struggled to show improvement in key indicators of women’s
      economic participation. The female composition of the labor force has shown little improvement,
      increasing from 13.86 percent in 2000 to 16.38 percent in 2013. Similarly, the labor force
      participation rate of female youth (ages 15-24) has shown little progress, increasing from 11.3
      percent in 2000 to 13.3 percent in 2013. Males have not fared much better, as the labor force
      participation rate of male youth decreased slightly, from 62 to 60.9 percent, in the same time
      period. Furthermore, the overall labor force participation rate for females decreased from 47
      percent in 2007, to 18.5 percent in 2011. The male labor force participation rate also decreased
      from 86 percent to 80 percent in the same time period.

      Unemployment has also been a rising concern in Afghanistan, with females faring worse than
      their male counterparts in some measures. The female youth unemployment rate has actually
      increased from 12.7 percent in 2000, to 22.8 percent in 2013. This is also true for the male youth
      unemployment rate, which increased from 6.9 percent to 16.4 percent in the same time period.
      The total female unemployment rate increased however from 7 percent in 2007 to 16.5 percent in
      2011, while the male unemployment rate decreased from 7 percent to 6.4 percent in the same
      period. The female employment to population ratio for the age group of 15+ increased slightly,
      from 12 percent in 2000, to 13.9 percent in 2013. For males, this ratio decreased from 77.7
      percent to 73.8 percent in the same time period. The female youth employment to population ratio
      has also increased slightly, from 9.9 to 10.3 percent, whereas it decreased for males, from 57.7
      percent to 50.9 percent in the same time period.

    Female political participation in Afghanistan is higher than the regional average. The proportion
    of seats held by women in national parliament is 27.7 percent (2014)—better than the regional
    average of 19.34 percent (2014). Afghanistan also fares well in terms of the proportion of women
    in ministerial level positions, which is 11.1 percent (2014). This is higher than the regional
    average of 7.06 percent (2014). Further research is needed on the prevalence of gender-based
    violence in Afghanistan, as well as with regard to attitudes that justify gender-based violence.

    2. Trends through time

    Afghanistan has improved and maintained good performance with regard to various indicators of
    female voice and agency. Since 2005, the proportion of seats held by women in national
    parliament has consistently been close to 27 percent—higher than the regional average of 19.34
    percent (2014). Similarly, the proportion of women in ministerial level positions has increased
    slightly, from 10 percent in 2005, to 11.1 percent in 2014. Yet, the proportion of women in these
    positions fell to 3.7 and 7.4 percent in 2008 and 2010, respectively, having peaked at 12 percent
    in 2012.


VII.    Data and Knowledge Gaps -- areas for more research

    There are significant data gaps on key gender indicators for Afghanistan. Areas that need more
    research include economic participation and gender based violence. While there is data on the
    extent of female participation in the labor force, research is needed on their sectors of


                                                                                                       170

employment. Moreover, there is also a need for data on the prevalence and acceptance of gender-
based violence in the country.

  Annex G2. Bangladesh Country Gender Statistical Profile


I.       Introduction

  The Bangladesh Country Gender Statistical Profile provides an examination of Bangladesh’s
  progress on social and economic indicators, from a gender perspective. The following sections
  provide sex-disaggregated data and analysis on health and nutrition, education, economic
  participation, voice and agency, and gender-based violence—along with insights on laws and
  regulations. The profile concludes with an overview of observed gaps in data and
  recommendations for future research.

  Bangladesh has performed well in some regards, as the country supports a gender neutral legal
  and political context in a number of areas, including access to institutions. Yet, there is room for
  improvement in other realms, such as incentives for work (e.g., assistance with childcare) and
  protecting women from violence—particularly domestic violence.

  In terms of health and nutrition, Bangladesh falls behind regional averages on several key
  indicators, including adolescent fertility rates, but performs better on others, such as the rate of
  contraceptive prevalence among women who are married or in union. In education, gross female
  enrollment rates at the primary and secondary levels are higher than those of males. However,
  female labor force participation rates remain lower than those of males, for both the broader
  working age (15-64 years) and younger segments (15-24 years) of the population. Some
  indicators of voice and agency are comparable with that of regional averages, such as the
  proportion of seats held by women in national parliament and the proportion of women in
  ministerial level positions.

  Overall, there is sufficient data available to support analysis and policy direction in key
  development areas, but there is a strong need for more research. In particular, further research is
  needed on gender-based violence, as well as on economic participation (by sector).

II.      Legal and Political context26

  The World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law (2016) assesses how countries perform in terms
  of laws in the following key areas: access to institutions, using property, going to court, getting a
  job, incentives for work, building credit and protecting women from violence.

  According to the report, Bangladesh is successful in providing gender neutral laws for most areas
  which pertain to institutional access. The constitution of Bangladesh contains clauses on
  nondiscrimination and equality. While both customary and personal laws are recognized as valid
  sources of law, they are invalidated if they contradict these constitutional provisions. Women in
  Bangladesh can also apply for key government documents, including national identification cards
  and passports, in the same fashion as men. There is also no legally sanctioned gender
  discrimination in terms of choices surrounding travel, registering a business, opening a bank
  account, getting a job, pursuing a trade or profession, choosing where to live, or conferring
  citizenship to children. Moreover, married women are not required by law to obey their husbands.
  However, unlike a man, a married woman cannot confer citizenship to a non-national spouse.

   Additionally problematic, the legal responsibility for financially maintaining a family’s expenses
   is not jointly shared by married couples.

   In terms of access to property, while unmarried and married women and men have equal rights to
   property ownership, sons and daughters do not have equal rights to inherit property from their
   parents.

   In court, a woman’s testimony carries the same weight as that of a man’s. Moreover, Bangladesh
   does not recognize customary courts of law. However, it does recognize personal courts of law.

   While paid or unpaid maternity leave is mandated by law, there are no legal provisions which
   ensure paternity leave. Moreover, upon returning to the workplace, mothers are not guaranteed a
   position that is equivalent to one they held prior to taking maternity leave. Furthermore, while the
   law mandates equal remuneration for work of equal value, there are a number of legal gaps which
   can enable gender discrimination in hiring, as well as within the workplace. For example, there
   are currently no laws to prohibit gender-based discrimination in hiring or to prohibit prospective
   employers from asking about family status.27 Furthermore, laws do not prohibit the dismissal of
   pregnant workers, nor do they ensure break-time for nursing mothers or flexible/part-time
   schedules for parents.

   In terms of providing incentives to work, childcare payments are not tax deductible, nor does the
   government provide child care services or child allowances to parents. Moreover, employers are
   not mandated to provide leave time for the purpose of caring for sick relatives. Similarly, in
   access to credit, the law does not prohibit creditors from discriminating on the basis of gender or
   marital status.

   While the nation does possess legislation on domestic violence, marital rape is not explicitly
   criminalized. Similarly, while there is legislation on sexual harassment in the workplace, there are
   no civil remedies or criminal penalties prescribed for such acts. Moreover, while the law prohibits
   early or child marriage, the legal age of marriage for boys is 21, compared to 18 years for girls.

III.     Endowments: Health and Nutrition

   1. Summary of current status

   Bangladesh falls behind regional averages on several key indicators of health and nutrition. The
   adolescent fertility rate is 81 births per 1000 women, ages 15-19 (2012). This is significantly
   higher than the regional average of 39 (2012). Similarly, the percentage of pregnant women
   receiving prenatal care is 54.6 percent (2011)—lower than the regional average of 71.56 percent
   (2009). Moreover, the percentage of births attended by skilled health staff is 31.7 percent (2011),
   compared to the regional average of 49.85 percent (2010). However, Bangladesh does perform
   better on other indicators, such as the rate of contraceptive prevalence among women who are
   married or in union. This rate is 61.2 percent (2011), marginally better than the regional average
   of 52.3 percent (2010). Similarly, in 2013, the maternal mortality ratio in Bangladesh was 170
   deaths per 100,000 live births. In the same year, the regional average was 190. Details of
   Bangladesh’s health and nutrition indicators are presented alongside regional average statistics in
   Table 2.

    2. Trends through time

    Bangladesh has seen improvement in some key health indicators. The adolescent fertility rate
    decreased from 96.22 percent in 2005, to 80.59 percent in 2012. The percentage of births attended
    by skilled health staff has also increased, from 20.1 percent in 2006, to 31.7 percent in 2011.
    Furthermore, the percentage of pregnant women receiving prenatal care increased from 33.3
    percent in 2000, to 54.6 percent in 2011. Most remarkably, the under-five mortality rate for
    females decreased from 85.1 per thousand in 2000 to 38.2 per thousand in 2013. The under-five
    mortality rate for males decreased from 91 per thousand to 43.9 per thousand in the same time
    period.

 IV.    Endowments: Education

    1. Summary of current status

    The ratio of literate young females to males is 105.01 (2012). This is higher than the regional
    average of 85 (2010). Similarly, the ratio of male to female gross primary and secondary
    enrollment rates are 106.30 (2011) and 113.82 (2012), respectively, compared to regional

                                                                                                      174

   averages of 100.17 percent (2012) and 93.39 percent (2012). Additional improvement in gender
   parity is needed at the tertiary level. The ratio of female to male gross tertiary enrollment rates is
   69.03 (2012), compared to the regional average of 78.22 (2012). Females are more likely than
   males to complete education at the primary and secondary—but not tertiary—levels. The ratio of
   female to male completion rates for primary and secondary education are 114.84 percent (2011)
   and 124.34 percent (2011), respectively, compared to regional averages of 98.70 percent (2012)
   and 97.7 percent (2012). Detailed statistics on education, including the shares of female graduates
   from tertiary education, by field of study, are provided in Table 2.

      2. Trends through time

      Over time, Bangladesh has done well in maintaining and improving its performance on key
      indicators of education. The ratio of female to male literacy rates has increased from 89.71 in
      2001 to 105.01 percent in 2012, favoring females. Since 2005, the ratios of female to male
      primary and secondary enrollment have also remained consistently above 100 percent. The ratio
      of female to male tertiary education has increased from 49.37 percent in 2000, to 69.03 percent in
      2012. The ratio of female to male primary completion rates has also increased from 108.39
      percent in 2005, to 114.84 percent in 2011. The ratio of female to male lower secondary
      completion rates has also increased, from 113.24 to 124.34 percent between 2005 and 2011.

 V.       Economic Opportunity: Labor Force Participation and Employment, and Access to Finance


      1. Summary of current status

      Labor force participation rates for those in the 15-64 year age group are skewed towards males;
      the male labor force participation rate is 82.5 percent (2010), compared to 36 percent (2010) for
      females. This pattern also holds true for the 15-24 year old age group—the young female labor
      force participation rate is 38.22 percent (2010), compared to 69.5 percent (2010) for young males.
      Unemployment rates are also higher for females, with the ratio of the female unemployment rate
      over the male employment rate at 141.46 percent (2010).

      There is a higher proportion of females employed in agriculture than in industry or services; the
      share of women employed in the non-agricultural sector is 18.3 percent (2010), slightly lower
      than the regional average of 19.33 percent. A higher proportion of males are employed in
      agriculture and services than in industry. Detailed data on key indicators of economic opportunity
      are provided in Table 3.

   2. Trends through time

   Nationally, the female labor force participation rate decreased from 55.9 percent in 2000, to 36
   percent in 2010. There was also a slight decline in the male labor force participation rate, which
   decreased from 87.2 to 82.5 percent between 2000 and 2010. The labor force participation rate for
   young females also decreased from 52.5 percent to 38.22 percent in the same time period. For
   young males, their labor force participation rate decreased, but by a far less significant amount—
   moving from 71.3 to 69.5 percent between 2000 and 2010.

VI.    Voice and Agency: Political Representation and Gender-based Violence

   1. Summary of current status

   With regard to women’s political representation, Bangladesh has achieved results that are roughly
   on par with regional averages. The proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments is
   20 percent—slightly higher than the regional average of 19.3 percent. However, the proportion of
   ministerial level positions held by women is lower than that of the regional average (see Table 4).

   Research suggests that gender-based violence remains pervasive in Bangladesh. For instance,
   data from the Demographic and Health Survey (2007) indicates that almost a quarter of women
   (ages 15-49) had experienced intimate partner violence within the 12 months preceding the study.

   Agricultural land ownership data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicates
   that women account for 22.6 percent of agricultural land owners in Bangladesh. However, women
   constitute only 4.6 percent of total agricultural holders. An agricultural holder is defined as the
   civil or judicial person who makes the major decisions regarding resource use and exercises
   management control over the agricultural holding operation. This could suggest that while
   women own agricultural land, they may not necessarily make major decisions regarding its use.
   Moreover, women are the sole owners of only 10.1 percent of total agricultural land, and an even
   smaller amount (2.2 percent) own such land jointly with men. Additional details on indicators of
   voice and agency are provided in Table 4.

   2. Trends through time

   Between 2000 and 2014, the proportion of women in national parliament increased from 9.1

   been inconsistent over time, it declined sharply in the four year period between 2010 and 2014,
   from 16 to 6.7 percent. There has also been a slight increase in the proportion of female headed
   households—from 8.7 percent in 2000, to 11 percent in 2011. Furthermore, the percentage of
   women married by the age of 18 has decreased slightly, from 65.3 percent in 2000 to 64.9 percent
   in 2011.

   the percentage of pregnant women receiving prenatal care, and the percentage of births attended
   by skilled staff. Bhutan also performs well on key indicators of education, having reached near-
   gender parity in primary and secondary enrollment rates, as well as in primary and lower
   secondary completion rates. Yet, when considering employment outcomes, it is concerning that
   the labor force participation rate of young males is considerably lower than that of females in the
   same age category. However, there is no significant difference between male and female
   unemployment rates, nor between overall labor force participation rates. Compared to regional
   averages, a higher percentage of women are employed in agriculture, while a lower percentage
   are employed in industry and services.

   Furthermore, when considering regional averages, Bhutanese women comprise a lower
   percentage of the national parliament—yet they hold a higher percentage of ministerial level
   positions. Over time, Bhutan has made numerous improvements in female health, nutrition and
   education, although efforts are still needed to bolster female economic participation.

 II.     Legal and Political context29

   Bhutan is largely successful in ensuring gender-equitable access to institutions. The constitution
   contains a provision on nondiscrimination, which takes gender into account. Married and
   unmarried women can apply for a passport and national ID in the same manner as their male
   counterparts. Women can also obtain jobs, travel outside their homes, and sign contracts in the
   same fashion as men. However, a married woman cannot register a business in the same way as a
   man.

   Under Bhutanese law, married and unmarried women and men have the same rights to property
   ownership and inheritance. In court, a woman’s testimony is equal to that of a man, and the
   country does not recognize personal or customary courts of law.

   However, the law does not guarantee equal remuneration for work of equal value, nor does it
   prohibit gender-based discrimination in hiring. While prospective employers are not prohibited
   from asking about marital status, employers are prohibited from dismissing pregnant women from
   the workplace.

   Bhutan does possess legislation on domestic violence and sexual harassment. Furthermore,
   marital rape is strictly criminalized. Although the legal age for marriage is 18, laws do not
   explicitly prohibit or invalidate child marriage. There are, however, penalties for those who
   authorize or knowingly enter individuals into child or early marriage.

    Bhutan performs better than regional averages on a number of key indicators of health and
    nutrition. While female life expectancy is on par with the regional average, the under-five
    mortality rate for females remains lower than the regional average. Moreover, the average under-
    5 mortality rate for males is higher than that of females. As compared to regional averages,
    pregnant women receive more prenatal care, and more births are attended by skilled staff. As of
    2010, the nation’s contraceptive prevalence rate was also 13.3 percentage points higher than the
    regional average, at 65.6 percent. However, in 2013, the proportion of female adults with HIV
    was 44 percent, higher than the regional average of 34.27 percent. Detailed indicators on
    Bhutan’s performance in health and nutrition are provided in Table 1.

    2. Trends through time

    Over time, Bhutan has improved upon key indicators of health and nutrition for women and girls.
    The under-5 female mortality rate, measured as the number of deaths per 1,000 live births,
    decreased from 74 to 33 between 2000 and 2013. This rate has also decreased for males—falling
    from 84 to 40 in the same time period. The adolescent fertility rate, measured by the number of

                                                                                                   182

   births per 1,000 women in the 15-19 year old age range, also decreased—from approximately 80
   in 2000, to 41 in 2012. The proportion of pregnant women receiving prenatal care also increased,
   from 51 percent in 2000, to 97.5 percent in 2010. There was also an increase in the proportion of
   births attended by skilled staff; this figure rose from 24 percent in 2000, to 65 percent in 2010.
   Also notable, the maternal mortality ratio decreased from 390 to 120 between 2000 and 2013.


IV.        Endowments: Education

   1. Summary of current status

   2. Bhutan has performed well on several key indicators of education. The ratio of female to
      male enrollment rates is higher than regional averages, at both the primary and secondary
      levels. A slightly higher number of girls are completing primary school, as the ratio of female
      to male primary completion rates stands at 104.34 percent (2012)—marginally above the
      regional average of 100.17 percent. The same trend holds true at the lower secondary level,
      where the ratio of female to male completion rates is 104.44 percent (2012), compared to
      97.70 percent (2012) for the region more broadly. Details on education indicators for Bhutan
      are provided in Table 2.

      2. Trends through time

      Bhutan has improved on a number of key indicators of female educational attainment. The ratio
      of female to male gross primary enrollment rates increased from 87.47 percent in 2000, to 101.78
      percent in 2012. This gender ratio for gross secondary enrollment increased from 79.42 percent in
      2000, to 105.84 percent in 2012. Similarly, this ratio also increased at the tertiary level, moving
      from 58.07 percent in 1999, to 69.27 percent in 2012. The ratio of female to male primary
      completion rates has also improved significantly, increasing from 86.80 to 104.34 percent
      between 2000 and 2012. At the lower secondary level, this ratio increased from 75.85 percent in
      2000, to 104.44 percent in 2012.


 V.       Economic Opportunity: Labor Force Participation and Employment, and Access to Finance

      1. Summary of current status

      According to a national estimate from 2012, a higher proportion of young females participate in
      the labor force as compared to young males. The labor force participation rate for females in the
      15-24 year old age group is 35.9 percent—slightly higher than that of males (28.3 percent). Per
      the 2014 Bhutan Labor Force Survey, this trend is reversed for the broader population (15-64
      years of age). The employment to population ratio for females, ages 15-24, is higher than that of
      males in the same age group, whereas the corresponding ratio for the 15+ age group is slightly
      lower for females. Overall, Bhutan’s unemployment rate is low, and there is little variation by
      gender. Lastly, a higher percentage of employed females are self-employed workers as compared
      to males.

      Additionally, women comprise a higher percentage of those in vulnerable employment, as well as
      a higher proportion of those who are own account workers. Nationally, the proportion of women
      employed in agriculture is higher than the regional average, while rates of those employed in
      industry and services are lower. Details on indicators of economic opportunity in Bhutan are
      provided in Table 3.

   2. Trends through time

   Bhutan has shown limited improvement in terms of women’s economic participation, particularly
   when considering its performance in other sectors, including health, nutrition and education. The
   nation’s female labor force participation rate increased only slightly in recent years, moving from
   38.38 percent in 2000, to 41.54 percent in 2013. The labor force participation rate for young
   women (15-24 years of age) also decreased, from 40.9 percent in 2005, to 35.9 percent in 2012.
   Young males saw an even steeper decline; their labor force participation rate fell from 53.7 to
   28.3 percent in the same period.

   The employment to population ratio for young females decreased from 42.7 to 33.4 percent
   between 2009 and 2012, whereas the same indicator remained relatively unchanged for females in
   the 15+ age group.

   Similarly, for young males (15-24 years of age), the employment to population ratio decreased
   from 38.3 to 26.2 percent in the same period. Simultaneously, the employment to population ratio
   for males in the 15+ age group also decreased—from 70.9 to 64.4 percent. In terms of youth
   unemployment, between 2005 and 2014, rates increased for both young females and males, from
   7.2 to 10 percent, and from 5.5 to 8.6 percent, respectively.

VI.     Voice and Agency: Political Representation and Gender-based Violence

   1. Summary of current status

   The proportion of seats held by women in Bhutanese national parliament is 8.5 percent—lower
   than the regional average of 19.34 percent. Yet, the proportion of women in ministerial level
   positions is 10 percent, which is slightly above the regional average (7.06 percent). Currently,
   Bhutan does not possess data on the prevalence, nor on the acceptance of gender-based violence.
   Details on indicators of voice and agency are provided in Table 4.

   2. Trends through time

   Bhutan has increased the proportion of total female legislators, senior officials, and managers
   from 14.36 percent in 2005, to 26.67 percent in 2011. However, this percentage was significantly
   higher—49.23 percent—in the preceding year (2010). It has also increased the proportion of
   women in ministerial level positions, from 0 in 2005, to 10 in 2014. The proportion of seats held
   by women in national parliament has also varied over time, from 9.3 percent (2000), to 2.7
   percent (2006), and most recently, 8.5 percent (2014).


VII.    Data and Knowledge Gaps -- areas for more research

   Like most countries in South Asia, Bhutan would benefit from further research on gender-based
   violence. There is also a strong need for additional data on access to finance. Aside from these
   two deficiencies, Bhutan currently possesses data in many key dimensions of development,
   including health and nutrition, education, and economic opportunity. This data is sufficient to
   support analysis and policy development within these areas.

                          Annex G4. Country Gender Statistical Profile: India


I.     Introduction

  This country gender profile seeks to provide an overview of the situation of women and men in
  India, based on internationally comparable data. Following the framework of the WDR 2012,
  Gender Equality and Development, this profile covers, in addition to the nation’s legal and
  political context, the situation of women and men in the key areas of endowments (health,
  nutrition and education), economic opportunity (labor force participation, employment and access
  to finance), and voice and agency (political representation and gender-based violence). For each
  of these key areas, the profile provides a summary of India’s current status and identifies the main
  trends that have occurred over time. The profile also identifies key data and knowledge gaps that
  pose a challenge to understanding and addressing gender inequalities in the nation.

II.    Legal and Political context30

  The Constitution of India guarantees equal rights to women and men; it contains a clause against
  discrimination on the basis of gender. The constitution also mandates a 33% quota for women in
  local government. Both women and men, whether married or unmarried, can apply for a passport,
  travel outside their home or the country, obtain a job or pursue a trade or profession, register a
  business, open a bank account, choose were to live, confer citizenship to their children, and
  legally head a household or a family. In court of law, India utilizes a system of personal law, and
  women’s and men’s testimony carry the same evidentiary weight.

  The default marital property regime is the separation of property31 and the original owner
  administers his/her marital property. Married and unmarried women and men have equal rights to
  own property and to inherit assets from their parents.

  The state does not explicitly provide incentives for women to work: childcare payments are not
  deductible, there are no childcare tax deductions, the government does not support or provide
  childcare services or a childcare allowance for parents, and most employers do not provide leave
  time so that individuals can provide care for sick relatives. Indian law mandates paid maternity
  leave of 84 days, with the employer paying for 100% of wages during that time.

  There are no incentives or support for building credit. Retailers, utility companies and
  microfinance institutions do not provide information to private credit bureaus or public credit
  registries. In terms of access to credit, laws do not prohibit creditors from discriminating on the
  basis of gender or marital status.

  30 Women, Business, and the Law (2016)
  31
     According to Women, Business and the Law (2016), “all assets and income acquired by the spouses both
  before they marry and during the marriage remain the separate property of the acquiring spouse. At the
  time of divorce or the death of one of the spouses, each spouse retains ownership of all assets and income
  brought to the marriage or acquired during marriage by that person and any value that has accrued to that
  property (IFC 2016).”



                                                                                                         188
    Annex G4: India                                                              Country Gender Profile



    Laws prohibit gender-based discrimination in hiring, as well as the dismissal of pregnant workers.
    Employers are also required to provide break time for nursing mothers. Yet, current laws do not
    mandate equal remunerations for work of equal value, prohibit prospective employers from
    asking about family status, guarantee mothers an equivalent position after maternity leave, or
    entitle parents to flexible/part-time work schedules. While non-pregnant and non-nursing women
    are permitted to work the same night hours as men, there are a myriad of restrictions on which
    types of work they may engage in. For instance, they cannot work in mining, metalworking, in
    jobs that require lifting weights above a certain threshold, or in those deemed hazardous or
    morally or socially inappropriate.

    India’s legislation on domestic violence prescribes clear criminal penalties to offenders, and
    furthermore, the country possesses a specialized court and procedures to address cases of
    domestic violence. Domestic violence legislation covers physical, sexual, emotional and
    economic violence, and protects family members, former spouses, and unmarried intimate
    partners. Protection orders for domestic violence provide for the removal of the perpetrator from
    the home. Further, they prohibit the perpetrator’s contact with the survivor, and ensure that they
    maintain a geographic distance from them. However, there is no legislation which explicitly
    criminalizes marital rape.

    The legal age of marriage in India is 21 years for boys, and 18 years for girls. The law prohibits
    or invalidates child or early marriage, and there are penalties for those who authorize or
    knowingly enter an individual into child or early marriage.

 III.   Endowments: Health and Nutrition

    1. Summary of current status

    Available data indicates that while there has been significant progress towards achieving gender
    equality, significant gaps still exist, particularly with regard to health outcomes. The sex ratio at
    birth is strongly skewed towards boys, revealing a strong preference for sons. Further, early
    marriage remains a significant concern; close to half of Indian women were married before the
    age of 18. The under-five mortality rate is higher for girls than for boys, and overall, it is higher
    than the regional average. Fewer than half of all children between the ages of 12 and 23 months
    are vaccinated—evidence shows that girls are approximately 5 percentage points less likely to be
    vaccinated. There is a high prevalence of malnutrition (both wasting and stunting) among both
    girls and boys, although it is higher for girls. Additionally problematic, only about half of all
    births are attended by skilled staff.

    2. Trends through time

    Over time, women’s and girls’ health and nutrition have improved. With regard to mortality rates,
    the under-five mortality rate for girls dropped from 96.2 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000, to
    54.7 in 2013. The maternal mortality ratio decreased from 370 deaths per 100,000 live births in
    2000 to only 190 in 2013. Similarly, fertility rates have improved; the total fertility rate (number
    of births per woman) dropped from 3.15 in 2000 to 2.51 in 2012, and between 2000 and 2012, the
    adolescent fertility rate fell dramatically, from 78.86 to 33 births per 1,000 women, ages 15-19.
    Despite such improvements, sex ratios have worsened slightly—increasing from 1.06 in 1962, to
    1.11 in 2012.

    Although pregnant women have increased access to healthcare services, additional improvement
    is needed. Between 2000 and 2008, the proportion of pregnant women receiving prenatal care
    increased by almost 10 percentage points (from 65.8 to 75.2 percent), and the proportion of births
    attended by skilled health staff increased from 42.5 to 52.3 percent.

    Another concern is the persistently high level of malnutrition among girls under five, which is
    typically worse than that experienced by boys. Between 1992 and 2006, girls’ malnutrition
    (weight for age) declined by only 5 percentage points, from 48.8 to 43.9 percent, and stunting
    (height for age) only dropped from 55.7 to 48 percent. Furthermore, the proportion of female



                                                                                                      190

   adults with HIV actually increased—from 34.3 percent in 1999, to 38.7 percent in 2013. This
   figure is higher than the regional average of 34.3 percent.

IV.     Endowments: Education

   1. Summary of current status

   Girls are performing as well or better than boys in terms of primary school enrollment and
   completion, and gender disparities have further shrunk as enrollment has expanded at the
   secondary and tertiary levels. Despite significant progress, girls still lag behind boys in secondary
   school enrollment and completion rates, and differentials are even starker at the tertiary level.

     Between 1988 and 2011, India has made remarkable progress towards eliminating gender
     disparities in educational enrollment at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. The ratio of
     female to male gross enrollment rates increased from 74.3 to 102.30 at the primary level, from
     55.8 to 94 at the secondary level, and from 50.1 to 78.13 at the tertiary level. These improvements
     occurred alongside the substantial expansion of educational enrollment; the proportion of the
     population enrolled in school increased considerably between 1988 and 2013—from 89 percent to
     114.06 percent at the primary level (2012), 37 percent to 71.47 percent at the secondary level
     (2012), and 5 percent to 24.69 percent at the tertiary level (2013).

     In terms of completion rates, the gap between girls and boys has also fallen at all levels and, in
     fact, reversed slightly at the primary level. The boy-girl gap in primary completion rates has
     almost disappeared—declining from 24 in 1988, to -0.25 in 2011. The ratio of female to male
     lower secondary completion rates also moved closer to parity, reaching 98 percent in 2011, from
     56 percent in 1988.

V.       Economic Opportunity: Labor Force Participation and Employment, and Access to Finance

     1. Summary of current status

     According to official statistics, only 56 percent of the age-relevant population participates in the
     labor force, which is quite low. Women constitute only 24 percent of the official and counted
     labor force. In fact, the labor force participation rate for males between 15 and 64 years of age is
     78.8 percent, whereas the female labor force participation rate for the same age group is 27.2
     percent. Moreover, the male employment to population ratios are higher than that of females for
     both the 15+ and 15-24 year old age groups (see Table 3). Official statistics report very low levels
     of unemployment: 3.6 percent in total, with 3.4 percent for males and 4.0 percent for females.
     These results may not reflect the full extent of unemployment or underemployment in the
     country.

     Women and men more or less follow the same pattern for type and status of employment. Both
     are most likely to be self-employed or own-account workers, which may not be fully captured in
     official statistics on formal employment. Next, they are both likely to be contributing family
     workers, which is close to three times as common among women (34 percent) than among men
     (11 percent), followed by wage and salaried jobs, which are more common among men (19
     percent) than among women (15 percent). Both women and men are unlikely to be employers
     (approximately 1 percent of employed men and 0.4 percent of employed women). Moreover,
     most of the economically active population (80.8 percent) holds vulnerable jobs, which lack
     stability, benefits and decent working conditions; women are more likely to occupy vulnerable
     jobs than men: 85 percent, compared to 79.3 percent for men (2010).

     Women and men also follow the same pattern with regards to sector of employment. Close to half
     of all workers are employed in agriculture, where women are more likely to work than men—60
     percent, as compared to 43 percent. In fact, the proportion of women working in agriculture is
     greater than the combined proportions of those working in services and industry. Close to a third
     of women and men work in services, which employs more men than women—31 percent, as
     compared to 19.5 percent. Around 25 percent of the overall population works in industry, where
     men are also more likely to to be employed than women—26 percent, as compared to 20.7
     percent. Overall, women occupy less than 20 percent of jobs in the nonagricultural wage sector
     (19.3 percent), which is dominated by men (80.7 percent).



                                                                                                     192

   Available data shows large differences between women and men in access to and use of finance.
   In 2011, 44 percent of males—but only 26 percent of women—had an account in a formal
   institution. Further, 6 percent of males—but only about 2 percent of females—used their accounts
   for business purposes. With regard to debit and credit cards, India’s patterns roughly mirror
   regional averages: 12 percent of males and only around 5 percent of females have a debit card,
   and very few men (2.5%)—and even fewer women (1.0%)—have a credit card. However, women
   comprise 86 percent of microfinance borrowers.32

   2. Trends through time

   There are worrying trends in labor force participation, particularly for women. India’s female
   labor force participation rate among those ages 15 to 64 fell from 36 percent in 1994, to 27.2
   percent in 2012, and their overall share of the labor force fell from 28.3 to 24.3 percent in the
   same time period. This pattern was observed for all types of employment, except for wage and
   salaried employment, where the percentage of females employed rose from 8.2 to 14.5 percent

                                                                                                   194
   Annex G4: India                                                                  Country Gender Profile


   between 1994 and 2010. Alternatively, there was a much more modest decrease in labor force
   participation for males—from 84 percent in 1994, to 74.4 percent in 2013.

   These trends in labor force participation also hold true for youth, ages 15-24. The labor force
   participation rate for young females declined from 29.8 percent to 17.5 percent between 1994 and
   2012. In the same period, it declined from 66.7 percent to 49.5 percent for males.

   Between 1994 and 2014, there was also a shift in the sectoral distribution of employed women.
   Women’s employment in agriculture fell from 72.4 percent to 60 percent, while their presence
   rose in industry (12.4 to 20.7 percent) and in services (15.3 to 19.5 percent).

VI.     Voice and Agency: Political Representation and Gender-based Violence

   1. Summary of current status

   The proportion of Indian women in positions of political power is approximately 10 percent, and
   reaches almost 14 percent when including senior officials and managers. This reflects the overall
   pattern for the region. Agricultural landownership data from the Food and Agriculture
   Organization (FAO) shows that females comprise only 12.8 percent of agricultural land holders in
   India (2010-11) (Table 4).

   Early marriage is a problem in India, where in 2010, close to half of all women—47.4 percent—
   were married before the age of 18 (the official legal age of marriage for women). This may
   explain in part why intimate partner violence tends to be even more prevalent among adolescent
   girls (15 to 18 years old) than among adult women.33 Moreover, 24 percent of women had
   suffered physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner (DHS 2006).

   It is also important to note that approximately one third of women believe that a husband is
   justified in beating his wife when she argues with him, when she goes out without telling him, or
   when she neglects the children. Around 20 percent of surveyed women believe that such abuse is
   justified when they burn food, and 14 percent believe it is justified when they refuse to have sex
   with their husbands.

   2. Trends through time

   The proportion of women in positions of political power or in managing positions has remained
   relatively constant, fluctuating between 14 and 15 percent between 1994 and 2010. The
   proportion of households headed by women rose slightly—from 9.2 percent in 1993, to 14.4
   percent in 2006. The proportion of women married by the age of 18 also fell slightly, from 50.2
   percent in 1993, to 47.4 percent in 2006. Attitudes towards violence against women were
   measured only once, in 2006, so it is not possible to determine whether they have changed over
   time.

VII.    Data and Knowledge Gaps -- areas for more research

   India possesses data for 36 of the 47 indicators that were considered as part of this set of country
   gender profiles. Despite the availability of data for most indicators, a number of gaps remain. For
   instance, there is a need for research on the percentage of tertiary graduates by field of study, the
   number of firms with female managers or owners, women’s share of employment in agriculture,
   industry and services, and on violence against women (as perpetrated by someone other than an
   intimate partner). For some indicators, data was only available for one point in time, negating the
   possibility of measuring changes over time. Finally, data for some of the indicators was last
   collected around 2000 or 2005, which prevents policy makers from understanding recent trends.



   34
     The distribution of agricultural holders is calculated as (number of female agricultural holders/total
   agricultural holders)*100. An agricultural holder is defined as the civil or judicial person who makes the

Furthermore, official statistics do not capture and report the full extent of women’s and men’s
employment. In particular, they do not acknowledge the magnitude of women’s economic
contributions. Countries in South Asia, as well as many countries in other regions, do not collect
data on, for example, informal and unpaid work, time spent on remunerated and non-remunerated
activities, asset ownership and control (including land ownership and urban property), or
participation in decision-making at the local level.

I.      Introduction

  The Maldives has performed well on numerous indicators of health and nutrition. As compared to
  regional averages, it has recorded a higher female life expectancy and lower fertility rates. Nearly
  100% of pregnant women receive prenatal care and almost all births are attended by skilled staff.
  The Maldives has achieved near parity in figures of primary and secondary enrollment and
  completion. However, a higher percentage of women are enrolling in tertiary education, as
  evidenced by data from 2008. Improvement is needed on indicators of economic opportunity; in
  particular, female labor force participation rates lag behind those of men. More research is needed
  on economic opportunity (especially regarding the distribution of employment by sector), access
  to finance, and gender-based violence.

II.     Legal and Political context35

  The Constitution of the Maldives protects the rights of women and men. It contains a clause on
  nondiscrimination that mentions gender, as well as a clause on equality. The constitution does not
  recognize personal or customary law as valid sources of law. All married and unmarried women
  and men have equal rights to apply for a passport, obtain a national identification card, travel
  outside their home or outside the country, obtain a job or pursue a profession, sign a contract,
  register a business, open a bank account, and choose where to live. Married and unmarried
  women have the same right as men to confer citizenship on their children or on a non-national
  spouse, and are not required by law to obey their husbands. However, there are no quotas for
  female representatives in parliament, local government or corporate boards, or for women in
  candidate lists for national or local elections. Married and unmarried women and men have equal
  ownership rights to property, and female and male surviving spouses, as well as sons and
  daughters, have equal rights to inherit assets. The constitutional court has 7 judges, none of which
  are currently women. Moreover, a woman’s testimony carries the same evidentiary weight in
  court as a man’s. Further, personal courts of law are recognized, but not customary courts.

  The Maldives provides some incentives for women to work, as well as job protection. Yet,
  childcare payments are not deductible, there are no childcare tax deductions or credits specific to
  men or women, nor does the government support or provide childcare services or a childcare
  allowance for parents. However, most employers do provide leave so that employees are able to
  care for sick relatives, and the government does support or provide free and compulsory primary
  education. The law also mandates paid or unpaid maternity leave of 60 days, with the employer
  paying for 100% of benefits and 100% of wages during this period, as well as paid or unpaid
  paternity leave (3 days) and parental leave (up to 365 days). Employers are required to provide
  break time for nursing mothers, and are prohibited from dismissing pregnant workers.

  The law prohibits gender-based discrimination in hiring and guarantees mothers an equivalent
  position of employment after returning from maternity leave. Unfortunately, current laws do not
  mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value, entitle parents to flexible/part-time
  schedules, or prohibit prospective employers from asking about family status. Both women and
  men can retire with full or partial benefits at the age of 65, although there is no mandatory
  retirement age.

    There are no restrictions on the types of jobs that non-pregnant and non-nursing women can
    perform. They can work in the same occupations and perform the same jobs and job-related tasks
    as men, in addition to working the same night hours.

    The Maldives does not provide incentives for building credit. The law does not prohibit
    discrimination by creditors on the basis of gender or marital status and retailers, utility
    companies, and microfinance institutions do not provide information to private credit bureaus or
    public registries.

    The Maldives possesses domestic violence legislation with clear criminal penalties, and there
    exists a specialized court and procedure for addressing cases of domestic violence. The legislation
    covers physical, sexual, emotional, and economic violence, and protects family members, former
    spouses, and unmarried intimate partners. There are protection orders for domestic violence that
    provide for the removal of the perpetrator from the home. Further, they prohibit the perpetrator’s
    contact with the survivor, and ensure that they maintain a geographic distance from them.
    Moreover, marital rape is explicitly criminalized in the Maldives and a rape perpetrator is not
    exempt from penalty if they marry the victim. However, there is no legislation to prescribe
    criminal penalties for sexual harassment, whether in places of employment or education, or in
    public places more broadly.

    The legal age of marriage in the Maldives is 18 years, for both boys and girls. There are currently
    some exemptions to the legal age of marriage, and the law does not prohibit child or early
    marriage. Yet, there are penalties for those who authorize or knowingly enter an individual into
    child or early marriage.

 III.   Endowments: Health and Nutrition

    1. Summary of current status

    Maldives’ health indicators are mostly favorable to women, and are among the best in the region.
    In 2012, life expectancy was slightly higher for women (78.65) than for men (76.55 years). The
    nation’s female life expectancy is also higher than the regional average (68.25 years). Under-five
    mortality rates are slightly lower for females than for males, and these rates are also significantly
    lower than regional averages. Fertility rates are lower than regional averages, for both the overall
    population as well as among adolescents. It is particularly notable that nearly all pregnant women
    receive prenatal care, and that most births (94.8 percent) are attended by skilled staff, compared
    to regional averages of 71.55 and 50 percent, respectively. The maternal mortality ratio for the
    Maldives—31 deaths per 100,000 live births—is significantly lower than the regional average of
    190. Rates of malnutrition do not differ significantly by gender, and over 90% of children ages
    12-23 months have received specific vaccines. These, as well as other key indicators of health
    and nutrition in the Maldives, are provided in Table 1.

    2. Trends through time

    Since 1977, the sex ratio has remained relatively constant, around 1.06 male births per each
    female birth. The most recently recorded under-five mortality rate—8.8 for girls and 10.8 for
    boys (2013)—is almost one tenth of what it was in 1990 (87.6 for girls and 99.10 for boys), and is
    now even slightly lower for girls than for boys. Overall, malnutrition (weight for age) has
    dropped by almost half, from 32.5 percent in 1994, to 17.80 percent in 2009. This drop of was
    experienced proportionally by both girls and boys, declining from 31.9 to 17.2 percent for girls,
    and from 33.2 to 18.4 percent for boys, between 1994 and 2009.

    The total fertility rate also improved, decreasing from 6.93 births per woman in 1977 to 2.29 in
    2012. The age at first marriage also increased by almost 5 years for women (from 17.5 years in
    1977, to 22.4 years in 2009) and by 4 years for men (from 22.4 years in 1977, to 26.4 years in
    2006). The proportion of pregnant women receiving prenatal care increased from 81 percent in
    2001 to 99.10 percent in 2009. Additionally, the proportion of births attended by skilled staff
    increased slightly, from 90 percent in 1994, to 94.8 percent in 2009. These improvements are
    reflected in the maternal mortality ratio, which declined drastically—from 430 to 31 maternal
    deaths per 100,000 live births between 1990 and 2013. However, the proportion of female adults
    with HIV increased from 21 percent in 1990, to 24 percent in 2013.

   1. Summary of current status

   The Maldives has performed exceptionally well in terms of achieving gender parity on key
   indicators of education. There is now an equal number of literate young females and males; the
   ratio of female to male gross primary enrollment rates is 100 percent (2009). Ratios of female to
   male gross secondary and tertiary enrollment rates are highly skewed towards females: the
   secondary enrollment ratio is 112.75 (2004), while the tertiary ratio is 112.55 (2008). Both figures
   are much higher than the regional averages of 93.39 (2012) for secondary enrollment and 78.22
   (2012) for tertiary enrollment. Completion rates in the Maldives are close to parity: the female to
   male completion ratio at the primary level is 90.77% (2009), and the corresponding ratio at the
   tertiary level is 121.95% (2008)—favoring girls.

   2. Trends through time

   The female to male youth literacy ratio in the Maldives dropped from 103.6 percent (1977) to 100
   percent (1990), and has remained relatively constant since then. The ratio of female to male gross
   primary enrollment rates has also remained close to parity, decreasing from 100.04 percent in
   1992, to 97.35 percent in 2009. At the secondary level, the ratio of female to male gross

                                                                                                         201
      Annex G5: Maldives                                                         Country Gender Profile


      enrollment rates rose from 59.91 to 112.75 percent between 1970 and 2008. The ratio of female
      to male gross tertiary enrollment rates also moved towards parity, moving from 228.83 percent in
      2003—highly skewed towards girls—to 112.55 percent in 2007.

      Both female and male primary school completion rates have remained consistently high in the
      Maldives. Yet, according to data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, between
      1997 and 2009, female gross primary completion rates decreased from 121.08 to 104.41 percent,
      while male rates also dropped slightly, from 122.33 to 115.05 percent. The ratio of female to male
      primary completion rates also dropped, from 98.98 percent in 1977, to 90.77 percent in 2009.
      Further, the boy-girl gap in primary completion rates (boy minus girl rates) grew from 1.25
      percentage points in 1997—close to parity—to 10.61 percentage points in 2009. This trend may
      reflect increasing gender inequality, or the fact that girls are more likely than boys to complete
      primary school at the standard age level. Data for gross secondary completion rates was collected
      for the first time in 2005, 2006, and 2007, hence it is not possible to assess trends over time for
      this indicator.


 V.       Economic Opportunity: Labor Force Participation and Employment, and Access to Finance

      1. Summary of current status

      Improvement is needed in the area of economic opportunity. Female labor force participation
      rates are lower than those of males, and unemployment rates are higher for women. Further, close
      to one half of employed females—but only one-fifth of males—are engaged in vulnerable
      employment. According to ILO estimates, the female employment to population ratio is lower
      than that of males, for both the 15+ and 15-24 year old age groups.

      There are also differences in the type (status) of employment held by women and men. Over 50
      percent of employed women are self-employed, 45 percent engage in wage and salaried work,
      and 24.1 percent are employed in own-account work. Additionally, 22.9% are contributing family
      workers, and a mere one percent are employers. Employed males are most likely to be wage and
      salaried workers (61%), followed by self-employed workers (29%). They are much less likely to
      be own-account workers (11.6%) or contributing family workers (7.9%), but are roughly four
      times more likely than women to be employers (4.8%).

      Although data on the sectoral distribution of Maldivian workers is outdated, such data generally
      indicates that over half of women and almost two thirds of men work in services; almost one third
      of women and 20 percent of men work in industry; and only 7 percent of women—but 14 percent
      of men—work in agriculture.

    2. Trends through time

    From 1990 onwards, there have been a number of important changes in labor force participation
    and employment in the Maldives. Many of these changes have occurred along gender lines.
    Between 1990 and 2010, women’s share of the total labor force rose from 19 to 42 percent, and
    the ratio of female to male labor force participation rates increased from 26 to 72 percent. This
    trend was even more pronounced among young workers (15-24 years of age), where the ratio of
    female to male labor force participation rates rose from 26 to 82 percent.

    Between 2005 and 2013, the employment to population ratio for female youth has remained
    steady at around 30 percent. The same ratio also remained consistent for young males—48
    percent—in the same period. During this time, the female employment to population ratio for the
    15+ age category increased from 39.1 to 45.9 percent, and for males, the same indicator increased
    from 68.9 to 72.3 percent.

 VI.    Voice and Agency: Political Representation and Gender-based Violence

    1. Summary of current status

    The proportion of women holding seats in Maldivian national parliament is 6.8 percent—much
    lower than the regional average of 19.34 percent (2014). However, the proportion of women
    holding ministerial level positions is much higher than the regional average, at 17.6 and 7.6
    percent, respectively. More than one-third of households are headed by women, and the
    proportion of women married by the age of 18 is quite low in comparison to that of other
    countries in the region. Also, the proportion of women who believe a husband is justified in
    beating his wife (as the result of a number of different situations) is lower than that of other South
    Asian countries.

   2. Trends through time

   The proportion of women in Maldivian national parliament has fluctuated between 6.3 percent
   (1990) and 12 percent (2005-2008), though it currently stands at 6.8 percent (2014). The
   proportion of women in ministerial positions increased from 12 percent in 2005, to 17.6 percent
   in 2014. No trends can be reported for other indicators; available data points are generally too
   close in time to permit such an assessment.

VII.   Data and Knowledge Gaps -- areas for more research

   In order to support policy research and development, the Maldives requires new or updated data
   in a number of areas. There is currently a lack of recent data on several key indicators of
   education and employment. Further, there is a lack of data on access to finance, and a strong need
   for new research and data on the overall prevalence of gender-based violence.

I.      Introduction

  With regard to indicators of gender equality, Nepal performs better than most other countries in
  South Asia. The nation’s health and nutrition indicators reveal small differences between women
  and men. As compared to regional averages, Nepal also performs particularly well in education,
  exceeding primary, secondary and tertiary enrollment ratios, as well as primary and secondary
  completion rates. Most indicators of economic opportunity indicate limited gender gaps. With
  regard to political participation, Nepal also exceeds regional averages.

II.     Legal and Political context36

  Nepal’s constitution protects the rights of women and men. A constitutional clause on
  nondiscrimination encompasses gender, and further, there is a clause on equality. Married and
  unmarried women and men have equal rights to apply for a passport, travel outside their home or
  outside the country, obtain a job or pursue a trade or profession, sign a contract, register a
  business, open a bank account, and choose where to live. Yet, women cannot confer citizenship
  on their children or on a non-national spouse, nor can they be heads of household or family in the
  same way as men. With regard to political participation, there are quotas for female
  representatives on candidate lists in national elections (33%) and on candidate lists in local
  elections (40%). In terms of law and courts, the law recognizes personal law, but not customary
  courts, and in court, women and men’s testimony carry the same evidentiary weight.

  In terms of inheritance rights, both married and unmarried women and men have equal rights to
  own property. However, neither female and male surviving spouses nor sons and daughters have
  equal rights to inherit assets.

  Nepal does not provide incentives for women to work. For instance, childcare payments are not
  deductible, there are no childcare tax deductions or credits specific to men or women, and the
  government does not support or provide childcare services or a childcare allowance for parents.
  Similarly, the government does not provide free and compulsory primary education. However,
  Nepali law mandates paid maternity leave of 52 days, with the employer paying for 100 percent
  of benefits and 100 percent of wages during this period. Further, laws require that employers
  provide break time for nursing mothers.

  Yet, laws do not mandate nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring, guarantee equal
  remuneration for work of equal value, or guarantee mothers an equivalent position after maternity
  leave. Additionally, parents are not entitled to flexible or part-time schedules, and most
  employers do not provide leave so that employees can care for sick relatives. Laws do not
  prohibit the dismissal of pregnant workers, nor do they prohibit prospective employers from
  asking about family status.

  Other than being prohibited from working the same night hours, non-pregnant and non-nursing
  women can work in the same occupations and complete the same job-related tasks as men,
  including working in jobs deemed arduous, hazardous or morally or socially inappropriate. This
  includes jobs in construction, factories, mining and metalworking.

   Nepal does not provide incentives for building credit. The law does not prohibit creditors from
   discriminating on the basis of gender or marital status. Additionally, retailers, utility companies
   and microfinance institutions do not provide information to private credit bureaus or public
   registries.

   The nation possesses domestic violence legislation, which prescribes clear criminal penalties for
   offenders, and there is a specialized court and procedure for addressing cases of domestic
   violence. This legislation encompasses physical, sexual, emotional and economic violence, and
   protects family members but not former spouses or unmarried intimate partners. Protection orders
   for domestic violence provide for the removal of the perpetrator from the home. Further, they
   prohibit the perpetrator’s contact with the survivor, and ensure that they maintain a geographic
   distance from them. While there is legislation to address sexual harassment, there are currently no
   provisions that specifically cover instances of sexual harassment in places of employment or
   education, or in public places more broadly. Nepal also possesses legislation that explicitly
   criminalizes marital rape.

   The legal age of marriage in Nepal is 20 years, for both girls and boys. The law does not
   explicitly prohibit or invalidate child or early marriage, but there are penalties for individuals who
   authorize or knowingly enter an individual into child or early marriage.

III.    Endowments: Health and Nutrition

   1. Summary of current status

   Nepal performs well in terms of health and nutrition indicators, but improvement is needed with
   regard to several key indicators of reproductive health. The adolescent fertility rate is 74 births
   per 1000 women—considerably higher than the regional average of 39. This is likely associated
   with the high prevalence of child marriage in Nepal, which in 2011 stood at 40.7 percent among
   women ages 20-24. In addition, the percentage of pregnant women receiving prenatal care is
   lower than the regional average, as is the percentage of births attended by skilled staff. Female
   life expectancy is on par with the regional average, and malnutrition rates do not differ by gender.
   Rates of contraceptive prevalence among women who are married or in a union are also close to
   the regional average, and the proportion of adult women with HIV is below the regional average.
   Additional details on health and nutrition indicators are provided in Table 1.

   2. Trends through time

   Over time, Nepal has shown improvement in most indicators of health. The sex ratio at birth
   remained relatively constant from 1972 to 1990—at 1.05 male births per each female birth—but
   increased to 1.07 by 2013. The total fertility rate dropped by more than half, from 5.96 births per
   woman in 1971, to 2.39 in 2012. Age at first marriage increased for both females and males, from
   17.50 years for women and 21.10 for men in 1971, to 19.90 and 23.70 years in 2011, respectively.
   In the decade between 1991 and 2011, both the proportion of women receiving prenatal care and
   the proportion of births attended by skilled staff increased immensely: the percentage of women
   receiving prenatal care increased from 15.4 to 58.80 percent, and the percentage of births
   attended by skilled health staff grew from 7.40 to 36.00 percent. Perhaps as a consequence, the
   maternal mortality ratio dropped from 790 to 190 deaths per 100,000 births between 1990 and
   2013.

   Between 1990 and 2013, under-five mortality rates dropped from 141.60 deaths for females and
   143 deaths for males (per 1000 births), to 37.20 deaths for women and 42.10 for males.
   Malnutrition rates also declined for both girls and boys, between 1975 and 2011, with no
   significant difference by sex. Under five malnutrition, weight for age, declined from 60.30 to
   28.40 percent for girls, and from 61.30 to 29.80 percent for boys. Malnutrition, height for age,
   dropped from 75.10 to 39.5 percent for girls, and from 74.60 to 41.30 percent for boys. Moreover,
   the proportion of females with HIV also dropped from 36.20 percent in 1990, to 21.40 percent in
   2013.

IV.     Endowments: Education

   1. Summary of current status

                                                                                                  208

   Nepal has also reduced a number of gender gaps in education. Its education indicators display
   higher ratios of female to male primary and secondary enrollment rates as compared to regional
   averages (see Table 2), although the ratios above 100 suggest the presence of gender disparities
   that specifically benefit women. The ratios of female to male gross enrollment rates are 108.19
   and 105.24 percent, at the primary and secondary levels, respectively, as compared to regional
   averages of 100 and 93 percent. At the tertiary level, the corresponding ratio is also higher in
   Nepal (64 percent) as compared to the regional average (78 percent). Nepal also performs well
   with regard to ratios of female to male completion rates, at both the primary and lower secondary
   levels: the ratio of female to male primary completion rates is 110.85 as compared to 100.17
   percent for the region, and the ratio of secondary completion rates is 108.39, also higher than the
   regional average (97.70 percent).

   2. Trends through time

   Within the past 30 years, Nepal has made remarkable progress towards achieving gender equality
   in education. The female to male youth literacy ratio (ages 15-24) increased from 33.19 percent in
   1981, to 86.81 percent in 2011. The ratio of female to male gross primary enrollment rates rose
   from 21.61 percent in 1972, to 108.19 percent in 2013. The ratio of female to male gross
   secondary enrollment rates rose from 21.1 in 1972, to 105.24 percent in 2013. Further, the ratio of
   female to male tertiary enrollment rates increased from 27.32 in 1976, to 63.69 percent in 2011,

                                                                                                         209
      Annex G6: Nepal                                                            Country Gender Profile


      although improvement is still needed in order to reach parity. Completion ratios also moved
      towards parity in the 22 year period between 1992 and 2014, though indicators now reveal a
      disparity benefitting women. The ratio of female to male primary completion rates rose from
      57.68 to 110.85 percent, while the corresponding ratio at the lower secondary level increased
      from 52.24 to 108.39 percent.


 V.       Economic Opportunity: Labor Force Participation and Employment, and Access to Finance

      1. Summary of current status

      Female labor force participation rates in Nepal are comparable to those of men. A larger share of
      women, however, are self-employed and are more likely to be employed as own account workers.
      While a majority of both women and men hold vulnerable jobs, women are 21 percentage points
      more likely than men to hold such jobs. Youth employment to population ratios are comparable
      for both females and males, however, employment to population ratios for those ages 15+ are
      lower for females as compared to males. Additionally, while data on the sectoral distribution of
      employment is relatively outdated, it shows that both women and men are more likely be
      employed in agriculture rather than in industry or services.

      In terms of access to finance, a lower percentage of women hold accounts at a financial institution
      as compared to men, and their rates are lower than the regional average. Men are also more likely
      than women to use their account for business purposes (4 and 2.02 percent, respectively), yet the
      percentage of women in Nepal who use their account for business purposes still exceeds the
      regional average (1.71 percent).

    2. Trends through time

    Analysis of national estimates suggests that female labor force participation has increased, from
    48.7 percent in 1991, to 79.4 percent in 2010. The male labor force participation rate increased
    from approximately 80 to 90 percent between 1991 and 2003, but dropped back to 80 percent in
    2010. Also, between 1990 and 2013, women’s share of the labor force increased from 47.42 to
    50.94 percent, and according to national estimates, the ratio of female to male labor force

                                                                                                   211

   participation rates improved—increasing from 61 to 80.9 percent between 1991 and 2010.
   Among young workers (ages 15-24), as per modeled ILO estimates, the ratio of female to male
   labor force participation rates rose from 93.11 to 98.29 percent between 1990 and 2013.

   The total youth employment to population ratio declined slightly, from roughly 74 to 72 percent,
   between 2005 and 2013. The employment to population ratio for females (ages 15+) remained
   relatively consistent between 2005 and 2013, at around 78 percent, while the corresponding ratio
   for males declined slightly—from 87 to 85 percent—in the same time period. Available data on
   type and sector of employment were collected only once, in 2001, so it is not possible to establish
   trends over time for these particular indicators. Similarly, no trends can be established with regard
   to access to finance, as there has only been one round of data collection, also in 2011.


VI.    Voice and Agency: Political Representation and Gender-based Violence

   1. Summary of current status

   With regard to indicators of voice and agency, Nepal exceeds regional averages. The proportions
   of seats held by women in national parliament and by women in ministerial level positions both
   exceed regional averages. In the domestic sphere, however, over 40 percent of women were
   married by the age of 18, and 28 percent are heads of household. Agricultural land ownership
   data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicates that females comprise 8.1
   percent of agricultural land holders in Nepal (2002) (Table 4). More recent data shows that the
   incidence of female agricultural land ownership (sole or jointly documented ownership) is around
   10 percent. In terms of gender-based violence, 14.3 percent of women reported to have
   experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a 12 month period. Very
   small proportions of women (less than 10%) believe that violence by a spouse is justified, except
   in instances when they neglect their children.

   2. Trends through time

   The proportion of seats held by women in national parliament has increased substantially in the
   past few decades. Over time, it increased from 6.1 percent (1990) to 5.9 percent (2001), and later
   to 33.2 percent (2011-2013) and 29.9 percent in 2014. The proportion of female-headed
   households increased from 12.4 percent in 1996, to 28.2 percent in 2011. Additionally, the
   proportion of women who were first married by the age of 18 dropped from 60.3 percent in 1996,
   to 40.7 percent in 2011. There was also a shift in women’s attitudes towards domestic violence;
   between 2001 and 2006, there was a significant drop in the proportion of women who believed
   violence is justified by a husband, for every scenario captured by the survey. Other indicators of
   voice and agency in Nepal have been collected only once, making it impossible to establish trends
   over time.

VII.    Data and Knowledge Gaps -- areas for more research

   Nepal possesses data on most key indicators of health and nutrition, education, economic
   opportunity, voice and agency and gender based violence. However, there exist some gaps in
   data, and various indicators are outdated. There are gaps in data on children’s vaccination rates
   and data on type and sector of employment needs updating.




   37
     The distribution of agricultural holders is calculated as: (number of female agricultural holders/total
   agricultural holders)*100.
   The incidence of sole or joint female landowners is calculated as: (the number of female agricultural
   landowners, sole or joint/total female adult population)*100.
   An agricultural holder is defined as the civil or judicial person who makes the major decisions regarding
   resource use and exercises management control over the agricultural holding operation. Documented
   ownership is when the respondent reports that some type of ownership documents exist for the land. In
   most surveys however, these documents are not verified.

                         Annex G7: Pakistan Country Gender Statistical Profiles

I.      Introduction

  The Pakistan Country Gender Statistical Profile provides an examination of Pakistan’s progress
  on social and economic indicators, from a gender perspective. The following sections provide
  sex-disaggregated data and analysis on health and nutrition, education, economic participation,
  voice and agency and gender-based violence—along with insights on laws and regulations. The
  profile concludes with an overview of observed gaps in data and recommendations for future
  research.

  Over time, Pakistan has improved on a number of indicators of female health, nutrition and
  education, whereas it has shown mixed results in the areas of female economic participation and
  voice and agency. Despite having exceeded regional averages and nearing gender parity in
  tertiary enrollment, Pakistan has yet to achieve gender parity in primary and secondary
  enrollment. In terms of employment, women still comprise only a small proportion of the total
  labor force, and their labor force participation rates are significantly lower than that of males.
  However, female labor force participation rates have increased in recent years, while those for
  males have decreased. Improvements are needed in terms of voice and agency, as well as with
  regard to mitigating the prevalence and tolerance of gender-based violence.

II.     Legal and Political context38

  The constitution of Pakistan contains a clause on nondiscrimination—which specifically mentions
  gender—as well as a clause on equality. While customary law is recognized, it is considered
  invalid if it violates constitutional provisions on nondiscrimination and equality. The same cannot
  be said however about personal law, which remains valid even if it violates constitutional
  provisions on nondiscrimination and equality.

  Unmarried—but not married women—can obtain a national ID or passport in the same way as a
  man. Further, a married woman is not permitted to register a business in the same manner as a
  married man. However, there is no legal distinction between married or unmarried women and
  men in terms of travelling outside the home, pursuing a job, or signing a contract.

  With regard to marital affairs, married women are not required by law to obey their husbands, and
  married couples do not jointly share legal responsibility for financially maintaining their family.
  Another important distinction between women and men is that a married woman cannot confer
  national citizenship to her spouse or children in the same way as a married man. Lastly, sons and
  daughters, as well as female and male surviving spouses, do not have the same property
  inheritance rights.

  In terms of work environment, the law does mandate paid maternity leave, but not paternity leave.
  Laws do not mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value, nor do they prohibit gender-
  based discrimination in hiring. Mothers are also not guaranteed equivalent positions after
  maternity leave, and employers are not required to provide break time for nursing mothers.

    In the area of violence against women and girls, there exists legislation which prescribes criminal
    penalties for domestic violence, encompassing the physical, sexual, emotional, and economic
    aspects of such violence. However, the law does not protect unmarried intimate partners. There is
    also legislation, including criminal penalties, to address sexual harassment. The law prohibits or
    invalidates child marriage, and there are penalties for those who authorize or knowingly enter
    individuals into child or early marriage. The legal age for marriage is 18 years for both girls and
    boys.

 III.   Endowments: Health and Nutrition

    1. Summary of current status

    Improvement is needed on key indicators of health and nutrition. The adolescent fertility rate is
    27.26 births per 1000 women, ages 15-19 (2012), which is lower than the regional average of
    38.76 percent. The proportion of pregnant women receiving prenatal care is 68 percent, as
    compared to the regional average of 72 percent. However, approximately half of births are not
    attended by skilled staff. Moreover, about half of female children, ages 12-23 months, did not
    receive specific vaccines by the time of the 2013 DHS survey. In the same age range, slightly
    more male children received specific vaccines (56 percent). Details of Pakistan’s health and
    nutrition indicators are presented alongside regional average statistics in Table 2.

    2. Trends through time

    Several key indicators of female health and nutrition have improved over time. The under-5
    mortality rate for females—as measured by the number of deaths per 1,000 live births—decreased
    from 109.6 in 2000, to 81.9 in 2013. The same rate also decreased for males, from 115.5 to 89.2
    in the same time period. The adolescent fertility rate also decreased from 47.83 births per 1,000
    women in 2000, to 27.26 births in 2012. In the same period, the total fertility rate also decreased,
    from 4.47 to 3.26 births per woman. Also promising, the proportion of pregnant women receiving
    prenatal care increased from 24.8 percent in 1999, to 68 percent in 2000, and the proportion of
    births attended by skilled health staff increased from 18 to 49 percent in the same time period.
    Correspondingly, between 2000 and 2013, the maternal mortality ratio decreased from 280 to 170
    deaths per 100,000 live births.


 IV.       Endowments: Education

    1. Summary of current status

    Pakistan falls behind regional averages with regard to gender parity in enrollment at the primary
    and secondary levels. The ratio of female to male gross primary enrollment rates is 87.22 percent
    (2012), as compared to the regional average of 100.17 percent (2012). At the secondary level, the
    corresponding ratio is 73.55 percent (2012)—moderately lower than the regional average of 93
    percent (2012). Pakistan performs particularly well in terms of achieving gender parity at the
    tertiary level, with a 95.47 percent (2012) ratio of female to male gross tertiary enrollment rates;
    this figure is higher than the regional average of 78.22 percent (2012). These and other detailed
    indicators of education for Pakistan are provided in Table 2.

      2. Trends through time

      Over time, Pakistan has improved on some indicators of female education. The ratio of female to
      male gross primary enrollment rates increased from 76.97 percent in 2005, to 87.22 percent in
      2012. The ratio for secondary enrollment, however, decreased from 77.73 to 73.55 percent
      between 2006 and 2012. At the tertiary level, the ratio increased from 80.1 percent in 2003, to
      95.47 percent in 2012. Between 2005 and 2013, the ratio of female to male primary completion
      rates increased from 71.93 to 85.38 percent. Further, the ratio of female to male lower secondary
      completion rates increased from 72.69 to 80.93 percent in the same time period.


 V.       Economic Opportunity: Labor Force Participation and Employment, and Access to Finance

      1. Summary of current status

      With regard to labor force participation, significant improvement is needed. Females comprise
      only about 22.15 percent of the total labor force, and their labor force participation rates are
      significantly lower than those of men. As such, the female employment to population ratio is
      significantly lower than that of males, for both the 15+ and 15-24 year age groups (see Table 3).
      Unemployment rates are also higher for females. In terms of type (status) of employment, a
      higher proportion of employed females are self-employed, contributing family workers, or
      engaged in vulnerable employment. Pakistani females are predominantly employed in agriculture,
      whereas males are more active in agriculture and services.

   2. Trends through time

   In recent years, there has been a slight increase in the female proportion of the labor force, which
   rose from 15.16 percent in 2000, to 22.15 percent in 2013. Similarly, female labor force
   participation has increased—from 16.3 percent in 2000, to 22.2 percent in 2014—whereas the
   male labor force participation rate actually decreased, from 83.2 to 68.1 percent in the same time
   period. Female youth also experienced an increase in labor force participation, from 10.3 percent
   in 2000, to 21.9 percent in 2013. Inversely, this rate decreased for male youth—from 70.5 to 67.4
   percent in the same time period.

   Between 2005 and 2013, the employment to population ratio for female youth increased slightly,
   from 15 to 19 percent, while the corresponding ratio for males decreased from 65 to 62 percent.
   Also during this time, the female employment to population ratio for those 15 years of age and
   above increased from 17 to 22.3 percent. For males, this ratio remained roughly the same, around
   79 to 80 percent, in the same time period.

   Pakistan has also reduced unemployment for much of its population. Between 2000 and 2014,
   female youth unemployment decreased from 29.4 to 11.9 percent, and overall female
   unemployment decreased from 15.8 to 8.7 percent. During the same time period, the
   unemployment rate for male youth decreased from 11.2 to 7.5 percent, and there was a slight
   decrease for the overall male population—from 5.5 to 5.1 percent.


VI.     Voice and Agency: Political Representation and Gender-based Violence

   1. Summary of current status

   The proportion of seats held by women in national parliament is 20.7 percent, which is roughly
   on par with the regional average (19.34 percent). However, there are currently no women serving
   in ministerial level positions. Gender-based violence remains pervasive in Pakistan; 33 percent of
   women who were surveyed as part of the DHS program reported to have experienced physical
   and/or emotional violence from their intimate partners within a 12-month period. Further, a
   significant proportion of those surveyed believe such violence is justified in a number of
   situations. Additional details on these indicators are provided in Table 4.

   2. Trends through time

   The proportion of seats held by women in Pakistan’s national parliament has remained relatively
   constant since 2002—between 20 and 23 percent. Further, from 2001 to 2008, the percentage of
   female legislators, senior officials and managers remained stagnant, between 2 and 3 percent.
   However, in 2014, there were no women in ministerial level positions. Previously, in 2005, they
   comprised 5.6 percent of such positions.

VII.   Data and Knowledge Gaps -- areas for more research

   Pakistan possesses a considerable amount of data, sufficient to support analysis and policy
   guidance. Yet, additional data is needed on the prevalence of gender-based violence, particularly
   with regard to marital sexual violence, as well as violence perpetrated by someone other than an
   intimate partner. The most recent DHS domestic violence module collected data on physical, but
   not sexual violence occurring within the context of marriage.

                         Annex G8: Sri Lanka Country Gender Statistical Profiles

I.      Introduction

  The Sri Lanka Country Gender Statistical Profile provides an examination of Sri Lanka’s
  progress on social and economic indicators, from a gender perspective. The following sections
  provide sex-disaggregated data and analysis on health and nutrition, education, economic
  participation, voice and agency and gender-based violence—along with insights on laws and
  regulations. The profile concludes with an overview of observed gaps in data and
  recommendations for future research.

  Overall, Sri Lanka has performed well on indicators of health, nutrition and education. It exceeds
  regional averages on several key indicators in these categories. However, improvement is needed
  in the area of economic opportunity, particularly with regard to labor force participation and
  unemployment. Further, Sri Lanka stands to improve on female political participation, and there
  is a strong need for additional research on gender-based violence.

II.     Legal and Political context39

  Sri Lanka’s constitution protects the rights of women and men. It contains a clause on
  nondiscrimination that includes gender, as well as a clause on equality. The constitution
  recognizes both and personal and customary law as valid sources of law. All married and
  unmarried women and men have equal rights to apply for a passport, obtain a national ID, travel
  outside their home or outside the country, obtain a job or pursue a trade of profession, sign a
  contract, register a business, open a bank account, choose where to live, and to be heads of
  household or family. Married and unmarried women have the same right as men to confer
  citizenship on their children or on a non-national spouse, and are not required by law to obey their
  husbands. Married couples share legal responsibility for financially maintaining their family’s
  expenses. However, there are no quotas for female representatives in parliament, local
  government, nor for women in candidate lists for national or local elections. Similarly, there are
  no quotas for female representatives on corporate boards. In terms of the judiciary, the Supreme
  Court of Sri Lanka is comprised of 11 judges, three of which are women. Moreover, in court of
  law, Sri Lanka recognizes personal law, and women’s and men’s testimony carry the same
  evidentiary weight.

  Sri Lanka provides few incentives for women to work and little job protection. Childcare
  payments are not deductible; there are no childcare tax deductions or credits specific to men or
  women; the government does not support or provide childcare services or a childcare allowance
  for parents; and most employers do not provide leave to care for sick relatives.

  The law mandates paid maternity leave of 84 days, with the employer paying for 100% of
  benefits and wages during this time. Moreover, the law requires that employers provide break
  time for nursing mothers. Unfortunately, mothers are not guaranteed an equivalent position of
  employment after returning from maternity leave, and parents are not entitled to flexible or part-
  time schedules.

  Further, while laws prohibit the dismissal of pregnant workers, they do not prohibit prospective
  employers from asking about family status. Additionally, laws do not prohibit gender-based

  39   Women, Business, and the Law (2016)

                                                                                                  221
    Annex G8: Sri Lanka                                                         Country Gender Profile


    discrimination in hiring, nor do they guarantee equal remuneration for work of equal value.
    Women can retire with full or partial benefits at 50 years of age, and men are eligible at 55 years.

    As compared to men, non-pregnant and non-nursing women face certain restrictions in terms of
    which types of employment they are eligible to engage in. For instance, they are not permitted to
    work in mining and factories in the same way as men. Hence, women are not permitted to
    perform all of the same jobs or job-related tasks as men.

    Sri Lanka does not provide incentives for building credit. The law does not prohibit creditors
    from discriminating on the basis of gender or marital status, and retailers, utility companies and
    microfinance institutions do not provide information to private credit bureaus or public registries.

    Sri Lanka possesses domestic violence legislation, which prescribes clear criminal penalties, and
    there exists a specialized court and procedure for addressing cases of such violence. Additionally,
    this legislation encompasses the physical, sexual, emotional and economic aspects of domestic
    violence, and protects family members, former spouses and unmarried intimate partners.
    Protection orders for domestic violence provide for the removal of the perpetrator from the home.
    Further, they prohibit the perpetrator’s contact with the survivor, and ensure that they maintain a
    geographic distance from them. However, there is no legislation which explicitly criminalizes
    marital rape. Sri Lanka also possesses legislation that specifically addresses sexual harassment.
    This legislation prescribes criminal penalties, and covers sexual harassment in places of
    employment and education, but not in public places more broadly.

    The legal age of marriage in Sri Lanka is 18 years for both girls and boys, although there are
    certain exemptions. The law prohibits child marriage, and there are penalties for those who
    authorize or knowingly enter an individual into child or early marriage.

 III.   Endowments: Health and Nutrition

    1. Summary of current status

    Sri Lanka performs well on many indicators of health and nutrition. Life expectancy is higher for
    females than males (77 and 71 years, respectively)—outperforming the regional average of 68
    years. The female under-five mortality rate is 9 deaths per 1000 live births, significantly lower
    than the regional average of 57 deaths. Sri Lanka’s fertility rate is also slightly lower than the
    regional average, while the adolescent fertility and maternal mortality rates are considerably
    lower than regional averages. Nearly all pregnant women receive prenatal care and nearly 100%
    of births are attended by skilled staff. However, some health indicators are now outdated, such as
    the age at first marriage for males. Additional details on indicators of health and nutrition in Sri
    Lanka are provided in Table 1.

    2. Trends Through time

    Sri Lanka’s health indicators have traditionally been among the best in the region, and most
    reflect the large reduction in gender disparities that has occurred over the last several decades.
    Between 1972 and 2012, sex ratios remained constant, at 1.04. The total fertility rate has also
    dropped in recent decades, from 5.5 births per woman in 1960, to 2.3 births in 2012. In the same
    time period, the adolescent fertility rate declined drastically, from 98 to 16.9 births per 1,000
    women, ages 15-19.

    The proportion of pregnant women receiving prenatal care rose from 94.5 percent in 2000, to 99.4
    percent in 2007, as did the proportion of births attended by skilled health staff—from 87 percent
    in 1987 to 98.6 percent in 2007. Correspondingly, the maternal mortality ratio fell from 49 deaths
    per 100,000 live births in 1990, to 29 deaths in 2013. However, the proportion of female adults
    with HIV increased from 23.1 to 32.2 percent between 1987 and 2013.

    Both female and male under five mortality rates dropped by more than half between 1990 and
    2013—from 19.4 to 8.8 deaths (per 1,000 live births) for girls, and from 23.1 to 10.4 deaths for
    boys. Malnutrition prevalence indicators also improved for both girls and boys—particularly


                                                                                                   223

IV.        Endowments: Education

  I.       Summary of current status

   Sri Lanka is close to achieving gender parity on several key indicators of education, including
   primary and secondary enrollment rates. The ratios of female to male gross enrollment rates in Sri
   Lanka are 99.58 percent at the primary level, and 106.14 percent at the secondary level, as
   compared to the regional averages of 100.17 and 93.39 percent. The ratio of female to male gross
   tertiary enrollment rates is skewed towards females at 165.75 percent—higher than the regional
   average of 78.22. Females also perform well in terms of the distribution of graduates by field of
   study, where they comprise close to 50 percent or more of graduates in key fields, including
   agriculture, education, health, humanities, and science. Details on key indicators of education are
   provided in Table 2.

      2. Trends through time

      Over the course of the past 40 years, there have been a number of improvements in Sri Lanka’s
      education indicators, suggesting increasing levels of gender equality. The ratio of young literate
      females to males improved from 98.16 percent in 1981, to 100.92 percent in 2010. The ratio of
      female to male gross primary enrollment rates rose from 91 percent in 1970, to 99.58 percent in
      2012; at the secondary level, this ratio increased from 110.27 to 106.14 percent between 1981 and
      2010—closer to parity. Yet, the ratio of female to male gross tertiary enrollment rates became
      highly skewed towards females, moving from 78.82 percent in 1970 to 165.75 percent in 2012,
      indicating an emerging gender differential that favors young women.

      Primary and secondary completion rates have improved considerably for both females and males,
      from around 62 percent for girls and 64 percent for boys (1970), to 97 and 98 percent (2013),
      respectively. Between 1970 and 2013, the ratio of female to male completion rates remained
      between 98 and 100 percent. Lower secondary completion rates also rose between 1970 and
      2012, from 32.35 to 82.31 percent for girls, and from 29.64 to 79.51 percent for boys. Available
      data points for the distribution of tertiary level graduates by field of study are only two years
      apart (2010 and 2012); hence it is not possible to assess recent trends for this set of indicators.

 V.       Economic Opportunity: Labor Force Participation and Employment, and Access to Finance

  I.      Summary of current status

      Improvement is needed with regard to key indicators of economic opportunity. Females comprise
      only 33.04 percent of the labor force. Further, as compared to males, their labor force
      participation rates are significantly lower and their unemployment rates are more than twice as
      high. Moreover, the female employment to population ratio is lower than the male employment to
      population ratio. Gender disparities in labor force participation, unemployment, and in
      employment to population ratios are also evidenced among youth, as shown in Table 3. Both
      women and men are most likely to work as wage and salaried workers, followed by self-
      employed workers. Yet, men are more likely than women to be own account workers or
      employers, while women are more likely than men to be contributing family workers.

      While a large proportion of men (40 percent) hold vulnerable jobs, approximately half of women
      (47.7 percent) are engaged in such forms of employment. Men are more likely than women to
      work in agriculture (41.6 percent, as opposed to 34.7 percent), while women are more likely than
      men to work in industry (25.1 and 14.1 percent, respectively). The proportions of women and
      men employed in services are roughly similar.

   2. Trends through Time

   Labor force participation patterns and trends in Sri Lanka have not progressed towards parity in
   the last 23 years. Between 1990 and 2013, the total labor force participation rate remained fairly
   constant at around 55 percent, reflecting women’s very low levels of participation. Between 2006
   and 2015, female and male labor force participation rates (ages 15-64) also remained constant, at
   around 75 percent for males and 36 percent for females. Hence, the ratio of female to male labor
   force participation rates (49%) did not progress towards parity between 2006 and 2015. Among
   young workers (ages 15-24), labor force participation rates for both women and men dropped
   between 1990 and 2014, from 45.1 to 23.3 percent among young women, and from 59.6 to 42.8
   percent among young men. This drop may be reflective of the fact that more young adults have
   attended school in recent years. The employment to population ratio for females (ages 15+) has
   increased only slightly—from 29.7 percent in 2000, to 30.9 percent in 2012. For males, the same
   indicator increased from 63.6 percent in 2000, to 72.8 percent in 2012.


VI.     Voice and Agency: Political Representation and Gender-based Violence

  I.    Summary of current status

   Female political participation remains relatively low in Sri Lanka. The proportion of seats held by
   women in parliament is 5.8 percent, as compared to the regional average of 19.34 percent. The
   proportion of women in ministerial level positions is 2.9 percent, lower than the region’s 7.06
   percent. Lastly, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that females
   comprise only 16.3 percent of agricultural land holders in Sri Lanka (2002) (Table 4).

   2. Trends through Time

   In recent decades, Sri Lankan women seem to have made limited progress in the area of voice and
   agency. The proportion of women who were first married by the age of 18 declined modestly,
   from 13.7 percent in 1987, to 11.8 percent in 2007. The proportion of seats held by women in
   national parliament only rose from 4.9 to 5.8 percent between 1990 and 2014, and the proportion
   of female legislators, senior officials and managers increased rather marginally, from 21.72
   percent in 2002 to 23.93 percent in 2007. The absence of data on gender-based violence and
   attitudes towards spousal violence negates any potential assessment of trends in these areas.

VII.    Data and Knowledge Gaps -- areas for more research

   Sri Lanka possesses largely complete data on indicators of health and education. However, there
   is only one data point available in a number of areas, including type (status) and sector of
   employment, access to finance, the percentage of female headed households, and among various
   indicators of voice and agency. Data is needed on the prevalence of gender-based, and on
   attitudes towards spousal violence.

     The distribution of agricultural holders is calculated as (number of female agricultural holders/total
   agricultural holders)*100. An agricultural holder is defined as the civil or judicial person who makes the
   major decisions regarding resource use and exercises management control over the agricultural holding
   operation.
