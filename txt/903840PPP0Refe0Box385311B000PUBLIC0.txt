This second version of the PPP Reference Guide, as the first one, presents a global overview of the diversity
of approaches and experiences in the implementation of PPPs, providing an entry point to the substantial
body of knowledge on PPPs that has been built up by practitioners in governments, the private sector,
international institutions, and academics. With due care not to increase the overall size of the Guide, this
version includes new references and examples.

The PPP Reference Guide seeks to provide advice on what PPP practitioners should know, rather than
provide advice on what to do. The Guide sets out the main topics, looks at the key issues that must be
addressed, and provides what we consider the most important references that PPP practitioners can turn to
for answers and to enhance their own knowledge and understanding. It is structured into separate sections
that focus on three main areas, firstly what are PPPs, when might they be used and the advantages and
disadvantages relative to public provision; secondly the policy, legal and institutional frameworks that
should be put into place to help improve their effectiveness; and finally the ways in which PPP projects can
be developed and implemented. A diverse range of case studies and institutional solutions, from all parts
of the world, are presented in the PPP Reference Guide.

This project, jointly developed by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB), was funded by a grant from the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory
Facility (PPIAF). We are glad to acknowledge PPIAF previous support in creating the first version of this
Guide. This second version was developed by a team led by Rui Monteiro of the World Bank PPP Group,
and overseen by Clive Harris, PPP Group manager, who enthusiastically sponsored this project since its
beginning. David Bloomgarden coordinated IDB’s contributions, and Trevor Lewis ADB’s contributions.
Many PPP experts—too many to list them here—provided advice and suggestions. Shin Kue Ryu and John
Saville did extensive research for this version, and—last but not least—Helen Martin had a critical role as its
main editor.

This new version will be published in PDF and in a web-friendly version, accessible through the websites
of the World Bank, ADB and IDB, through the Global PPP Network website, www.pppnetwork.info, and
through www.ppiaf.org.

A growing number of developing country governments are interested in using Public-Private Partnerships
(PPPs) to provide public infrastructure assets and services. This Reference Guide exists to help them.
Specifically, it aims to help government officials and other interested parties to answer three questions:

•	 	What are PPPs, and why would we want to use them?

   What kind of policy, legal, and institutional framework do we need to put in place to ensure PPPs
•	 	
   achieve their objectives efficiently and effectively?

•	 	What is the process for developing and implementing a PPP project?

A substantial body of knowledge on PPPs has been built up by practitioners in governments, the private
sector, international institutions, academics and advisors. This Reference Guide helps readers navigate this
body of knowledge. It introduces key topics on PPP, sets out options, and directs readers to examples, and
key references where they can find out more.

The Reference Guide is not intended as a Toolkit, setting out how to approach everything. Nor is it a manual
of best practice—the state of knowledge on many topics is not yet well enough developed to prescribe best
practices (which in any case are situation specific). Rather, it is the user-interface for the body of knowledge,
setting out the key topics and issues, providing an overview, and letting the interested practitioner know
where to go to learn more.

Version 2.0 of the Reference Guide provides new resources and updated examples. However, readers
should not expect to find in this Guide a presentation of the current status of PPPs in any given country
14




     or sector. The Reference Guide rather attempts to provide the most relevant examples and resources—
     whether most recent or older—to help readers inform themselves on the topics at hand.


     Key Definitions—What Is a PPP?
     There is no single, internationally accepted definition of ‘Public-Private Partnership’. This Reference Guide
     takes a broad view of PPP, as:

         A long-term contract between a private party and a government entity, for providing a public asset
         or service, in which the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility, and
         remuneration is linked to performance.

     This definition encompasses PPPs that provide new assets and services, and those for existing assets and
     services. It can include PPPs in which the private party is paid entirely by service users, and those in which
     a government agency makes some or all of the payments. The project functions transferred to the private
     party—such as design, construction, financing, operations, and maintenance—may vary from contract to
     contract, but in all cases the private party is accountable for project performance, and bears significant risk
     and management responsibility. Section 1.1: What is a PPP: Defining ‘Public-Private Partnership’ provides
     more information on the range of contract types that constitute PPPs under this definition and the different
     nomenclature used to describe them.

     The definition encompasses contracts in many sectors and for many services, provided that there is a public
     interest in the provision of the service, and the project involves long-life assets concomitant with the long
     term of the PPP contract. Throughout this Reference Guide, the term ‘infrastructure’ is used loosely to cover
     this range of sectors and services for which PPPs are used. In this context, ‘infrastructure’ includes economic,
     social, and government infrastructure—that is, the ‘basic physical and organizational structures’ needed to
     make economic, social, and government activity possible (using the Oxford English Dictionary definition).
     Section 1.2: How PPPs Are Used: Sectors and Services describes further the range of sectors and services
     for which PPPs are used.


     What is in the Reference Guide
     The Reference Guide is divided into the following three modules, addressing the questions above:

     •	 Module 1: PPP Basics—What and Why? Provides an overview of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)—what
        they are, how they are used to provide infrastructure assets and services, their benefits, and their pitfalls

     •	 Module 2: Establishing the PPP Framework. Describes the elements of a sound PPP framework—
        that is, the policy, processes, institutions, and rules that together define how PPPs will be implemented,
        and that promote good governance of a PPP program.

     •	 Module 3: Implementing PPP Projects. Provides guidance on each stage of developing and
        implementing a PPP project—from initially identifying candidate projects, to managing PPP contracts
        through the project lifetime.
                                                                                                                 15




Each module begins with an introduction, providing an overall framework for the module’s content, and
listing any helpful overview references. The modules are divided into sections, each covering a different
topic, as shown in Figure 1: PPP Reference Guide Overview.

Each section provides a narrative describing the topic, and setting out the guiding principles and practical
options that interested government officials should consider. This text is interspersed with references
providing more information on key points on each topic. These references are highlighted in bold type,
and followed, in square brackets, by a key reference number and page number, for example: [#1, pages
1-5]. This number refers the reader to a list at the end of the Guide, in which all references are presented—
by clicking on the number the reader is sent to that listing; to return to the original page, the reader only
needs to click Alt + Left Arrow key. The main references for each section are listed and briefly described at
the end of the section.

Table 1: Key Reference Table—Example below provides an example from a “key references” table. In some
cases, the reference tables are organized by subject area, within the overall topic. Readers who just want to
quickly get a sense of the most important references on the topic can refer directly to these key references
tables.

     Who should use the Reference Guide
     Broadly speaking, this Reference Guide is intended for use by government officials in developing countries,
     as described above. However, different people will find different parts of this Reference Guide useful at
     different times. Table 2: PPP Reference Guide Modules and Who Should Read Them briefly sets out which
     module will be most useful to which kind of reader, under which circumstances. As noted above, the Guide
     is part synthesis and part bibliography. As such, it may be useful for both the newcomer to the PPP area
     looking for a structured introduction to key PPP topics, and the expert who may find additional references
     in some specific area.

This module provides an overview of Public-Private Partnership (PPPs), for interested government officials
and other stakeholders who want to learn more about how PPPs can be used to provide infrastructure assets
and services.

•	 Section 1.1: What is a PPP: Defining ‘Public-Private Partnership’ delves in more detail into the definition
   of PPP: describing the range of PPP contract types, and clarifying how PPPs relate to a broader range of
   ‘partnerships’ between the public and private sectors
•	 Section 1.2: How PPPs Are Used: Sectors and Services describes the range of sectors and services for
   which PPPs have been used, with links to a wide range of international PPP examples.
•	 Section 1.3: Infrastructure Challenges and How PPPs Can Help describes some of the problems that
   typically arise in providing infrastructure—particularly in developing countries. It describes how PPPs
   can help address some of those problems—drawing where possible on examples and evidence—as
   well as the limitations and potential pitfalls of PPP
•	 Section 1.4: How PPPs Are Financed briefly introduces the private finance structures used for PPPs,
   and provides links to further resources for those interested in learning more. It also describes how
   governments may seek to influence or control how private parties develop the financing structure—and
   why and how governments may participate in financing PPPs.


1.1 What is a PPP: Defining ‘Public-Private Partnership’
The overall introduction to this Reference Guide provided a broad definition of PPP, as a ‘long-term contract
between a private party and a government entity, for providing a public asset or service, in which the private
18   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     party bears significant risk and management responsibility, and remuneration is linked to performance’.
     This section delves into that definition in more detail: describing (in Section 1.1.1) the range of PPP contract
     types, and the different nomenclature used to describe those contract types; as well as clarifying (in Section
     1.1.2) some related types of ‘partnership’ between public and private sector parties to which the definition,
     and more importantly the guidance material, in this Guide would generally not apply.


     1.1.1 PPP Contract Types and Terminology
     A Public-Private Partnership (PPP), as defined above, comprises a long-term contract between a government
     entity and a private firm. However, this broad definition encompasses a range of contract types, which
     can be described in different ways—there is no standard, internationally accepted definition of PPP, and
     different jurisdictions use different nomenclature to describe similar projects. This section describes in more
     detail the range of PPP contract types under the definition of PPP used in this Reference Guide; and some
     of the more common terminology used globally to describe PPPs.


     PPP Contract Types
     Throughout this Reference Guide, PPPs are described in terms of three broad parameters: first, the type
     of asset involved; secondly, what functions the private party is responsible for; and thirdly, how the private
     party is paid.

     Many PPPs involve new assets—often called ‘greenfield’ projects. For example, the United Kingdom’s PPP
     program—called the Private Finance Initiative (PFI)—involved private companies in financing, building,
     and managing new public assets, from schools and hospitals to defense facilities. PPPs can also be used
     to transfer responsibility for upgrading and managing existing assets to a private company—those are
     called ‘brownfield’ projects. In either case, a key feature of a PPP is that the assets or services provided are
     specified in terms of outputs rather than inputs—that is, defining what is required, rather than how it is to
     be done.

     A central characteristic of a PPP contract is that it ‘bundles’ together multiple project phases or functions.
     Nonetheless, the functions for which the private party is responsible vary, and can depend on the type of
     asset and service involved. Typical functions can include the following:

     •	 Design (also called ‘engineering’ work)—means developing the project from initial concept and output
        requirements to construction-ready design specifications
     •	 Build, or Rehabilitate—when PPPs are used for new infrastructure assets, they typically require the
        private party to construct the asset and install all equipment. Where PPPs involve existing assets, the
        private party may be responsible for rehabilitating or extending the asset
     •	 Finance—when a PPP includes building or rehabilitating the asset, the private party is typically also
        required to finance all or part of the necessary capital expenditure, as described further in Section 1.4:
        How PPPs Are Financed.
     •	 Maintain—PPPs assign responsibility to the private party for maintaining an infrastructure asset to a
                                                           MODULE 1 PPP Basics - What and Why                   19




    specified standard over the life of the contract. This is typically considered a defining feature of PPP
    contracts
•	 Operate—the operating responsibilities of the private party to a PPP can vary widely, depending on
   the nature of the underlying asset and associated service. For example, the private party could be
   responsible for:
    -	 Technical operation of an asset, and providing a bulk service to a government off-taker—for
       example, a bulk water treatment plant
    -	   Technical operation of an asset, and providing services directly to users—for example, a PPP for a
         water distribution system
    -	   Providing support services, with the government agency remaining responsible for delivering the
         public service to users—for example, a PPP for a school building that includes janitorial service.

The PPP payment mechanism is a third defining feature. The private party can be paid by collecting
fees from service users, by the government, or by a combination of the two—with the common, defining
characteristic that payment is contingent on performance. The options for a payment mechanism can
depend on the functions of the private party:
•	 Under ‘user pays’ PPPs, such as toll roads, the private party provides a service to users, and generates
   revenue by charging users for that service. These fees (or tariffs, or tolls) can be supplemented by
   subsidies paid by government, which may be performance-based (for example, conditional on the
   availability of the service at a particular quality), or output-based (for example, payments per user)
•	 In ‘government pays’ PPPs, the government is the sole source of revenue for the private party.
   Government payments can depend on the asset or service being available at a contractually-defined
   quality (“availability” payments). They can also be output-based payments for services delivered to
   users—for example, a “shadow toll” road that is free for users, but for which the government pays a fee
   per driver to the operator.

These characteristics can be combined in various ways, to create a wide range of PPP contracts. Figure 1:
PPP Reference Guide Overview provides some examples. As Figure 1 illustrates, these contracts can be
thought of as a continuum between public and private provision of infrastructure—transferring increasing
responsibilities and risk to the private sector. PPPs are not the only way the private sector can be involved
in infrastructure—Figure 1 also includes examples of arrangements that would not usually be considered as
PPP. These ‘adjacent’ arrangements are described further below in Section 1.1.2: What PPP is Not: Other
Types of Private Involvement.

     PPP Terminology
     While PPP contracts can generally be categorized using the parameters above, there is no consistent,
     international standard for defining PPPs and describing these different types of contract. This varying
     terminology can create confusion when comparing international experience—hence this Reference Guide
     consistently uses ‘PPP’ to describe the wide range of contract types, irrespective of the terminology in the
     particular country or jurisdiction.

     Some governments define ‘PPP’ in their PPP policies or laws to mean a specific range of contract types, as
     described in Section 2.1: PPP Policy. These definitions may incorporate all or some subset of the contract
     types described above. For example, Brazilian law distinguishes between user-pays and government-pays
     projects. PPP projects that are fully paid for by charging users are governed by the ‘Concessions Law’, while
     other PPP projects are governed by the ‘PPP Law’—accordingly, only the latter are commonly referred to as
     ‘PPP’. A similar distinction is made in France, where the term ‘PPP’ is restricted to government-pays contracts
     implemented under the ‘PPP Law’—again, user-pays contracts are typically referred to as concessions.

     At the same time, other terms can be used as synonyms for PPP in general, or to refer to particular types of
     PPP—either in law, or in common usage. ‘Concession’ is sometimes used to refer to specific types of PPP
     (as is the case in Brazil, as noted above, where a ‘concession’ is a fully user-pays PPP), while in other cases it
     is simply a synonym for PPP (for example, in Chile all PPPs are called ‘concessions’, and implemented under
                                                               MODULE 1 PPP Basics - What and Why                      21




the country’s ‘concessions law’). In the United Kingdom, Government-pays PPPs for new assets are known
as ‘Private Finance Initiative’ or PFI projects; while PPPs for existing assets (such as hospitals, or railways) are
sometimes known as ‘franchises’. It is not uncommon to hear the process of entering into a PPP referred to
as ‘privatization’, or for the resulting assets to be termed ‘private’—although this reference guide makes a
distinction between PPP and privatization, as described further in the following section.

Different nomenclature can also be used to distinguish different PPP contract structures. In some cases,
PPPs are described by the functions transferred to the private party. For example, a ‘Design-Build-Finance-
Operate-Maintain’, or DBFOM contract would allocate all those functions to the private party. Other
nomenclatures such as ‘Build-Operate-Transfer’ focus rather on the legal ownership and control of the
assets.

Table 1.1: PPP Nomenclature explains common PPP nomenclature, and how each relates to the description
by asset type, functions, and payment mechanisms described above. The following resources provide more
information on PPP contract types and nomenclature:
•	 Delmon’s paper on understanding options for PPPs in infrastructure [#59] provides the most
   detailed discussion. Delmon classifies PPPs by five factors, similar to the characteristics described
   above: (1) whether the PPP is a new or existing business or asset; (2) the responsibility of the private
   party for construction; (3) the level of private finance involved; (4) the nature of the project company’s
   service delivery obligations (bulk supply or retail level); and (5) the source of revenue stream
•	 Yescombe chapter on ‘What are Public-Private Partnerships’ [#295], which also describes the range
   of PPP structures and how these are classified
•	 Farquharson et al chapter on ‘Defining Public-Private Partnerships’ [#95, pages 9-14], which
   focuses on how PPPs differ from privatization and management contracts; and describes user-fee and
   availability-based PPPs
•	 The World Bank explanatory notes on key topics in water sector regulation [#122, Note 4] describe
   common contract types for managing existing assets in the water sector: concession, lease or affermage,
   and management contracts
•	 The World Bank’s PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center website describes a spectrum of PPP
   types based on the extent of private sector’s participation. It is available at http://ppp.worldbank.org/

Section 3.3: Structuring PPP Projects also provides further guidance and links on PPP contract structures,
and how governments can decide which to use for a particular project.

1.1.2 What PPP is Not: Other Types of Private Involvement
Besides setting out what is defined as a PPP for the purpose of this Reference Guide, it is also helpful to
clarify what is not. Figure 1.2 illustrates the intersection between PPP and three related concepts, described
in turn below: other types of contract with the private sector for providing public assets and services; other
types of ‘partnerships’ with the private sector; and regulation of private sector service provision.

Other types of contract for providing public assets and services
Governments enter into a wide range of contracts with private companies. Some of these contract types
share some or all of the typical PPP characteristics—such as being long-term, output based, or performance-
related. For example, these include:
•	 Management contracts typically include similar performance indicators and requirements to PPPs.
   However, these contracts are typically of shorter duration as PPPs, and do not involve significant private
24   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




         capital investment—with performance incentives created primarily through payment and penalties
         schemes. The World Bank’s explanatory notes on water regulation [#122, pages 36-42], for example,
         describe how management contracts are used in the water sector. Operations and Maintenance (O&M)
         and performance-based maintenance contracts may also fall outside the definition of PPP where these
         contracts are of short duration
     •	 Design-build, or ‘turnkey’ contracts include similar output-based specifications; however, as shorter-
        term contracts they do not create the same long-term performance incentives as PPPs
     •	 Financial lease contracts are long-term contracts for providing public assets. However, these contracts
        transfer significantly less risk to the private party than PPPs.

     While the material in this Reference Guide focuses on PPP arrangements, many of the references provided
     in this guide may also be useful for governments considering these related contractual arrangements;
     conversely, some references dealing with these contract types are provided, where these may provide
     applicable lessons for PPPs. However, readers should bear in mind that the differences in risk allocation can
     make for significant differences in bidding and operational behavior.


     Other concepts of ‘public-private partnerships’
     The expression ‘public-private partnership’ is also sometimes used for several other types of arrangements
     between public and private entities that contribute to public policy goals. These can include, for example:
     •	 Information-sharing mechanisms, such as a ‘public-private partnership’ against healthcare fraud in the
        United States involving the federal government, state officials, several leading private health insurance
        organizations, and other health care anti-fraud groups
     •	 Voluntary activities undertaken by private companies towards public ends and in coordination with
        relevant authorities, such as community health or education projects attached to major foreign direct
        investment projects
     •	 Private funding of public investment projects on a philanthropic basis, which may involve some private
        involvement in project execution
     •	 Jointly-run projects for research and innovation, formed to draw on skills and information in both the
        public and private sectors
     •	 Government interventions to support private sector development in general, or in particular target
        sectors—such as providing land, assets, debt, equity or guarantees to otherwise fully private enterprises
        that are not involved in provision of public services.

     While all types of partnership, these arrangements are very different to the contracts discussed in this PPP
     Reference Guide: in duration, objectives, and legal status and structure. As such, the principles, policy
     arrangements, and processes described in this guide are of limited relevance to these other types of public-
     private ‘partnership’.

PPPs and sector regulation
PPPs often deal with the supply of essential services in monopoly (or near-monopoly) conditions. Private
monopoly essential service providers are typically regulated by government to control tariffs and service
standards—often by assigning responsibilities to an independent regulatory agency—to protect customers
from possible abuse of market power. Sector regulation may also govern the terms on which providers in
a sector deal with each other; entry to the sector through licensing; and control over sector investment
decisions. Regulation is particularly important in the water, electricity, gas, and telecommunications sectors,
and can also be found in other sectors, such as airports or highways.

There are several ways in which PPPs relate to the concept of sector regulation, in the context of natural
monopoly sectors:
•	 PPP and privatization as alternative reform options. Governments looking at options to improve
   performance of existing public assets and services in these sectors may consider a PPP as an alternative
   sector reform option to privatizing and establishing a regulatory regime. While there are similarities
   in the processes of establishing a PPP and privatizing, and some of the guidance in this book may be
   applicable in both cases, the nature of the resulting relationship is distinct.
•	 Regulation by contract through a PPP. When PPPs are introduced in sectors that would typically
   be regulated, the PPP contract itself can be used to define tariffs and service standards in a way that
   protects customers’ interests—as an alternative to establishing a regulatory regime. Box 1.1 presents
   some examples of ‘regulation by contract’; some of the implications for PPP contract design are
   described further in Section 3.3: Structuring PPP Projects
•	 PPP alongside sector regulation. Some countries decide to establish sector regulatory regimes
   when introducing a PPP for service provision in a sector; including in some cases to act as government
   party to the contract. In other cases, sector regulation may already be in place. In either case, the
   PPP agreement and sector law and regulations need to be carefully harmonized—to ensure there is
   no conflict between the PPP contract and regulatory requirements, and to establish clear roles and
   responsibilities. Section 2.3.2: Institutional Responsibilities: Implementation provides more examples of
   the roles of sector regulators in developing, implementing, and managing PPPs.

guidance and further reading on a wide range of regulation topics. The following references also discuss
regulation in more detail, including how it relates to PPPs:

•	 Eberhard’s paper on hybrid and transitional models of regulation in developing countries [#66]
   provides an overview of different regulatory models and the advantages and potential pitfalls of each
   model. The paper also provides recommendations on how to improve the performance of regulatory
   models
26   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     •	 Two papers by Ian Alexander [#4, #5] focus on establishing predetermined rules for committing
        regulators to future actions, and building confidence in the regulatory system to attract private investors.

     Regulation is not limited to sectors involving the provision of essential services in monopoly or near-
     monopoly conditions. Regulatory frameworks can also be used to overcome other market failures, such
     as to ensure responsible management of limited natural resources. In some cases the processes and
     structures can bear resemblance to a PPP—for example, a concession for mining or petroleum exploration
     or exploitation, or for management of a tourism site. There can also be some muddy ground between these
     types of regulation, where some aspect of provision of essential services through a competitive market
     requires access to limited resources—such as allocation of radio spectrums for mobile telecommunications,
     or access to hydropower or other resources for electricity generation in the context of a competitive market.
     While there are some similarities between such concessions or licensing procedures and PPPs, for the most
     part the contract structures involved in such cases are distinct, and the material in this Reference Guide is
     of limited relevance in such cases.




          Box 1.1: Regulation by Contract

          Many governments implement PPPs without creating an overall sector regulatory regime. A
          common approach to sector regulation is to address tariff and service standards directly through
          the contract with a private service provider. In this approach, no special tools or regulatory bodies
          are required. The contract itself sets out the service standards to be reached.

          In the case of a concession contract, the contract will also sets out what the tariff is, and rules
          and processes for adjusting the tariff from time to time. In a lease or affermage contract, tariff
          setting powers may be retained by the government, but the payment to the operator—which is
          also linked to the amount of the service supplied—is set in the contract. This approach is used
          successfully in France, and in many Francophone countries. For example:

          •	 Urban water concession, Senegal—in the 1995, the government implemented reforms to
             bring in private operators under an affermage and performance contract to improve the
             performance of the water sector. Provisions within the contracts outlined performance
             standards and indicators, allowed for monitoring by a committee, and included an effective
             dispute resolution mechanism. The private operator was legally obliged to meet the
             standards—such as water quality, access, non-revenue water—set out under the contract
             [#272]

          •	 Manila water concessions, Philippines—when the government of the Philippines decided to
             end a water crisis in Manila by letting two concession contracts for supply of water in the
             city, it considered establishing an independent statutory regulator. However, it decided that
             going to Congress to pass the necessary laws would be too time-consuming and risky. It
             therefore created a regulatory office for the two concession agreements within the public
                                                                          MODULE 1 PPP Basics - What and Why                               27




          utility (which remains the asset owner and counterpart to the PPP contract). A clause in the
          concession agreement required the private operators to ‘cooperate’ with the regulatory
          office, which in turn was responsible for interpreting the regulations in the agreements [#63]

     •	 The Bucharest water concession, in Romania, also provides an interesting example of a
        regulatory structure created under contract. The concession had two different regulatory
        bodies—a technical regulator and an economic regulator. The technical regulator was created
        for the specific purpose of monitoring the technical performance of the private operator
        against the indicators set out under the concession contract. The economic regulator, a
        national government agency, approved tariff adjustments according to the formula set out
        by the concession contract.

     1.2 How PPPs Are Used: Sectors and Services
     PPPs have been used in a wide range of sectors, to provide many different kinds of assets and services.
     As noted in the introduction to this Reference Guide, there are two primary defining characteristics of the
     sectors and services for which PPPs are used: first, that the project constitutes or contributes to provision of
     public assets and services, and second, the project involves long-life assets concomitant with the term of
     the PPP contract.

     In practice the definition of ‘public services’ may vary from country to country, and over time. The material
     presented in this Reference Guide is neutral to this definition; considering as ‘public services’ any service
     that the relevant government considers its responsibility to provide or ensure is provided. The focus on
     long-term assets reflects the long-term nature of a PPP contract. For the most part this means PPPs deal
     with fixed assets; but may also include related long-life assets that are somewhat purpose or site-specific,
     such as train rolling stock. Table 1.2: PPPs by Sector—Examples and Resources below provides just a few
     examples, and overview resources, to give readers an idea of the range of worldwide experience with PPPs.

     Some countries choose to focus their use of PPPs to certain sectors within this broad definition, as described
     in Section 2.1 PPP Policy. This can reflect priorities for investment or for improvement in service performance,
     or prioritize sectors in which PPPs are expected to be most successful.

     Conversely, some countries also define certain sectors, or services within sectors, for which PPPs will not be
     used. These are sometimes called ‘core’ services—that is, services that should be provided exclusively by
     the government, and so should not be delegated to the private sector through a PPP. In practice, definitions
     of ‘core’ services vary depending on local preferences and perceptions. For example, in the healthcare
     sector in the United Kingdom, PPPs have been used to construct hospitals and provide ancillary services,
     but the ‘core’ medical services remain publicly-run [#178]. On the other hand, the pioneering PPP hospital
     project in Lesotho included the provision by the private operator of the full range of health services [#155].

     Useful resources providing cross-sector overviews of PPP experience in developing countries include:
     •	 Farquharson et al’s book on PPPs in emerging markets [#95] includes case studies of PPPs for a new
        hospital in Mexico, an upgraded hospital in South Africa, a water concession in the Philippines, a water
        and electricity services concession in Gabon, a new metro line in Sao Paulo, Brazil, an airport expansion
        in Jordan, and a review of the PPP program in national highways in India

1.3 Infrastructure Challenges and How PPPs Can Help
Inadequate infrastructure is a constraint on growth worldwide, particularly in developing countries.
Infrastructure services are often inadequate to meet demand, resulting in congestion or service rationing.
Infrastructure services are also often of low quality or reliability, while many areas are simply un-served.

This poor infrastructure performance reflects pervasive challenges facing governments. First, most countries
simply are not spending enough to provide the infrastructure needed. Secondly, poor planning and
coordination, weak analysis underpinning project selection, pursuit of political gain, and corruption, mean
that the limited resources are often spent on the wrong projects. Moreover, the delivery of infrastructure
assets and services often disappoints—construction of new assets costs more and takes longer than
expected, and service delivery is weak. Finally, infrastructure assets are often poorly maintained, increasing
costs and reducing benefits.


How PPPs can help
This section examines whether and how PPPs can help overcome some of these pervasive challenges,
as illustrated in Figure 1.3: What’s Wrong with Infrastructure and How PPPs Can Help. Under the right
circumstances, PPPs can mobilize additional sources of funding and financing for infrastructure. By
subjecting assumptions to the market test of attracting private finance, PPPs can go some way to improving
project selection. Countries with relatively long PPP histories have found that PPPs manage construction
better than traditional procurement, with projects coming in on time and on budget more often—typically
attributed to the incentives created by the PPP structure. Finally, the longer-term investment perspective
under PPP contracts can also help to ensure adequate maintenance keeps assets in a serviceable condition.

     The mechanisms by which PPP can help improve infrastructure delivery are often summarized as ‘value
     drivers’—that is, how using PPPs to provide infrastructure can achieve value for money. These value drivers—
     as described in Box 1.2: PPP Value Drivers are often integrated into PPP policies.


     PPP limitations, pitfalls, and complementary measures needed
     There are problems that PPPs cannot solve, or that PPPs may exacerbate. First, PPPs may appear to relieve
     funding problems more than is actually the case, as the government’s fiscal commitments to PPPs can
     be unclear. This can lead to governments accepting higher fiscal commitments and risk under PPPs than
     would be consistent with prudent public financial management. While PPPs can contribute to better project
     analysis and adoption of innovative ideas and practices, responsibility for planning and project selection
     still remains primarily with the public sector—moreover, the unclear fiscal costs and contractual inflexibility
     of PPPs can make these tasks more difficult. The advantages of private sector efficiency in managing
     infrastructure, and improved incentives to carry out regular maintenance, also depend on effective PPP
     contracting and procurement by the government.

     These limitations mean that PPPs cannot be seen as a panacea to solve infrastructure performance problems.
     Figure 1.3: What’s Wrong with Infrastructure and How PPPs Can Help also highlights other important
     ingredients for improved infrastructure delivery. Sound public decision-making resulting from adequate
     capacity and governance are necessary prerequisites for successful PPPs or public investment projects.
     Evidence suggests that improved management could go a long way to reducing infrastructure shortfalls,
     by making better use of existing infrastructure and more efficient use of public resources on new projects.
     Ultimately many governments may simply need to commit more resources to investing in infrastructure.

     This section describes each of the four problems with infrastructure project implementation shown in Figure
     1.3: What’s Wrong with Infrastructure and How PPPs Can Help describing whether and how PPPs may be
     able to help, as well as PPP limitations or pitfalls that may exacerbate the problem.




          Box 1.2: PPP Value Drivers

          PPP ‘value drivers’ are the ways in which PPP can improve value for money in infrastructure
          provision. They include the following:

          •	 Whole-of-life costing—full integration, under the responsibility of one party, of up-front design
             and construction with ongoing service delivery, operation, maintenance and refurbishment,
             can reduce total project costs. Full integration incentivizes the single party to complete each
             project function (design, build, operate, maintain) in a way that minimizes total costs

          •	 Risk transfer—risk retained by the Government in owning and operating infrastructure
             typically carries substantial, and often, unvalued cost. Allocating some of the risk to a private
             party which can better manage it, can reduce the project’s overall cost to government
                                                           MODULE 1 PPP Basics - What and Why                  33




     Upfront commitment to adequate maintenance, and predictability and transparency of
     whole-of-life costs—a PPP requires an upfront commitment to the whole-of-life cost of providing
     the asset over its lifetime, building in appropriate maintenance. This both provides budgetary
     predictability over the life of the infrastructure, and reduces the risks of funds not being made
     available for maintenance after the project is constructed

     •	 Focus on service delivery—allows a sponsoring department or agency to enter into a long-
        term contract for services to be delivered when and as required. Management in the PPP firm
        is then focused on the service to be delivered without having to consider other objectives or
        constraints typical in the public sector

     •	 Innovation—specifying outputs in a contract, rather than prescribing inputs, provides wider
        opportunity for innovation. Competitive procurement of these contracts incentivizes bidders
        to develop innovative solutions for meeting these specifications

     •	 Asset utilization—private parties are motivated to use a single facility to support multiple
        revenue streams, reducing the cost of any particular service from the facility

     •	 Mobilization of additional funding—charging users for services can bring in more revenue,
        and can sometime be done better or more easily with private operation than in the public
        sector. Additionally, PPPs can provide alternative sources of financing for infrastructure,
        where governments face financing constraints

     •	 Accountability—government payments are conditional on the private party providing the
        specified outputs at the agreed quality, quantity, and timeframe. If performance requirements
        are not met, service payments to the private sector party may be abated.

     The Partnerships Victoria’s Practitioner’s Guide [#19] published in 2001 clearly set value
     drivers as the basis for the State of Victoria, Australia’s PPP program. PricewaterhouseCoopers
     (PWC)’s paper on the “PPP promise” [#208, pages 13-34] and Deloitte’s paper on PPPs [#68,
     pages 5-9] both succinctly describe these benefits of PPP.




1.3.1 Insufficient Funds
Infrastructure is typically under-funded—that is, most countries are not investing enough to meet
infrastructure needs and support economic growth, suggesting economically beneficial projects are not
being implemented. This problem is particularly prevalent in developing countries.

Various studies have identified and tried to quantify this ‘funding gap’. For example:
•	 In 2010, the World Bank’s diagnostic study of infrastructure in Africa estimated that Sub-Saharan Africa
   needed to spend US$93 billion a year on infrastructure, of which only US$45 billion was already being met
34   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




         through existing sources—such as government spending, user charges, private sector investment, and
         other external sources—creating a total funding gap of US$48 billion [#106, pages 6-9, and 65-86]
     •	 According to the 2013 IDB infrastructure strategy, the additional investment needed in infrastructure
        in Latin America amounted to US$100 billion per year—2 percent of regional GDP [#152]
     •	 This funding gap is not unique to developing countries—a 2007 OECD report on Infrastructure to
        2030 identified a widening gap between the infrastructure investment needed for the future and the
        capacity of the public sector to meet those requirements from traditional sources [#192, Chapter 1].
     •	 McKinsey [#179] estimates $57 trillion in infrastructure investment will be globally required between 2013
        and 2030—simply to keep up with projected global GDP growth. The $57 trillion required investment is
        more than the estimated value of today’s worldwide infrastructure.

     As noted in the World Bank Africa infrastructure diagnostic study referenced above, the funding gap can
     itself be a symptom of other problems in infrastructure delivery. The authors found that US$17 billion, or 35
     percent of the funding gap, can be attributed to inefficiency in existing spending due to poor governance,
     poor planning of investments, under-investment in maintenance, under-charging for services, and operating
     inefficiencies [#106, pages 65-86].


     How PPPs can help: infrastructure funding and finance
     Many governments turn to PPPs because they recognize that more investment in infrastructure is needed,
     but the government cannot ‘afford’ to undertake additional infrastructure projects through traditional
     public procurement. Although this is one of the most common motivations for using PPPs, it is also among
     the most debated. The extent to which PPPs genuinely enable governments to increase spending on
     infrastructure depends on the nature of the project in question, and of a government’s particular funding
     and financing constraints.

     Some types of PPP can help increase the funding available for infrastructure—that is, bring in more
     revenue to pay for infrastructure services, including:
     •	 Increased revenue from user fees—by introducing user charges, or reducing leakage in the collection
        of charges. For example, the N4 Toll Road in Mozambique and South Africa was developed as a toll
        road under a PPP, since neither government had the funds to invest otherwise. Cross-subsidies from
        the South African side to the Mozambican side helped make tolls affordable to users [#93, pages 9-10]
     •	 New revenue streams from greater asset utilization. Raising revenues from alternative uses for
        infrastructure assets can reduce the cost of the infrastructure to government or users.

     Governments can also implement user charges, collect revenues effectively, or find innovative alternative
     uses for infrastructure—as described in Engel, Fischer, and Galetovic’s paper PPPs: When and How [#74,
     pages 7-13]. PPPs therefore do not increase the resources available for infrastructure over the alternative
     of traditional government provision if users are charged the same for the service and those charges are
     collected. However, the authors also note that governments can find it difficult to charge users a cost-
     reflective tariff for publicly-provided services.
                                                             MODULE 1 PPP Basics - What and Why                    35




Some governments use PPPs as a financing mechanism to overcome short-term cash budget constraints,
by spreading the capital cost of a project over its lifetime. Governments implementing cash-based accounting
systems recognize the entire capital cost of infrastructure as expenditure when it is incurred, even if it is in
practice financed by borrowing. PPPs, by contrast, create cash outflows over time—a PWC paper on PPPs
illustrates how the payment profile for a PPP differs from that of a traditionally-financed project [#208, pages
17-19]. This can enable governments facing short-term cash budget constraints to undertake infrastructure
investment sooner. This accounting advantage for PPPs disappears under a full accrual accounting system,
in which capital investments are depreciated over time.

Finally, PPPs may be able to help governments to overcome public sector borrowing constraints.
Governments often face a borrowing constraint—which may arise from prudent public financial management
policies—that means that even commercially viable, fully ‘user pays’ infrastructure projects cannot be
implemented in the public sector. Under a PPP the project is financed by private sector rather than public
sector borrowing, which may in some circumstances enable a government to overcome this constraint
(although as noted in the following section, such projects typically create contingent liabilities that may also
affect the sustainability of the government’s debt and fiscal position).

Engel, Fischer, and Galetovic’s paper [#74, page 9] suggests the extent to which PPPs can help relieve
borrowing constraints depends on the nature of the constraint. PPPs can help relieve short-term liquidity
constraints, enabling commercially viable user pays PPPs to be built. Engel, Fischer, and Galetovic argue,
however, that PPPs are less likely to help when a government cannot borrow because it is considered
insolvent—in this case, it may be difficult for the government to credibly enter into a long-term contract
giving up a potential source of future revenue, so a PPP may not be considered viable by investors. On the
other hand, in a 2011 paper on Chile’s PPP Experience, Fischer describes how multilaterals’ involvement
in a PPP can improve the credibility of the government’s commitment to the contract—increasing the
potential of PPP to help governments overcome debt constraints [#97, pages 17-18, and 27-28].

The extent to which using PPP can enable governments to overcome borrowing constraints also depends on
how the PPP is accounted for. As described in Section 2.4.4: Fiscal Accounting and Reporting for PPPs, while
international norms and standards continue to evolve, PPP assets and liabilities are increasingly recognized
in the government’s accounts and financial statistics. In this case, financing of PPPs would be subject to the
same constraints as public borrowing for infrastructure projects.


PPP pitfalls: using PPP to bypass public financial management controls
While there are some instances in which PPPs can increase the ‘fiscal space’ available for infrastructure, these
are in practice very limited. In the case of government-pays PPP projects, the cost of the infrastructure is
ultimately met from the public purse either way—in practice, the payment stream to repay a debt-financed
public procurement may be very similar to a stream of availability payments under a PPP for the same project.

Absent real efficiency gains, this means the apparent fiscal advantages of PPP arise from accounting quirks—
the limitations of cash budgeting, or the definition of public sector debt. At best, this can create budgeting
issues; at worst, it can enable governments to use PPP to bypass their own prudent public borrowing and
budget limits—creating a temptation to spend more now, in response to political and other pressures to
deliver new and improved infrastructure.
36   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     Abrantes de Sousa’s paper on Portugal’s PPP experience [#1] describes how inadequate control of the
     PPP process meant the Government of Portugal took on significant fiscal exposure to its PPP contracts,
     contributing to its 2011 fiscal crisis. Abrantes de Sousa describes how the PPP program has created budget
     problems, and highlights the incentives faced by agencies to use PPPs simply to loosen budget constraints.
     The United Kingdom’s Private Finance Initiative (PFI—a large British PPP program) has also come under
     criticism for concealing the cost of the government’s obligations. A House of Lords Select Committee
     inquiry into PFI found many witnesses imputed the choice to use PFI to the fact that the government’s
     commitments under these contracts were often not recognized as part of public debt [#248, pages 16-18].

     Recognizing these challenges, the treatment of PPP in public sector accounts has evolved over time. The
     latest public sector accounting standards require most PPP assets and liabilities to be included in government
     balance sheets, as described in Section 2.4: Public Financial Management Frameworks for PPPs. However, at
     the time a PPP project is approved, the future payment commitments still may not be included in budgets and
     expenditure plans, which often do not look more than one to three years ahead. Sections 2.4 and 2.4.1 provide
     guidance on how governments can manage the fiscal implications of PPPs to help avoid these problems.


     PPP pitfalls: fiscal risk
     Even where a PPP is expected to generate additional resources—for example, by charging users for
     services—governments typically bear or share certain project risks. For example, governments may provide
     guarantees on particular risk factors such as demand, exchange rates, or certain costs; while PPP contracts
     often contain compensation clauses in case of termination of the agreement for a range of reasons.

     Accepting these risks could be consistent with good risk allocation, as described in Section 3.3. However,
     doing so creates contingent liabilities for government—the cost of which can be harder to assess than the
     direct liabilities and upfront capital costs created by a traditional government investment project. As a
     result, governments often take on significantly more fiscal risk under PPP projects than they had expected,
     or than would be consistent with prudent fiscal management.

     In this context, the influence of optimism bias on project decision-making (see Section 1.3.2 Poor Planning
     and Project Selection) can be exacerbated—for example, a government may agree to provide a demand
     guarantee for a project, as optimistic forecasts mean it appears to have no cost. Contracting authorities can
     also have an incentive to over-estimate demand in order to ‘hide’ the need for subsidies and push through
     projects that are not really viable. The cumulative impact over several PPP projects can create substantial
     fiscal risk. Moreover, public resources may go into projects that do not really provide value for money, since
     costs are higher or benefits lower than initially expected.

     Irwin’s book on government guarantees [#161, Chapters 2 and 3] provides examples of how guarantees
     have been used, in some cases creating large exposure for the government, and describes some of the
     reasons governments make bad decisions regarding guarantees.

     In addition to the government’s explicit liabilities such as guarantees, PPPs can give rise to implicit liabilities—
     that is, non-contractual liabilities that arise from moral obligation or public expectations for government
     intervention—that create further fiscal risk (see [#206]). Weak contracts and ineffective enforcement can mean
                                                            MODULE 1 PPP Basics - What and Why                    37




that governments fail to really achieve risk transfer to the private sector. Again, this means that governments
end up bearing significantly more risk than they had expected when projects were initially implemented.

Box 1.3: Excessive Fiscal Risk—Examples from Colombia, Korea, Mexico, United Kingdom provides examples
of PPPs for which the government ended up making large, unexpected payments, either as a result of called
guarantees or realization of implicit liabilities




     Box 1.3: Excessive Fiscal Risk—Examples from Colombia, Korea, Mexico, United Kingdom

     Governments often provide guarantees to PPP projects, which often cost more than expected.
     For example:

     •	 In the 1990s, the Government of Colombia guaranteed revenue on toll roads and an airport,
        as well as payments by utilities that entered into long-term power-purchase agreements with
        independent power producers. Lower-than-expected demand and other problems required
        the government to make payments of US$2 billion by 2005.(1)

     •	 Also in the 1990s, the South Korean government guaranteed 90 percent of forecast revenue
        for 20 years on a privately financed road linking the capital, Seoul, to a new airport at Incheon.
        When the road opened, traffic revenue turned out to be less than half the forecast. The
        government has had to pay tens of millions of dollars every year.(2)

     PPP projects can also create substantial implicit liabilities for governments. When PPP projects
     are financially distressed, governments can be under significant pressure to bail them out, to
     avoid disruptions in service. For example:

     •	 In the five years between 1989 and 1994, Mexico embarked on an ambitious road building
        program, awarding more than 50 concessions for 5,500 km of toll roads. The concessions
        were highly leveraged, because equity contributions were made in the form of “sweat equity”
        for the construction instead of in cash. Debt financing for the projects was on a floating-rate
        basis and provided by local banks—many of them government owned—which might have
        faced government pressure to lend. By 1997, a combination of lower than forecasted traffic
        volumes and interest rate rises pushed the government to restructure the entire toll road
        program and bailout the concessions. In total, the government took over 25 concessions and
        assumed US$7.7billion in debt(3)

     •	 The United Kingdom National Air Traffic Services (NATS) was partially privatized, to separate
        the air traffic control functions from the Civil Aviation Authority. Under a PPP arrangement,
        NATS was to be paid a fee based on airline traffic volumes. The PPP company took on
        considerable debt for its investments and operations. After the September 11th attacks,
        airline traffic fell below forecasts and the company was in danger of not meeting its debt
        obligations. To reduce the perceived risk of a disruption in service, the United Kingdom
        Government injected GBP100 million of equity into the project company.(4)

     1.3.2 Poor Planning and Project Selection
     Limited resources are often spent on poorly-selected projects that fail to achieve benefits concomitant with
     their cost. The result can be under-used assets and poor service delivery at a higher cost than necessary.
     These systematic problems result from:

     •	 Poor planning and coordination—good sector and cross-sector planning and coordination is needed
        to ensure that the ‘best’ projects—those that represent value for money, enable integrated regional
        development, and provide customers with the services they desire—are consistently selected. Without
        sound plans, responsible agencies will not have the full view of potential projects that could be
        implemented and will not know the sequence in which to implement the projects to achieve the best
        value for money, and cross-sector coordination will be weak. Box 1.4: Mumbai Water—Example of Poor
        Planning in Infrastructure provides an example of how weak infrastructure planning can mean projects fail
        to achieve value for money. McKinsey [#179] report on infrastructure investment—identifying $57 trillion
        globally required between 2013 and 2030—notes that scaling up best practice could save an average of
        $1 trillion a year in infrastructure costs during that period

     •	 Flawed analysis—the analysis underpinning project selection is often flawed, so projects that appeared
        to be cost-benefit justified turn out not to be so in practice. Benefits are often over-estimated, resulting
        in projects that are larger or more complex than is justified by demand for services, while costs are
        often under-estimated. The United Kingdom Government’s Green Book on project assessment
        [#238, pages 29-30] acknowledges this as a systematic problem and highlights the need to correct for
        ‘optimism bias’ in project analysis. UK Treasury supplementary guidance on optimism bias [#239]
        presented evidence on the extent of optimism bias dating from the early 2000s—although more recent
        evidence from the UK notes that public procurement practices have since improved—see for example
        [#242, #243] and [#243]. A global series of studies of large transport projects by Flyvbjerg [#101, #102,
        #103] found that costs are systematically under-estimated, and benefits often over-estimated:

         -	   A study of 258 transport projects found that actual costs were on average 28 percent higher than
              planned costs—and 65 percent higher on average for projects outside Europe and North America

         -	   A study of 25 rail projects found traffic was heavily over-estimated, at over twice actual traffic, on
              average. The accuracy of traffic forecasts for 183 road projects was also found to be highly variable,
              but without a tendency to over-estimate.

     •	 Politics or personal gain interfering with the project selection process; increasing costs, or diverting
        funds to less beneficial projects. An IMF analysis of corruption in public investment in infrastructure
                                                           MODULE 1 PPP Basics - What and Why                   39




    found corruption tends to create a bias towards capital spending projects, and increase their size and
    complexity—reducing the productivity of that investment [#225].

These factors often feed into each other. For example, weak analysis or poor planning can enable badly-
chosen projects to be pushed through for political or personal gain, as described in the World Bank’s
sourcebook on deterring corruption in the water sector [#279, Chapter 6]. Flyvbjerg’s studies also
emphasize, with examples, that costs and benefits can be deliberately misrepresented, to push through
projects for political or organizational reasons [#101].




     Box 1.4: Mumbai Water—Example of Poor Planning in Infrastructure

     The experience of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai provides an example of weak
     planning in the water sector. The Corporation was looking for ways to improve the efficiency of
     its operations. Mumbai is short of water, with supply rationed to around four to six hours a day
     in most parts of the city. Corporation planners were working on new schemes to transport water
     from hundreds of kilometers outside the city. Consultants engaged through the World Bank
     analyzed the cost of achieving a 24 hour water supply in one ward (K-East) entirely with new
     supply, and compared this with the cost of achieving 24 hour water supply through improving
     the distribution system to reduce leakage and theft. The consultants estimated that the cost of
     distribution improvements would be one sixth or less of the cost of bulk supply increments, for
     the same level of service improvements. The size of the discrepancy suggests that the Municipal
     Corporations’ planning had been biased toward large projects.




How PPPs can help
Under the right circumstances, PPPs can help improve infrastructure project selection, by harnessing the
analysis and ideas of private sector investors, whose financial returns depend on getting cost and revenue
forecasts right.

Private investors and lenders undertake their own project analysis based on their experience and strong,
profit-driven incentive to carefully assess benefits and costs. Lenders to project finance transactions, in
particular, carry out extensive project due diligence, as described in Section 1.4 How PPPs Are Financed.
A 2002 Standard and Poor’s study [#24] found that traffic forecasts for toll roads commissioned by
banks tended to be less optimistic than those commissioned by other agencies, including developers and
governments, although still biased on average.

The PPP tender process can therefore act as a filter for non-viable projects. As described by Engel, Fischer,
and Galetovic [#74], if the private sector sponsor and lenders are being asked to take revenue and cost risk
under a PPP, a non-viable project may simply not attract private interest. For example, a McKinsey report
on infrastructure challenges in India [#124, pages 25-27] notes that several of the National Highways
40   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     Authority of India (NHAI)’s toll road projects have not attracted bidders. In some cases demand forecasts
     were too high, in others bidders found NHAI’s cost estimates to be low, and the project not viable on more
     conservative cost assumptions. Conversely, Engel, Fischer and Galetovic [#74] note that if the government
     is bearing a risk—for example, by providing a demand guarantee—then a non-viable project could still be
     profitable for the private partner, reducing the “filtering ability” of PPPs.

     Experienced private companies can also be well-placed to identify infrastructure needs, and come up with
     innovative ideas to meet them. Accepting unsolicited proposals for PPP projects from private companies
     can be a way to capitalize on these ideas. Box 1.5: Hot lanes in Virginia—An Example of Private Sector
     Innovation provides an example of an innovative project developed from an unsolicited proposal. While
     unsolicited proposals can be a useful source of ideas, in order to improve project selection they need to be
     subject to the same analysis as other major government investments. Section 3.6: Dealing with Unsolicited
     Proposals describes how some governments have introduced policies to encourage unsolicited proposals,
     while subjecting them to rigorous analysis and competition.




          Box 1.5: Hot lanes in Virginia—An Example of Private Sector Innovation

          A portion of the I-495 and I-95 highways—the ‘beltway’ around the Washington, DC metropolitan
          area, and a major North-South corridor—had been in need of repair and expansion to alleviate
          congestion since the early 1990s. The State of Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT)
          initially developed a plan to rehabilitate and expand the highway at a cost of US$3 billion, but
          lack of funding and public opposition over the proposed displacement of over 300 businesses
          and homes had stalled the project.

          In 2002, Fluor, an engineering and construction company, submitted an unsolicited proposal to
          develop High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes on the I-495, as an alternative way to accommodate
          traffic volume. HOT lanes are an innovative technology that allows drivers to pay to avoid traffic.
          The tolled lanes run alongside highway lanes, and are designed to be congestion free. To
          regulate demand for the lanes, tolls for the HOT lanes change depending on traffic conditions.
          When traffic increases, tolls go up. Cars with three or more passengers and buses are allowed
          to use the HOT lanes free of charge. The Fluor proposal reduced the number of business and
          homes displaced from 350 to eight, a major factor in garnering public support for the project. The
          proposal also minimized project costs, by meeting minimum standards for road specifications.

          In 2005, VDOT awarded the PPP agreement to construct the HOT lanes. The total cost of the
          project was US$1.9 billion, compared to the estimated US$3 billion under initial plans developed
          by the government. The State of Virginia contributed US$400 million of this cost. The HOT lanes
          project reached financial close in 2007 and opened in 2012. Building on this experience, VDOT
          went on to make further use of the HOT lane concept, with a second contract awarded in 2011.

PPP limitations and pitfalls—poor planning and project selection

While the PPP process can provide more information and additional analysis to inform project selection, the
government remains responsible for choosing which projects to implement. This limits the extent to which
PPPs can help improve project selection. PPPs may even distort investment priorities—low priority projects
may go ahead simply because they are easier to do.

Foremost, PPPs do little to improve planning. Where PPP projects initiate from government, private
companies can only respond by avoiding projects that do not appear viable, as described above. Where
PPP ideas are generated by private investors, these often cannot overcome weaknesses in planning
and coordination between sectors or across regional boundaries. For example, the HOT lanes project
described in Box 1.5: Hot lanes in Virginia—An Example of Private Sector Innovation does not extend
into Maryland, a neighboring state in which half of the beltway is located. Also, in generating project ideas,
private firms focus in those that are financially viable, but may not propose economically beneficial projects
that would require government contributions.

The inflexibility of PPP contracts may also exacerbate sector planning challenges. As described in the United
Kingdom House of Lords’ review of the PPP program [#248, pages 28-29], PPP projects constitute a
long-term commitment, which can be expensive to change if needs change (or were misunderstood in the
first place). Although changes in traditional public procurement also imply added costs, these are typically
lower than under a PPP, since the absence of long-term contractual commitments allows easier recourse to
the market and competitive pressure.

There are limitations on the extent to which PPPs can improve project analysis. First, the private sector is
also not immune to optimism bias. The Standard & Poor’s analysis described above shows lenders make
more realistic assumptions than public agencies—nonetheless they still overestimate traffic forecasts. The
more conservative traffic forecasts commissioned by banks still overestimate traffic by almost 20 percent—
see [#25]. In Spain [#270], traffic estimates by concessionaires that were awarded several PPP toll road
contracts have proven to be even more optimistic—revenue generated by the companies could barely
cover the interest of the outstanding debt.

Secondly, where the private party to a PPP is not bearing traffic risk, or other project risks, the incentive for
rigorous analysis is weaker. PPP structures can even weaken government incentives for rigorous analysis, by
obscuring the costs and risks the government bears (see the pitfalls described under Section 1.3.1: Insufficient
Funds.

Finally, PPPs can provide an opportunity for corruption, which may bias project selection. Where project
selection is not based on analysis but rather influenced by corruption or pursuit of political gain, PPPs are
also likely to be affected. Guidance on assessing corruption risk, and mitigating it, is provided in a series of
World Bank sourcebooks on governance in the water, transport, and power sectors [#279, #280, #281].

The policies and processes presented in Modules 2 and 3 of this Guide, and in the references listed, can
help governments avoid the planning and project selection challenges that can undermine the effectiveness
of PPP projects.

     1.3.3 Weak Management
     A common rationale for involving the private sector in infrastructure provision is that the private sector
     is more efficient and effective at managing infrastructure construction projects, and at managing service
     delivery once the assets are in place.

     The quality of infrastructure service delivery by government entities is often constrained by limited capacity
     and weak management incentives. This increases the cost of infrastructure—for example, the World Bank’s
     Africa infrastructure diagnostic study [#106, pages 71-74] estimates that inefficiencies in state-owned
     utilities and infrastructure providers in Sub-Saharan Africa cost around US$6 billion a year. It also reduces
     the benefits users get from the service.

     Studies comparing PPPs and publicly-procured or run infrastructure have found that PPPs can achieve better
     results in both construction of new infrastructure assets, and in infrastructure service delivery, as described
     in turn below. Still, achieving these benefits, and ensuring they translate into lower infrastructure costs
     for taxpayers and users, depends on the government structuring, procuring, and implementing the PPP
     effectively; and could be undermined where weak government or private sector capacity results in poorly-
     run tender processes or poorly drafted contracts, and frequent re-negotiation, as also described below.


     How PPPs can help—improved construction of new assets
     PPPs have been found to reduce construction time and cost overruns for new infrastructure assets, compared
     to traditional public procurement.

     In the United Kingdom, the National Audit Office surveyed the proportion of PPP projects coming in over
     budget or late, and compared this with previous assessments of the performance of publicly-procured
     projects. PPPs out-performed public projects, particularly on cost—although the difference was lower in
     2008 than in 2003. As also described in the House of Lords’ review of the PPP program, improvements
     in public procurement in the United Kingdom may be narrowing the gap with PPPs [#248, pages 19-20].

     In Australia, two studies have broken down the project development process to allow more detailed
     comparison. PPPs consistently perform better in achieving lower project cost over-runs. Comparing the
     timing of project delivery, both PPPs and traditionally-procured projects both took longer than expected.
     These studies support the claim regarding higher accuracy of estimates built into signed PPP contracts
     relative to traditional procurement. However, they are inconclusive on whether the PPPs projects are
     necessarily more economical than traditionally procured projects. The studies suggest delays occur at
     different stages of the process. The complex contracting process means PPPs can experience delay at an
     earlier stage in the process, but tend to come in on time once contracted. Publicly-procured projects may
     be contracted more quickly, but this is more than offset, on average, by delays in implementation.

     A selection of these studies is summarized in Table 1.3: Comparing PPP and Public Procurement in the
     United Kingdom and Table 1.4: Comparing PPP and Public Procurement in Australia.
                                                                    MODULE 1 PPP Basics - What and Why                      43

Construction companies interviewed by the United Kingdom National Audit Office indicated that the PPPs
‘impose a greater discipline’ in regard to cost certainty for projects. This is because PPPs usually do not
allow for contract price to be adjusted for changes in costs, and private financiers have greater scrutiny
over the specifications of the project. That is, private companies’ returns on a PPP depend on bringing the
project in on time and on budget—creating stronger incentives than under public procurement, where
changes to project cost are often at the expense of the contracting authority. In turn, this means private
companies make more careful and conservative estimates of costs in the first place, helping reduce the
optimism bias described in Section 1.3.2: Poor Planning and Project Selection.


How PPPs can help—improved service delivery and management
There have been relatively few studies on the impact of private sector participation on infrastructure
operation. Nonetheless, available evidence suggests that private sector participation can improve service
delivery and management, compared to government-run infrastructure services.

For example, a comprehensive 2009 study by the World Bank [#109] analyzed the effect of introducing
private sector participation through concessions or full privatization of utilities. The study used econometric
analysis to assess performance of over 1,200 water and electricity utilities, in 71 developing and transition
countries. The study found significant efficiency gains when private sector participation was introduced—
including reduced water losses and increased staff efficiency. These gains came alongside improvements in
service delivery, with increased coverage and daily hours of service. A study by Marin of private participation
in urban water utilities, also in 2009, analyzed the performance of 65 large water PPPs and similar contracts
(including management contracts) in developing countries worldwide. Marin also found that introducing a
private operator consistently improved operational efficiency and service quality [#180].

     PPP limitations and pitfalls—PPP implementation failures
     PPPs can achieve efficiency improvements in the delivery of infrastructure, as described above. However,
     creating the incentives to achieve efficiency gains, and ensuring the public and users reap the benefit,
     depends on the government effectively structuring, procuring, and managing the PPP project over
     its lifetime—to achieve competitive tension, real risk transfer, and ensure anticipated performance
     improvements materialize in practice. This can be difficult where low public sector capacity means that
     governments lack the resources and skill to structure and manage PPPs well.

     Implementing a competitive procurement process for PPPs can be difficult. As described in detail in Module
     3 of this Reference Guide, governments need to approach the market with a well-structured PPP project,
     under an appropriate tender process. Where this is not the case, bidders may simply not participate; or may
     make bids that are either incomparable with each other (as based on varying assumptions) or deliberately
     low, with a view to resolving uncertainties through post-bid negotiation. This can be a challenge even in
     countries with long PPP experience. For example, the House of Lords’ Review of PPPs in the United
     Kingdom [#248, pages 20-21] describes how negotiations at the preferred bidder stage led to price increases
     in many PPP projects.

     Guasch’s comprehensive review of PPP experience in Latin America [#123] highlights a further challenge
     with achieving the benefits of competition—the incidence of renegotiation of PPP contracts. Of a sample
     of over 1000 concessions granted in the Latin America and Caribbean between 1985 and 2000, Guasch
     found that 10 percent of electricity concessions, 55 percent of transport concessions, and 75 percent of
     water concessions were renegotiated. These renegotiations took place an average of 2.2 years after the
     concessions were awarded.

     Guasch suggests this high incidence of renegotiation soon after concession award may reflect flaws in the
     initial tender processes, weak regulation, or opportunism on the part of the private party or government.
     Most renegotiations were favorable to the operator—for example, resulting in increased tariffs, or reduced
     or delayed investment obligations. In these cases, the efficiency savings from cost discipline may not have
     been passed on to the public sector.

     Abrantes de Sousa’s review of the PPP program in Portugal describes a similar tendency [#1, pages
     9-10]. Abrantes de Sousa notes that the government’s apparent willingness to renegotiate contracts
     undermines the competitive process, with bidders engaging in strategic bidding to win the contract, in
     order to renegotiate it later without competition.

     Moreover, effective management of a PPP transaction is only the start of the process. For a PPP to be
     sustainable over the long term requires a consistent level of commitment and capacity from the government
     and private parties over time. Where this is not the case, whether due to changing government priorities or

     Box 1.6: When PPPs fail—The case of the 1993 water concession in Buenos Aires

     In the 1990’s Argentina implemented a major concessions program in the water sector. Water and
     sanitation concession agreements with private operators were signed in 28 percent of the country’s
     municipalities, covering 60 percent of the population. The more widely known contract was the
     concession for public water and sewerage services for Greater Buenos Aires, signed in 1993 with
     a consortium led by the French firm Suez. The concession soon showed positive results—labor
     productivity almost tripled, service coverage increased, reliability and responsiveness improved,
     and the price of service fell. However, teething problems also appeared—poor availability of
     information to users and the public, lack of transparency in regulatory decisions, and the ad hoc
     nature of government interventions. Consumers were not reassured that their welfare was being
     protected, and the sustainability of the concession was in doubt.

     There is evidence that the private operator increased investment, and that it expanded access—
     Suez claims it extended access to water to 2 million people, and access to sanitation to one
     million people. In 1999 it started programs to provide access to slums—but soon the Argentinian
     economic crisis disrupted the plans.

     After the 2001 economic crisis, the Argentinian government froze water tariffs, condemning most
     concessions to renegotiation, and several of them to early termination—as was the case of the
     Buenos Aires concession, which was terminated in 2006.

 Infrastructure assets are often under-maintained, as maintenance is poorly planned, or planned maintenance
is deferred. Political consideration or pursuit of personal gain often biases infrastructure expenditure towards
new assets over maintenance, as described in an IMF analysis of corruption in infrastructure [#225].

Inadequate maintenance increases lifetime costs, while also decreasing benefits. Regular maintenance is
usually the lower-cost way to keep infrastructure assets at a serviceable standard, compared to the alternative of
allowing quality to degrade until major rehabilitation work is needed. The World Bank’s Africa infrastructure
diagnostic study estimates that preventative maintenance for the roads sector in Africa could save $2.6 billion
a year in capital expenditures rehabilitation [#106, page 15]. In South Africa, a review of road maintenance
by the South African National Roads Agency indicates that delaying road maintenance for three years leads
to increased costs of six times the original costs of preventative maintenance. If road maintenance is delayed
for five years, costs rise to 18 times the preventive cost [#218, page 36].
46   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     The poor performance of under-maintained infrastructure can be costly for users. For example, an engineers’
     association report from the United States [#2, pages 1-4] estimates that poor road conditions cost motorists
     $67 billion a year in repairs and increased operating costs, while leaking pipes lose an estimated seven
     billion gallons of clean drinking water a day.


     How PPPs can help—improved maintenance
     PPPs can improve maintenance of infrastructure assets by improving incentives for both private contractors
     and governments to make quality maintenance a priority.

     PPPs bundle construction or rehabilitation and on-going maintenance into a single contract. This helps
     incentivize the private company to build the asset to a high quality upfront, reducing the need for
     maintenance (resulting in a lower ‘whole of life’ cost of the asset), as described in a 2009 United Kingdom
     National Audit Office report on PPP performance [#253, page 8].

     The private party then faces a strong incentive to carry out adequate maintenance. In the case where its
     revenue depends on user-fees, the operator has an incentive to make sure the asset meets performance
     requirements and attracts users. Under government-pays PPP, the operator’s revenue typically depends
     both on the availability of the asset over time, and the operators ability to meet specific levels of service
     quality. In this case, PPP contracting also forces governments to commit upfront to making adequate
     funding available to maintain an asset over time. This can help overcome the tendency to cut maintenance
     budgets down the line and thereby delay necessary maintenance and rehabilitation.

     Some types of PPP or related contracts reward improved maintenance directly. For example, Frauendorfer
     and Liemberger describe performance-based contracts for non-revenue water reduction [#107, pages
     34-37]. Infrastructure provides examples of performance-based maintenance contracts, which share many
     characteristics of PPP, and which have proved effective at improving maintenance in the road sector.




          Box 1.7: Performance Based Road Contracts—Improving Maintenance of Infrastructure

          Performance-based road contracts have proved successful in improving the quality of road
          maintenance—a pervasive problem in many countries. For example:

          •	 Chad suffers from poor maintenance of its road network because of poor design of maintenance
             contracts with private contractors, as well as lack of domestic funding. In 2001, Chad awarded
             a performance-based maintenance contract for 441km of unpaved roads (7 percent of the
             country’s road network), which pays a lump-sum fee per kilometer of road maintained to pre-
             defined standards. The roads have since met and even exceeded performance standards
                                                                        MODULE 1 PPP Basics - What and Why                                47




      Argentina also has experience with private-sector performance contracts on their road networks.
      The performance-based contracts have improved maintenance and reliability of the roads up to
      a specified standard with the government, and have saved the Government of Argentina almost
      30 percent in additional capital expenditures for rehabilitation.

PPP limitations—need for effective contract design and regulation
In some circumstances, the ability of PPPs to create incentives to improve maintenance will be limited. This
may be the case:

•	 In user-pays PPPs where the PPP company is a monopoly provider, or for government-pays PPPs, if
   quality and safety standards are not carefully specified, monitored, and enforced. Engel, Fischer,
   and Galetovic [#74] note the importance of effective monitoring to achieving the potential benefit of
   improved maintenance

•	 If the contractor does not have much equity or other financial stake in the project, meaning it would
   rather walk away from a contract than spend on costly maintenance. This risk is described further in
   Section 1.4.2: Considerations for Government, on the danger of over-leveraged projects

•	 Towards the end of the contract, when the contractor knows it will not reap the benefit of further
   maintenance investments.

These limitations can be mitigated through good contract design, as described further in Section 3.4:
Designing PPP Contracts.

1.4 How PPPs Are Financed
Transferring responsibility to the private sector for mobilizing finance for infrastructure investment is one of
the major differences between PPPs and conventional procurement. Where this is the case, the private party
to the PPP is therefore responsible for identifying investors and developing the finance structure for the
project. However, it is important for public sector practitioners to understand private financing structures for
infrastructure and also to consider the potential implications for government. This section:

•	 Provides a brief introduction to how private finance of PPP projects can be structured (Section 1.4.1).

•	 Highlights points that governments need to bear in mind when procuring a privately-financed PPP—that
   is, ways in which the government might need to enable or control how the private party raises finance,
   to help ensure the project is implemented successfully (Section 1.4.2).

•	 Describes different roles for public finance in PPPs—that is, why and how governments may be directly
   involved in the financing of PPPs (Section 1.4.3).
50   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     The chapter on PPP Financing in Farquharson et al’s book on PPPs in emerging markets [#95, Chapter
     5], provides a helpful overview of some of the topics covered in this section. Public-Private Partnerships:
     Principles of Policy and Finance by E. R. Yescombe [#295], and Private Sector Investment in Infrastructure:
     Project Finance, PPP Projects, and Risk by Jeffrey Delmon [#58] are more comprehensive resources that
     cover a wide range of topics on PPP financing. The relevant sections of these books, as well as links to
     additional resources, are provided throughout the section for more information on specific points.


     1.4.1 Finance Structures for PPP
     The private party to most PPP contracts is a specific project company formed for that purpose—often
     called a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). This project company raises finance through a combination of
     equity—provided by the project company’s shareholders—and debt provided by banks, or through bonds
     or other financial instruments. The finance structure is the combination of equity and debt, and contractual
     relationships between the equity holders and lenders.

     Figure 1.4: Typical PPP Project Structure shows a typical finance and contract structure for a PPP project. The
     Government’s primary contractual relationship is with the project company. This may be complemented by
     a direct agreement between contracting authority and lenders; although often this relationship is limited to
     the provisions in favor of the lenders included in the PPP agreement, such as step-in rights or senior debt
     repayment guarantees.

     The initial equity investors, who develop the PPP proposal, are typically called project shareholders. Typical
     equity investors may be project developers, engineering or construction companies, infrastructure
     management companies, and private equity funds. Lenders to PPP projects in developing countries may
     include commercial banks, multilateral and bilateral development banks and finance institutions, and
     institutional investors such as pension funds.

     As shown in Figure 1.4: Typical PPP Project Structure, the project company in turn contracts with firms to
     manage design and construction (usually known as an Engineering, Procurement and Construction, or EPC
     contract), and operations and maintenance (O&M). These contractors may be affiliated with the equity
     investors. Yescombe’s book on PPP finance includes examples of PPP structures for different types of PPP
     [#295, section 1.4].

As described in Farquharson et al’s chapter on PPP financing [#271, page 53], equity investment is ‘first
in, last out’—that is, any project losses are borne first by the equity investors, and lenders suffer only if the
equity investment is lost. This means equity investors accept a higher risk than debt providers, and require
a higher return on their investment.

The aim of the project shareholders and their advisors in developing the finance structure is typically to
minimize the cost of finance for the project. Because equity is more expensive than debt, project shareholders
use a high proportion of debt to finance the project.


Non-recourse project finance for PPPs
Under non-recourse project finance, lenders can be paid only from the project company’s revenues, without
recourse to the equity investors. That is, the project company’s obligations are ring-fenced from those of
the equity investors, and debt is secured on the cash flows of the project. As described in Yescombe’s
chapter on project finance for PPPs [#295] project finance structures typically involve a large proportion of
debt. In many cases, it ranges from 70 to 95 percent of total finance. From the equity investors’ perspective,
this helps manage risk, by limiting exposure to a project, and makes it possible to undertake much larger
projects than would otherwise be the case. For lenders, it means undertaking rigorous due diligence,
focusing on the project cash flow and contractual structure.

There is a large literature on project finance structures, including several comprehensive text books. The
following books provide a starting point for readers interested in exploring the subject further:

     Alternatives to non-recourse project finance
     While helpful for raising finance for large, highly leveraged investments, project finance comes at a cost.
     Interest rates for project-finance debt are more expensive than government borrowing, and often more
     expensive than borrowing by established companies. The transaction cost—setting up the contractual
     structure, and carrying out adequate due diligence—can make it unattractive for smaller deals. For this
     reason, many smaller PPP projects adapt the non-recourse project finance structure, to achieve greater
     contractual flexibility, or lower the financing cost.

     One option is for project shareholders to back up the project company by providing a corporate guarantee
     to the lender, for repayment for all or part of the project debt. Box 1.8: Examples of Project Finance Structure
     with Corporate Guarantees provides examples.




          Box 1.8: Examples of Project Finance Structure with Corporate Guarantees

          In some cases, a project company may be unable to raise finance on a non-recourse basis. One
          option is for a major project shareholder to provide a partial or full guarantee on the project debt.
          For example:

          •	 In 1997, a concession for the eastern section of metro Manila was awarded to the Manila
             Water Company, a consortium led by the Ayala Corporation of the Philippines, with interests
             from United Utilities, Bechtel, and the Mitsubishi Corporation. In the wake of the Asian
             Financial Crisis, the Manila Water Company was unable to raise debt to finance investments
             on a non-recourse project finance-basis, so Ayala provided a corporate guarantee to back up
             the project company

          •	 In 1992, an oil pipeline in Colombia was being developed as a joint-venture between the
             national oil company and international oil companies with the IFC as the main lender. At the
             time, the IFC was concerned about possible guerilla attacks and the project stalled. To move
             forward, the shareholders provided a full loan guarantee on the project.

Another alternative to lower the cost of finance for a PPP is for the government to participate in the
finance structure, as described in Section: 1.4.3: The Role of Public Finance in PPPs. The government—or
a government-owned financial institution—could provide finance as a lender to the project company, or
could provide a guarantee to some or all of the project debt.


1.4.2 Considerations for Government
When a PPP involves private finance, the investor typically has primary responsibility for developing the
finance structure. Nonetheless, there are several ways in which the government may need to influence the
financing structure.

At the most basic level, governments need to ensure that the project design is ‘bankable’—that is, the
project company is able to raise debt. Although the ability to raise debt is a necessary feature, too much
debt can undermine risk-transfer, so governments may want to limit the amount of debt finance (leverage)
allowed. More arcane but still important details include: how to manage risks in going from contract award
to financial close; how to deal with the possibility of refinancing project debt; and how to define step-in
rights for lenders and the government. These points are described in turn below.

Governments may also participate in the finance structure. Governments can provide debt, equity, or
guarantees—either directly, or through government-owned financial institutions such as development
banks and pension funds. Section 1.4.3: The Role of Public Finance in PPPs describes the role of this kind
of public finance in PPPs.


Bankability
The ability of a project to raise finance is often called bankability. ‘Bankable’ really means that a project can
attract not only equity finance from its shareholders, but the required amount of debt. Delmon’s chapter
on bankability [#58, Chapter 4] and Farquharson et al’s chapter on PPP financing [#95, pages 54-57],
both describe the factors banks will consider in deciding whether to lend to a project.

For a project to be bankable, lenders need to be confident that the project company can service the debt.
Under a project finance structure, as described in Section 1.4.1: Finance Structures for PPP, this means
operating cash flows need to be high enough to cover debt service plus an acceptable margin. It also
means that the risk of variation to the cash flows must be highly likely to stay within the margin. Lenders
therefore carefully assess project risks, and how these risks have been allocated between the parties to the
contract.
54   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     If too much risk has been allocated to the private party, lenders will reduce the amount they are prepared
     to lend until the margin of cash flow over debt service is acceptable. When this happens, more equity will
     be needed. At the same time, the project company needs to be expected to generate high enough returns
     to compensate its equity-holders for their level of risk.

     From the government’s perspective, the key considerations for ensuring bankability are therefore the
     technical and financial viability of the project, and appropriate risk allocation. Section 3.2: Appraising PPP
     Projects provides guidance on assessing financial viability of a potential PPP project. Section 3.3: Structuring
     PPP Projects provides guidance and tools for practitioners on risk allocation.

     Moreover, lenders and shareholders both have incentives to reduce their risks and maximize their return.
     This means that in structuring the PPP, the government undertakes a difficult balancing act—ensuring the
     project is bankable, while resisting pressure for the government to accept more risk than necessary.


     Limiting the amount of debt allowed
     Projects shareholders often have an incentive to finance a PPP with a high ratio of debt to equity—that is, to
     achieve high leverage. As Yescombe [#295] describes, higher leverage typically enables equity investors to
     achieve higher returns, and makes it easier to manage the financial structure, since it can be easier to raise
     debt than equity. Moreover, as described in Ehrhardt and Irwin [#72], governments often provide more
     protection to debt investors than to equity investors, providing a further incentive for high leverage. For
     example, governments may provide guarantees on demand designed to ensure revenue can cover debt
     service, or agree to payments in case of early termination that are set equal to the level of debt, such that
     lenders are repaid even in case of default by the project sponsor on its obligations under the contract.

     However, highly-leveraged projects can also be more vulnerable to default and bankruptcy, as also
     described in Ehrhardt and Irwin [#72, pages 35-38]. Box 1.9: Example of an Over-Leveraged PPP—Victoria
     Trams and Trains below provides an example of a highly leveraged PPP that resulted in default.

     To ensure a sustainable level of leverage, and large enough equity stake in the project, governments can
     consider introducing a minimum equity ratio for PPPs. As Ehrhardt and Irwin [#72, pages 49-50] note, this
     can be particularly important if the government is also providing guarantees that are designed to protect
     lenders’ investment. However, restricting an investor’s ability to choose its capital structure can increase the
     cost of capital, as described in a World Bank Gridline note on financing Indian infrastructure [#125, page
     2]. The authors also note the importance of structuring any guarantees or termination payment clauses to
     avoid creating incentives for high levels of debt and leverage.

     Box 1.9: Example of an Over-Leveraged PPP—Victoria Trams and Trains

     The State Government of Victoria awarded five franchises (similar to concessions) for operation of
     trams and commuter rail in Melbourne, and regional trains in the State of Victoria. The government
     expected total savings of A$1.8 billion over the life of the contract. However, the total equity
     contribution, including performance bonds, from the shareholders was only A$135 million, which is
     only 8 percent of the total gains. The payment structure of the PPP relied heavily on the expected
     growth in patronage and reduction in costs. When the growth and cost reductions were not realized,
     the franchisees experienced losses. Because the equity at stake was relatively low, the operators
     could walk away from the franchises, rather than endure the losses trying to improve it. This put the
     government in a position of having to renegotiate the contracts with the existing operators.

Risks in going from award to financial close
A PPP contract is sometimes awarded and signed before the project reaches financial close—that is, before
the finance for the project is fully secured. In the interim period, lenders complete their due diligence
process, including detailed review of the PPP agreements. Loan agreements set ‘conditions precedent’ that
must be in place before the project company can access funds from the loan.

This process creates a risk that the project could be delayed or even fall through, if the winning bidders
are unable to raise finance on the expected terms. As described by Farquharson et al [#95, page 125] the
government may be under pressure to change the contract terms to meet lenders’ requirements, since re-
opening the procurement process at this stage would cause delays and additional transaction costs for the
government.

Governments have a few options available to mitigate this risk. As Farquharson et al also explains, bidders
can be required to provide a bond, which may be called if the preferred bidder fails to achieve financial
close within a certain period. This may encourage bidders to develop more concrete financing plans before
submitting bids. Another option to avoid the risk altogether, as described by Delmon [#58, pages 445-446],
is for governments to require bids with financing commitments already in place (called an ‘underwritten’
bid). In this case, lenders must complete due diligence before the tender process is complete. However,
both these options increase the cost of bidding, which may deter bidders and undermine competition.

Another approach is to introduce stapled financing. Stapled financing is a pre-arranged financing package
for the project, developed by the government and provided to bidders during the tender process. The
winning bidder has the option, but not the obligation, to use the financial package for the project. Stapled
financing is common in Mergers and Acquisition deals, and has been explored by some governments for
infrastructure projects—for example, in Egypt [#116].

     Refinancing of project debt
     ‘Refinancing’ means taking on new debt to pay off existing loans. The project company and its shareholders
     may have two main reasons to refinance debt that was initially used to finance the project.

     First, the project may have been unable to obtain a financing package with a long enough maturity to
     match the project’s length. This could occur because long-term debt was not available at the time when
     the project was awarded, or because lenders viewed the project as too risky to extend credit with a long
     maturity. In this case, the project could proceed with a shorter-term loan, as described in Yescombe’s
     chapter on financial structuring [#295, Chapter 10]. This creates a refinancing risk—that is, the risk that the
     shorter-term loan cannot be refinanced at the expected terms. The PPP contract should specify who bears
     refinancing risk, as described in Section 3.3: Structuring PPP Projects.

     One option to mitigate refinancing risk is ‘take-out financing’, in which a second lender promises to take
     over a loan at some future point—thereby encouraging the original lender to provide longer-term debt
     than might otherwise be the case. For example, the Indian Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL)
     has established a take-out financing scheme for infrastructure projects [#134].

     Refinancing can also provide an opportunity for the project company and its shareholders, if more favorable
     terms become available. Because infrastructure projects have long durations, capital markets could change
     during the life of the project and offer better terms on the existing project debt. Lenders also tend to offer
     better financing terms to projects with demonstrated track records and have already moved past initial risks,
     such as construction. Yescombe’s section on debt refinancing [#295] further describes the potential gains
     to equity investors from refinancing.

     Refinancing with more favorable terms can lower overall costs for users or government, improve returns to
     investors, or both. The government needs to consider upfront how benefits of refinancing will be treated.
     Options include:

     •	 Do nothing—allow equity-holders to gain from refinancing through higher dividend payments

     •	 Share gains between project shareholders and customers, by including in the PPP contract or PPP
        regulation a clause which states that benefits of refinancing must be reflected in the price paid for the
        asset or service

     •	 Building into the PPP contract the right for the government to require or request refinancing of the
        project debt, if it believes that more favorable terms are available in the market.

     Several governments have introduced rules for how PPP refinancing benefits will be treated, as described
     by Yescombe [#295]. For example, in 2004 the United Kingdom’s Treasury introduced into its standard PFI
     contracts a 50:50 split of any refinancing gain between the investors and the government [#235]; this was
     subsequently revised in each version of contract standards [#242]. South Korea has also introduced a similar
     provision in its legislation governing PPPs. Since 2008, the United Kingdom’s government has also reserved
     the right to request for refinancing of project debt to take advantage of more favorable capital market
     conditions.

Step-in rights
Step-in rights refer to a power under the contract or in the country’s legislation for the government or lender
to take control of the project company in certain situations. Step-in rights for the government are normally
reserved for situations in which the project poses significant health and safety risks, threats to national
security, or when legal requirements call for the government to take over the project. The government
may also terminate the PPP contract and take over the project if the project company fails to meet service
obligations.

Lenders generally require step-in rights that come into effect if the project company fails to meet its debt
service obligations, or if the PPP contract is under threat of termination for failure to meet service obligations.
In this situation, the lenders would typically appoint new senior management or another firm to take over
the project company.

It is important that both the government and lenders have a clear framework and timeline for invoking their
step-in rights so they are informed when problems start to occur and can take remedial actions. Section
3.4: Designing PPP Contracts provides more detail on how step-in rights can be built into a PPP contract.


1.4.3 The Role of Public Finance in PPPs
The exclusive use of private finance is not a defining characteristic of a PPP—governments can also finance
PPP projects, either in whole or in part. Reducing the amount of capital investment needed from the private
party reduces the extent of risk transfer—weakening private sector incentives to create value for money,
and making it easier for the private party to walk away if things go wrong. Nonetheless, there are several
reasons why governments may choose to provide finance for PPP projects. These include:

•	 Avoiding excessive risk premiums—the government may consider the risk premium charged by the
   private sector for the project to be excessive, in relation to the actual project risks. This can be a difficult
   call to make, since financial markets are usually better at assessing risk than governments, but can apply
   particularly for new projects or markets, or during financial market disruptions

•	 Mitigating government risk—where project revenues depend on regular payments from government,
   this creates a risk for the private party, which will be reflected in the project cost. Where reliability of
   government payments may be in doubt, providing subsidies or payments upfront in the form of loan
   or grant finance, rather than on-going payments, could improve the bankability and lower the cost of
   the project

•	 Improving availability or reducing cost of finance—particularly when capital markets are under-
   developed, or disrupted, the availability of long-term finance may be limited, and so governments
   may choose to provide finance at terms that would otherwise be unavailable. Governments often have
   access to finance on concessional terms, which they may pass on to lower the cost of infrastructure
   projects. This may also be part of a broader policy of involving state financing institutions to provide
   long-term lending for developmental purposes.
58   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     There are also several different ways in which governments can contribute to the financing structure of a PPP.
     Governments may provide loan or grant finance directly to the project company, or provide a government
     guarantee on a commercial loan. Government-owned development banks or other finance institutions can
     also be involved—either providing finance to PPPs as part of a broader portfolio, or established specifically
     to support the PPP program. Finally, governments may simply not transfer the financing function to the
     PPP project to the private sector, instead retaining on-going responsibility for capital expenditures. These
     options are described in more detail below.

     The rationale for government financial support to PPPs may be strengthened during periods of capital
     market disruption, and many governments introduce specific forms of financial support in response. Box
     1.10: Pursuing PPP During the Global Financial Crisis describes how some governments have supported
     PPPs during the Global Financial Crisis of the late 2000s.




          Box 1.10: Pursuing PPP During the Global Financial Crisis

          The Global Financial Crisis of the late 2000s significantly reduced the availability of debt finance
          for PPP projects and similar investments. Fewer lenders were prepared to lend to PPP projects—
          in developed and developing markets alike—and terms became tougher. An IMF paper [#40]
          presents evidence on the impact of the financial crisis on PPPs.

          Several governments responded to this challenge by introducing specific measures to support PPP
          through the crisis. In the United Kingdom, the Treasury established an Infrastructure Finance Unit
          (TIFU), to lend at commercial rates to PPP projects that were unable to raise enough commercial
          bank finance. A World Bank note on the TIFU [#106] describes the United Kingdom’s experience
          with PFI during the credit crisis. Foster’s paper on the experience in Victoria, Australia [#105]
          describes how the government adapted on a project-by-project basis, by changing how certain
          financial risks were allocated, including by offering short-term guarantees.

          An EPEC paper on the financial crisis and the PPP Market [#79] provides further ideas for
          governments on how to support PPPs under these circumstances. These include changes to
          procurement approaches, providing State guarantees or co-lending, particularly as a short-term
          measure, and adapting PPP structures to attract different types of investor.




     Loan or grant finance directly from government to project company
     Governments may provide finance directly to a PPP, in the form of loans or upfront grant subsidies. These
     can be critical for project viability, where revenue projections show that the project is not likely to be
     financially viable without government funding. Capital contributions can also reduce the project’s costs
     to the government, by making finance available at better terms than would otherwise be possible. For
     example,
                                                             MODULE 1 PPP Basics - What and Why                    59




•	 In the United States, the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) established
   a flexible mechanism for the United States Department of Transport to provide loans (as well as loan
   guarantees) directly to private and state project shareholders for eligible projects. The credit assistance
   is offered on flexible terms, and typically takes a subordinated position, which in turn makes it easier to
   attract more private capital [#267, Chapter 4]

•	 India’s Viability Gap Fund uses funds appropriated from the national budget to provide upfront capital
   subsidies for PPP projects, as described in Box 2.8: Viability Gap Fund in India. The Indian government’s
   guidelines on financial support for PPP in Infrastructure [#135] provide more information.

The willingness of the public sector to provide funds can also act as a signal to help build confidence of
private investors. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, the United Kingdom’s Treasury recognized
several infrastructure projects could have difficulty raising debt and were in danger of being scrapped.
The Treasury created the Treasury Infrastructure Finance Unit (TIFU) to lend at commercial rates to PPP
projects that were unable to raise enough commercial bank finance. The unit funded one major project in
April 2009: the Greater Manchester Water project. According to a United Kingdom National Audit Office
report [#254, page 8], the Treasury’s willingness to lend improved market confidence, and as of July 2010,
35 further projects had been agreed without public lending.


Government provision of SPV equity
Under the UK Government’s revised PPP policy introduced in 2012—termed ‘Private Finance 2’, or PF2—
the Treasury may provide a minority share of the equity in PF2 projects [#241]. The rationale was to give
government better access to project information, including in relation to the financial performance of the
project company; allow government to be more involved in strategic decision making; and improve value
for money by sharing in the on-going investment returns. A similar structure has been used by a few other
governments, such as the Regional Government of Flanders, in Belgium.

However, public equity in a PPP also brings risks for private sector counterparts, and unless carefully
managed could raise concerns of conflict of interest. Under the UK’s PF2 policy, for example, any equity
shareholdings are managed by a unit located in the Treasury separate from the procuring authority.


Government guarantee of commercial loan to project
Rather than providing lending directly, governments may instead guarantee repayment of debt provided
by commercial sources, in case of default by the private party. Farquharson et al [#95, page 63] notes that
guaranteeing project debt undermines the risk transfer to the private sector. For this reason, governments
often provide only partial credit guarantees—that is, a guarantee on repayment of only a part of the total debt.

Partial credit guarantees have been used by both developed and developing country governments to help
support their PPP programs. For example:

•	 Korea’s Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Fund guarantees project debt through a counter-guarantee
   structure. That is, the Fund guarantees an on-demand term loan provided by a financial institution, that
60   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




         can be called by the project to meet its senior debt service payments [#99, pages 6-7]

     •	 Kazakhstan has provided guarantees on infrastructure bonds issued for its transport PPPs. The guarantees
        on the bonds by the government gave security for the pension funds to invest in the projects. [#263]

     The use of guarantees should be carefully considered, and targeted at risks which the government is best
     placed to manage. Guarantees that are inappropriately used by the government can increase its fiscal
     exposure, while reducing value for money by reducing real risk transfer to the private sector, as described
     in Section 1.4.2 on the danger of over-leverage, and Section 1.3.1 on the lack of fiscal clarity from PPPs. For
     more information on government guarantees and public financial management for PPPs, see Section 2.4:
     Public Financial Management Frameworks for PPPs.


     Forfaiting structures
     A finance structure sometimes used to reduce the cost of finance for PPPs is the forfaiting model, which
     can be used for ‘government-pays’ PPP projects. Under this model, once construction is completed
     satisfactorily, the government issues an irrevocable commitment to pay the project company a portion of
     the contract costs—typically sufficient to cover debt service. This can lower the project’s financing costs.
     However, it means the government retains more risk under the PPP, and as debt service payments are no
     longer conditional on performance, the lender has less interest in ensuring project performance during
     operations. The forfaiting model has been widely used in Germany for small projects—typically municipal
     projects—where over half of the PPPs implemented between 2002 and 2006 used this structure. For more
     detail on the forfaiting model, see Daube’s article comparing project finance to the forfaiting model [#57].

     A variant of the forfaiting model is the cession de créance (assignment of receivables) used in France.
     Similarly, once the infrastructure is built and operational the government may commit to making a series
     of payments unconditional on availability that will cover some or all of the debt service of the PPP project
     company.

     The Government of Peru has also introduced a financing structure for PPPs that is a variant on the forfaiting
     model, in which these irrevocable payment commitments are issued during construction on completion of
     defined milestones. The ‘CRPAO’ structure is described in Box 1.11: CRPAOs in Peru. These forfaiting-type
     models allow for the private partner to gradually finance its investment, by securitizing the guaranteed
     future flow of payments related to each phase of construction. However, it also means the Government is
     committed to paying a proportion of the contracted amount irrespective of whether the asset is completed.
     The relevance of this approach may depend on the nature of the asset—in particular, whether it is readily

     Box 1.11: CRPAOs in Peru

     In Peru, an innovative financing structure has been developed to finance construction of its road
     concessions. The Government of Peru issues PAOs (Pago Annual de Obras or ‘annual payments
     for work’) to the private contractor for completing construction milestones. PAOs are obligation
     of the Government of Peru to make dollar-denominated payments on an annual basis (similar to
     bonds). After they are issued, the payments are not linked to the performance or operation of the
     roads and are irrevocable and unconditional. Debt for the project is raised through bonds that
     are backed by the securitization of the PAOs, known as CRPAOs (Certificado de Reconocimiento
     de Pago Annual de Obras).

     Peru first used this financing structure in 2006 to finance the first 960km piece of the IIRSA
     Interoceania Sur. The project raised US$226 million in debt for the project with a US$60 million
     partial credit guarantee from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). Two subsequent
     pieces of the Interoceania Sur have also used the CRPAO financing structure.

Development bank or other state finance institution involvement in PPPs
Many governments have established publicly-owned development banks or other finance institutions, which
may provide a range of financial products to PPP projects. These financial institutions may be capitalized
by the government, and can often also access concessional financing. Where these entities operate more
or less as commercial finance institutions they may be better-placed to assess the viability of a proposed
PPP project than the government itself—although some such institutions can also be exposed to political
pressure that may undermine the quality of due diligence or project structuring.

In some cases, established development banks may expand their activities into the PPP sector. For example,
the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social in Brazil (BNDES) has been a major lender to
private infrastructure projects in Brazil—appraising risk and providing finance in a similar way to a private
commercial bank [#29, Annual Report].

Alternatively, governments may establish finance institutions specifically to serve PPPs, and sometimes
other infrastructure investments. For example, the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL)
was established in 2006 to provide long-term debt to viable infrastructure projects undertaken by public or
private companies. In Indonesia, the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund (IIGF) was established in 2009
as a state-owned company to provide guarantees for infrastructure projects under PPP schemes. However,
as described by Klingebiel and Ruster in their paper on infrastructure facilities [#172], unless policy and
institutional frameworks are developed to provide a pipeline of bankable projects then government-backed
financing facilities are unlikely to provide the hoped-for results.
62   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     Government-owned finance institutions can also be used to provide PPP policy coordination and
     enforcement, by establishing clear rules and requirements for when financing will be available. This can
     particularly apply when a financial institution is set up specifically to serve the needs of a PPP program. For
     example, in Mexico most PPPs have been implemented with the support of FONADIN, an infrastructure
     investment fund under the national development bank BANOBRAS. The operating rules for FONADIN de
     facto established the rules and procedures by which PPP projects will be implemented, as described in Box
     1.12: Mexico’s FONADIN.




           Box 1.12: Mexico’s FONADIN

           Prior to 2012, Mexico had no PPP Law. However, most government agencies that implement
           projects through PPP schemes did so with the support of the Fondo Nacional de Infraestructura
           (FONADIN). Exceptions are typically projects that are “self-financing”—that is, projects that
           generate revenues that are sufficient to cover the costs; the two government entities that generally
           follow this path are CFE (the national electric company) and PEMEX (the national oil company).

           In addition to providing subsidized lending and, in some cases grants, FONADIN can help
           agencies in providing grants for the preliminary studies for the project, preparing the project
           documentation and implementing the tender process. In practice, this has meant that the
           Presidential Decree that established FONADIN in 2008 has effectively governed most PPP
           projects. Under that decree, the Rules of Operation of FONADIN set out the scope, and the
           processes and procedures to identify, assess, and approve PPP projects.

                             Establishing the PPP Framework



PPPs can be implemented on a one-off basis, without any specific supporting policy framework. However,
most countries with a successful PPP program have built that program on a sound PPP framework. The
‘PPP framework’ means the policy, procedures, institutions, and rules that together define how PPPs will be
implemented—that is, how they will be identified, assessed, selected, budgeted for, procured, monitored,
and accounted for.

Establishing a clear PPP framework publicly communicates the government’s commitment to PPPs. It also
defines how projects will be implemented, helping ensure good governance of the PPP program—that is,
promoting efficiency, accountability, transparency, decency, fairness, and participation in how PPPs are
implemented, as described in Box 2.1: Good Governance for PPPs below. This will help generate private
sector interest, and public acceptance of the PPP program.




     Box 2.1: Good Governance for PPPs

     The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Guidebook on Promoting
     Good Governance in PPPs defines governance as ‘the processes in government actions and
     how things are done, not just what is done’. All elements of the PPP Framework described in
     this module contribute to the governance of the PPP program. UNECE further describes ‘good
     governance’ as encompassing the following six core principles:
66   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




          •	 Efficiency—use of resources without waste, delay, corruption, or undue burden on future
             generations

          •	 Accountability—the extent to which political actors are responsible to society for their
             actions

          •	 Transparency—clarity and openness in decision-making

          •	 Decency—development and implementation of rules without harming people

          •	 Fairness—equal application of rules to all members of society

          •	 Participation—involvement of all stakeholders.

          One of the aims of establishing a sound PPP framework is to ensure these principles of good
          governance are followed in the implementation of PPP projects.

          For further description of good governance in the context of PPPs, see the UNECE Guidebook
          on Promoting Governance for PPPs [#262, pages 13-14] Section 2.1: Principles of Good
          Governance in PPPs.




     Defining the ‘PPP framework’
     There is no single ‘model’ PPP framework. A government’s PPP framework typically evolves over time, often
     in response to specific challenges facing the PPP program. In the early stages of a program the emphasis
     may be on enabling PPPs, and creating and promoting PPP opportunities. On the other hand, where many
     PPPs have already been implemented on an ad-hoc basis, concern about the level of fiscal risk in the PPP
     program may be the impetus for strengthening the PPP framework. In this case, the focus may be on
     strengthening control over how PPPs are developed, or improving public financial management for PPPs,
     as for example in South Africa. [#38]

     Often this initially involves introducing PPP-specific processes, rules, and institutions to ensure PPP projects
     are subject to similar discipline as public investment projects. Gradually, as experience with PPP grows, these
     PPP frameworks may re-integrate with normal public investment and infrastructure planning, procurement,
     and fiscal management processes, with PPPs as one particular option among several other options for
     implementing public investment projects.

     The best solutions to similar challenges will likely also vary between countries—depending among other
     things on the country’s existing legal framework, investment environment, government institutions, and
     capacity. Figure 2.1: PPP Framework Overview illustrates the possible components of a ‘comprehensive’
     PPP framework into component parts, while Box 2.2: The PPP Framework of Chile and Box 2.3: The PPP

                                               PPP Legal Framework




As shown in Figure 2.1: PPP Framework Overview, the components of a comprehensive PPP framework can
include the following:

•	 Policy—articulation of the government’s intent to use PPPs to deliver public services, and the objectives,
   scope, and implementing principles of the PPP program

•	 Legal framework—the laws and regulations that underpin the PPP program—enabling the government
   to enter into PPPs, and setting the rules and boundaries for how PPPs are implemented. This can
   include PPP-specific legislation, other public financial management laws and regulations, or sector-
   specific laws and regulations

•	 Processes and institutional responsibilities—the steps by which PPP projects are identified,
   developed, appraised, implemented, and managed; and the roles of different entities in that process.
   A sound PPP process is efficient, transparent, and is followed consistently to effectively control the
   quality of PPP projects

•	 Public financial management approach—how fiscal commitments under PPPs are controlled, reported,
   and budgeted for, to ensure PPPs provide value for money, without placing undue burden on future
   generations, and to manage the associated fiscal risk

•	 Broader governance arrangements—how other entities such as auditing entities, the legislature,
   and the public participate in the PPP program, and hold those responsible for implementing PPPs
68   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




         accountable for their decisions and actions. The sections of this module describe each of these elements
         of a PPP framework, providing examples and guidance for practitioners.

     In practice, these elements are closely inter-related. For example a well-controlled process for developing
     PPPs that considers their fiscal consequences and builds in Finance Ministry control is central to sound public
     financial management of the PPP program. Comprehensive public reporting of fiscal commitments to PPPs in
     turn enables effective oversight of the PPP program. These linkages are highlighted throughout this Module.

     For more on the typical components of a PPP framework, see Farquharson et al [#95, pages 15-16], and
     Yong [#296, page 30], which both provide brief overviews. The OECD’s recommendation on public
     governance of public-private partnerships (2012) [#196] also sets out guiding principles for its member
     governments on managing PPPs, covering three areas: establishing a clear, predictable, and legitimate
     institutional framework supported by competent and well-resourced authorities; grounding the selection
     of PPPs in value for money; and using the budget process transparently to minimize fiscal risks and ensure
     the integrity of the procurement process. These built on earlier OECD principles for private sector
     participation in infrastructure (2007) [#193].

     Detailed assessments of PPP frameworks in a range of countries are available in the following:

     •	 The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)’s Infrascope index publications, which evaluate the PPP
        environment in a set of countries against measures designed to assess the countries’ readiness to carry
        out sustainable PPPs. These measures include many of the PPP framework elements described above, as
        well as the country’s operational experience with PPPs, the availability of finance and financing support
        mechanisms, and the overall investment climate. The series includes EIU Infrascope index for Latin
        America and the Caribbean [#67], commissioned by IADB’s Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF); EIU

          Box 2.2: The PPP Framework of Chile

          Chile is a country with substantial PPP experience, and a well-defined PPP framework. As of 2013,
          Chile had awarded 69 projects in roads, airports, jails, reservoirs, urban transport, hospitals, and
          other sectors, with a total investment value of USS$14 billion.

          The use of PPP in Chile was enabled in 1991 by Decree 164, which set out much of the framework
          still in use today. This law was updated in 2010 by the Concessions Law, to address some of the
          challenges Chile had faced in its PPP program to date.
                                       MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                                69




The Concessions Law sets out the institutional responsibilities and processes for developing
and implementing PPPs. The Concessions Unit of the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) acts as
implementing agency for all PPPs in Chile. The MOP may receive proposals from government
agencies or private investors, and follows a clearly-defined process to appraise the project. If
the project is a good PPP candidate, the MOP Concessions Unit prepares the detailed tender
documents, carries out a tender process, and selects and announces by decree the winning
bidder. The Unit then manages the PPP contract over the project lifetime, receiving regular reports
from the concessionaire—with the ability to request additional audits to check the information
received—and managing any changes needed to the contract.

The National Planning Authority must review and approve the technical and economic analysis
of the project. The Concessions Council—led by the Minister of Public Works, with an advisor
selected by the MOP, and four other advisers representing the Civil Engineering, Economics and
Management, Law, and Architecture departments of the University of Chile—must approve the
initial decision to carry out the project as a PPP.

The Ministry of Finance must approve PPP tender documents before they can be published, any
changes made during the tender process, and any significant changes made through the lifetime
of the contract. The Minister of Finance must also sign the decree awarding the PPP contract to
the winning bidder. To manage these oversight responsibilities, the Ministry has established a
Contingent Liabilities Unit, which reviews all projects in detail prior to approval, and calculates the
value of the government’s liabilities initially and throughout the contract. Chile publicly discloses
its commitments to PPP projects in a detailed annual contingent liabilities report. Information on
the PPP program is also included in budget documentation.

The Treasury makes all the payments established in the PPP contract in accordance with the
procedures and milestones stipulated in the PPP contract. The payments incorporated in the
contract were previously approved by the Ministry of Finance during the project approval phase.
Payment commitments are structured where possible to reduce fiscal risk—for example, demand
guarantee payments are typically due the year after a demand shortfall, once the amount is
known.

Disputes that emerge during the implementation of the project can be brought by either party to
a Technical Panel. If the solution proposed by the technical panel does not resolve the problem,
the parties may bring up the Arbitration Commission or the Appeals Court of Santiago.

         Box 2.3: The PPP Framework of South Africa

         South Africa is another country with substantial PPP experience. From 2000 to April 2014, South
         Africa has implemented 24 national and provincial level PPP projects totaling over US$8.35 billion
         of total investment.

         The legislation governing national and provincial PPPs is the Treasury Regulation 16, issued
         under the Public Finance Management Act of 1999—it broadly sets out the PPP process,
         requirements and approvals, and institutional responsibilities of involved entities. Municipal PPPs
         are governed by the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Municipal Systems Act. There
         are also municipal PPP regulations that roughly mirror the requirements of Treasury Regulation 16.

         PPP processes and institutional responsibilities are established in a detailed PPP Manual. This
         manual describes how the Treasury regulations should be interpreted, and provides detailed
         guidance at every step in the PPP process, each in a separate module. Each module of the manual is
         issued as a Practice Note of the National Treasury, and can be updated separately. A similar manual,
         the Municipal Service Delivery and PPP Guidelines, provides instructions for municipal PPPs.

         Responsibility for implementing PPP projects rests with the contracting authority. Contracting
         authorities must identify and appraise PPP projects, and manage the tender process to select
         the winning bidder, following the detailed guidance and requirements (including checklists for
         each stage and standard forms) set out in the manuals. The contracting authority is responsible
         for managing PPPs through the contract lifetime, which includes ensuring the project meets
         performance standards, resolving disputes, and reporting on the PPP in the institution’s/
         municipality’s annual reports.

         PPP approvals are made by the Treasury at the national and provincial levels. Municipal PPPs will
         be subject to Treasury’s “views and recommendations”. Projects are submitted for approval at
         four points, after: (1) the feasibility study has been completed, (2) the bid documents have been
         prepared, (3) bids have been received and evaluated, and (4) negotiations have concluded and
         the PPP contract is in its final form. The Treasury established a PPP Unit in 2004, to review all PPP
         submissions and recommend the PPP for approval. The Treasury’s evaluation focuses particularly
         on the value for money and affordability of the PPP project.

         Payments for PPP commitments are made through the annual appropriations process. The
         Accounting Standards Board of South Africa has published guidelines for public sector
         accounting for PPPs. The PPP Manual also sets out the auditing requirements for PPP. The
         Auditor General’s annual audits of contracting authorities should check that the requirements of
         the PPP regulations have been met, and the financial implications are reflected in the institution’s/
         municipality’s accounts. The Auditor General may also conduct forensic audits if any irregularity
         is suspected.

Instituting the PPP framework
A PPP framework can be instituted in different ways. The options available typically depend on the legal
system of the country, and on the norm for establishing government policies, procedures, institutions, and
rules. They can include:

•	 Policy statement—common in developed countries with Westminster-style governments, PPP policy
   statements typically set out at least the objectives, scope, and implementing principles of the PPP
   program—as described further in Section 2.1: PPP Policy. Policy statements may also outline procedures,
   institutions, and rules by which the objectives and principles will be put into practice

•	 Laws and regulations—as described further in Section 2.2: PPP Legal Framework, civil law countries
   typically require legislation to enable PPPs to be pursued, and set out the rules for how PPPs will be
   implemented; many common law countries also introduce PPP legislation as a more binding form of
   commitment to a PPP framework. This can be a dedicated PPP law, a component of broader public
   financial management law, subordinate legislation such as executive orders, presidential decrees,
   regulations, or a combination

•	 Guidance materials, such as manuals, handbooks, and other tools. These may be used to establish
   PPP procedures upfront, or developed over time to supplement policy statements or legislation, as a
   codification of good practice. Module 3 of this Reference Guide provides examples and draws from
   many examples of good-quality guidance material from national PPP programs.

In addition to cross-sector PPP frameworks, policies or laws at the sector level can enable the use of PPPs and
create a framework for PPPs within the sector. Many PPP programs use a combination of these approaches.

     2.1 PPP Policy
     The first step in establishing a PPP framework is often for the government to articulate its PPP policy.
     ‘PPP policy’ is difficult to define, and is used in different ways in different countries. Based on the Oxford
     English Dictionary definition of policy as a ‘course or principles of action … one formally advocated by a
     government’, this Reference Guide uses PPP Policy to mean the government’s statement of intent to use
     PPPs as a course of action to deliver public services, and the guiding principles for that course of action. A
     PPP policy would typically include:

     •	 PPP program objectives—why the government is pursuing a PPP program

     •	 PPP program scope—what types of projects will be pursued under the PPP policy

     •	 Implementing principles—how PPP projects will be implemented, to ensure the PPP program meets
        its objectives.

     The following sections provide examples of how different countries define their PPP program objectives,
     scope, and implementing principles.

     Many governments issue a PPP policy statement or document, to communicate to the public and to
     potential investors the government’s intention to use PPP, and how PPPs will be implemented. The
     sections below, and the ‘key references’ at the end of this section, reference some example PPP policy
     documents. Other countries incorporate these elements of PPP policy within PPP laws and regulations,
     or guidance material. PPP policies benefit from being nested in a more comprehensive public investment
     or infrastructure policy framework, as described further below under Section 2.3: PPP Processes and
     Institutional Responsibilities.

2.1.1 PPP Program Objectives
Governments pursue PPP programs for different reasons. Some countries begin using PPPs in a particular
sector, simply as a way to meet investment needs given fiscal constraints. For example, PPPs were first used
in South Africa in the roads sector, with the specific objective of building more highways. In the Philippines,
many of the first PPPs were in the power sector, where the state-owned power company contracted with
Independent Power Producers to solve a power crisis. In both cases, the use of PPPs subsequently extended
into other sectors.

Many governments define broader PPP program objectives when formulating and documenting PPP
policies. The choice and relative priority of these objectives depends on the government’s other policies
and priorities. They can include:

•	 Enabling more investment in infrastructure, by accessing private finance

•	 Achieving value for money in the provision of infrastructure and public services

•	 Improving accountability in the provision of infrastructure and public services

•	 Harnessing private sector innovation and efficiency

•	 Stimulating growth and development in the country.

Table 2.1 provides examples of clear statements of PPP program objectives drawn from the relevant
country’s PPP policy statement or law.

             Chapter II Article 3]          	 To improve the quantity, quality and efficiency of services through healthy competition
                                            	 To improve the quality of management and maintenance in the supply of infrastructure
                                            	 To encourage the use of the principle where users pay for services received; or in
                                                certain cases the paying ability of the users shall be taken into consideration.

     2.1.2 PPP Program Scope
     Many governments bound the scope of their PPP program to particular types of projects or contracts.
     The aim can be to focus on those projects that are most likely to successfully achieve the government’s
     objectives and provide value for money as PPPs. Where the PPP framework includes particular processes
     and institutional responsibilities, it may also be necessary to define under what circumstances these will
     apply. Governments may define the PPP program scope by a combination of the following:

     •	 PPP contract types—there is no consistent, international definition of ‘PPP’, which can be used to
        describe a wide range of contract types. Section 1.1 What is a PPP: Defining ‘Public-Private Partnership’
        describes this range, which can stretch from lease arrangements for existing assets and services to
        Design-Build-Operate-Finance-Maintain contracts for new assets. Some countries define the types of
        contract that are included under the PPP policy. The aim can be to prioritize contract types that are
        most consistent with the government’s objectives. It can also be important to distinguish when the
        requirements and processes of the PPP framework will apply. For example, India’s draft National PPP
        Policy (2011) describes the types of contracts that are considered as PPPs, types of contract that will not
        be used (those involving private ownership of assets), and those that are not covered by the PPP policy
        (Engineering-Procurement-Construction (EPC) contracts, and divestiture of assets). Brazil (2004) Law
        11079, Federal PPP Law, Brasilia [#34] and Chile, Ministerio de Obras Públicas (2010) Ley y Reglamento
        de Concesiones de Obras Públicas, Santiago [#46] both define limits on the contract duration: in Brazil,
        a minimum of five years, and in Chile, a maximum of 50 years

     •	 Sectors—the PPP program may be limited to the sectors most in need of investment or improvements
        in service performance, or those in which PPPs are expected to be most successful. For example,
        Singapore’s PPP policy (2004) is limited to those sectors ‘in which other similar countries have had proven
        success with PPP’, including sports facilities, incineration plans, water and sewage treatment works,
        major IT infrastructure, education facilities, hospitals and polyclinics, expressways, and government
        office buildings. Some countries exclude sectors considered too sensitive—Uruguay and El Salvador
        excluded the water sector, Guatemala excluded education and health

     •	 Project size—many governments define a minimum size for PPP projects implemented under the PPP
        framework. Smaller projects may not make sense because of the relatively high transaction costs of
        implementing a PPP. In some cases, smaller projects can be implemented, but are not subject to the
        appraisal and approval requirements defined in the PPP framework. In other cases, a size limit may
        mean PPP-type contracts cannot be used for smaller projects. For example, Singapore’s PPP policy
        (2004) states that initially, PPPs will be pursued only for projects with an estimated capital value of over
        US$50 million. Brazil’s PPP law (Law 11079, 2004) sets a minimum size of 20 million reais (US$11.7 million)
        for individual projects launched under the ‘PPP Law’.

     Table 2.2 provides more detail on how various countries have defined the scope of their PPP programs.

               paragraph 4]                     government transfers—, and (ii) administrative concessions—all of the returns
                                                to the private party come from government transfers. Concessions not requiring
                                                government transferred are not considered PPPs in Brazil. The law also states that
                                                the concession must be at least five years long to be considered a PPP.
                                                Project Size—PPPs will only be used for project over 20 million reais (US$11.7

                                                Sector—the law does not specify the sectors. However, it states that PPPs are to

 PPP policies often set out implementing principles—the guiding rules, or code of conduct under which
PPP projects will be implemented. These principles set out the standards against which those responsible
for implementing PPPs should be held accountable. Principles are often supported by regulations and
processes, detailing how the principles will be put into practice. For example, Box 2.4: PPP Implementing
Principles in Peru lists the implementing principles established in Peru’s national PPP law.
76   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




          Box 2.4: PPP Implementing Principles in Peru

          Peru’s PPP policy is set out through legislative decree 1012. In article 5, this defines the following
          guiding principles for the PPP Policy:

          •	 Value for Money: a public service must be provided by the private actor that can offer better
             quality for a given cost or lower costs for a given quality outputs. This is how the policy seeks
             to maximize user satisfaction and optimize the use of public resources

          •	 Transparency: all quantitative and qualitative information used to make decision during the
             evaluation, development, implementation and monitoring stages, must be made public in
             accordance with Article 3 of the Transparency and Public Information Access Law

          •	 Competition: competition must be sought in order to ensure efficiency and lower costs in
             the provision of public infrastructure and services. The government must also avoid any anti-
             competitive o collusion behavior

          •	 Adequate Risk Allocation: there must be an adequate risk allocation between the public
             and private parties. This means that the risks must be assigned to the party that has the
             greatest capacity to manage the risks at a lower cost, considering both the public interest
             and the project’s characteristics

          •	 Budgetary Responsibility: this is defined as the Government capacity to assume the firm
             and contingent financial commitments related to the implementation of PPP contracts
             without compromising the sustainability of public finances or the regular provision of the
             public service.

     For other examples of strong guiding principles, see:

     •	 The State Government of Karnataka Infrastructure Policy (2007) [#144, page 135], which clearly sets
        out and explains its ‘Touchstone Principles’

     •	 Australia’s National PPP Policy Framework (2008) [#13, pages 10-11], which sets out seven principles:

     2.2 PPP Legal Framework
     The ‘PPP legal framework’ comprises all the laws and regulations that control whether, and how, PPPs can
     be implemented. Both governments and private companies looking to implement PPPs need to scrutinize
     the relevant laws and regulations, to identify any provisions, requirements, or constraints that may apply to
     PPPs. Governments embarking on PPPs may also need to adapt the existing legal framework to do so—at
     a minimum to ensure that PPP contracts can be entered into and clarify the legal rights and processes that
     apply; or in some cases to introduce PPP-specific processes and responsibilities such as those described in the
     following sections. Some governments do so by adapting existing laws; others introduce specific legislation.

     The nature of the legal framework for PPP depends heavily on the type of legal system in place. There are
     two main types of legal systems in the world: common law, and civil law. In civil law systems, the operations
     of government are usually tightly prescribed in administrative law. This typically establishes legal rights and
     processes that apply to PPP contracts, as described further below. Common law systems are typically
     much less prescriptive, with fewer provisions implied into a contract by law. As a result, contracts in common
     law countries tend to be larger than in civil law countries—more importance is attached to specifying in
     the contract the terms governing the relationship between the parties to a contract, as the absences or
     ambiguities cannot so easily be remedied or resolved by operation of law.

     This section briefly describes and provides examples of PPP legal frameworks: Section 2.2.1 describes
     the broad scope of legislation that may affect PPPs; and Section 2.2.2 focuses on PPP-specific legislation.
     The following resources provide overview guidance on assessing and developing the legal and regulatory
     framework for PPPs:

•	 The World Bank’s online PPP Toolkit for Roads and Highways [#282, Module 4] section on ‘legislative
   framework’ describes the types of enabling law for PPPs, and lists and describes the other laws that
   typically impact a PPP project in highway infrastructure.


2.2.1 Scope of the PPP Legal Framework
The PPP legal and regulatory framework can include specific PPP legislation, as described below. However,
the legal framework for PPP is broader in scope, and can comprise a range of types of law.

Firstly, in civil law countries, as described above, PPP contracts are couched in general administrative law,
which governs the functions and decision-making processes of government agencies. This body of law can
create legal rights for both contracting authority and private party, in addition (or indeed, overriding) those
specified in the contract. For example, it may establish the right of the contracting authority to modify or
cancel a contract (often linked to a legal requirement for continuity of service provision). Some protections
of the operator are also implied by law—such as the right to ‘financial equilibrium’ in case of certain types
of unexpected change in circumstances (as described further under Section 3.4: Designing PPP Contracts).
Administrative law may also define processes and institutional roles relevant to PPPs; such as those for
procurement, or resolution of contractual disputes—including the ultimate jurisdiction of administrative
courts, unless otherwise specified.

In both civil and common law jurisdictions there may also be specific laws that apply to aspects of the PPP
process. These can include:

•	 Procurement law—the transaction process for a PPP must typically comply with public procurement
   law and regulations, unless PPPs are specifically exempt

•	 Public financial management law—institutional responsibilities, processes, and rules established in
   public financial management laws and regulations can contribute to the PPP framework. For example,
   this could include project approval requirements, fiscal limits, budgeting processes, and reporting
   requirements

•	 Sector laws and regulatory frameworks—PPPs are often implemented in sectors that are already
   governed by sector-level law and regulatory frameworks. These may constrain the government’s ability
   to contract with the private sector, or provide rules for doing so

•	 Other laws affecting the operation of private firms, which also apply to PPP companies, and should
   be taken into consideration when defining PPP projects and processes. These can include:

    -	   Environmental law and regulations

    -	   Laws and regulations governing land acquisition and ownership

    -	   Licensing requirements, particularly for international firms
80   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




         -	   Tax rules

         -	   Employment law

     These laws taken together may comprise the legal framework for implementing PPP—that is, there may be
     no need for PPP-specific legislation. For example, Box 2.5: PPP Legal Framework in Germany.




          Box 2.5: PPP Legal Framework in Germany

          The development and implementation of PPPs in Germany is regulated primarily by the Budget
          law, particularly sections 7 and 55 of the Federal Budget Code, which set out requirements for
          project preparation and appraisal, and procurement, respectively.

          The Budget law establishes guiding principles and appraisal requirements for all public
          procurements, including PPP projects. Under section 7 subsection (1) of the Federal Budget Code,
          the principles of efficiency and economy must be observed when preparing and executing the
          budget—which includes the preparation of PPP projects. Economic feasibility analysis is the main
          instrument for implementing the efficiency principle—it must be conducted for all measures having
          a financial impact, which includes PPPs (section 7 subsection (2) of the Federal Budget Code). This
          analysis must be conducted during various stages of the project development process, before any
          decision with financial impact; and includes analysis of possible procurement approaches.

          General provisions for procurement processes are set out in Section 55 of the Federal Budget
          Code. Federal procurement procedures are related to a certain threshold (€5 million for construction
          contracts; €200,000 for supplies and services contracts; €400,000 for supplies and services contracts
          involving sectoral clients; €130,000 for contracts involving higher and supreme federal authorities).
          For procedures exceeding stipulated thresholds, the rules established under EU Directives must be
          applied, as well as the Act Against Restraints of Competition [#110, part 4] and the Ordinance on the
          Award of Public Contracts [#113]. For procurement procedures below the above-cited threshold,
          the following regulations apply: Section 55 of the Budgetary Principles Act, Section 55 of the Federal
          Budget Code, and the respective Länder budget codes in conjunction with the corresponding
          administrative provisions, plus Section 1 both of the VOB/A (Vergabe- und Vertragsordnung für
          Bauleistungen) and VOL/A (allgemeine Bestimmungen für die Vergabe von Leistungen).




     2.2.2 PPP Laws
     Some countries enact special PPP laws. These may be used a means to adapt the existing legal framework,
     if this is not clear or comprehensive, or constrains the Government’s ability to structure and manage PPPs
     well. The same can be achieved by adapting existing laws to accommodate PPPs. A PPP-specific law can
     help raise the profile and demonstrate political commitment to the PPP program—although care is needed
                                            MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                                          81




to avoid conflict with any other existing relevant laws. PPP laws may establish guiding principles for a PPP
program, processes and institutional responsibilities (such as for procurement, and dealing with disputes)
and policies such as public financial management rules PPPs. A well-designed PPP law typically sets out
principles, which may be supported by more detailed regulations—with a view to avoiding rigidity and
enabling the PPP program to adapt over time.

PPP laws are most common in civil law countries—for example, all Latin American countries implementing
PPPs do so under a specific PPP or Concession law (or both). Some common law countries also adopt PPP
laws, as a more binding commitment by government than a PPP policy.

Table 2.3 below provides examples of PPP laws and regulations in a range of countries. Yong [#296, page
33] summarizes the suggested content of a dedicated PPP law, while the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law has published general recommendations and model legislative provisions for
enabling privately financed infrastructure projects [#259, #260]. The World Bank PPP in Infrastructure
Resource Center for Contracts, Law and Regulation [#286, ‘Legislation’] provides more information,
including summaries of different legislation types (such as general PPP laws, concession laws), example
provisions, and PPP legislation from over 30 countries.

 Brazil           The federal-level legal framework for PPPs in Brazil is different for Concessions (‘self-financing’ projects, which
                  require no government subsidy support), and PPPs:
                  	 Law 8987 (1995) is the Federal Concessions Law. It establishes which government bodies can grant
                      concessions, and defines concession types. It also sets out criteria for selecting bidders during tender, the
                      required content of concession contracts, rights and responsibilities of the contracting government agency,
                      the concessionaire and users, the tariff policy, and the acceptable reasons for step in and contract termination.
                      Law 9648 (1998) made some updates to this law
                  	 Law 11079 (2004) is the Federal PPP Law. It defines PPPs in the Brazilian context, establishes the scope
                      of the PPP program, defines the contents of PPP contracts, sets rules for providing guarantees, setting up the
                      SPV, tendering the project, and defines the rights and responsibilities of the contracting authority
                  Each State making use of PPPs also has its own legal framework.
 Chile            Law 20410 (2010) is the current Concessions Law. It updated the previous legal instrument for concessions—
                  Decree 900 (1996)—which had modified the original legal instrument for PPPs in Chile: the Ministry of Public
                  Work’s Regulation 164 (1991). The law sets out the institutional framework for PPPs, tender rules, concessionaire’s
                  rights and obligations, inspection and oversight requirements, and procedures for resolving conflicts
 Colombia         Law 1508 (2011) is the National PPP Law. It sets out the scope of the PPP program in the country, and the
                  principles that should guide it, and establishes the procedures and institutional framework for PPPs. It sets out
                  specific approaches on PPP procurement, PPP contract design, and on the budgetary approach for PPPs. The
                  following laws also contribute to the legal framework for PPP:
                  	 Law 80 (1993): establishes norms and principles for government contracting. It also sets norms that regulate
                       the legal relationship between the public and private partners
                  	 Law 1150 (2007): modifies some parts of Law 80. Specifically, it incorporates certain elements that make the
                       tendering processes more efficient and transparent
                  	 Presidential Decree 4165 (2011), in article 4, establishes the National Infrastructure Agency (ANI Agencia
                       Nacional de Infraestructura), which is in charge of identifying, assessing the viability, and proposing
                       concessions and other forms of PPPs in transport and other related services, and of developing and
                       implementing the resulting PPP projects

                       partnerships’, which establishes the rules for the nation’s PPP program.
      Tanzania         The PPP Act (Gazette of the United Republic of Tanzania No. 13 Vol. 91, 2010) sets out the responsibilities of the
                       private and public sectors, the functions and powers of the PPP Unit, and the approval process for PPPs.




     2.3 PPP Processes and Institutional Responsibilities
     Governments need skill, capacity, and coordination to implement PPPs successfully. The private party will
     design, finance, build and maintain the infrastructure, and provide services. However, the government
     remains responsible for ensuring the public service is provided to the expected quality, in a way that achieves
     good value for money. The government must choose the right project, select a competent partner, and set
     and enforce the parameters within which that partner operates.

     To this end, many governments define processes and institutional responsibilities for PPPs—that is, the
     steps that must be followed when developing and implementing a PPP project, and the entities responsible
     for each step. This section provides examples and resources for practitioners on:

     •	 Establishing the PPP process. There are several steps that a government must usually take to implement
        a PPP project successfully. Defining a standard PPP process, with approvals required at key points, helps
        ensure these necessary steps are taken consistently and efficiently. Section 2.3.1: PPP Process describes
        a typical PPP process, and gives examples from different countries’ PPP programs

    the particular needs of the PPP program and the existing institutional responsibilities and capacities.
    Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 describe and provide examples of institutional responsibilities for:

    -	   Implementing PPPs—that is, doing the day-to-day work to drive forward the PPP process through
          the steps defined below: from identifying potential projects, appraising, structuring, drafting the
          contract, bidding it out, and managing the contract after it is signed

    -	   Reviewing and approving PPPs—that is, overseeing the PPP process, typically through review and
         approvals at key stages, to ensure that the project represents a good investment decision for the
         government

•	 Establishing PPP units. Some governments establish teams aggregating staff with specific knowledge
   on PPPs. The functions of these PPP Units vary widely, as do their location within Government and
   structure—reflecting the variation in priorities and constraints facing PPP programs both between
   governments, and over time as the PPP program evolves. Section 2.3.4 briefly describes the various
   roles played by these units, with examples from different countries.

This section focuses on the process and responsibilities within the executive branch of government for
implementing PPPs. Section 2.5: Broader PPP Program Governance provides further guidance on how other
entities can input into the PPP process, and hold those responsible for developing PPPs accountable for
their decisions and actions.


2.3.1 PPP Process
Many governments set out a process that must be followed to develop and implement every PPP project.
Standardizing the PPP process helps ensure that all PPPs are developed in a way that is consistent with the
government’s objectives. It also helps achieve coordination between the various entities involved.

Figure 2.2: Typical PPP Process shows an example of a well-defined PPP process. The process is broken down
into several stages, in which the PPP is iteratively developed and appraised. At each key stage, approval is
required to proceed. There are two reasons to use an iterative approach to developing a PPP project. First,
it enables timely involvement of oversight agencies in approving projects, as described further in Section
2.3.3. Second, it avoids wasting resources developing weak projects. Developing a PPP project is costly—
early checks that the project is promising can help ensure development budgets are well-spent.

          As shown in Figure, the process of developing and implementing a PPP is typically preceded by identifying
          a priority public investment project. A PPP is one way to deliver public investment—moreover, one that
          ‘locks in’ the specifications of the project over a long-term period. Potential PPP projects therefore typically
          emerge from a broader public investment planning and project selection process. At some point in this
          process some or all proposed public investment projects may be screened, to determine whether they may
          provide more value if implemented as a PPP.
                                      MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                         85




Developing and implementing the PPP then involves several stages:

•	 Structuring and appraising the PPP—once a priority public investment project has been identified and
   initially approved for development as a PPP, the next step is typically to prepare the PPP structure, or ‘key
   commercial terms’—including the proposed contract type, risk allocation, and payment mechanisms.
   This proposed PPP structure can then be appraised. Box 3.3: PPP Project Appraisal Criteria describes
   typical appraisal criteria and how these are assessed: value for money as a PPP, and affordability, as
   well as likely marketability as a PPP, in addition to the technical and economic viability of the underlying
   project (which may have already been assessed prior to identifying the project as a PPP, as described
   in Box 2.6). The proposed PPP structure and appraisal analysis is often pulled together in a ‘business
   case’ is often also developed, to demonstrate why the PPP is a good investment decision. Approval is
   typically needed at this stage, based on the analysis in the business case, before going on to prepare
   for and implement the PPP transaction

•	 Designing the PPP contract—the final step to prepare the PPP for procurement is to draft the PPP
   contract and other agreements. This involves developing the commercial principles into contractual
   terms, as well as setting out the provisions for change and how the contract will be managed, such as
   dispute resolution mechanisms. Often the design of the draft contract is completed in the early stages
   of the procurement process, to allow for consultation with potential bidders

•	 Implementing the PPP transaction—in the transaction stage, the government selects the private
   party that will implement the PPP. This usually involves preparing for and conducting a competitive
   procurement process. Bidders submit information detailing their qualifications and detailed technical
   and financial proposals, which are evaluated according to defined criteria—often in a multi-stage
   process—to select a preferred bidder. Since the bidding process typically also establishes some key
   parameters of the contract—in particular its cost—most processes involve a final approval at this stage.
   The transaction stage is complete when the project reaches financial close.

Once the PPP has reached financial close, the government must manage the PPP contract over its lifetime.
This involves monitoring and enforcing the PPP contract requirements, and managing the relationship
between the public and private partners.

An alternative to the government carrying out all these steps is to allow private companies to identify and
propose PPP projects. Some governments have introduced specific requirements and processes to ensure
that these unsolicited proposals are subject to the same assessment, and developed following the same
principles, as government-originated PPPs. Section 3.6: Dealing with Unsolicited Proposals provides details
and examples.

Module 3 of this Reference Guide describes the PPP process in detail, setting out options and providing
information and guidance for practitioners on each stage. The following provide examples of how the PPP
process is defined in a range of countries:

     •	 In Egypt, the Ministry of Finance has published a step-by-step guide to developing PPPs (undated—
        accessed 2011) [#68]. The guide directs the relevant Ministries through the PPP process, from identifying
        a project through developing a business case and the procurement process

     •	 An ADB publication on PPP projects in Korea (2011) [#171, pages 61-72] includes a detailed description
        of the PPP implementation process for different types of PPP, including unsolicited projects

     •	 The PPP Guidelines of the Government of Malaysia (2005) [#179, page 11] provides an overview of
        its PPP process

     •	 In Mexico, the PPP Law (2012) describes all the studies that must be carried out to assess the viability of
        a PPP project; sets out the PPP approval process; sets out the activities and institutional responsibilities
        in running a PPP tender process; and describes the bid evaluation process and the selection of the
        winning bid [#185, articles 14, 21-25, 38-51, and 52-59]

     •	 Peru’s Legislative Decree No.1012 (2008) lays out the process for carrying out a PPP, establishes the
        criteria for selecting projects and the PPP modality, and defines the steps and responsibilities in project
        design and approval [#199, Title III, Articles 7-9]

        Philippines [#203, pages 11-51 and Annexes]

     •	 In Puerto Rico, the PPP Act (2009) [#210, sections 7-10], presents a detailed description of the PPP
        process including conducting initial desirability and convenience analysis, setting up a Partnership
        Committee to implement the tender process and the PPP contract, and selecting proponents and
        awarding partnerships

     •	 The South Africa PPP Manual (2004) [#219] has an introduction that provides a brief overview of the
        PPP process. The process is explained in detail in the manual, with a module dedicated to each step

         tendering options.


     2.3.2 Institutional Responsibilities: Implementation
     Implementing a PPP successfully requires a range of skills and expertise. Government agencies and individuals
     responsible for implementing projects need a sound understanding of the needs of the particular sector,
     skill in economic and financial appraisal of projects and PPPs, expertise in structuring privately-financed
     infrastructure project contracts, expertise in procurement and contract management, and experience in
     dealing with the private sector. The main challenge in designating the institutional arrangements for PPPs
     is to ensure that all these skills are available to implement PPP projects successfully.

     By default, responsibility for implementing a PPP typically falls to the ministry, department, or agency
     responsible for ensuring the relevant asset or service is provided. However, particularly at the early stages
                                      MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                        87




of a PPP program, such entities may not have the full range of skills and experienced needed: hence,
other government entities are sometimes involved. This section briefly describes the range of institutional
arrangements for identifying PPP projects; developing and implementing those projects; and managing the
PPP contracts.


Identifying PPP projects
As described in Section 2.3.1: PPP Process above, PPP projects emerge from the usual public investment
planning and project identification process. Responsibility for identifying potential PPPs from among priority
public investment projects therefore typically rests with the relevant sector agency or entity, under the
oversight of entities responsible for public financial management and planning—for more on PPP review
and approval responsibilities see Section 2.3.3 Institutional Responsibilities: Review and Approval below.

Sometimes a specialized PPP team may be involved in the PPP identification process, as described in Section
2.3.4: Dedicated PPP Units. For example, a PPP unit may provide support to sector agencies in screening
projects for PPP potential—particularly at the early stage of a PPP program when sector agencies may have
limited understanding of how PPPs work. Sometimes PPP Units are specifically given the task of promoting
the use of PPP. This can help overcome initial anti-PPP bias at the early stage of new PPP programs.
However, it can also risk distorting the public investment planning process—pushing forward projects
because they appear to be doable as PPPs, rather than because they are public investment priorities.
Instituting a clear PPP process with appropriate approvals, as described in Section 2.3.1: PPP Process and
Section 2.3.3: Institutional Responsibilities: Review and Approval, helps overcome this risk.


Developing and implementing PPP projects
Responsibility for developing and implementing the PPP project—that is, for structuring the PPP, designing
the PPP contract, and carrying out the PPP transaction—typically also falls to the entity with responsibility
for ensuring the relevant asset or service is provided. This entity is often termed, for PPP purposes, the
contracting authority, since it will usually be the public party to the PPP contract. The PPP law or policy may
define the types of government ent ity that can be contracting authorities, and specify that these authorities
are responsible for PPP implementation. For example:

•	 In the Philippines, the BOT Law (1993) delegates responsibility for developing and implementing PPPs
   to eligible government agencies, units, or authorities. These include Government-Owned or Controlled
   Corporations (GOCCs), Government Financial Institutions (GFIs), State Universities and Colleges (SUCs),
   and Local Government Units. These agencies are required to create a Pre-qualification, Bids and Awards
   Committee (PBAC) that will oversee the PPP process for each PPP project [#202, Implementation Rules
   and Regulations]

•	 Under Tanzania’s PPP Law (2010), the contracting authority can be any eligible party within government.
   The contracting authority is responsible for facilitating project development, including project
   identification, a feasibility study, environmental impact assessment, and design and implementation of
   the PPP contract [#224]
88   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     •	 In Colombia, the Manual for PPP procedures (2010) allows contracting authorities to be ministries or
        other sector-specific institutions, and local and regional institutions. The contracting authorities are in
        charge of conducting eligibility and value for money analyses, and submitting the results to the PPP
        Unit—UPAPP. The contracting authorities also manage the procurement process [#55, Chapter 4.2,
        page 34].

     However, sector agencies may lack some of the skills needed to identify and develop PPP projects successfully.
     Particularly at the early stages of a PPP program, sector agencies may have little or no experience with engaging
     with the private sector on privately-financed projects. For this reason, other government entities are often also
     involved, to provide additional skills or perspectives. This can be achieved in different ways, including:

     •	 Forming inter-departmental committees to oversee each PPP transaction—often including representatives
        from the sector ministry as well as ministries of finance and planning, and legal representatives

     •	 Involving specialist entities in different implementing roles. This is the case in Peru, for example, where
        the procurement agency is responsible for implementing the PPP transaction, and sector regulatory
        agencies are responsible for monitoring the private parties’ compliance with the PPP contract. Zevallos
        Ugarte’s book on lessons learned in concessions in Peru [#297] provides further details on the
        institutional framework for implementing PPPs

     •	 Involving dedicated PPP units, as described in Section 2.3.4. These units are a repository of skill and
        experience in developing PPPs. They often support contracting authorities in implementing PPP projects.
        In a few cases the PPP unit may take over primary responsibility as implementing agency. For example,
        the PPP Law in Chile (2010) authorizes the Ministry of Public Works as the implementing agency for PPPs,
        through its dedicated concessions unit [#46, Article 1-3, 6-9, 15-21, 25, 27-30, 35-36, 39-41]. Section 2.3.4
        provides several more examples of PPP units and the extent of their roles in implementing PPPs.

     Even governments with extensive experience using PPPs typically also make use of external advisors to
     support in detailed preparation and appraisal of a proposed PPP, as described in Box 2.6: Use of external
     advisors below.



          Box 2.6: Use of external advisors

          Even governments with long PPP experience do not have in-house all the expertise and skill
          needed to develop PPP projects. All engage external specialist advisors for detailed, technical
          tasks such as conducting feasibility studies and drafting PPP contracts [#271, #88]

          The extent and nature of external advisory support needed may change as the government
          and the country gains PPP experience. Initially, governments may rely heavily on advisors, and
          contract ‘full service’ transaction advisors providing the full range of technical skills needed as
          well as overall strategic support. Over time, responsible government teams may be better able
          to play an integrating role, and use advisors to provide specific technical or legal inputs.
                                     MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                        89




     Even when working with experienced advisors, however, it is important for the contracting
     authority to develop the internal capacity to manage the process effectively—to oversee the
     work of the advisors, and retain ownership of the structuring decisions. Over-relying on external
     consultants to drive the procurement process can put the contracting authority in a weak position
     for managing the contract over its lifetime.




Managing PPP Contracts
Monitoring the project performance and managing the contract usually falls to the contracting authority.
From roads and bridges to water provision and hospital services, line ministries and agencies typically have
the required technical knowledge and the policy focus for monitoring delivery. Some countries reduce
conflict in contract management by outsourcing to credible external entities, such as engineering firms, or
research institutions, certain specialized monitoring activities. For example, in Brazil, the state government
of Minas Gerais hires ‘Independent Verifiers’ for monitoring PPP performance; in France, engineering firms
are hired for monitoring PPP hospital infrastructure performance.

However, managing PPP contracts can be complex—particularly when it comes to dealing with change that
inevitably occurs over the lifetime of the contract (as described in Section 3.7.3: Dealing with Change. Some
countries therefore involve other, specialized entities in the contract management function; for example by:

•	 Creating a centralized contract management support function. For example, the United Kingdom,
   being a pioneer in large scale use of PPP contracts, was one of the first countries to experience this
   need. In 2006 the British Treasury invited the then-PPP Unit, Partnerships UK, to create a PFI Operational
   Taskforce, operating on behalf of the Treasury [#232, page 3]. This taskforce provided support to hundreds
   of contract managers and published guidance. The central PPP unit for British local governments, 4Ps
   (now called Local Partnerships—a company jointly owned by HM Treasury and the Local Government
   Association) also has a role in supporting local governments in carrying out their contract management
   role, and published in 2007 a Guide to Contract Management for PFI and PPP Projects [#229]

•	 Including responsibility for some aspects of contract management among the responsibilities of
   a dedicated ‘PPP Unit’, as described further below. For instance, the Concessions Unit of the Ministry
   of Public Works (MOP) in Chile monitors performance and manages PPP contracts on behalf of several
   ministries. Often this involvement may be limited to ‘non-routine’ events, or particularly challenging
   contract management tasks. In Korea, the PPP Unit PIMAC manages PPP contracts during the sensitive
   construction phase

•	 Allocating contract management responsibility to an independent regulator—a solution when
   relevant variables, such as the mechanism determining the fees to collect over time, are not clearly
   prescribed in the contract. However, the functions of ‘regulator’ and of ‘contract manager’ may
   collide—the contract manager is supposed to protect the public interest and the public purse, while
   the regulator may have a distinct and legally-mandated set of interests to preserve.

     2.3.3 Institutional Responsibilities: Review and Approval
     A PPP project is a type of public investment. Most governments have systems for reviewing and approving
     capital investment projects: to ensure all projects are effective at meeting objectives; provide value for
     money; and in line with fiscal priorities. Because PPPs often do not require capital investment by the
     government, they may not automatically be subject to these approval rules. Many governments therefore
     define similar review and approval requirements for PPPs. See Table 2.4 below for some examples.

     Often, several decision points are created, allowing weak projects to be stopped before they consume too
     many resources, or develop a momentum of their own. This is illustrated in Figure 2.2: Typical PPP Process.
     These iterative reviews are sometimes called ‘gateway’ processes. Monteiro’s article in IMF’s book on
     PPPs [#214] describes a typical ‘gateway’ process, and how this process works in Portugal. At a minimum,
     approval is typically needed to enter into a PPP transaction. Because the final cost of a project is not known
     until procurement is concluded, final approval may be needed before the contract is signed.

     Finance ministries typically have a leading role in this process, given their responsibilities for managing
     government resources, and (often) economic and fiscal policy. The IMF emphasizes the importance of the
     role of the finance ministry in its book on Public Investment and PPPs [#214, page 10]. In a few countries
     another entity has overall responsibility for overseeing the public investment program, and hence may play
     the same role for PPPs—such as the National Economic Development Agency (NEDA) in the Philippines.
     Many Ministries of Finance have established special PPP units through which to carry out their filtering and
     monitoring functions, as described further below.

     Other oversight agencies can also have a role in reviewing and feeding into PPP project approvals, mirroring
     their roles in any major capital investment project. These can include:

     •	 Planning agencies. Some systems separate responsibility for planning and project appraisal from fiscal
        oversight, with the latter housed in a dedicated planning agency. For example, in Chile the National
        Planning Authority must review and approve the economic analysis of proposed PPPs, as is the case for
        all public investment projects

     •	 Attorney generals may be required to approve major government contracts, including PPPs, as part of
        their role as the government’s legal advisor. For example, The PPP law of Tanzania (2010) requires that
        the implementing agency to submit the final draft PPP contract for approval by the Attorney General
        before the contract is executed [#224, pages 15-16].

     •	 Supreme audit entities. Many Latin American countries also require approvals from audit entities that
        are independent of the executive branch of government, as described further in Section 2.5: Broader
        PPP Program Governance. For example, in Brazil, the Courts of Audit (the federal Tribunal de Contas
        da União, or TCU, and the sub-national Courts) is required to review each PPP project and its legal
        documents before it can go to market.

     These additional reviews can be important checks on the quality and legality of the project appraisal
     and development process. However, they can also risk introducing delays at crucial points. Mechanisms
     for coordination can help, as described below. Capacity-building may also be needed to ensure these
                                           MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                                            91




institutions are able to fulfill their roles as they relate to PPPs.

Ultimately approval may be by Cabinet or Parliament; typically aligned with requirements for other investment
projects. Jurisdictions vary as to which entity can approve a PPP. A few countries require legislative approval
of projects. More often, approval may come from Cabinet or a Cabinet-level committee, the finance ministry,
or a combination. As described in Irwin’s paper on controlling spending commitments in PPPs [#161,
pages 113-114], approval power may depend on the size of the project, as is typically the case for other
capital investments.


Coordination
Investment decision-making for public investment projects is typically coordinated around the annual
budget process. However, because PPPs often do not have immediate budget implications, specific
coordination mechanisms may be needed to ensure reviews and approvals proceed smoothly and do not
hold up the project development process. In some cases PPP units are tasked with a coordinating role, as
described further in Section 2.3.4 below. Some governments also form inter-departmental committees to
oversee each PPP transaction, to ensure the perspectives of oversight agencies are taken into consideration
throughout the project development process rather than just at review points.

                    pages 16-19]               Development Authority (NEDA) Board. The members of the NEDA Board are Cabinet
                                               members responsible for the major infrastructure, economic and finance departments.

     2.3.4 Dedicated PPP Units
     Government teams aggregating staff with specific knowledge on PPPs are often called ‘PPP Units’. The
     functions of these PPP Units vary widely, as do their location within Government and team structure—
     reflecting the variation in priorities and constraints facing PPP programs both between governments, and
     within a government over time as the PPP program evolves.

     Functions allocated to such ‘PPP Units’ can include:

     •	 Policy guidance and capacity building—defining PPP policies and processes, and building the capacity
        of implementing agencies to follow those processes. This can often including preparing guidance
        materials and standard documentation for PPPs. Table 2.1: Example PPP Program Objectives and the
        ‘key references’ section in Module 3 provide examples of such guidance material

     •	 PPP promotion both within and beyond government—that is, encouraging sector agencies to consider
        using PPPs, or promoting the opportunities presented by the PPP program to potential investors

     •	 Technical support in implementing PPP projects. As described in Section 2.3.2: Institutional Responsibilities:
        Implementation above, this may involve providing hand-holding support to responsible implementation
        teams in Ministries or Agencies; or being directly responsible for some aspects of PPP implementation

     •	 ‘Gatekeeping’, or reviewing and overseeing the management of PPP projects for efficiency and
        affordability; and either approving PPP projects, or advising on the approval process. As described in
        Section 2.3.3: Institutional Responsibilities: Review and Approval, such reviews can take place at several
        stages during project development; while the oversight role of such PPP teams can extend into PPP
        implementation and portfolio management.

     PPP units may perform more than one of these functions, while a single PPP program may involve more than
     one PPP unit performing different roles.

     The structure and location within government and structure of PPP units typically depends on their
     combination of functions, as well as existing institutional roles and experience within Government. PPP

units may be departments within ministries or agencies, units with some kind of special status but reporting
to ministries, autonomous government entities, or even government-owned or public-private corporations.
Gatekeeping units are most often located within ministries of finance, or other oversight agencies; while
technical support units may be housed centrally, sometimes alongside other relevant functions such as
procurement, or be established at the sub-national or sector level where a sector has a significant PPP
program. Units with a PPP promotion focus may part of broader investment promotion entities.

The functions of PPP units, and hence their structure, may also change over time as the PPP program evolves.
For example, in the United Kingdom, the original Treasury Task Force (its first PPP Unit) was partially converted
into a joint public-private venture (Partnerships UK, or PUK, 51 percent owned by private entities), with more
of a focus on PPP promotion and technical support. However, as the PPP program developed and ministries
and agencies gained more experience, the focus shifted towards oversight and integration of PPP with the
broader public investment function. Eventually PUK was reabsorbed into government as ‘Infrastructure UK’.

The following studies provide more information on the functions and structure of PPP Units, detailed case
studies, and assessments of the effectiveness of these units in achieving their objectives:

•	 An OECD study on PPP units [#195], which describes the range of PPP unit functions along the lines
   of the list above, and provides detailed case studies of PPP Units in Germany, Korea, South Africa, the
   United Kingdom, and the State of Victoria, Australia

•	 A report by the Brookings Institution [#162] provides a similar break-down of the functions of PPP
   units, into three categories: review bodies, or gatekeepers; full service agencies providing technical
   assistance to review agencies, and centers of excellence acting as repositories of best practice.

   member countries’ PPP Units and institutional frameworks [#85, #86]

     2.4 Public Financial Management Frameworks for PPPs
     PPP contracts often have financial implications for Governments. Payment commitments under PPP contracts
     are often long-term, and can be contingent on one or more risks as Box 2.7: Types of Fiscal Commitments
     to PPPs describes. This can create particular challenges for public financial management, which is generally
     geared to annual appropriations for expenditure. For this reason, PPP-specific approaches to public financial
     management have been developed.
                                MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                   97




Box 2.7: Types of Fiscal Commitments to PPPs

Fiscal commitments to PPPs can be regular payments constituting all or part of the remuneration
of the private party, a means to share risk, or a combination of the two. Common types of
government fiscal commitments to PPPs include the following.

Direct liabilities

Direct liabilities are payment commitments that are not dependent on the occurrence of an
uncertain future event (although there may be some uncertainty regarding the value). Direct
liabilities arising from PPP contracts can include:

•	 ‘Viability gap’ payments—a capital subsidy, which may be phased over construction based
   on achievement of milestones, or against equity investments

•	 Availability payments—a regular payment or subsidy over the lifetime of the project, usually
   conditional on the availability of the service or asset at a contractually specified quality. The
   payment may be adjusted with bonuses or penalties related to performance

•	 Shadow tolls, or output-based payments—a payment or subsidy per unit or user of a
   service—for example, per kilometer driven on a toll road.

Contingent liabilities

Contingent liabilities means payment commitments whose occurrence, timing and magnitude
depend on some uncertain future event, outside the control of government. Contingent liabilities
under PPP contracts can include:

•	 Guarantees on particular risk variables—an agreement to compensate the private party for
   loss in revenue should a particular risk variable deviate from a contractually specified level.
   The associated risk is thereby shared between the government and the private party. For
   example, this could include guarantees on demand remaining above a specified level; or on
   exchange rates remaining within a certain range

•	 Compensation clauses—for example, a commitment to compensate the private party for
   damage or loss due to certain, specified, uninsurable force majeure events

•	 Termination payment commitments—a commitment to pay an agreed amount, should
   the contract be terminated due to default by the public or private party—the amount may
   depend on the circumstances of default

•	 Debt guarantees or other credit enhancements—a commitment to repay part or all of the
   debt used to finance a project. The guarantee could cover a specific risk or event. Guarantees
   are used to provide more security to a lender that their loan will be repaid.

Polackova’s paper on Government Contingent Liabilities [#206] defines direct and contingent
liabilities, and describes the fiscal risks posed by contingent liabilities in general.
98   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




     Section 1.3: Infrastructure Challenges and How PPPs Can Help describes some of the problems that
     commonly arise when the fiscal implications of PPPs are not carefully addressed and managed. Without
     specific rules to prevent this, PPPs can be used to bypass budget or borrowing limits. Governments also
     often underestimate the cost of bearing risk under PPPs, which can result in unsustainable levels of exposure
     to PPP-related risks.

     This chapter provides guidance for practitioners on public financial management for PPPs, to help avoid
     these pitfalls. The following sections describe how governments can:

     •	 Assess the fiscal implications of a proposed PPPP project

     •	 Control aggregate exposure to PPPs

     •	 Budget for fiscal commitments to PPPs

     •	 Reflect fiscal commitments to PPPs in government accounts and reports.

     The following resources provide helpful guidance across this range of public financial management issues
     for PPPs:

     •	 An IMF publication on Public Investment and Public-Private Partnerships [#214] provides a helpful
        set of articles on public financial management for PPPs, including sections on fiscal risks from PPPs, and
        on PPP accounting, reporting, and auditing. These are referenced in the relevant sections below

     •	 Funke, Irwin and Rial’s paper on Budgeting and Reporting for Public-Private Partnerships [#108]
        describes how well-defined approaches to accounting, reporting, and budgeting for PPP projects can
        help ensure PPP decision-making is driven by value for money considerations not accounting quirks

     •	 Posner, Ryu and Tkachenko’s report on the budgetary implications of PPPs [#207] examines the
        issues posed by PPPs for central budget offices—including the impact of PPPs on near and longer term
        fiscal targets and priorities, current budgetary practices of PPPs, and possible strategies to promote
        greater consideration of the short and longer term affordability of PPPs given fiscal space and priorities

     •	 A World Bank note on implementing a framework for managing fiscal commitments from PPPs
        [#292] provides guidance and examples on all these aspects of public financial management for PPPs;
        a related World Bank study on managing fiscal commitments from PPPs in Ghana [#290] goes into
        more detailed recommendations, including for example providing template reporting formats.


     2.4.1 Assessing Fiscal Implications of a PPP Project
     Public investment projects normally need to go through a project appraisal and approval process (to
     determine whether it is a good project), usually closely integrated with the budget process (determining
     whether and when the project is affordable). The finance ministry typically plays a central role in this process.
     Because PPPs often involve neither capital investment nor other expenditure in the short term, they may not
     be automatically included in these control mechanisms.
                                     MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                       99




Section 2.3: PPP Processes and Institutional Responsibilities describes how governments often create an
approval process for PPPs, which mirrors that used for their large investment projects. Such processes
generally provide a central role for the finance ministry. This section offers guidance on how the finance
ministry can decide whether to approve the fiscal commitments to a proposed PPP project. In doing so,
a finance ministry typically considers two questions: will the project provide value for money; and is the
project affordable.


Assessing whether a PPP will provide value for money
For most projects, assessing value for money means assessing whether the project is cost--benefit justified,
and the least-cost way of achieving the benefits. When assessing a PPP, some additional analysis is needed—
to check whether the PPP has been structured well, and will provide better value for money than public
procurement. Section 3.2: Appraising PPP Projects describes this analysis, and provides links to examples
and guidance.


Assessing whether a PPP is affordable
The second question is even harder to answer: Is the PPP project affordable? There are two main challenges
in answering this question for a PPP project.

First, it is not always clear how much the PPP will cost. Direct fiscal commitments are long-term, and may
depend on variables, such as demand (in the case of shadow tolls), or exchange rates (where payments are
made in foreign currency). Moreover, many fiscal commitments to PPPs are contingent liabilities, whose
occurrence, timing, and value all depend on some uncertain future events. Section 3.2: Appraising PPP
Projects provides guidance and examples on how the cost of fiscal commitments to a proposed PPP can
be calculated. Mostly this involves considering the modal or ‘best estimate’ value, hopefully correcting for
optimism bias, and scenarios for how that value might vary.

Second, because costs are long-term, and may be contingent, it is not easy to decide whether they are
affordable. An OECD publication on PPPs [#196, page 21] defines affordability to mean the ‘ability to be
accommodated within the inter-temporal budget constraint of the government’. For most government
expenditures, affordability is assessed by considering the annual budget constraint, and in some cases
the medium-term (typically three-year) expenditure framework. Table 2.5: Options for Assessing the
Affordability of Fiscal Commitments to PPPs describes two alternatives for PPPs. The approach may be
different for different types of fiscal commitments. Limits on the total stock of fiscal commitments to PPPs,
as described further below, may also affect decision-making for particular projects.

                                            	 Colombia’s law on contingent liabilities (1998) requires implementing agencies to make
                                                a cash transfer to a contingency fund when a PPP project is signed. The cash transfer
                                                is set equal to the expected value of programs under any revenue guarantees provided
                                                (these payments may be phased over several years). This means the decision to accept a
                                                contingent liability has an immediate budget impact that must be considered [#49, Article 6]




      2.4.2 Controlling Aggregate Exposure to PPPs
      As well as considering fiscal exposure project-by-project, some governments introduce targets or rules
      limiting aggregate exposure. A challenge is defining which types of fiscal commitments should be included—
      for example, does the rule apply to direct liabilities only, or are contingent liabilities included?

      One option is to introduce specific limits on PPP exposure. This approach is described in Irwin’s article on
      controlling spending commitments in PPPs [#161, p.114-115]. For example:

      •	 Peru’s Legislative Decree No.1012 (2008) [#199, Article 13] states that the present value of the total fiscal
         commitments to PPPs—firm commitments and measurable contingent liabilities—shall not exceed 7
         percent of GDP. However, every three years, the President may, with the endorsement of the Ministry
         of the Economy and Finance, issue a decree increasing or decreasing this limit, depending on the
         infrastructure needs of the country

      •	 In Hungary, the public finance law limits the total nominal value of multi-year commitments in PPPs to 3
         percent of government revenue (Act 38 of 1992, Article 12, quoted in Irwin paper in [#161])

      •	 Brazil’s Federal PPP Law (Law 11079, 2004) [#34] initially limited total financial commitments undertaken
         in PPP contracts to a maximum of 1 percent of annual net current revenue—in 2009 Law 12024 raised
         this limit to 3 percent, and in 2012 Law 12766 raised it again to 5 percent.

      As Irwin describes, creating PPP-specific limits—distinct from other limits on public expenditure—can
      simply create incentives for agencies to choose public procurement over PPP even when PPP would provide
      better value for money (or vice versa). Nonetheless, given the difficulties in deciding whether a particular PPP
      commitment is affordable, limits on aggregate exposure can be a helpful way to ensure the government’s
                                     MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                       101




total exposure to PPP costs and risk remains within manageable limits.

An alternative is to incorporate limits on PPP commitments within other fiscal targets. For example, some
governments introduce targets or limits on public debt. Some types of PPP commitment may be included
within measurements of public debt, following international norms or national rules. However, this usually
only applies in limited cases and restricted to the national level as highlighted by Liu and Pradelli [#177].
Their paper proposes a more rigorous monitoring framework of fiscal risks imposed by PPP debt by using a
minimum set of five sub-national debt indicators which also takes into account SPV’s debt. Irwin [#161] also
describes an alternative of establishing a limit on ‘debt plus PPP commitments’.


2.4.3 Budgeting for Government Commitments to PPPs
Budgeting for PPPs involves making sure that money is appropriated and available to pay for whatever cost
government has agreed to bear under its PPP projects. Because such cost may be contingent or occur in the
future, PPP budgeting can be hard to manage in traditional annual budget cycles. Nevertheless, credible
and practical budgeting approaches are needed for good public financial management, and to assure
private partners that they will be paid. This section describes how some countries have introduced systems
specifically to enable better budgeting for PPP payments, both direct and contingent.


Budgeting for Direct Commitments to PPPs
Direct commitments to PPP include capital subsidies during project construction, as well as ongoing
payments such as shadow tolls or availability payments.

When governments provide capital subsidies to PPPs, the payments required are similar to those for
traditionally government-procured projects. Because these payments are typically made within the first
few years of a project, they can be relatively easily built into annual budgets and medium-term expenditure
frameworks. Nonetheless, some governments have introduced particular funds (called Viability Gap Funds)
from which such payments will be made. One example of such a fund is in India, as described in Box 2.8.




     Box 2.8: Viability Gap Fund in India

     In July 2005, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs established India’s Viability Gap
     Fund (VGF) program through its approval of the ‘Scheme for Financial Support to Public Private
     Partnerships in Infrastructure’. The program has been very successful. During its first nine years,
     42 projects with a total project cost of over US$5 billion and VGF allocation of US$916 million
     have received final approval, while 178 projects with a total project cost of $17.7 billion and a VGF
     allocation of $3.4 billion have received in-principle approval.
102   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




           The primary objective of India’s VGF program is to attract more private investment in infrastructure
           by making PPP projects financially viable. Dissecting this primary objective reveals three underlying
           objectives:

           •	 Attracting more private investment to mobilize additional finance and more rapidly meet
              India’s infrastructure needs

           •	 Prioritizing PPP projects to improve efficiencies, control timing and cost, and attract private
              sector expertise

           •	 Developing projects through an ‘inclusive’ approach that does not neglect geographically or
              economically disadvantaged regions.

           Critically, knowing that the funding is available encourages firms to bid on India’s PPP projects.
           The resulting keen competition has meant that many projects that the government thought might
           need a subsidy have in fact been fully privately financed, without a VFG contribution being called
           on or in some cases with ‘negative grants’, or upfront payments by the private sector.

           The scheme is funded by the Government through its budgetary resources, with budget
           provisions made on an annual basis linked to likely demand for disbursements during the year. In
           the first year a budgetary provision of US$40 million was made. The scheme also provides for a
           revolving fund to be kept at the disposal of the Empowered Committee to ensure liquidity of the
           VGF, and replenished as needed. In any given year, the scheme provides for a cap on the value of
           projects approved equivalent to ten times the budget provisions for VGF in the annual plan—to
           ensure continuing liquidity and preventing bunching of disbursement requests as far as possible.
           This cap can be modified if the Ministry of Finance considers necessary. In practice, the cap has
           not been binding, and the total VGF support during any year has been based on the estimated
           requirement for disbursals during the coming year.

      Budgeting for long-term direct commitments, such as availability payments, is more challenging. The
      mismatch between the annual budget appropriation cycle and the multi-year payment commitments
      exposes the private party to the risk that payments may not be appropriated when due. This problem
      is not unique to PPPs—many other types of contractual payment commitments may extend beyond the
      budget year. In many jurisdictions, governments do not introduce any particular budgeting approach for
      direct, long-term PPP commitments, on the assumption that a responsible legislature will always approve
      appropriations to meet the government’s legally binding payment commitments.

      Where appropriations risk is high—typically in systems with a true separation of powers between the
      legislature and executive—mechanisms to reduce this risk may be warranted. In Brazil at the federal level,
                                      MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                         103




Law No.101 of 2000 requires subsidy payments to PPPs to be treated in the same way as debt service
payments—that is, they are automatically appropriated. This means that once the subsidy is approved, the
appropriations needed are not subject to further legislative approval. Although no federal subsidies have
been disbursed yet, this policy should help reduce the likelihood that committed funds are retracted and
provides investors with more certainty.

For more on budgeting for direct commitments to PPPs, see the World Bank report on fiscal subsidies
for PPPs [#287]. The study presents the appropriations mechanisms for Brazil at the Federal and State levels
(pages 15-16), Colombia (page 31), Mexico (page 46), and India (page 59).


Budgeting for PPP Contingent Liabilities
Budgeting for contingent liabilities can be particularly challenging, because payments may become due
unexpectedly. If savings cannot be found within the existing appropriations, government may need to go
back to the legislature to request a supplementary appropriation—often a difficult and contentious affair.

To overcome these difficulties, some governments introduce particular mechanisms for budgeting for
contingent liabilities under PPP projects. As described in Cebotari’s paper on managing contingent
liabilities [#44, pages 26-28], the first option is to create additional budget flexibility. This can include
creating a contingency line in the budget from which unexpected payments can be made. A contingency
line could be specific to a particular liability—say, those that are considered relatively higher risk—or cover
a range of contingent liabilities. Cebotari also notes that some countries allow spending in excess of the
budget without need for additional approval in certain, defined circumstances.

A second option, also described in detail by Cebotari [#44, pages 27-29], is to create a contingent liability
fund. A contingent liability fund (or guarantee fund) is an account (which may be within or external to the
government’s accounts) to which transfers are made in advance, and from which payments for realized
contingent liabilities will be made when due. The following are examples of contingent liability funds for PPPs:

•	 Colombia—Colombia has developed a sophisticated system for managing contingent liabilities arising
   from guarantees offered to toll road concessions. This system includes assessing the fiscal impact of
   guarantees before these are granted, and setting aside funds to cover the expected payments from
   the guarantees [#287, pages 32-33]. A Government Entities Contingent Liabilities Fund, established
   in 1998, has a special account that is managed by La Previsora, a Trust Company. The fund is funded
   by contributions by the government entities, contributions from the national Budget, and the returns
   generated with its resources. The government entities carry out the contingent liabilities valuation which
   is then approved by the Public Credit Division of the Ministry of Finance. Once the PPP is approved and
   implemented, the division carries out ongoing assessments of the value of the associated contingent
   liabilities [#49, Articles 3-8]

•	 São Paulo, Brazil—In the State of São Paulo, the São Paulo Partnerships Corporation (Companhia
   Paulista de Parcerias—CPP) was established in 2004 using resources from the sale of the government’s
   stake in State Owned Enterprises [#37, Articles 12-23]. Section 5 of State Governor’s Decree [#36, Articles
   11-12] describes the duties of CPP. The CPP manages its resources as a fiduciary fund provides real and
104   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




          fiduciary guarantees to PPP projects [#36, Article 15]. The CPP is managed by a Directorate made up of
          up to three members selected by the Governor of the State, a Management Council made up of up to
          five members selected by the Governor of the State, and a fiscal council. The CPP is an independent
          legal entity. The Government of the State can add capital to the fund using funds from the sale of shares
          in state owned companies or government-owned buildings, public debt titles, other goods or rights
          that are directly or indirectly owned by the Government. The World Bank review of Subsidy Funds for
          PPPs in LAC [#287, page 16] provides more background about the CPP

      •	 Indonesia—Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund, or IIGF, is a state owned enterprise established
         by Government Regulation and Ministry of Finance Decree in 2009. As one of the fiscal tools of the
         Government, IIGF is under direct supervision of the Ministry of Finance and has mandate to provide
         guarantees for infrastructure projects under of PPP schemes. IIGF is part of the government’s efforts
         to accelerate infrastructure development in Indonesia, by providing contingency support/guarantee
         for the risks caused by the government’s action or inaction. The Fund operates as a single window for
         appraising, structuring, and providing guarantees for PPP infrastructure projects. The single window
         provides certainty because it constitutes a consistent policy for appraising guarantees, a single process
         for claims, and it introduces transparency and consistency in the process which is critical for market
         confidence. IIGF provides guarantees against specific risks based on private sector demand in a variety
         of sectors—including power, water, toll roads, railways, bridges, ports, and others [#149]

      •	 South Korea—The Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Fund (ICGF) was established in 1994, being
         managed by a public financial institution. ICGF guarantees each project up to 300 billion won, for an
         annual guarantee fee capped at 1.5 percent of the total guarantee amount [#221]. Typically, the annual
         guarantee fees range between 0.3 and 1.3 percent. The guarantee operates as a subrogation—that is,
         ICGF pays back loans taken by the project company to the financial institutions in the case where the
         project company defaults on debt payments, if funds become insufficient, the government can provide
         additional contributions [#171].

      As well as providing a clear budgeting mechanism and thereby improving credibility, creating a fund can
      also help control the government’s fiscal commitments to PPPs—depending on how the fund is designed.
      For example, Colombia’s approach encourages discipline when deciding what liabilities to accept, as
      described in Section 2.4.1: Assessing Fiscal Implications of a PPP Project. Requiring a cash transfer from
      the implementing agency’s budget when a contingent liability is incurred means the decision to accept a
      contingent liability has an immediate budget impact that must be considered. In Indonesia, the government
      policy requires IIGF to accept contingent liabilities on the basis of careful assessment of the risk by the
      fund’s management.


      2.4.4 Fiscal Accounting and Reporting for PPPs
      Governments need to account for and report on their financial commitments, including those under PPP
      contracts. When reporting is done well, it encourages the government to scrutinize its own fiscal position.
      Making financial reports publicly available enables other interested parties—such as lenders, rating agencies,
      and the public—to reach an informed opinion on the government’s public financial management performance.
                                      MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                        105




Box 2.9: Types of Government Financial Reporting briefly describes the three types of government financial
accounting and reporting—government financial statistics, government financial statements, and budget
documentation and reporting—and the relevant internationally—recognized standards and guidelines that
apply in each case. In general, these standards set rules or guidelines for whether and how different kinds
of liabilities and expenditures should be recognized—that is, formally recorded in the financial statements
and statistics, or disclosed—that is, reported in notes or narratives. This section briefly describes how these
standards apply to PPPs, with some examples of how different countries have interpreted them in practice.




     Box 2.9: Types of Government Financial Reporting

     Most governments capture and report financial information in three related frameworks:

     •	 Government finance statistics—these are summary statistics on the state of a government’s
        finances, which are intended to be internationally comparable. These statistics may follow
        regional or international standards, such as those set by Eurostat for European Union
        countries, or the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) published in 2001 but
        with regular updates since that date [#156]

     •	 Government financial statements—most governments also publish audited financial
        statements. There are internationally-recognized standards on what should be in those
        financial statements, although in practice few governments meet those standards. The
        International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS, [#153]) is a modified version of
        the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IPSAS is designed for use in the
        public sector, while IFRS applies to companies. Some governments adopt local accounting
        standards that are a simplified version of the IPSAS standards

     •	 Budget documentation and reporting—most governments prepare reports on financial
        performance as part of budget preparation and reporting. These are not subject to any
        international standards, although there are international guidance materials that promote
        transparency—for example, the IMF’s Manual on Fiscal Transparency (2007) [#157] and the
        OECD’s Best Practices for Budget Transparency (2002) [#191].




Helpful overview resources on reporting and accounting for PPPs include:

•	 Funke, Irwin, and Rial’s paper on budgeting and reporting for PPPs includes a section on accounting
   for and reporting PPP transactions, which describes in detail the implications of accounting standards
   and statistical standards for PPPs [#108, pages 9-19]

•	 Part 4: PPP Accounting, Reporting, and Auditing in the collection of articles published by the IMF on
   Public Investment and Private Partnerships [#214]
106   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      •	 An OECD report on PPPs, value for money, and fiscal risk, which includes a section on budget
         scoring and accounting treatment of PPPs [#39, pages 90-105]

      •	 Cebotari’s report on contingent liabilities, which includes a section on disclosing contingent liabilities
         [#44, pages 32-41], with practical examples of different countries’ approaches, and an annex on the
         relevant international standards.


      Recognizing PPP Liabilities in Government Accounts
      Governments need to decide whether and when PPP commitments should be recognized—that is, formally
      recorded in financial statements as creating public assets, liabilities or expenses. This is important because
      limits or targets are often set on the government’s liabilities and expenditures. Whether or not PPP
      commitments are recognized as expenses or liabilities can therefore influence a government’s decision to
      pursue PPPs, or how to structure them, in a way that is not driven by achieving value for money. Section 1.3.1
      describes how some governments have used PPPs to circumvent limits on liabilities.

      The financial standards mentioned in Box 2.9: Types of Government Financial Reporting vary in their
      treatment of PPP fiscal commitments. A few standards specifically address when and how direct liabilities
      and assets of PPP projects should be recognized by the contracting governments:

      •	 International Public Sector Accounting Standards 32—introduced in 2011, IPSAS-32 defines when
         PPP assets and liabilities should be recognized, assuming a government is following IPSAS accrual
         accounting standards. Under IPSAS-32, PPP assets and liabilities appear on the government’s balance
         sheet, provided (i) the government controls or regulates the services the operator must provide with the
         PPP asset, to whom, and at what price; and (ii) the government controls any significant residual interest
         in the asset at the end of the contract. Under this definition, ‘government-pays’ PPPs would appear on
         the government’s balance sheet; the treatment of ‘user-pays’ PPPs is less clear, and depends on the
         details of the contract [#153, #154]. Moreover, IPSAS standards and associated guidance notes assume
         full accrual accounting (for example, such that the government prepares a full balance sheet capturing
         both assets and liabilities)—it is less clear how the principles of this standard can be applied where
         governments are practicing cash accounting

      •	 Recent updates to the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual set out criteria for classifying
         PPP assets and liabilities for statistical reporting purposes. Under these criteria, PPP assets and liabilities
         are accounted for in the government’s balance sheet if the government bears most of the project’s risks
         and rewards—for example, taking into consideration the degree to which the government controls the
         design, quality, size, and maintenance of the asset, and bears construction risk; as well as the allocation
         of demand risk, residual value and obsolescence risk, and availability risk

      •	 Eurostat guidelines—Eurostat requires European governments to recognize PPP liabilities in debt
         statistics where the government retains construction risk or demand or availability risk. Rougemont’s
         article on Accounting for PPPs [#214, pages 256-268] provides more detail. Since PPPs transfer those
         risks to the private party, under this rule most PPPs remain off the government’s balance sheet.
                                               MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                                          107




Most accounting and reporting standards do not require governments to recognize contingent liabilities,
including those arising from accepting risk under PPP contracts. Cebotari’s report on contingent liabilities
[#44, Annex I] describes one limited exception: IPSAS standards for governments implementing accrual
accounting require contingent liabilities to be recognized, only if it is more likely that not that the underlying
event will occur, and the amount of the obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability. In this case,
the net present value of the expected cost of the contingent liability should be recognized as a liability and
as an expense (a provision) when the contract is signed.


Disclosing PPP Liabilities
Most international reporting and statistical standards agree that even when PPP commitments are not
recognized as liabilities, they should be disclosed in notes to the accounts and reports. For example, an
IMF booklet on Public Investment and PPPs [#214, pages 14-17] describes what information should be
disclosed for PPPs in general, and specific disclosure requirements for guarantees. A World Bank report
on Disclosure of Project and Contract Information in PPPs reviews practices in several jurisdictions and
present best practices in the field.

Disclosing contingent liabilities can be particularly challenging, since it can be difficult to estimate their
value. Section 3.2: Appraising PPP Projects provides guidance on how the value of contingent liabilities
can be estimated. Cebotari’s paper on Government Contingent Liabilities [#44, pages 32-41] describes
international guidelines for how contingent liability exposure should be disclosed—including those under
PPP programs—and provides examples from several countries.

Cebotari’s paper also describes how some countries have interpreted these standards in practice. For
example, New Zealand and Australia disclose contingent liabilities—including to PPPs—in notes to financial
statements, available online. Since 2007, Chile’s Budget Directorate of the Ministry of Finance has
published an annual contingent liabilities report [#45], which initially presented information on contingent
liabilities from revenue and exchange rate guarantees to PPPs. This report has since been expanded to
cover other types of government contingent liability.

2.5 Broader PPP Program Governance
The executive branch of government is largely responsible for implementing PPP projects. The processes
and institutional responsibilities described in Section 2.3: PPP Processes and Institutional Responsibilities
largely aim to create checks and balances within the executive branch on how those decisions are made.
This section describes the broader governance of the PPP program—how other entities and the general
public participate in the PPP process, and hold the executive accountable for its decisions and actions.

A cornerstone of these accountability mechanisms is the timely and comprehensive disclosure of information
about the PPP program. The entities and groups outside the executive with a role to play in ensuring good
governance of the PPP program can then include:

•	 Supreme auditing institutions—many jurisdictions have independent audit entities, which can have a
   role in ensuring good governance of PPP programs. These entities may simply consider PPP commitments
   as part of their regular audit responsibilities—for example in auditing government financial statements.
   They may also review PPP project performance or investigate particular points of concern, or review the
   value for money of the program as a whole. These reviews in turn enable the legislature and the public
   to check on PPP program performance

•	 The legislature—the legislative branch of government often defines the PPP framework, by passing
   PPP legislation. In some cases, the legislature may be directly involved in the PPP process, approving
110   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




          PPP projects. More commonly, it exercises ex-post oversight, scrutinizing reports on the government’s
          PPP commitments

      •	 The public—the public can directly participate in PPP project design, through consultation processes,
         and in monitoring service quality by providing channels for feedback. Transparency of the PPP process
         as a whole, and an active media, can inform public opinion and—if the issues are serious enough—
         influence elections.

      Creating mechanisms through which the legislature, audit bodies, and the public can engage in the PPP
      process strengthens accountability, and helps make the PPP program more participatory, transparent, and
      legitimate. An example of a well-established positive feedback mechanism which involves all three oversight
      bodies can be seen in the United Kingdom—PPP audit reports are often used in legislative hearings where
      all their written recordings are available to the public on the National Audit Office’s website.


      2.5.1 Disclosure of PPP Project and Program Information
      Transparency in and of itself is an important principle of governance, as described in Box 2.1: Good
      Governance for PPPs—while timely access to information is also a crucial aspect of accountability
      mechanisms, including those described in the following sections. To this end, many countries disclose
      information about PPP projects and programs.

      Many governments proactively disclose PPP project or contractual information—that is, post this
      information in the public domain, without receiving a specific public request, such that it is freely accessible
      to anyone who is interested. This proactive disclosure can be achieved in various ways, such as by creating
      an online project database with key pieces of contract information, or an online library of PPP contracts,
      often with accompanying project summaries. Proactive disclosure of project and program information is
      often the responsibility of a PPP unit—for instance, Chile’s PPP unit located in the Ministry of Public Works
      provides information on contracts, contract variations, and monthly performance reports.

      Various countries engage in mandatory proactive disclosure of PPP project contracts in accordance with
      their transparency laws, freedom of information laws, or PPP laws. The disclosure practices are not uniform
      across countries, as to whether, when, and what information is disclosed. For example, Chile and Peru
      disclose the full contract, as does Minas Gerais in Brazil. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom,
      redact PPP contracts before they are made available to the public, with a view to protecting commercially
      sensitive information—although the definition of ‘sensitive information’ varies. Even in countries with no
      mandatory proactive disclosure, PPP contracts may be proactively disclosed by responsible sector ministries
      or agencies—for instance, road contracts are disclosed in India.

      Other countries, such as South Africa, provide reactive disclosure—that is, make information available only
      in response to a specific request by a member of the public. Procedures for making requests are outlined
      in the legislation or rules framed under the legislation. The terms of such reactive disclosure may vary by
      country—including the cost (which may range from nominal to substantial) and the required timeframe,
      which may be as much as a month or more in many cases.
                                     MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                       111




Disclosing PPP contracts may not be enough for the public to understand them—some additional
information on the projects, and a plain-language description of the main contract provisions, is useful.
For example, the Victorian Freedom of Information Act of 1982 requires that, besides publishing all
PPP contracts on Victorian Government Purchasing Board website [#23], a project summary is published,
providing information on the key project features and commercial terms of the project [#23, Section 19,
page 10].

The World Bank’s 2013 report on Disclosure of Project and Contract Information in PPPs presents the
above diversity of disclosure practices. The report identifies a gradual trend towards broader disclosure,
with several countries supplementing contract disclosure with project summaries presenting the main
contract provisions and additional information on the project, its origination, and its procurement.


2.5.2 Role of Supreme Auditing Institutions
Supreme audit entities are an important link in the chain of accountability for public expenditure decisions—
providing independent reviews of government finances and performance to parliaments and to the public.
The International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) provides an online list of its member
audit entities.

The mandate of supreme audit entities varies by jurisdiction, but often includes two types of audit. The
first is regularity audits, which can include auditing the financial statements of government entities and of
government as a whole, and auditing decision-making processes for compliance and probity. The second
is performance, or value for money audits—reviewing the government’s effectiveness and efficiency. Other
entities may play a similar role—for example, government procurement agencies may be responsible for
checking that procurement processes have been followed, as does the Contractor General in Jamaica.

Supreme audit entities can also have a role in PPP programs. In some jurisdictions, audit entities must
sign off on PPP contracts before they can be implemented. Audit entities may then need to consider PPP
commitments and processes as part of regular audits of contracting authorities and of the government as a
whole. Audit entities may also conduct performance audits of PPP projects, or review the value for money
of the program as a whole. This section describes each of these elements of auditing PPP programs. Audit
institutions performing these roles can help improve PPP program governance. However, to be effective
in doing so—rather than simply introducing delays, or saddling PPP programs with requirements that are
not appropriate for the specific needs of PPP—audit entities may need training and support. INTOSAI,
supported by the World Bank and by several Courts of Audits, delivers training activities for auditors, and
produced a series of manuals on PPPs.

For further examples of how PPP auditing works in practice, see the articles on PPP Audits in Portugal, and
Hungary’s audit experience with PPPs, in the IMF publication on Public Investment and PPPs [#214,
Chapters 17 and 18].
112   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




           Box 2.10: Audit Entity Access to PPP Company Information

           While the remits of supreme audit entities vary, they typically extend only to government agencies,
           and entities wholly or majority owned by government. Supreme audit entities therefore typically
           do not have the right or responsibility to audit PPP companies. Nonetheless, the private company
           often holds a lot of relevant information. The access of the audit entity to information held by the
           private party has the potential to create conflict.

           Public Auditing Guidelines for PPPs issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)
           of India (2009) discuss this issue in Section III: Scope and Objectives of PPP Audit. The guidelines
           suggest that access rights for the CAG in carrying out PPP projects may need to be defined in
           the public audit statute. In the meantime, the guidelines note that the audit entity is likely only
           to have access to information held by the contracting authority given its contract monitoring role
           [#132, Section 3, pages 29-38]. In the United Kingdom, this type of access is provided through
           mechanisms in the PPP contract itself.

           INTOSAI has published guidelines for auditing PPP projects (2007) which note that the audit
           entity must be clear about its access rights to the private company associated with the PPP [#158,
           Section 1, Guideline 1, page 9].




      Regularity auditing for PPPs
      When carrying out regularity audits of contracting authorities, audit entities may need to check that PPP
      commitments are appropriately reflected in accounts, and that PPP processes have been followed.

      For example, the South Africa PPP Manual Module 7: Auditing PPPs [#219] describes how the scope of the
      Auditor General’s annual regularity audits applies to PPPs. This includes:

      •	 Checking compliance—the Auditor General is required to check that the requirements of the PPP
         Regulations have been met, for example that the appropriate treasury approvals were sought and
         granted

      •	 Checking financial reporting—the Auditor General must also check the financial implication of the PPP
         for the institution. This includes checking that information on PPPs in ‘notes to the financial accounts’ is
         correct, and that commitments to PPPs have been accounted for appropriately. For more on accounting
         requirements for PPPs see Section 2.4.4: Fiscal Accounting and Reporting for PPPs.

      According to the guidelines, the Auditor General in South Africa may also carry out forensic audits (should
      the regular audits raise any suspicion of fraud or corruption), or performance audits, as described further in
      the following section.
                                      MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                          113




Performance auditing of PPP projects
Auditing agencies may also carry out performance, or value for money audits of particular PPP projects.
INTOSAI published guidelines for auditing PPP projects in 2007 [#158] with the aim to help audit
entities carry out thorough performance audits of PPP projects, leading to recommendations for improved
performance, and the spread of good practice.

The INTOSAI guidelines recommend that the audit office review a PPP project soon after procurement,
and carry out further reviews over the project lifetime. The guidelines recommend the review cover all
major aspects of the deal that have a bearing on value for money. They provide guidance for reviewing how
the PPP was identified, how the transaction process was managed, the tender process adopted, how the
contract was finalized, and on-going management of the PPP contract.

Auditors and other similar bodies may in particular review particular projects where there is concern over
whether processes have been appropriately followed, or whether the project is providing value for money.

The following are examples of PPP project performance audits:

•	 In the State of New South Wales, Australia, the Auditor-General audited the Cross City Tunnel through
   Sydney. The 2006 report included an analysis of the process in which the PPP contract was awarded,
   how the contracted was eventually amended, and whether the costs of the project to citizens were
   justified. The project was criticized for its high tolls, lower than expected levels of traffic, and a lack of
   transparency in the amendment of the initial contract. The Auditor-General provided opinions on each
   of these issues based on the analysis [#10]

•	 The State of Victoria, Australia, awarded concession contracts (called ‘franchises’) for the tram and train
   system in the city of Melbourne. When these operators ran into financial difficulties, the government
   decided to renegotiate with the existing private contractors, rather than re-tender. Because of the
   concerns this raised for the resulting value for money, the government committed to carrying out an ex-
   post value for money audit of the concessions and renegotiations. The report, published in 2005, focused
   on the effectiveness of the responsible agency, transparency of the process, proper risk allocation of
   the project, the development of public sector benchmarks, and adequate monitoring systems.


Auditing the PPP program
In some countries with well-developed PPP programs, audit entities have undertaken value for money
reviews of the PPP program as a whole. For example, in the UK, audit entities have compared PPPs and
traditionally procured public projects, to assess whether and how PPPs provide value for money, and feed
back into PPP decision-making.

In 2011, the National Audit Office published a review of the PFI program and other large procurement
projects and provided key lessons from the UK’s experience [#254]. The NAO assessed various aspects of
the program, including value for money, project preparation and implementation, and accountability. Based
on this analysis, the NAO offered recommendations for future improvements to the PFI program [#254]. The
findings were discussed in Module 1.

      2.5.3 Role of Legislative Bodies
      The legislative branch of government—that is, the elected, law-making parliament or assembly—may
      engage in the PPP process in several ways. These include:

      •	 Defining the PPP framework—the PPP Framework is often established in specific PPP legislation. As
         described in Section 2.2: PPP Legal Framework, one rationale for introducing a PPP law is to enable the
         legislative branch of government to set rules for how PPPs will be developed and implemented, against
         which those responsible can be held accountable.

      •	 Defining limits on PPP commitments—as described in Section 2.4.2: Controlling Aggregate Exposure
         to PPPs, the legislature may limit total PPP commitments, or the amount taken on in a year, or otherwise
         govern the risk and inter-generational equity issues that PPPs can create

      •	 Approving PPP projects—PPP projects may require parliamentary approval, as described in Section
         2.3.3: Institutional Responsibilities: Review and Approval. This requirement can be limited to PPP
         projects above a certain size. For example, the Hungarian PPP Act (1992) states the government must
         seek Parliament’s approval before signing a contract creating multi-year payment obligations with a
         present value of more than US$230 million. In Guatemala, on the other hand, all PPP contracts require
         approval from Congress. In the United States as of 2010, nine States require some individual projects to
         be approved by the state legislature

      •	 Receiving and reviewing reports on the PPP program—as described in Section 2.4: Public Financial
         Management Frameworks for PPPs, many governments include information on the PPP program in
         budget documents and other financial reports. This gives Parliament the opportunity to scrutinize
         the government’s commitments to PPPs, and hold the decision-makers responsible after the event.
         Parliaments may also commission and receive auditors’ reports on the PPP program and processes, as
         described further in Section 2.5.2: Role of Supreme Auditing Institutions.

      Examples of legislative reviews of PPP programs are described below:

      •	 The Public Accounts and Estimate Committee in the Parliament of Victoria, Australia reviewed
         Partnerships Victoria, the PPP program, in the context of governance, risk allocation, accountability,
         protecting the public interest, economic benefits and value for money, and international accounting
         standards for PPPs. Recommendations were then made to improve PPP policies and strengthen
         governance of the projects [#18].


      2.5.4 Role of the Public
      PPPs are meant to provide value to the public. Getting the right level of public involvement in the PPP
      process and program can make or break the legitimacy of a PPP program, and directly contribute to good
      governance as defined in Box 2.1: Good Governance for PPPs. Direct public participation—by service users
      or other stakeholders—at various points in the PPP process can improve project design and performance.
      Equally important, making PPP projects and processes transparent enables PPP performance to be a factor
      in public policy debate, and in the formation of public opinion on the government’s overall performance.
                                             MODULE 2 PPP Basics - Establishing the PPP Framework                                       115




Public participation in the PPP project process
Involving services users and other stakeholders directly in developing and monitoring a PPP project can
improve project design and performance.

During the PPP project development stages, stakeholder consultation is an important part of the PPP
development process, allowing the concerns of potential service users and others affected by the project to
be taken into consideration when structuring and implementing PPPs. Section 3.3: Structuring PPP Projects
provides more guidance on carrying out stakeholder consultations as part of developing a PPP.

Once the PPP is in place, user feedback can be an important aspect of PPP performance monitoring.
Firstly, some projects involve user feedback as an efficient, decentralized mechanism for collecting contract
monitoring information. Second, an effective mechanism for resolving grievances may be an important
aspect of project design. Ultimately, the purpose of the PPP is to provide services to users—in this respect,
user satisfaction, or whether services meet users’ expectations, can be an important (albeit subjective)
measure of PPP project performance alongside more technical or functional attributes.

User feedback mechanisms can be structured in various ways, as described further in Section 3.7: Managing
PPP Contracts—some projects provide a web portal for continuous user-based input, others conduct
regular user surveys. A specific mechanism may also be needed for user grievances.

                                             Implementing PPP Projects



This module provides guidance on each stage of developing and implementing a PPP project—from initially
identifying candidate projects, to managing PPP contracts through the project lifetime. Section 2.3.1: PPP
Process introduced the overall PPP development and implementation process, also shown in Figure 3.1:
PPP Development and Implementation Process. This module describes each stage in the PPP process in
more detail, providing links to resources, tools, and further guidance for PPP practitioners.

Governments only want to develop ‘good’ PPP projects—that is, PPPs for projects that are cost-benefit
justified, where the PPP provides better value for money than traditional public procurement, and is fiscally
responsible (see Box 3.3: PPP Project Appraisal Criteria). However, whether a project meets all these
criteria cannot be fully assessed until the project is fully designed, and cannot be confirmed until bids are
received. This creates a Catch 22 situation—the government does not want to incur the considerable costs
of developing a PPP unless it knows the project meets the criteria, but cannot tell if it meets the criteria until
the project has been developed.

Successful PPP programs tackle this problem through an iterative approach, of progressively more rigorous
screening at successive stages of project development. The idea is that projects must seem likely to be
suitable for development as a PPP before any public money is spent on them. Then, the processes of
preparation is broken into successively more intensive and expensive phases, with a check before each
phase that it seems likely that the project will continue to meet the criteria required for all successful PPPs.

                                           This module describes this iterative process for developing a PPP, as follows:

                                           •	 Project identification and screening—the process of developing and implementing a PPP is typically
                                              preceded by identifying a priority public investment project, typically through a public investment
                                              planning and project selection process. At some point in this process some or all proposed public
                                              investment projects are then screened for their potential as a PPP

                                           •	 Candidate projects that survive the ‘screening’ are then developed and appraised. Again, this is
                                                            MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                    119




    an iterative, or multi-stage, process—hence appraisal and structuring are shown in parallel in Figure
    3.1 above. Because appraisal and structuring are different things conceptually, the Reference Guide
    discusses first one (Section 3.2 on appraisal) and then the other (Section 3.3 on structuring). In reality,
    projects will typically be partially structured, then partially appraised, then more fully structured, and
    more fully appraised. Different countries break up these iterative steps differently. The end result, often
    called a ‘Business Case’, is typically the basis for approval to proceed with the PPP transaction

•	 Before the PPP transaction can be implemented, the draft PPP contract needs to be prepared—
   further refining the PPP structure by setting out its details, in appropriate legal language. Section 3.4
   sets out some key elements of PPP contract design

•	 Managing a PPP transaction is a complex process. A well-designed and well-implemented transaction
   process is central to achieving value for money from the PPP. As described in Section 3.5: Managing
   PPP Transactions, this can include marketing the PPP, checking the qualifications of bidders, inviting
   and evaluating proposals, interacting with bidders during the process, and identifying and finalizing
   the contract with the selected bidder. At the end of the transaction, after bids are received and the
   contract agreed, government will finally know the cost and risks in the PPP project. At this point it may
   be checked once more to ensure it still meets the PPP criteria

•	 As an alternative approach to originating and developing PPP project ideas, some governments accept
   unsolicited proposals for PPP projects from private companies, as described in Section 3.6.

•	 Having executed the contract, the PPP enters the final and longest ‘stage’—managing the contract
   throughout its lifetime, as described in Section 3.7.

This guidance module is far from an exhaustive resource—developing a PPP is a complex process and every
project has vagaries. Public officials should hire experienced advisors when implementing a PPP project.
The World Bank toolkit for hiring advisors for PPP in infrastructure provides extensive guidance on
engaging and managing advisors.


Overall guidance on implementing PPP Projects
As described in Module 2, some governments develop detailed guidance material or manuals for PPP
practitioners. The World Bank and other multilateral institutions have also published guidance material and
toolkits on developing and implementing PPP projects, including sector-specific materials.

The table below lists some of the best PPP guidance documents published by governments with successful
PPP programs, and by multilateral organizations. The relevant sections of these manuals are included as
‘further resources’ for each PPP stage in the sections below.

3.1 Identifying PPP Projects
The first step towards a successful PPP is identifying a potential PPP project. Since a PPP is first and foremost
a public investment, most successful PPP projects originate from the broader public investment planning
process, as described in Section 2.3.1: PPP Process. At some point in this process, priority public investment
projects can be screened for their potential to achieve better value for money if implemented as a PPP—
several governments have established tools and checklists to support this screening. The online toolkit for
PPPs in India [#141] provides a good overview of PPP project screening process.

As shown in Figure 3.2: Identifying PPP Projects, the output of the project identification stage is typically
a PPP concept, and an initial assessment (sometimes called a strategic, or outline business case) of the
rationale for pursuing the project as a PPP. In many countries this must be formally approved before
continuing to develop the PPP further.

                              3.1.1 Identifying Priority Public Investment Projects
                              The starting point—or precursor—to identifying a potential PPP is identifying a priority public investment
                              project. Many governments have well-defined processes and methodologies for public investment
                              planning—which may extend from setting out sector or infrastructure strategies, assessing project options
                              to meet objectives, conducting detailed feasibility and cost-benefit analyses, to project prioritization in an
                              overall public investment plan or fiscal envelope.

                              Sound public investment planning and management is crucial to the success of PPP projects. A well-
                              structured and managed PPP will not be effective unless it addresses clearly-identified objectives that are
                              central to sector needs—particularly since the long-term nature of PPP contracts effectively locks in asset
                              and service specifications over a long-term period. However, while public sector investment management
                              provides the context for successful PPPs it is not the focus of this Reference Guide. The World Bank Website
                              section on Public Investment Management provides a wealth of resources and examples on this topic.

                              In some cases, PPP project ideas may also emerge from other sources than the standard public investment
                              planning process. These could include:

                              •	 Sector reform processes. Governments undertaking reform of an under-performing infrastructure
                                 sector may consider PPP among a range of options for introducing private participation to improve
                                 performance in a particular infrastructure sector, as described in Section 1.1.2: What PPP is Not: Other
                                 Types of Private Involvement. The ADB’s PPP Handbook chapter on sector diagnostic analysis [#8,
                                 Chapter 3] describes how potential PPPs may emerge in the context
                                                               MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                      123




•	 Unsolicited proposals from businesses. Some governments provide ways in which businesses and
   other non-government entities may originate PPP project ideas, for consideration by government—as
   described in Section 3.6: Dealing with Unsolicited Proposals. This can be a way to capitalize on the
   ideas of the private sector on how to solve infrastructure challenges.

However, wherever a PPP is developed outside the typical public investment planning process, this raises the
risk that such ideas may not be well-integrated with broader sector and infrastructure plans and priorities.
Such project ideas should be subject to the same analysis and screening as any proposed public investment
and PPP.


3.1.2 Screening for PPP Potential
At some point in the process of identifying priority public investments, or sector reform options, projects
may be screened for their potential to be implemented as a PPP. The objective of this screening is to
identify—based on the available information—whether the project may provide better value if implemented
as a PPP.

In practice, different governments do this PPP screening at different stages, as described in Box 3.1: PPP Selection
in the Public Investment Planning Process below. Some may screen all projects, as part of a comprehensive
‘procurement options analysis’, as described in [#39, pages 47-50]. Others may consider PPP only for certain
project types—as may be established in the PPP Policy [see Section 2.1.2: PPP Program Scope]. In many countries,
the initial impetus to develop a project as a PPP is left to the discretion of the implementing agency.




     Box 3.1: PPP Selection in the Public Investment Planning Process

     The PPP process can be seen as a ‘branch’ of the broader public investment management
     process—that is, at some point a project is selected as a potential PPP, and thereafter follows
     a PPP-specific process. However, this ‘branching’ can occur at different points in the public
     investment process. For example, this could be:

     After budgeting as a public investment project, as is the case in Australia and the Netherlands,
     where procurement options (including PPP) are assessed only once a project has been approved
     and budgeted for as a public investment project. If the project is subsequently implemented as a
     PPP then budget allocations are adjusted accordingly

     After project appraisal and approval as a public investment. For example, in Chile all public
     investment projects undergo cost-benefit analysis by the National Planning Commission, and
     must pass a hurdle social return rate to be added to a list of public investments. PPP projects are
     also taken from this list
124   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




           After ‘pre-feasibility’ or strategic options analysis. For example, in the Republic of Korea a
           potential PPP is identified as such after pre-feasibility analysis, and detailed project appraisal (such
           as technical feasibility studies, or cost-benefit analysis) is carried out as part of the PPP appraisal
           process. A similar approach is followed in South Africa, where PPP implementation is considered as
           part of an initial ‘needs analysis and options assessment’ of a potential public investment project.

           In any case, well-defined PPP processes typically mirror public investment management
           processes—for example, requiring approvals by the same bodies, as described further in Section
           2.3.3: Institutional Responsibilities: Review and Approval.

           Infrastructure Projects: Case Studies from the Republic of Korea [#171, page 63]; South Africa PPP manual [#219, Module
           4, pages 1-13]




      To support this screening process, many governments introduce criteria or checklists for PPP potential,
      against which projects can be compared. Box 3.2: PPP Potential Screening Factors in South Africa provides
      an example of such a checklist, from the South Africa PPP Manual [#219]. Similar criteria may be also
      used for more detailed appraisal, as described in Section 3.2.3: Assessing Value for Money below—at the
      screening stage, the idea is to check if they are sufficiently likely to be met for the project to proceed to the
      next level of development.




           Box 3.2: PPP Potential Screening Factors in South Africa

           The South Africa PPP Manual lists the following, as factors to consider when deciding whether a
           project could achieve value for money as a PPP:

           •	 Scale of the project—are transaction costs likely to be justified? In Module 2 of this Reference
              Guide, Section 1: PPP Policy describes how some governments set a minimum size for their
              PPP projects

           •	 Outputs capable of clear specification—is there reason to believe we can write a contract
              that will hold provider accountable

           •	 Opportunities for risk transfer (and other PPP value drivers)—is there good reason to
              believe that a PPP will provide value for money compared to the alternative of traditional
              public procurement? That is: to achieve appropriate risk allocation—so risks are largely
              allocated to the party best able to control or bear them—and capitalize on the PPP value
              drivers set out in Module 1, Box 1.1: PPP Value Drivers
                                                                  MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                125




     •	 Market capability and appetite—is there a potentially viable commercial project and a
        level of market interest in the project? Assessing market appetite may require initial market
        sounding with potential investors.

The following resources provide further suggestions and guidance on the factors to take into account when
screening potential PPP projects:

•	 India’s online PPP toolkit [#143] includes a ‘suitability filter’ that guides the user to consider the factors
   described in Box 3.2: PPP Potential Screening Factors in South Africa, as well as the supportiveness of
   the public sector environment (including an assessment of the public sector capacities to implement the
   project as a PPP); the existence of potential barriers to project implementation (based on information
   from the pre-feasibility study), and other factors such as the expected effort and resources needed to
   develop the PPP (for example, whether standard contracts are already available)

•	 In Colombia, the implementing agency must present an Executive Report to the PPP Unit requesting
   authorization to implement the project as a PPP. The analysis in this report—such as pre-feasibility
   analysis—is described in the PPP Manual [#55, pages 34-38]. The PPP Unit then assesses the report by
   applying a Project Eligibility Index, as described in the Finance Ministry’s technical note on eligibility
   analysis [#54]. The index measures the “necessary conditions” for implementing a project as PPP,
   which include: the organizational and functional capacity of the implementing agency to structure a
   PPP project, likelihood of attracting competent partners, risk, project size and duration, urgency, and
   stakeholder views. The document also presents the questions that the implementing agency must
   answer to generate the information that the PPP Unit will need to apply the eligibility index

•	 The Government of Hong Kong’s Guide to PPPs [#131, pages 31-32] describes a list of criteria that a
   PPP should meet at the initial screening stage (or ‘stage one business case’), to be considered as having
   a prima facie case for implementation as a PPP.

While identifying PPPs among the sector’s priority investment projects is typically the responsibility of the
relevant ministry, department, or agency, under new PPP programs sector agencies often need support
to overcome initial unfamiliarity or reluctance to adopt PPPs. This can be among the roles of a central PPP
unit, as described in Section 2.3.4: Dedicated PPP Units. Developing a PPP and running a PPP transaction
is typically more expensive than the equivalent process for a traditional public investment project, which
can also deter agencies from identifying PPPs. Additional funding for PPP development can help level this
playing ground. For example, the India Infrastructure Project Development Fund [#139] was established as
a revolving fund, and can fund up to 75 percent of PPP project development expenses.

The outcome of this screening process is a pipeline of PPP projects, set in the context of an overall
infrastructure and sector strategic plan. Making this PPP pipeline public can be a good way to build private
sector interest in investing in PPPs in a country. The Chilean PPP Unit, Coordinación de Concesiones de
126   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      Obra Pública, shares all relevant information on their project pipeline on their website. Farquharson et al
      describes the advantages of defining the ‘investment framework’ for a PPP program—including the PPP
      pipeline, and the complementary other planned infrastructure investments [#95, pages 21-22].


      3.1.3 Building an Initial PPP Pipeline
      In countries with relatively new PPP programs, project selection often means sifting through the various
      project concepts already generated by sector agencies, and screening these projects for PPP potential
      using the approach described in Section 3.1.2: Screening for PPP Potential. In this context, Governments
      may also take into consideration additional criteria in deciding which potential PPP projects to develop
      first. Often at this stage the priority is to build experience and momentum in the PPP program by achieving
      project successes in a relatively short timeframe.

      Several factors may feed into this process. For example, the Philippines PPP Center notes that projects in
      its PPP program pipeline (on its ‘PPP List’) were selected based on the following criteria:

      •	 Project readiness and stage of preparation—some projects have been further developed than others
         before being proposed as PPPs, reducing the remaining project development cost

      •	 Responsiveness to the sector’s needs—the order of implementation of PPP projects needs to be
         aligned with overall sector priorities within the strategic plan—in other words, PPPs should be central to
         the development of the sector, not peripheral projects whose benefits may turn out to be marginal, or
         which may distract from strategic priorities

      •	 High ‘implementability’—prioritizing PPP projects with a high likelihood of success, that are considered
         most likely to attract private sector interest, and for which there is a precedent in the local or regional
         market.

      In an interview with the Reason Foundation, the Director of the Puerto Rico PPP Authority also describes
      how the Authority initially prioritized PPP projects that were most ready to go to market, as well as ensuring
      that these corresponded with overall policy priorities (such as brownfield school PPPs).

3.2 Appraising PPP Projects
Appraising a PPP project means checking it makes sense to develop the project, and to implement it as a PPP.
Many successful PPP programs establish PPP ‘appraisal criteria’—these are the criteria used to decide whether
or not a proposed PPP project is a good investment decision. As Box 3.3: PPP Project Appraisal Criteria sets
out, appraisal criteria typically require at least four questions to be addressed: Does the project make sense
at all—that is does it meet standard project appraisal criteria such being technically feasible and cost-benefit
justified? Is the PPP opportunity commercially attractive to the market? Will the project deliver more value for
money if done as a PPP than under conventional procurement? Is the project fiscally responsible?




      Box 3.3: PPP Project Appraisal Criteria

      In deciding whether to pursue a project as a PPP, governments need to assess whether the PPP is
      a good use of resources. This typically involves assessing the project and proposed PPP against
      four key criteria:

      •	 Feasibility and economic viability of the project—whether the underlying project makes
         sense, irrespective of the procurement mode. First, this means confirming that the project
         is central to policy priorities and sector and infrastructure plans. It then involves feasibility
         studies to check the project is possible, and economic appraisal to check the project is
         cost-benefit justified, and the least-cost approach to delivering the expected benefits. This
         appraisal may be carried out prior to identifying the project as a possible PPP, or as part of
         the PPP development process
128   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




           •	 Commercial viability—whether the project is likely to be able to attract good-quality sponsors
              and lenders by providing robust and reasonable financial returns. This is subsequently
              confirmed through the tender process

           •	 Value for money of the PPP—whether developing the project as the proposed PPP can be
              expected to best achieve value for money, compared to the other options. This can include
              comparing against the alternative of public procurement (where that would be an option). It
              can also include comparing against other possible PPP structures, to check that the proposed
              structure provides the best value (for example that risks have been allocated optimally)

           •	 Fiscal responsibility—whether the project’s overall revenue requirements are within the
              capacity of users, the public authority, or both, to pay for the infrastructure service. This
              involves checking the fiscal cost of the project—both in terms of regular payments, and fiscal
              risk—and establishing whether this can be accommodated within prudent budget and other
              fiscal constraints.

           These criteria (with some variations) are described in more detail in “Public-Sector Investment
           Decision” chapter in Yescombe’s book on PPPs [#295, Chapter 5], “Selecting PPP projects” in
           Farquharson et al [#95, Chapter 4], and “Project identification” chapter in the EPEC “Guide to
           Guidance” [#83, Chapter 1].




      This Section describes how PPP practitioners can assess a proposed PPP against each of the criteria described
      in Box 3.3: PPP Project Appraisal Criteria; Section 3.2.1: Assessing Project Feasibility and Economic Viability;
      Section 3.2.2: Assessing Commercial Viability; and Section 3.2.3: Assessing Value for Money.

      Figure 3.3: Appraise PPP Projects shows how project appraisal fits in to the overall PPP process. Initial
      assessment against each criterion is typically done at the project identification and initial screening stage,
      as described in Section 3.1: Identifying PPP Projects. Detailed appraisal is typically first done as part of
      a detailed ‘business case’, alongside developing the PPP project structure as described in Section 3.3:
      Structuring PPP Projects. For example, assessing the value for money of the PPP depends on risk allocation,
      which is an important part of PPP structuring. An initial risk allocation could be assessed for whether it will
      provide value for money, which assessment might result in changes to the risk allocation.

      PPP appraisal is typically re-visited at later stages. In particular, the final cost (and so, affordability and value
      for money) is not known until after procurement is complete, when the government must make the final
      decision to sign the contract. Many governments require further appraisal and approval at this stage.

                                     3.2.1 Assessing Project Feasibility and Economic Viability
                                     It only makes sense to do a project as a PPP if the project itself is sound. Most governments therefore
                                     subject proposed PPP projects to the same technical and economic appraisal as any other major public
                                     investment project. There are typically two broad elements to this assessment. The first is developing, and
                                     assessing the feasibility of, the project concept. The second is appraising whether the project is a good
                                     public investment decision—typically based on some form of economic viability analysis.

                                     This assessment may take place prior to ever considering a project as a PPP, as described in Section 3.1:
                                     Identifying PPP Projects. In other cases it may be undertaken as part of the PPP appraisal process. Either
                                     way, the project feasibility and economic viability analysis for a PPP should typically be no different to that
                                     for any other major public investment project. This section therefore describes such analysis very briefly
                                     as it may be applied to potential PPP projects, highlighting key issues that would typically be addressed,
                                     and providing a selection of sources that may usefully supplement other governments’ existing guidance
                                     material.

      Defining project and checking feasibility
      Before being appraised, a project must be defined. That is, the project should be clearly defined as to its
      physical outline, the technology it will use, the outputs it will provide, and the people it will serve. Capital,
      operating, and maintenance costs should be estimated, as well as any revenue expected to be generated.
      This definition should be sufficiently broad to apply to a project delivered as either a PPP or a conventional
      publicly financed project.

      The project concept is typically then tested for feasibility across several dimensions:

      •	 Technical feasibility—can the project actually be implemented as planned, using proven technologies,
         and without unreasonable technical risks?

      •	 Legal feasibility—are there any legal barriers to the project? For a PPP this includes considering
         whether there are any legal constraints on the government’s ability to enter into a PPP contract

      •	 Environmental and social sustainability—at a minimum, does the project comply with national
         environmental and planning standards? In some cases, a higher bar may be set, such as compliance
         with the equator principles—a set of standards on managing environmental and social risk from project
         finance transactions, based on World Bank Group standards, set out in detail at [#75].

      Answering these questions usually involves engaging experts to undertake several detailed studies—for
      example, technical feasibility studies, legal analysis, environmental, and social impact assessments. For
      further guidance, see for example the detailed manuals published by the governments of Chile [#47],
      Colombia [#54], Germany [#111], Peru [#201], Philippines [#204], and the United Kingdom [#238] for
      carrying out feasibility studies for public sector investment projects.


      Appraising project economic viability
      Many governments undertake some form of economic viability analysis, to decide whether a proposed
      project is a good use of public resources. A project is economically viable if the economic benefits of the
      project exceed its economic costs.

      Generally speaking, the economic costs of the project are the same as its financial costs—though in some
      cases, other non-market costs, such as environmental damage, may be taken into account. The economic
      benefits are a measure of the value the project will deliver to people. The revenue a project will generate is
      usually a lower bound estimate of its economic benefits—but benefits can be much higher than revenues.
      For example, the benefits from improved transportation can exceed the tolls paid on a highway. The value
      of education at a high school is measured by the enhancement in the lives and prospects of the children who
      attend, even if no school fees are charged. Economic viability analysis can also include ‘cost-effectiveness’
      analysis, to determine whether the project is the lowest-cost way to achieve the identified benefits.

      There is a wide range of literature and guidance material available on project appraisal and economic
      cost-benefit analysis. The Reference List at the end of this section provides a selection, with examples of
                                                              MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                    131




government guidance material, as well as resources from international institutions, and textbooks. The
British Green Book on appraisal [#238] states as the main purpose of appraisal guaranteeing that no
project, program, or policy is adopted without answering two major questions: ‘Are there better ways to
achieve this objective?’, and ‘Are there better uses for these resources?’.


Application to PPPs
Many countries require PPP projects to meet feasibility and economic viability criteria. Often this is because
meeting these criteria is a requirement for all major government projects, as described above. Other times
the requirements are defined specifically for PPP projects. Either way, the content of the appraisal is typically
the same. For example:

•	 In the Philippines, all major infrastructure projects are required to pass through a well-structured
   feasibility and viability assessment process, set out in a detailed reference manual [#205]. The same
   process is generally required for PPP projects

•	 In Chile, the 2010 Concessions Law states that the social evaluation of a potential PPP project must be
   approved by the Ministry of Planning. This is one of the documents that the Concessions Council must
   review before allowing a project to be implemented as a PPP

•	 In Indonesia, guidelines issued by the government-owned Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund
   specify criteria by which requests for guarantees to PPP projects will be assessed. The criteria include
   technical feasibility, economic viability, and environmental and social desirability.

Common challenges in project appraisal—such as optimism bias—also apply when assessing PPPs (see
Section 1.3.2 Poor Planning and Project Selection), and should be addressed. The United Kingdom
Treasury has published guidance material on overcoming optimism bias.

Implementing agencies should also bear in mind that the work done in assessing project viability also lays
the foundation for the rest of the PPP appraisal. The project definition provides the basis for developing the
PPP financial model and commercial and fiscal viability analysis, as well as any quantitative value for money
analysis. Assessment of technical feasibility, social and environmental sustainability will provide a basis for
the risk analysis. Cost and demand estimates developed for the economic viability assessment will also
provide initial inputs to the financial modeling, and value for money analysis.


3.2.2 Assessing Commercial Viability
Having established that the project is viable, the next step may be to consider whether, if structured as a
PPP, it would be attractive to the market. Will private parties see the opportunity as something attractive to
pursue? Generally speaking, private parties will find a project commercial attractive if it offers good financial
returns, and requires the private party to bear only reasonable levels of risk.

Assessing returns typically involves financial analysis—that is, building a project financial model and
checking project cash flows, returns, and financial robustness. The ADB’s PPP Handbook [#8, pages 17-18]
132   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      gives a brief overview of typical financial analysis of a PPP. Yescombe’s chapter on financial structuring
      [#295] provides a more comprehensive description.

      Where revenue from user charges exceeds costs plus the commercially required return on capital, the
      project will generally be commercially attractive (provided risks are seen as reasonable). Where user charges
      are not at this level, government can use the financial analysis to assess the government contributions that
      will be needed—which in turn needs to be assessed as part of the fiscal analysis discussed in Section 2.4.1:
      Assessing Fiscal Implications of a PPP Project.

      Governments also often assess the appetite of potential partners for a proposed PPP, before taking it to
      market. This could include simply considering whether similar projects have previously been implemented
      with private partners in the country or region. It can also include testing market interest by market sounding—
      that is, presenting to potential investors the main parameters of the project (typically the project concept and
      initial structure, developed during the structuring phase described in Section 3.3: Structuring PPP Projects,
      for questions and comments. The following resources provide more guidance on market sounding:

      •	 Farquharson et al’s chapter on managing the interface with the private sector [#95, Chapter 8],
         which includes ‘top 10 tips’ for a successful market-sounding exercise

      •	 4Ps paper on ‘soft market testing’ [#229], which includes tips, practical guidance, and a case study of
         a market sounding exercise for a PPP in the United Kingdom

      •	 Grimsey and Lewis’ chapter on procurements options analysis [#121, pages 409-411], which
         describes a market sounding exercise for a hypothetical example hospital PPP project

      •	 Singapore’s PPP Handbook [#216, pages 56-57], which requires implementing agencies to conduct
         market sounding before pre-qualification, and describes the type of information that should be shared
         at this stage.

      Market sounding may be done by government agencies directly, or may be delegated to transaction
      advisors. Experienced transaction advisors tend to know likely bidders for many kinds of PPP projects—using
      them to assess market interest allows government to take advantage of these relationships, which can result
      in market feedback that is more honest and specific than an inexperienced government agency would be
      able to elicit on its own. Where local experienced transaction advisors are not available, governments may
      perhaps hire advisory services from multilateral financial organizations, such as IFC PPP advisory services
      and support provided by the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF)’s PPP advisory facility.


      3.2.3 Assessing Value for Money
      A key objective of most governments in implementing PPPs is to achieve value for money in providing
      needed infrastructure. ‘Value for money’ means achieving the optimal combination of benefits and costs,
      in delivering services users want. Many successful PPP programs require an assessment of whether a PPP
      is likely to offer better value for the public than conventional public procurement—often called ‘value
      for money analysis’. A value for money comparison can be done for a specific proposed PPP project. It
                                                             MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                    133




can also be done at a program level, for projects with common characteristics. For example, the United
Kingdom Treasury’s manual on assessing value for money [#237] described how value for money should
be assessed at both the program and project levels—but that methodology was later considered biased
and recalled by government.

Value for money (VFM) analysis typically involves a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches.
Qualitative VFM analysis involves sense-checking the rationale for using PPP—that is, asking whether a
proposed project is of a type likely to be suitable for private financing, and whether the conditions are in
place for the PPP to achieve value for money—for example, that the PPP has been structured well, and that
competitive tension is expected. This often takes place at a relatively early stage of PPP development—
as such, qualitative VFM analysis may constitute part of the PPP ‘Screening’ described in Section 3.1.2:
Screening for PPP Potential.

Some PPP programs also require quantitative assessment of value for money. This typically involves
comparing the chosen PPP option against a ‘Public Sector Comparator’ (PSC)—that is, what the project
would look like if delivered through conventional procurement. This comparison can be made in different
ways. The most common is to compare the fiscal cost under the two options—comparing the risk-adjusted
cost to government of procuring the same project through traditional procurement, to the expected cost
to government of the PPP (pre-procurement) or the actual PPP bids (post-procurement). An alternative is to
compare the two options on an economic cost-benefit basis—that is, to quantitatively weigh the expected
benefits of a PPP over conventional procurement against its additional costs.

Value for money analysis—particularly the use of quantitative ‘public sector comparator’ methodologies—
has been subject to wide debate. Some question the value and relevance of a PSC approach, which can
appear to be more ‘scientific’ than is actually the case, potentially misleading decision-makers; or conversely,
may simply come too late in the process to be a genuine input to decision-making. A World Bank report
on Value for Money [#293] analysis presents evidence on practices from several countries, and on trends
regarding the scope of value-for-money analysis and the relative advantages of quantitative and qualitative
approaches.

disadvantages, see also:

      The remainder of this section briefly describes and provides further resources for readers on qualitative and
      quantitative value for money assessment methodologies.


      Qualitative value for money assessment
      Qualitative VFM analysis typically involves sense-checking the rationale for using PPP—that is, asking
      whether a proposed project is of a type likely to be suitable for private financing; as well as whether the
      conditions that are necessary to achieve value for money are in place, as described in Farquharson et al,
      [#95, pages 42-43]. This often takes place at a relatively early stage of PPP development—as such, qualitative
      VFM analysis may overlap with the ‘PPP Screening’ process described in Section 3.1.2: Screening for PPP
      Potential above—but may be repeated throughout the project development process.

      Some jurisdictions have clearly-defined criteria for this analysis. For example:

      •	 The UK Treasury has defined criteria for assessing suitability, and unsuitability, for a Private Finance
         Initiative (PFI—the UK’s PPP model). Suitability criteria include the long-term, predictable need for the
         service; the ability to allocate risk effectively—including through performance-related payments and
         ensuring sufficient private capital at risk; the likely ability of the private sector party to manage risk
         and take responsibility for delivery; presence of stable and adequate policy and institutions; and a
         competitive bidding market. “Unsuitability” criteria include projects that are either too small or too
         complicated; sectors where needs are likely to change or there is a risk of obsolescence (for example,
         PFI projects are no longer used in the ICT sector in the UK); or where the contracting authority is
         inadequately skilled to manage PPP [#293]

      •	 In France, “preliminary analysis” of a PPP includes checking against several criteria under three
         categories: PPP relevance—for example, appropriateness of an integrated, whole-of-life approach to
         managing a project; commercial attractiveness; and the potential for optimal risk allocation [#293]

      •	 In the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, assessment of a potential PPP at “high level” and detailed
         screening stages also considers proposed road projects against specific criteria to determine if the project
         is delivered under the Public-Private Transportation Act (PPTA)—that is, as a PPP. These criteria include
         whether a project is sufficiently complex to benefit from private sector innovation; whether a PPP can
         achieve appropriate risk transfer; and the degree of stakeholder support. The extent to which a project can
         generate revenues from tolls is also taken into consideration when assessing possible PPP structures. [#293]

      The EPEC Guide to Guidance also includes a list of key conditions that should be met to have a higher
      probability of achieving Value for Money [#83, Chapter 1.2.4].


      Standard PSC—comparing fiscal cost
      The most common quantitative tool for value for money assessment of a PPP project is derived from the
      approach originally used in the United Kingdom’s PFI program in the early 1990s as described in Leigland’s
      Gridlines article on the PSC [#175]. It involves comparing the fiscal cost of a PPP delivery options with that
      of a conventional public delivery option.
                                                            MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                    135




The focus of the Fiscal Cost approach to Value for Money analysis is the construction of a Public Sector
comparator (PSC)—the cost to government of implementing the project through traditional public
procurement. Calculating the PSC can be complicated, as several adjustments are needed to ensure a fair
comparison. Box 3.4: How the Public Sector Comparator is Calculated, and highlights some methodological
debates.

This type of PSC can be used at two stages of the procurement process, as described in the OECD book’s
chapter on the economics of PPPs [#194, pages 71-72]. These are:

•	 Before the bidding process—the PSC can be compared with a ‘shadow’ or ‘reference’ PPP, or ‘market
   comparator’—a model of the expected cost of the project under the PPP option. This can help identify
   whether the PPP can be expected to provide value for money, before deciding to go ahead with
   detailed preparation and procurement. The reference PPP model would be the same as the financial
   model described in Section 3.2.2: Assessing Commercial Viability.

•	 During the bidding process—the PSC can also be compared with actual PPP bids received, to assess
   whether the bids provide value for money. This approach is used in Australia, and is described in a PSC
   Technical Note [#14].


Despite the appealing logic of the concept, there have been many criticisms of the usefulness of the PSC and
fiscal cost comparison approach in countries where it has been used frequently, such as the United Kingdom
and Australia. A United Kingdom House of Lords’ review of the PPP program, for example, argued that
shortage of relevant data and methodological issues limit the value of the PSC. The government’s response
to the review agrees that the PSC provides only a partial picture, and highlights that its use is balanced with
qualitative analysis, as described above.

Leigland’s Gridlines article on the PSC [#175, pages 2-3] summarizes these criticisms, which include the
inevitable inaccuracy of estimates over a long-term project, lack of consensus on methodology, and so the
possibility of manipulation to reach the desired conclusion. Grimsey and Lewis [#119, pages 362-371] describe
some of these criticisms in more detail. Given these challenges, Leigland’s Gridlines article [#175, pages 3-4]
also discusses whether and how the PSC approach could make sense in a developing country context.




     Box 3.4: How the Public Sector Comparator is Calculated

     Calculating a PSC can be complex. The starting point is typically the best estimate of the capital
     cost and lifetime operations and maintenance cost of implementing the project under public
     procurement. This is typically adjusted, to enable a fair comparison between the PSC and the
     PPP. The Infrastructure Australia guidance note on PSC [#15, Section 2.3] describes two types
     of adjustment:
136   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




          •	   Risk adjustments—one of the main differences between traditional procurement and the
               PPP approach is that the PPP transfers more risks to the private party. The return on investment
               expected by the private party will take into account these transferred risks. This means that to
               make a fair comparison, the PSC should also take into account the cost of these risks

          •	   “Competitive neutrality” adjustments—a public sector project or enterprise may have cost
               advantages or disadvantages compared to private company, which create costs or benefits
               to the government that are not normally taken into account when considering the cost of a
               traditionally procured project. For example the tax liabilities under the two options may be
               different. These differences should be corrected for in calculating the PSC.

          There are also differences in the timing of payments between the PPP option—where payments
          are often spread over time—and traditional procurement, where the government must meet
          construction costs upfront. The streams of payments are usually converted into net present
          values, to give a single value for comparison. This requires defining the appropriate discount rate
          to apply to future cash flows in both the PPP and PSC models.

          The following provide further descriptions and examples of how the PSC is used and calculated
          in different countries:

          •	 The United Kingdom Treasury’s detailed guidance for quantitative PSC assessment was
             recalled in 2013, being replaced with a mix of qualitative and quantitative assessment

          •	 South Africa’s PPP Manual Module on the PPP Feasibility Study includes a detailed
             description of how to calculate and use the PSC [#219, Module 4, pages 17-49]

          •	 Colombia’s technical note on PSC analysis [#56] defines the concepts of PSC and value for
             money, and provides both detailed guidance and an example of how to calculate the PSC.

          Methodological differences and challenges

          Although the PSC has been widely used, the particular methodology differs between countries,
          and there is on-going debate on several methodological points. For example, Shugart’s article
          on the PSC [#215] highlights two related issues: which is the appropriate discount rate to use
          when calculating present values, and how the cost of risk should be taken into account. Grimsey
          and Lewis [#118] and Gray, Hall and Pollard [#117] both a so focus on the choice of discount
          rate, and its relationship with risk allocation under PPP and traditional procurement. Partnerships
          Victoria’s FAQs and Common Problems in PSC Development [#21] also touch on these issues,
          and describe some other common problems.
                                                              MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                137




     Some countries in Latin America, such as Colombia and Perú, have developed guidelines for
     implementing the Public Sector Comparator methodology. However, due to lack of capacity and
     or trustworthy information to implement such a complex methodology, none of these countries
     have implemented the full methodology in practice.

     The World Bank report on Value for Money assessment practices [#293, pages 23-28] reviews
     methodological evolution and practices in several governments with significant PPP experience,
     including the United Kingdom, France, India, Chile, the state of Virginia, and British Columbia, Canada.




Economic cost-benefit comparison of PPP and public procurement
One of the criticisms sometimes leveled at the PSC is that it focuses solely on the financial cost to
government of PPP or traditional procurement. A more comprehensive approach would also take into
account the differences in expected benefits, and compare the net economic benefit under PPP or under
public procurement. On the other hand, as Grimsey and Lewis note [#118, page 353], this adds further
complexity to the value for money analysis over the PSC approach, and could risk making the results even
more subjective.

For example, the EPEC’s note on non-financial benefits of PPP [#84] suggests how some of the benefits of
PPP—as described in Section 1.3: Infrastructure Challenges and How PPPs Can Help—could be quantified,
and added to a more typical PSC analysis.

Few countries have introduced this kind of analysis in practice. New Zealand’s new PPP program is an
exception, and adopts cost—benefit analysis as the main tool for assessing procurement options. New
Zealand’s PPP guidance material [#189, pages 6-12] asks practitioners to identify the possible benefits of
PPP over traditional public procurement—from among the value drivers as described in Box 1.2: PPP Value
Drivers—and where possible to assign dollar values to each benefit.

In many developing countries’ PPP programs, the aim is not just to reduce cost, but to transform service
delivery. For example, governments hope that roads will be better maintained, thus delivery much greater
benefits in terms of trade and economic development. These changes in service levels and quality cannot
be captured by comparing fiscal costs of PPP and public procurement. Where these expected benefits are
important, and quantitative value for money analysis is desired, economic cost-benefit analysis may be the
better approach.


3.2.4 Assessing Fiscal Implications
A proposed PPP project may be feasible and economically viable, and value for money analysis may show
that a PPP is the best way of procuring it. Nonetheless, the procuring government also needs to decide
whether the PPP is affordable and fiscally responsible, given its fiscal constraints.
138   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      Many governments have entered into PPPs not fully understanding their possible cost. This can create
      significant fiscal risk for governments (see Section 1.3.1). To avoid this pitfall, governments need to assess
      fiscal affordability when they appraise a PPP project—so that they do not go to market with projects that
      they cannot afford.

      Fiscal commitments can be either ‘direct’ or ‘contingent’. Direct commitments are those the government
      knows it will have to make if the PPP project goes ahead—for example, the availability payments for a school
      PPP. Contingent payments are ones that will only be made if certain events occur—for example, payments
      that may have to be made under a minimum traffic guarantee if traffic levels are below projections on a PPP
      highway, or even worse compensations in the event of early termination (for more on these concepts, see
      Box 2.7: Types of Fiscal Commitments to PPPs).

      Governments need to assess the likely costs of both types of commitments, as set out below. Once likely
      fiscal costs are identified, Government needs to assess whether those costs will be affordable. Section 2.4.2:
      Controlling Aggregate Exposure to PPPs describes how governments can assess the affordability of those
      commitments. For example, this can include comparing annual cost estimates against the projected budget
      of the contracting authority, considering the impact on debt sustainability, or introducing specific limits on
      different types of PPP commitment. A World Bank note on implementing a framework for managing
      fiscal commitments from PPPs [#292] provides an overview of typical types of fiscal commitments to PPP
      projects, and how these can be assessed.


      Assessing cost of direct fiscal commitments
      Direct fiscal commitments may include up-front capital contributions or regular payments by government
      such as availability payments or shadow tolls. Box 3.5: Direct Payment Commitments to PPP Projects.




           Box 3.5: Direct Payment Commitments to PPP Projects

           Direct liabilities are payment commitments that are not dependent on the occurrence of an
           uncertain future event (although there may be some uncertainty regarding the value). Direct
           liabilities arising from PPP contracts can include:

           •	 Upfront ‘viability gap’ payments—an up-front capital subsidy (which may be phased over
              construction, or against equity investments)

           •	 Availability payments—a regular payment or subsidy over the lifetime of the project, usually
              conditional on the availability of the service or asset at a contractually specified quality. The
              payment may be adjusted with bonuses or penalties related to performance
                                                             MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                     139




     •	 Shadow tolls, or output-based payments—a payment or subsidy per unit or user of a
        service—for example, per kilometer driven on a toll road.

     For more on types of payment commitments, see Module 2 of this Reference Guide, Section 4:
     Public Financial Management for PPPs.




The nature of the government’s direct commitments will be defined during the structuring process described
in Section 3.3: Structuring PPP Projects. This highlights the importance of an iterative process between
appraisal and structuring. The government needs to have an idea of the level and type of support that will
be needed in order to assess fiscal affordability, before investing large amounts in project preparation.
Fiscal limits set in appraisal can then inform further structuring efforts, until the project converges on a
structure that is both fiscally responsible and attractive to the market. In fact, the value of the direct fiscal
commitments is often a key bid variable, as described in Section 3.5: Managing PPP Transactions. This
means the fiscal cost cannot finally be known until after the tender process is complete.

During the appraisal stage, the value of the direct fiscal commitments required can be estimated from the
project financial model, described in Section 3.2.2: Assessing Commercial Viability. The value of these direct
payment commitments is driven by the project costs and any non-government revenues. The value of the
direct fiscal contribution required is the difference between the cost of the project (including a commercial
return on capital invested) and the revenue the project can expect to earn from non-government sources
such as user fees.

The fiscal cost can be measured in different ways:

•	 Estimated payments in each year—that is, the amount that the government expects to have to pay in
   each year of the contract, given the most likely project outcomes. This is the most useful measure when
   considering the budget impact of the project

•	 Net present value of payments—if the government is committed to a stream of payments over the
   lifetime of the contract—such as availability payments—it is often also helpful to calculate the net present
   value of that payment stream. This measure captures the government’s total financial commitment to
   the project, and is often used if incorporating the PPP in financial reporting and analysis (such as debt
   sustainability analysis) Calculating the net present value of requires choosing an appropriate discount
   rate—the choice of discount rate to apply when assessing PPP projects has been a subject of much
   debate, as described below.

In both cases, it is also helpful to estimate how the payments might vary—for example, they may be linked
to demand, or be denominated in a foreign currency and so be subject to exchange rate changes. Irwin’s
paper on fiscal support to PPPs [#160, pages 16-17 and Annex] provides more detail on measuring the
cost of different kinds of fiscal support.

Having estimated the cost of direct payment commitments, the government needs to decide if they are
140   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      affordable. Section 2.4.2: Controlling Aggregate Exposure to PPPs describes how some governments
      consider the affordability of direct payment commitments under PPPs—for example, this can include
      projecting current spending levels forward, or introducing specific limits on government payment
      commitments to PPPs. An OECD publication on PPPs [#194, pages 36-46] provides a helpful overview.


      Assessing cost of contingent liabilities
      Contingent liabilities arise in well-designed PPP project because there are some risks that government is
      best placed to bear. Which risks these are should be defined throughout project structuring (see Section
      3.3: Structuring PPP Projects) Box 3.6: Contingent Liabilities Under PPP Projects describes some types of
      contingent liability that governments may accept under PPP contracts.




           Box 3.6: Contingent Liabilities Under PPP Projects

           Contingent liabilities are payment commitments whose occurrence, timing and magnitude
           depend on some uncertain future event, outside the control of government. Contingent liabilities
           under PPP contracts can include:

           •	 Guarantees on particular risk variables—an agreement to compensate the private party
              for loss in revenue should a particular risk variable deviate from a contractually specified
              level. The associated risk is thereby shared between the government and the private party.
              For example, this could include guarantees on demand remaining above a specified level; or
              on exchange rates remaining within a certain range

           •	 Compensation clauses—for example, a commitment to compensate the private party for
              damage or loss due to certain, specified, uninsurable force majeure events

           •	 Termination payment commitments—a commitment to pay an agreed amount, should
              the contract be terminated due to default by the public or private party—the amount may
              depend on the circumstances of default

           •	 Debt guarantees or other credit enhancements—a commitment to repay part or all of the
              debt used to finance a project. The guarantee could cover a specific risk or event. Guarantees
              are used to provide more security to a lender that a loan will be repaid.

           For more on types of payment commitments, see Module 2 of this Reference Guide, Section 4:
           Public Financial Management for PPPs. The EPEC note on State Guarantees in PPPs [#82, Section
           2] provides further detail on the different types of guarantees that governments may offer to PPP
           projects.

Assessing the cost of contingent liabilities is more difficult than for direct liabilities, since the need for,
timing, and value of payments are uncertain. Broadly speaking, there are two possible approaches, as
described in the Infrastructure Australia guidance note for calculating the PSC [#14, pages 84-109]:

•	 Scenario analysis—scenario analysis involves making assumptions for the outcome of any events or
   variables that affect the value of the contingent liability, and calculating the cost given those assumptions.
   For example, this could include working out the cost to government in a “worst case” scenario, such as
   default by the private party at various points in the contract. It could also include calculating the cost of
   a guarantee on a particular variable—say, demand—for different levels of demand outturns

•	 Probabilistic analysis—an alternative approach is to use a formula to define how the variables that
   affect the value of the contingent liability will behave, and use a combination of mathematics and
   computer modeling to calculate the resultant costs. This enables analysts to estimate the distribution of
   possible costs, and calculate measures such as the median (most likely) cost, the mean (average) cost,
   and different percentiles (for example, the value within which the cost is likely to lie 90 percent of the
   time) However, to produce useful results it requires a lot of information on the underlying risk variables.

Scenario analysis is the simpler form of risk analysis, and gives a sense of the range of possible outcomes,
but not their likelihood. In practice most governments use scenario analysis, if anything, to assess the
possible cost of contingent liabilities. A probabilistic approach requires more input data, and complex
statistical analysis. In practice, only a few governments have used probabilistic analysis to assess a few types
of contingent liabilities.

Irwin’s book on government guarantees [#161] also provides a comprehensive discussion of why and how
governments accept contingent liabilities under PPP projects by providing guarantees, and how the value
of these guarantees can be calculated. The following resources provide more guidance and example of
how particular countries approach this problem:

•	 Colombia’s Ministry of Finance has defined its approach to (i) assessing the financial and economic
   implications of contingent liabilities, (ii) accounting, budgeting and assessing the fiscal implications of
   contingent liabilities, and (iii) identifying, classifying, quantifying and managing contingent liabilities.
   This approach is set out in a presentation on “management of contingent liabilities” [#53]

•	 In Chile, the Ministry of Finance has developed a sophisticated model for valuing minimum revenue
   and exchange rate guarantees to PPPs. This valuation is updated on an on-going basis for all PPP
   projects, and reported in an annual report on contingent liabilities [#45]. The report includes a brief
   description of the techniques used in Chile to analyze and value guarantees extended to PPP projects.
   Irwin and Mokdad’s paper on managing contingent liabilities from PPP projects [#162, Appendix
   1] also describes the Chilean methodology in more detail

•	 Peru’s Finance Ministry has also published a methodology for valuing contingent liabilities under
   PPPs—available on the Ministry’s website section on managing contingent liabilities [#200]

Defining and publishing a methodology for valuing contingent liabilities from PPPs is only part of the
solution—implementing such methodologies in practice can be demanding. Governments may need to
142   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      strike a balance between building capacity in risk analysis, and adopting sufficiently straightforward and
      simple approaches to this assessment that can be implemented in practice.

      Having estimated the cost of contingent liabilities, the government can assess whether they are affordable
      given fiscal constraints. For example, as described in Section 2.4.2: Controlling Aggregate Exposure to
      PPPs, this could include considering the implications of PPP contingent liabilities in the context of overall
      debt sustainability analysis, or specific limits on PPP liabilities. A few countries have introduced contingent
      liability funds to ring-fence and budget for these liabilities. The EPEC publication on State Guarantees in
      PPPs [#82] also provides a helpful overview of different approaches to managing the fiscal implications of
      PPP contingent liabilities.

3.3 Structuring PPP Projects
‘Structuring a PPP project’ means allocating responsibilities, rights, and risks to each party to the PPP
contract. This allocation is defined in detail in the PPP contract. Project structuring is typically developed
iteratively, rather than drafting a detailed contract straight away. The first step is to develop the initial project
concept into key commercial terms—that is, an outline of the required outputs, the responsibilities and risks
borne by each party, and how the private party will be paid. The key commercial terms are typically detailed
enough to enable practitioners to appraise the proposed PPP, as described in Section 3.1: Identifying PPP
Projects, before committing the resources needed to develop the draft PPP contract in detail.

                                           Figure 3.4: Structuring PPP Projects shows how PPP structuring—to the level of key commercial terms—fits
                                           into the overall development process. As described in the introduction to this Module, PPP structuring
                                           and PPP appraisal are in practice parallel and iterative processes. Information from the feasibility study
                                           and economic viability analysis is a key input to PPP structuring—for example, identifying the key technical
                                           risks, and providing estimates for demand and users’ willingness to pay for services. The PPP structure then
                                           feeds into commercial viability, affordability and value for money analysis—which may find that changes are
                                           needed to the proposed risk allocation. The aim is typically to structure a PPP that will meet the relevant
                                           appraisal criteria set out in Box 3.3: PPP Project Appraisal Criteria—that is, be technically feasible and
                                           economically viable, commercially viable, fiscally responsible, and provide value for money.

                                           The starting point for PPP structuring is the project concept: that is, the project’s physical outline, the
                                           technology it is expected to use, the outputs it will provide, and the people it will serve. These are often
                                           developed before deciding whether to implement the project as a PPP, as described in Section 3.1:
                                           Identifying PPP Projects.

                                           The detailed specification of output req uirements, for inclusion in the PPP contract, is described further
                                           in Section 3.4: Designing PPP Contracts. Most resources on PPP project structuring focus on identifying
                                           and allocating project risks. This makes sense, since appropriate risk allocation is behind many of the PPP
                                           Value Drivers described in Box 1.2: PPP Value Drivers. Following this approach, the other elements of the
                                           PPP structure—such as the allocation of responsibilities and the payment mechanism—stem from the risk

allocation. For example, construction risk may be allocated to the private party, on the basis that the private
party is best-qualified to manage construction. This means that the private party should also be allocated
the responsibility and right to make all construction-related decisions. The mechanism for allocating
commercial risk to the private party may be to define a ‘user-pays’ payment mechanism.

This section follows the literature, starting with identifying and prioritizing project risks (3.3.1: Identifying
Risks) then describing how risks are allocated (3.3.2 Allocating Risks) 3.3.3 Translating Risk Allocation into
Contract Structure then describes how the risk allocation relates to the other aspects of project structure.


3.3.1 Identifying Risks
The first step toward structuring the PPP is often to put together a comprehensive list of all the risks
associated with the project. Such a list is known as a ‘risk register’. In this context, a ‘risk’ is unpredictable
variation in the project’s value—from the point of view of some or all stakeholders—arising from a given
underlying ‘risk factor’’. For example, ‘demand risk’ is the risk that the project value, and project revenues,
will be lower (or higher) than expected because demand is lower (or higher) than expected. Irwin’s book
on PPP guarantees and risk defines risk in more detail [#161].

PPP risks vary depending on the country where the project is implemented, the nature of the project, and
the assets and services involved. Nonetheless, certain risks are common to many types of PPP project.
These are usually grouped into risk categories, which are often risks associated with a particular function
(such as construction, operations, or financing), or with a particular project phase (such as termination). Box
3.7: PPP Risk Categories.




     Box 3.7: PPP Risk Categories

     The following categories of risk are common to many PPPs:

     •	 Site—risks associated with the availability and quality of the project site, such as the cost and
        timing of acquiring the site, needed permits or assuring rights of way for a road, the effect of
        geological or other site conditions, and the cost of meeting environmental standards

     •	 Design, construction and commissioning—risk that construction takes longer or costs more
        than expected, or that the design or construction quality means the asset is not adequate to
        meet project requirements

     •	 Operation—risks to successful operations, including the risk of interruption in service or asset
        availability, the risk that any network interface does not work as expected, or that the cost of
        operating and maintaining the asset is different than was expected
148   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




           Demand, and other commercial risk—the risk that usage of the service is different than was
           expected, or that revenues are not collected as expected

           •	 Regulatory or political—risk of regulatory or political decisions or changes in the sector
              regulatory framework that adversely affect the project. For example, this could include failure
              to renew approvals appropriately, unjustifiably harsh regulatory decisions, or in the extreme,
              breach of contract or expropriation

           •	 Change in legal framework—the risk that a change in general law or regulation adversely
              affects the project, such as changes in general corporate taxation, or in rules governing
              currency convertibility, or repatriation of profits

           •	 Default—the risk that the private party to the PPP contract turns out not to be financially or
              technically capable to implement the project

           •	 Economic or financial—risk that changes in interest rates, exchange rates or inflation
              adversely affect the project outcomes

           •	 Force Majeure—uninsurable risk that external events beyond the control of the parties to
              the contract, such as natural disasters, war or civil disturbance, affect the project

           •	 Asset ownership—risks associated with ownership of the assets, including the risk that the
              technology becomes obsolete or that the value of the assets at the end of the contract is
              different than was expected.

           For more detail, see Yescombe’s chapter on risk evaluation and transfer [#295], and Delmon’s
           chapter on risk allocation [#58, Chapter 5], both of which start with descriptions of typical types
           of PPP risk.




      Many resources provide ‘standard’ risk lists and preferred risk allocations, in some cases for specific project
      types. Several examples are provided in Section 3.3.2: Allocating Risks. These standard lists can be useful
      resources when identifying project risks for a particular PPP. However, PPP projects often have unique
      features or circumstances—for example, the particular geological conditions on the route of a proposed
      road. This means that implementing agencies should make use of experienced advisors to help identify a
      comprehensive list of project risks.


      Assessing and prioritizing risks
      To focus effort when allocating risks, it is often also helpful to consider the importance of the different
      risks. Some risks will be much more significant than others: in terms of the likelihood of the risk occurring,
      the severity of its impact on project outcomes, or both. Risk c an be assessed either quantitatively, or
      qualitatively.

The Infrastructure Australia guidance note on calculating the PSC [#14, pages 84-109] provides detailed
guidance both on identifying risk, and using various quantitative techniques to evaluate risks. An ADB
handbook for risk analysis in project evaluation [#7, pages 9-28] also includes a chapter describing
quantitative techniques for assessing risk.

In practice, many implementing agencies take a more qualitative approach at this stage. Guidance on risk
management by the Victoria Managed Insurance Authority [#22, pages 79-83] provides helpful guidance
on a risk ‘heat map’—a qualitative risk assessment approach, in which risks are categorized according to
their likelihood of occurrence, and impact. Farquharson et al [#95, Appendix B] provides an example ‘risk
register’ for a PPP project, which also takes a qualitative approach. Each risk is categorized as being low,
medium, or high for both ‘risk status’ (likelihood) and ‘impact’. Most effort should be directed to managing
those risks identified as being both high likelihood, and high impact.


3.3.2 Allocating Risks
Allocating risk, in the context of a PPP, means deciding which party to the PPP contract will bear the cost (or
reap the benefit) of a change in project outcomes arising from each risk factor. Allocating project risk well
is one of the main ways that PPPs can achieve better value for money. Iossa et al [#159, page 20] describe
two main goals of risk allocation. The first is to create incentives for the parties to manage risk well—and
thereby improve project benefits or reduce costs. The second is to reduce the overall cost of project risk
by ‘insuring’ parties against risks they are not happy to bear. Box 3.8: Allocating Land Acquisition Risk—
commonly a significant risk for PPP projects.




     Box 3.8: Allocating Land Acquisition Risk

     Land acquisition can be one of the most challenging aspects of developing a PPP project—
     delays in obtaining land have created significant hurdles or even blocked some promising PPP
     projects. There are many options for dealing with this risk associated with land acquisition delays
     or difficulties. Some governments adopted a policy of freeing land before launching a project to
     the market, thereby accepting and taking this risk out of the contractual equation—such as for
     transport projects in India. Others allocate to the private party the responsibility for identifying
     the plots of land that will be needed for the project, and for undertaking the necessary processes
     to acquire that land. Still others prepare carefully the land acquisition process, detailing the need
     for land and the identification of owners, but then transfer to the private partner the responsibility
     for actually obtaining the land. The best option may depend on circumstances—not least the
     prevailing legislation regarding compulsory acquisition of land.

     India’s Toolkit for Highways, in its Module 3: Tools and Resources, presents several good and
     bad examples of how to handle land acquisition. Jonathan Lindsay’s paper [#176] discusses
     compulsory land acquisition in detail.

      Risk allocation principles
      A central principle of risk allocation is that each risk should be allocated to whoever can manage it best.
      Irwin’s book on guarantees and PPP risk [#161, pages 56-62] defines this principle more precisely, stating
      each risk should be allocated to the party:

      •	 Best able to control the likelihood of the risk occurring—for example, the private party is usually in
         charge of project construction, because they have the most expertise in that area. This also means they
         should bear the cost of construction cost over-runs or delays

      •	 Best able to control the impact of the risk on project outcomes, by assessing and anticipating a risk
         well and responding to it. For example, while no party can control the risk of an earthquake, if the
         private firm is responsible for project design, it could use techniques to reduce the damage should an
         earthquake occur

      •	 Able to absorb the risk at lowest cost, if the likelihood and impact of risks cannot be controlled. A party’s
         cost of absorbing a risk depends on several factors, including: the extent to which the risk is correlated
         with its other assets and liabilities; its ability to pass the risk on (for example, to users of the service
         through price changes, or to third parties by insuring); and the nature of its ultimate risk bearers. For
         example, the ability of governments to spread risk among taxpayers means they may have lower risk-
         bearing cost than private firms, whose ultimate risk-bearers are their shareholders.

      As described in the OECD’s publication on risk sharing and value for money in PPPs [#194, pages 49-
      50], applying these principles does not imply transferring the maximum possible risk to the private sector.
      Transferring to the private party the risks that it is better able to control or mitigate can help lower the
      overall project cost, and improve value for money. However, the more total risk transferred to the private
      party, the higher the return—or risk premium—the equity investors will require, and the harder it will be to
      raise debt finance.

      The principles and practice of risk allocation in PPPs is also increasingly the subject of academic research
      and literature. For example, Ng and Loosemore’s article on risk allocation in PPPs [#190] describes PPP
      risk categories and allocation approach, and provides a case study of risk allocation in the New Southern
      Railway project (an underground airport--city rail link) in New South Wales, Australia. Bing et al’s article on
      risk allocation in PPP/PFI projects in the United Kingdom [#31] assesses how risks have been allocated
      in PFI projects in practice, to identify risk allocation preferences. An IDB review of the Spanish PPP
      experience [#28] includes several examples of risk allocation used in different types of projects, from roads
      to hospitals.


      Limitations on risk allocation
      There are some limits to how risks can be allocated in a PPP project. These include the following:

      •	 Level of detail of risk allocation—in theory, every project risk could be identified, and allocated to
         the party best able to bear it, thereby improving value for money. In practice, as Irwin describes [#161,
                                                                MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                      151




    pages 63-65] the cost of doing so would be high, and likely outweigh the benefits in the case of less
    significant risks. In most cases, risks are allocated in groups, sometimes with exceptions for certain
    significant risks. For example, the private party may bear all construction risks, except certain key
    geological risks, against which the government could provide a particular indemnity

•	 Risks that cannot be transferred—certain types of risk cannot be transferred through the PPP
   contract. For example, the private party will always bear certain political risks—in particular, the risk
   that the government will renege on the contract or expropriate the assets. International institutions
   such as the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) provide political risk insurance to help
   mitigate this risk

•	 Extent of risk transfer to private party—the equity holders of the private party to the PPP contract—
   the PPP company—are only exposed up to the value of their equity stake. Moreover, lenders will
   typically only accept a relatively low level of risk, concomitant with their expected returns. In practice,
   this means that the extent to which risk can be transferred is limited by the level of equity in the project
   company, as described by Ehrhardt and Irwin [#72]. If losses due to a risk turn out to be greater than
   the equity stake, the equity holders can walk away from the project. Since the government is ultimately
   responsible for making sure services are provided, the remainder of the project risk remains with the
   government—as described by Iossa et al [#159, page 25].

A combination of these limitations can mean that country characteristics affect the possibilities of risk
transfer. Ke et al’s study of risk allocation [#168] demonstrates this, in their comparison of risk allocation
for projects in China, Greece, and the United Kingdom.


Risk allocation matrices
The output of the risk allocation process at this stage is often a risk allocation matrix. The risk allocation matrix
lists risks—often sorted by category—and defines who bears each risk. This risk allocation is then put into
practice by including the appropriate clauses in the PPP contract as described in Section 3.4: Designing PPP
Contracts. Farquharson et al [#95, Appendix B] provides an example ‘risk register’ (or matrix) for a PPP project.

Some governments capture the risk allocation principles described above in ‘preferred risk allocations’,
often presented in the form of a preferred risk allocation matrix. These preferred allocations may be generic,
or specific to sectors or types of project. They are usually a starting point for allocating risk on a particular
project, since projects often have particular characteristics that may mean a different risk allocation would
provide better value for money. Risk allocation matrixes should be checked again prior to signing the
contract to review the responsibilities of each party before it is legally binding. This final review could also
serve as an additional gate-keeping mechanism.

The following are examples of preferred risk allocations and risk allocation matrices:

•	 Infrastructure Australia has produced ‘standard commercial principles’ for both economic and social
   infrastructure projects [#15], which describe in detail how risks and responsibilities will be allocated
152   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      •	 Hong Kong’s Introductory Guide to PPPs [#131, Annex E] provides a detailed example of a risk matrix
         for PPP of a water treatment plant

      •	 The Government of Rio de Janeiro’s PPP Manual [#35, Annex 2] provides an example of a risk matrix
         for a PPP infrastructure project

      •	 South Africa’s PPP Manual, Module 4: PPP Feasibility Study [#219, Annex 4] includes a standardized PPP
         risk matrix—listing risks, and describing for each risk a typical risk mitigation mechanism and allocation.


      3.3.3 Translating Risk Allocation into Contract Structure
      Much of the PPP literature focuses on risk allocation. Some of it can give the impression that, once a preferred
      risk allocation has been settled, this can somehow translate smoothly into a detailed contract. Such an
      impression may be misleading, since many experienced PPP practitioners will go through an intermediate
      step in which they define other elements of the contract structure such as: “who will do what?”, and “how
      will the payments flow?” Unfortunately, relatively few resources describe how the risk allocation translates
      into an overall contract structure.

      The World Bank’s toolkit for PPP in water services [#273, pages 97-124] is an exception, and explicitly
      sets out a process of allocating responsibilities and risks together—since each responsibility is typically
      associated with a bundle of risks. For example, the private party may be responsible for revenue collection,
      which carries the risk that some customers will not pay. The private party may be responsible for construction,
      which entails a series of risks. Labor costs, the timing of equipment delivery, and the cost and time to obtain
      permits can affect total costs and construction times, positively or negatively.

      The toolkit therefore sets out an approach to contract structuring, starting with identifying the major areas of
      responsibility, or functions: design and construction of new assets, finance, operations, and maintenance (for
      more on these functions see Section 1.1: What is a PPP: Defining ‘Public-Private Partnership’). For each function,
      specific responsibilities can then be defined, and risks identified that are associated with each responsibility.

      The toolkit also describes the close linkage between defining the details of the payment mechanism—
      in this case, tariff review mechanisms since the toolkit focuses on user pays project—and risk allocation.
      Section 3.4.2: Payment Mechanism goes into more detail.

      Generalizing from this approach suggests that it may be helpful to think of arriving at a ‘PPP type’ (see
      Section 1.1: What is a PPP: Defining ‘Public-Private Partnership’) from considering whether the public or
      private party is better able to carry out each of the key ‘functions’ (Design, Build, Operate, Maintain, and
      Finance). This allocation of functions may be based on an analysis of which party is best able to bear the
      risks naturally associated with each function. Consideration of institutional linkages and political constraints
      will also factor into the decision on which party can perform which function.

      Once a basic PPP type is chosen, the remainder of the risk allocation can be thought of as a gloss on the
      basic function allocation. For example, if the private party is to be responsible for the ‘Build’ function, but
      the public party is to retain geotechnical risk, this would be included in the contract design as an exception
                                                                            MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                              153




to the basic functional principle that all construction-related risks are for the private party to manage and
absorb.

Beside allocation of functions, another key element in contract structure is how the payments flow. Payment
mechanisms may follow from the allocation of functions and risks. For example, if the private party is better
able to manage collection risks and demand risks, then the private party will likely be remunerated directly
from user charges. However, if the private party is able to manage collection risk but is not asked to take
demand risk, then the payment structure may involve the private party collecting user charges and remitting
them to the public authority, while the public authority then pays the private party for asset availability, with
a bonus for achieving high levels of collections.

Finally, a necessary complement to defining the payment mechanism is defining how performance will be
measured, monitored, and enforced. For example, the government’s payment may be conditional on the
availability of the asset, with a view to transferring most operating risk to the private sector. This risk transfer
can only be achieved in practice if the standards required as part of ‘available’ are clear and practicable.
Section 3.4.1: Performance Requirements provides more details.

The following resources provide further guidance on the linkages between responsibilities, risks, rights, and
payment mechanisms, which can inform development of the contract structure:

•	 Irwin [#161, page 61] briefly describes how responsibilities, rights, and risks should be allocated
   together. This follows from the principle of risk allocation that a risk is allocated to the party best able
   to manage it: the rationale only holds if the party is also given the right and responsibility to make
   decisions related to that risk

•	 Iossa et al [#159, pages 26-31] also describes how different PPP contract types—with different functions
   allocated to the private party and different payment mechanisms—typically correspond to different risk
   allocations. The authors also describe [pages 33-34] how output specifications, payment mechanisms,
   and risk allocations need to be closely aligned

•	 India’s online PPP Toolkit [#143] Module 1: PPP Background has a section on ‘PPP model variants’,
   which describes typical risk allocations under different PPP Contract types, thus giving a guide to how
   risk allocation can translate into choice of basic contract structure.

3.4 Designing PPP Contracts
The PPP Contract is at the center of the partnership, defining the relationship between the parties, their
respective rights and responsibilities, allocating risk, and providing mechanisms for dealing with change. In
practice, the ‘PPP Contract’ can encompass several documents and agreements, as described in Box 3.9:
What is the ‘PPP Contract’’.




      Box 3.9: What is the ‘PPP Contract’

      This section uses the ‘PPP contract’ to mean the contractual documents that govern the relationship
      between the public and private parties to a PPP. In practice, the ‘PPP contract’ may comprise more
      than one document. For example, a PPP to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain a new
      power plant, with power supplied in bulk to a government-owned transmission company, may
      be governed by a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between the transmission company and the
      PPP company, as well as an Implementation Agreement between the responsible government
      ministry and the PPP company. Each agreement may in turn refer to schedules or annexes to set
      out particular details—for example, detailed performance requirements and measures.

      In addition to the PPP contract, there will also be numerous contracts between the private parties
      to the PPP. Chief among them would be contracts between the project company and its EPC
      contractor, financing agreements between the project company and its lenders, and shareholders
      agreements between equity investors. (See Section 1.4: How PPPs Are Financed for more on the
      PPP contractual structure). The PPP contract may not be effective until these other contractual
      agreements are in place. The EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83, page 23] lists topics that should be
      covered in a typical PPP contract—the standardized contracts below provide further examples.
      The PPIAF Toolkit for PPP in Highways [#282] section on contracts describes the range of
      contractual agreements typically involved for different types of PPP.

                                          As shown in Figure 3.5: PPP Contract Design Stage, the draft PPP contract is generally needed before
                                          a Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued. Detailed contract design takes significant time and resources—
                                          including from expert advisors. Approval is often required before embarking on detailed design and
                                          investing these resources.

                                          The draft PPP contract is typically included with the Request for Proposals (RFP) sent to prospective bidders.
                                          In some cases, the PPP contract issued with the RFP cannot be changed. In others, it may be changed as
                                          a result of interaction with bidders during the transaction process. Australia National PPP Guidelines

                                          Aim of PPP contract design
                                          A well-designed contract is clear, comprehensive, and creates certainty for the contracting parties. Because
                                          PPPs are long-term, risky, and complex, PPP contracts are necessarily incomplete—that is, they cannot
                                          fully specify what is to be done in all future states of the world. This means the PPP contract needs to have
                                          flexibility built in, to enable changing circumstances to be dealt with as far as possible within the contract,
                                          rather than resulting in re-negotiation or termination.

                                          The aim of PPP contract design is therefore to create certainty where possible, and bounded flexibility
                                          where needed—thereby retaining clarity and limiting uncertainty for both parties. This is typically done by
                                                              MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                     157




creating a clear process and boundaries for change. To implement this style of contract in practice requires
strong contract management institutions, as described in Section 3.7: Managing PPP Contracts. Where
possible, involving the future contract manager in designing or reviewing the PPP contract can help ensure
that change management processes are implementable in practice.


Content of this section
PPP contract design is a complex task. This section briefly sets out some key considerations—and provides
links to tools, examples, and further resources—in five areas of PPP contract design:

•	 Performance requirements—defining the required quality and quantity of assets and services, along
   with monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, including penalties

•	 Payment mechanisms—defining how the private party will be paid, through user charges, government
   payments based on usage or availability, or a combination, and how bonuses and penalties can be built in

•	 Adjustment mechanisms—building in to the contract mechanisms for handling changes, such as
   extraordinary reviews of tariffs, or changing service requirements

•	 Dispute resolution procedures—defining institutional mechanisms for how contractual disputes will
   be resolved, such as the role of the regulator and courts, or the use of expert panels or international
   arbitration

•	 Termination provisions—defining the contract term, handover provisions, and circumstances and
   implications of early termination.

Together, these sets of provisions define the risk allocation under the contract. Obviously the aim must be
to draft these provisions so that the risk allocation chosen (as set out in Section 3.3: Structuring PPP Projects)
is achieved. The provisions dealing with adjustment mechanisms and dispute resolution are intended to
avoid the need for renegotiation, by allowing changes to be made, and problems resolved, within the
framework provided by the contract.

Many countries standardize elements of PPP contract design. This helps reduce the cost of developing the
contract for each PPP contract. Some develop model contracts or contract clauses—Table 3.1: Examples
of Standardized PPP Contracts and Contract Clauses provides some examples. Others incorporate some
elements in overall legislation to govern all PPP contracts, as described in 2.2: PPP Legal Framework. For
example, in Chile the dispute resolution mechanism is established in the Concessions Law.

      3.4.1 Performance Requirements
      The contract needs to clearly specify what is expected from the private party, in terms of the quality and
      quantity of the assets and services to be provided. For example, this could include defining required
      maintenance standards for a road, or defining the required service quality and connection expansion targets
      for utility services provided directly to users. Performance indicators and targets are typically specified in an
      annex to the main PPP agreement.

      A key feature of a PPP is that performance is specified in terms of required outputs (such as road surface
      quality), rather than inputs (such as road surfacing materials and design) wherever possible. This enables the
      private PPP company to be innovative in responding to requirements, as described in Farquharson et al
      [#95, page 34]. For more guidance and examples on the differences between output and input specification,
      see Hong Kong’s guidance on managing outsourcing contracts [#130, pages 32-33], and Guidance on
      output specifications from the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence [#249], which also sets out a
      process for developing the specification for a PPP project.
                                                            MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                   159




Specifying outputs rather than inputs also helps keep competition as open as possible. For example, the
World Bank’s sourcebook on governance in the electricity sector describes a power sector procurement,
in which a particular technology was specified in the request for proposals, with the intent of limiting
competition, and facilitating corruption.

The PPP contract should set out the following:

•	 Clear performance targets or output requirements. Farquharson et al [#95, pages 34-36] note
   performance targets should be ‘SMART—that is, Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and
   Timely—and provides an example of SMART targets for a government accommodation PPP

•	 How performance will be monitored—that is, the information that must be gathered, by whom, and
   reported to whom. This can include roles for the government’s contract management team, the private
   party, external monitors, regulators, and users (see Section 3.7: Managing PPP Contracts)

•	 The consequences for failure to reach the required performance targets, clearly specified and
   enforceable. This could include:

    -	 Specifying penalty payments, liquidated damages or performance bonds. Iossa et al [#159, pages
       47-49] describe the pros and cons of these kinds of enforcement mechanism. The United Kingdom’s
       standardized PPP contracts also include a chapter on protection against late service commencement
       [#234, chapter 4], describing when and how liquidated damages or performance bonds may be used

    -	 Specifying payment deductions for poor performance (or bonuses), built into the payment
       mechanism (see Section 3.4.2: Payment Mechanism)

    -	   Following a formal performance warning system, and how persistent unsatisfactory performance can
         escalate into eventual termination for default, as described in Section 3.4.5: Termination Provisions

•	 Step-in rights for the public party, to take control of the concession (typically temporarily) under
   certain well-defined circumstances. As described by Iossa et al [#159, pages 81-83], the intention is
   typically to enable step-in to deal with problems threatening service provision that the public party may
   be better able to deal with, such as urgent environmental, health, or safety issues.

The following resources provide more guidance and examples on these three elements of setting
performance requirements:

•	 Kerf et al’s Guide to Concessions [#169, pages 70-74] describes issues and provides examples of
   performance targets in the context of concession contracts for utilities

•	 4Ps paper on the United Kingdom’s PFI experience [#228, pages 7-10] presents lessons learned on
   specifying output requirements. These include the need for clarity to avoid differences in interpretation,
   leading to disagreement, and ensuring reporting requirements are adequate

•	 The South Africa PPP Manual Module 6 on ‘managing the PPP agreement’ [#219, Module 6, pages 25-
   26] briefly outlines how performance requirements, monitoring and enforcement mechanisms should
160   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




          be established; more detail is set out in South Africa’s Standardized PPP Provisions on ‘performance
          monitoring’ [#219, Standardized PPP Provisions, pages 121-133]

      •	 The Scottish Government has produced standard output-based performance requirements for PFI
         schools [#257], which also describe some key issues in defining performance requirements

      •	 The United States Department of Transportation’s Key Performance Indicators in Public-Private
         Partnerships [#268] reviews the indicators used in several countries and their efficiency.


      3.4.2 Payment Mechanism
      The payment mechanism defines how the private party to the PPP is remunerated. Adjustments to payments
      to reflect performance or risk factors are also important means for creating incentive and allocating risk in
      the PPP contract, as described in the EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83, page 24].

      Iossa et al [#159, pages 41-49] provides a helpful overview of payment mechanisms for PPPs. The basic
      elements of PPP payment mechanisms can include:

      •	 User charges—that is, payment collected by the private party directly from users of the service

      •	 Government payment—that is, payment by the government to the private party for services or assets
         provided. These payments could be:

          -	   Usage-based—for example, shadow tolls or output-based subsidies

          -	   Based on availability—that is, conditional on the availability of an asset or service to the specified
               quality

          -	   Upfront subsidies based on achieving certain milestones.

      •	 Bonuses and penalties, or fines—deductions on payments to the private party, or penalties or fines
         payable by the private party, due if certain specified outputs or standards are not reached; or conversely,
         bonus payments due to the private party if specified outputs are reached.

      A PPP payment mechanism could include some or all of these elements, which should be fully defined in
      the contract—including specifying the timing and mechanism for making the payments in practice. Key
      considerations in each case are described briefly in turn below, with references for further information.


      Defining user charges
      When a concession is paid by charging users, the approach to tariff setting and adjustment becomes an
      important risk allocation mechanism. In some PPPs, the private party may be free to set tariffs and the tariff
      structure. However, in many cases, user-pays PPPs are in sectors with monopoly characteristics, in which
      case tariffs are typically regulated by government (along with service standards), to protect users. The key
      question for risk allocation is how tariffs will be allowed to change—for example, with changes in inflation

or other economic variables, or changes in different types of cost.

Tariffs can be controlled by establishing tariff formulae in the PPP contract, or by regulation, or a combination
of the two. For example a tariff formula may be set that establishes initial tariff levels, and a formula by
which the tariff is allowed to regularly, automatically adjust in line with inflation. The contract may provide
for regular tariff formula reviews, at which point other factors could be considered—as described further in
Section 3.4.3: Adjustment Mechanisms.

Kerf et al Guide to Concessions [#169, Sections 3.3, and 3.4] provides a helpful overview on price setting,
and price adjustment for user-pays concessions contracts. The World Bank’s toolkit on water sector PPP
[#273, pages 108-118] also discusses tariff indexation and resets as a risk allocation mechanism for user-pays
PPPs.

For further information on tariff-setting and adjustment, there is a wide literature available on different
approaches to tariff-setting for infrastructure regulation. The World Bank’s Body of Knowledge on
Infrastructure Regulation, available online [#288], includes a module on price setting (that is, setting the
overall price level), and a module on tariff design (that is, how tariffs may vary for different customers or
circumstances). Both modules describe key issues and provide extensive links to further resources.


Defining government payments
Key considerations when defining government payments include the following:

•	 Risk allocation implications of different government payment mechanisms. For example, under
   a usage-based mechanism, demand risk is either borne by the private sector or shared; whereas
   an availability payment mechanism means the government bears downside demand risk. Providing
   an upfront capital subsidy means the private party bears much less risk than if the same subsidy is
   provided on an availability basis over the contract lifetime. Irwin’s paper on fiscal support decisions
   [#160] describes some of the trade-offs between different types of subsidies to infrastructure projects
   (alongside user payments), and how governments can decide which is appropriate

•	 Linkage to clear output specifications and performance standards—linking payments to well-
   specified performance requirements is key to achieve risk allocation in practice. See Section 3.4.1:
   Performance Requirements for more resources on specifying output and performance targets in the
   contract. The section below on defining bonuses and penalties provides more on how adjustments to
   payments should be specified

•	 Indexation of payment formulae—as for tariff specification, payments may be fully or partially indexed
   to certain risk factors, so the government bears or shares the risk.

The EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83, page 24] provides a helpful overview of how to define the payment
mechanism for government-pays PPPs. Yescombe [#295] provides more detailed description of the different
options and their implications for risk allocation and bankability. A note developed by the Scottish
Government [#258] describes experience with defining and implementing payment mechanisms in PPPs.
162   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      Defining bonuses and penalties
      Under both government- and user-pays PPPs, bonuses and penalties can be tied to particular outcomes.
      Under government-pays contracts, bonuses and penalties are typically implemented adjustments to regular
      payments. Governments may also provide bonuses or charge penalties under user-pays contracts.

      Iossa et al [#159, pages 46-47] provide an overview of performance-based payments. The Scottish
      Government note on designing payment mechanisms for PPPs [#258, pages 9-13] emphasizes the need
      to ‘calibrate’ the payment mechanism—that is, to check the financial impact of penalties under different
      possible combinations of under-performance. The model contracts in Table 3.1: Examples of Standardized
      PPP Contracts and Contract Clauses provide further examples of the use of bonuses or penalties. For
      example, the United Kingdom’s standardized PPP contracts include a chapter on payment mechanisms
      [#234, chapter 7], which also describes calibration of penalties and bonuses based on financial analysis.


      3.4.3 Adjustment Mechanisms
      PPP projects are long-term, and are often risky and complex. For example, a new toll highway faces obvious
      risks such as fluctuations in demand, but also less-obvious risks such as demand to provide more interchanges
      in the future, or install new traffic management technologies. More complex PPPs, such as water concession
      contracts, are even more exposed to unpredictable changes. Network assets may last more or less time
      than assumed. Demands for changes in treatment and distribution technologies may flow from new health
      research; while urban growth may create large investment demands, sometimes in unpredicted locations.

      This means PPP contracts are necessarily incomplete—that is, they cannot fully specify all future possibilities.
      The PPP contract therefore needs to have flexibility built in—to enable changing circumstances to be dealt
      with as far as possible within the contract, rather than resulting in re-negotiation or termination. Such
      adjustment mechanisms typically aim to create a clear process and boundaries for change.

      The concept of ‘financial equilibrium’, common in civil law systems, provides a broad mechanism for dealing
      with several different types of change, as described below. Other mechanisms are more specific—such
      as mechanisms for changes to service requirements, changes to tariff formulae, other cost adjustments in
      response to market changes, or dealing with refinancing gains, also described in turn below.

      As described in the EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83, pages 37-38], the administrative arrangements and
      processes for handling change are often further defined as part of the contract management framework and
      materials (see Section 3.7.1: Establishing Contract Management Structures). While rules and processes can
      be specified for changes, room for discretion is likely to remain. The contract therefore needs to define a
      process that gives both public and private parties confidence that their interests will be respected.


      Financial equilibrium clauses
      Civil law systems commonly espouse a concept of ‘financial equilibrium’ in contracting, which may be
      established in general administrative law, or defined in more detail in the PPP context in PPP-specific law
                                                             MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                     163




or a particular contract. Financial equilibrium provisions entitle an operator to changes in the key financial
terms of the contract to compensate for certain types of exogenous event that may otherwise impact
returns. Adjustments are based on a mutually agreed financial model that is maintained over the lifetime
of the contract. Three causes of unexpected changes that merit financial equilibrium are typically defined
as Force Majeure (major natural disasters or civil disturbances), factum principis (government action) and
ius variandi (unforeseen changes in economic conditions). The PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center
Website [#286] provides more information and references on financial equilibrium clauses in its section on
‘Key Features of Common Law or Civil Law Systems’.


Changes to service requirements
It may be difficult for the contracting authority to accurately anticipate service requirements over the duration
of the contract. Contracts typically build in approaches for handling changes to service requirements, in
response to changing circumstances (which could also include changing technology). For example the
Hong Kong PPP Guide [#131, pages 68-71] describes how changes in circumstance can be dealt with. The
South Africa standardized contract provisions [#219, Part K:50] provide for four categories of variation:
variations with no additional cost; small works variations; ‘institutional’ variations (changes in service
requirements); and variations requested by the private party.


Changes to tariff or payment rules or formulae
Tariffs or payments are often specified by formulae, as described in Section 3.4.3: Adjustment Mechanisms,
to allow regular adjustments for factors such as inflation. The PPP contract could also build in mechanisms
for reviewing these formulae—whether periodic, or one-off changes in extraordinary circumstances (with
specified triggers). Since these processes are analogous to regulatory tariff reviews, regulatory guidance
material may be useful. The World Bank’s body of knowledge on infrastructure regulation [#288] section
on price level regulation describes key issues in tariff regulation, and guides readers in accessing a wide
range of references.


Market testing and benchmarking operating costs
Some PPP contracts require periodic ‘market testing’ or benchmarking of certain sub-services in the contract,
to allow costs to be adjusted to market conditions. This is typically done where a PPP includes provision of
a long-lived asset (such as a school or hospital facility) together with ‘soft’ services where market contracts
are typically of shorter duration (such as cleaning). This approach is most common in PPP contracts in the
United Kingdom Private Finance Initiative (PFI) tradition. One objective is that the price charged for the
soft services should be kept in line with market conditions, through periodic challenges or benchmarking
exercises. The other reason for market testing ‘soft’ services is that service providers would normally be
reluctant to provide a fixed price (with simple inflation indexation) for such services over a long period of
time, because the actual costs are likely to get out of line with the indexation.

A United Kingdom Operational Taskforce note provides detailed guidance on benchmarking and market
164   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      testing approaches [#232]. The United Kingdom’s Department of Health has also produced a code of
      best practice on benchmarking and market testing in hospital PFIs [#252]. This code provides guidance on
      how to manage the market testing process, focused on health facilities contracts—see also [#254].


      Refinancing
      During implementation, changes to the project risk profile or in capital markets may mean the PPP company
      can replace or renegotiate its original debt on more favorable terms. As described in Section 1.4: How PPPs
      Are Financed, many PPP contracts set out rules for determining and sharing the gains from refinancing. For
      example, in 2004 the United Kingdom’s Treasury introduced into its standard PFI contracts a 50:50 split of
      any refinancing gain between the investors and the government. The EPEC Guide to Guidance on PPPs
      [#83, page 35] also provides a succinct summary of how refinancing can be treated in the PPP contract


      3.4.4 Dispute Resolution Mechanisms
      Because PPP arrangements are long-term and complex, contracts tend to be incomplete, as described in
      Section 3.4.3: Adjustment Mechanisms. Where this creates room for differences in interpretation, disputes
      can arise. Defining a dispute resolution process helps ensure disputes are resolved quickly and efficiently,
      without interruption of service—reducing the risk of disruption due to disputes to both the public and
      private parties. Dispute resolution mechanisms can be built into the PPP contract. Some governments
      define dispute resolution mechanisms in PPP legislation, to apply to all PPP contracts.

      As described by Kerf et al [#169, Section 3.10] dispute resolution mechanisms for PPP can include the
      following:

      •	 Mediation—a third part gets involved to help resolve a dispute by recommending how the parties can
         settle their disagreements. Mediation is used in the hope of not having to enter formal arbitration.

      •	 Recourse to a sector regulator—for PPPs in sectors under the remit of an independent regulatory
         body, this regulator can be assigned responsibility for resolving certain disputes. This is a relatively
         simple and hence low-cost option, but can be risky for the private party, particular in case of concerns
         over regulator independence or capacity

      •	 Judicial system—generally, contractual disputes are subject to jurisdiction of the courts, and the
         same is typically true of PPP contracts. However, parties to PPPs often consider the court system as
         inappropriate for solving disputes, since it may be slow, or lack technical expertise—particularly in
         developing countries. Dispute resolution mechanisms for PPPs often try to avoid resorting to the court
         system as far as possible

      •	 Panel of experts as arbitrators—the PPP contract or law could designate a panel of independent
         experts, to act as arbitrators in case of dispute. Decisions could be defined as non-binding (in which
         case a further escalation mechanism is required), or binding

      •	 International arbitration—the last resort for many PPPs is international arbitration, which can be
                                                           MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                  165




    under a permanent arbitration institution such as the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
    Disputes (see Box 3.10: International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or involve
    ad-hoc arrangements such as an international expert panel.

More than one of these approaches may be used, to allow for escalation of disputes should simpler methods
fail. For example:

•	 Chile concessions. The dispute resolution mechanism for PPP contracts in Chile was established in the
   Concessions Law, and centers on the role of an independent panel of experts, as set out in Jadresic’s
   review of Chile’s experience with expert panels [#165, pages 25-26]. A conciliation panel of experts
   is established for each contract, comprising three experts—one chosen by the government, one by the
   private party, and a third by mutual agreement. The conciliation panel may be called on to propose
   conciliatory terms to resolve disputes, for agreement by the parties. If agreement cannot be reached,
   the private party can either request the conciliation panel become an arbitration panel (and reach a
   binding decision), or refer to the court system

•	 Bucharest Water Service Concession. The dispute resolution mechanism is defined in the PPP
   Contract. It involves an economic regulator, a technical regulator housed in the municipal government,
   with recourse to an international panel of experts in case of appeal

•	 In Mexico the Federal Law on Acquisitions, Leases and Services [#184] sets out the procedures for
   conflict resolution during the implementation of the PPP contract. The Secretaría de la Función Pública
   is the organization in charge of handling these processes. The law states that interested party must
   request for dispute resolution support from the Secretary. The Secretary facilitates a dispute resolution
   meeting. Any agreements reached through this procedure will be binding, and the parties involved
   must produce a report showing the progress made in implementing the agreement reached

•	 In Uruguay, the Law on PPP Contracts [#269] prescribes that the parties must agree on an ad-hoc
   arbitration panel to solve any disputes.

The standardized contracts listed in Table 3.1: Examples of Standardized PPP Contracts and Contract
Clauses provide further examples of dispute resolution clauses and options.




     Box 3.10: International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)

     ICSID, part of the World Bank Group, is an autonomous international institution established
     under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
     Other States (known as the ICSID or the Washington Convention, entered into force in 1966) with
     over one hundred and forty member States. The primary purpose of ICSID is to provide facilities
     for conciliation and arbitration of international investment disputes.
166   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




           The ICSID Convention sought to remove major impediments to the free international flows of
           private investment posed by non-commercial risks and the absence of specialized international
           methods for investment dispute settlement. ICSID was created by the Convention as an impartial
           international forum providing facilities for resolving legal disputes between eligible parties,
           through conciliation or arbitration procedures. Recourse to the ICSID facilities is always subject
           to the parties’ consent. The ICSID maintains a Panel of Arbitrators and a Panel of Conciliators
           (mediators).

           The ICSID website, https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/Index.jsp provides more information and
           examples of international dispute settlements—including cases in roads, railways, ports, airports,
           energy, waste, water, wastewater, and other sectors. Many award reports are available in the
           website, in English and French. The website also provides a set of model clauses regarding
           conciliation and arbitration—in English, French, and Spanish.




      3.4.5 Termination Provisions
      In most cases, PPP contracts have a defined term. The contract typically sets out the contract termination
      date, as well as arrangements for contract close and asset handover. The PPP contract, or in some cases
      the relevant PPP Law, should also specify circumstances in which the contract may be terminated early, and
      consequences of termination in each case.


      Contract term and asset handover
      The PPP contract typically defines the contract term, and arrangements for any hand back of project assets
      to the government. The most common approach is for the government to choose the contract term, in the
      draft contract, as the best estimate of the time needed for the private party to achieve its required return,
      at reasonable tariffs or payment levels. A second option, with a similar result, is to define tariffs or annual
      payments, and enable the contract length be determined by bidders as one of the key bid variables. This
      approach was used, for example, in Mexico’s toll road program, where concessions were awarded to the
      bidder offering the shortest term [#98].

      A third alternative is to let the length of the concession be determined endogenously, as described by Kerf
      et al [#169, page 83], by inviting bids on the basis of the least present value of revenue (LPVR). This means
      the concession terminates when that value is reached—the higher the traffic, the sooner the concession
      terminates. This approach was set out by Engel, Fischer and Galetovic [#73] as a way to manage the risk
      of fixed-term concessions, and has been used for toll roads in Chile and Colombia.

      Kerf et al [#169, pages 81-82] and Iossa et al [#159, pages 73-78] both describe the trade-off between a shorter
      concession term—enabling the government to go back to the market to re-tender the concession—against
      the disincentive this can create for concessionaires to invest, particularly towards the end of the concession.
                                                           MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                   167




Given this disincentive, PPP contracts need to clearly define the approach to transition of assets and
operations at the end of the contract. This typically includes defining how quality of the assets will be
defined and assessed, whether a payment will be made on asset handover, and how the amount of any
payment will be determined. It can be particularly challenging to define handover standards at the start of
a long-term contract. The following resources describe some possible approaches:

•	 The World Bank’s toolkit for PPPs in Roads and Highways [#282, Module 5, Stage 5] section on hand
   back of facilities at contract end describes how asset standards at hand back can be defined in terms of
   the remaining useful life of different parts of the asset

•	 Australia’s standard commercial principles [#15, pages 120-124] specify use of an independent
   assessor, appointed near the end of the contract term, to assess the quality of the assets, and define
   the required ‘handover condition’

•	 The United Kingdom’s standard PFI contract [#234] requires inspection around 2 years before the
   end of the contract, on the basis of which any work required to bring the facility up to the required
   standard is specified. Fee payments may be withheld by the contracting authority and released only
   when the required work is carried out

•	 EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83, page 42] describes how bonds or guarantees can be used to ensure
   asset quality at handover.


Provisions for early termination
The PPP contract needs to set out the conditions under which the contract may be terminated early, in
which case the ownership of the project assets typically reverts to the public sector. This includes who may
terminate and for what reason, and what if any compensation payment will be made in each case.

There are three broad possible reasons for early termination: default by the private party, termination by
the public party, whether due to default or for reasons of public interest, and early termination due to some
external reason (force majeure). In each case, the government typically makes a payment to the private
party, and takes over control of the project assets (which may be re-tendered under a new PPP contract).
Contractually-defined termination payments typically depend on the reason for termination, as summarized
in Table 3.2: Types of Early Termination and Termination Payments.

Some of these approaches to defining the termination payment—particularly when linked to the value of
the project assets—require careful definition.

The following resources provide more guidance on termination causes, arrangements, and payments:

•	 EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83, pages 40-42] describes each of these causes of termination and the
   options for defining termination payments in each case

•	 A more detailed EPEC publication on termination provisions [#86] provides a review of current
   European practice and guidance on termination and force majeure provisions in PPP contracts
168   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      •	 Yescombe [#295] also describes termination causes and options for termination payments, in greater
         detail

      •	 Ehrhardt and Irwin [#72, pages 46-49] note that many PPP termination clauses protect lenders from
         any losses (that is, do not allow the PPP company to go bankrupt)—they describe why this can cause
         problems, and how bankruptcy could be a realistic option

      •	 Clement-Davies on PPPs in Central and Eastern Europe [#48, page 46] provides more information
         on lenders’ step-in rights.

      The standardized contracts listed in Table 3.1: Examples of Standardized PPP Contracts and Contract
      Clauses also provide further examples of termination clauses in practice.

      Notwithstanding careful provisions in the contract, early termination is typically costly for both parties, and is
      a last resort when other avenues have been exhausted. As described in the EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83,
      page 40], this means the contractually-defined termination payments are important even if termination does
      not happen, since it defines the ‘fallback’ position of each party in any dispute resolution or renegotiation.

      Early termination payments are usually tailored in such a way that debt providers always have an interest in
      keeping the contract alive and services operational, thereby inducing them to ‘step-in’ before issues of poor
      performance lead to default by the private party.

                    3.5 Managing PPP Transactions
                    In the transaction stage, the government selects the private party that will implement the PPP. This stage
                    follows the structuring, appraisal, and detailed preparation of the PPP described in the previous sections of
                    this Module. It concludes when the PPP reaches financial close—that is, when the government has selected
                    and signed a contract with a private party, and the private party has secured the necessary financing and
                    can start deploying it in the project.

                    The aim of the PPP transaction stage is twofold. The first is to select a competent firm or consortium. The
                    second is to identify the most effective and efficient solution to the proposed project’s objectives—both
                    from a technical, and value for money perspective. To the latter end the process typically establishes some
                    of the key quantitative parameters of the contract: the amounts government will pay, or the fees users will
                    pay for the assets and services provided. Achieving these objectives generally requires a competitive,
                    efficient, and transparent procurement process, as set out for example in the PPIAF Toolkit for PPPs in
                    Roads and Highways Procurement section [#282] under ‘competitive bidding’, and by Farquharson et al
                    [#95, page 112] in describing the outcome of the procurement phase.

                    Since most governments use a competitive selection process to procure PPP contracts, as the best way
                    to achieve transparency and value for money, this section assumes a competitive process is followed. In
                    practice, there may be a few circumstances where direct negotiation could be a good option. However, many
                    reasons put forward to negotiate directly are spurious, as described in Box 3.11: Competitive Procurement
                    or Direct Negotiation.
172   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




          Box 3.11: Competitive Procurement or Direct Negotiation

          A competitive selection process is typically recommended to procure PPP contracts. Key
          advantages are transparency, and use of competition to choose the best proposal—the
          mechanism most likely to result in value for money. The alternative to a competitive process is to
          negotiate directly with a private firm.

          There can be good reasons to negotiate directly, but these are relatively few—see for example
          Kerf et al’s guide to concessions [#169, pages 109-110] or World Bank water sector PPP
          toolkit [#273, page 170] sections on direct negotiation. These good reasons can include:




          •	 Small projects, where the costs of a competitive process would be prohibitively high given
             the level of expected returns

          •	 Cases where there is good reason to believe there would be no competitive interest—for
             example, extensions of an asset for which a contract is already in place

          •	 Need for rapid procurement in the case of emergencies and natural disasters, where speed
             may outweigh value for money considerations

          On the other hand, several reasons commonly put forward to negotiate directly with a private
          proponent of a PPP can be misleading—see for example PPIAF’s toolkit for PPPs in Roads
          and Highways [#282] Module 5 Procurement section on ‘overall principles for procurement’. For
          example, some argue negotiation is faster—although ultimately, challenges in and to the process
          can often mean it ends up taking longer. Direct negotiation is also often considered when a
          PPP idea has originated as an unsolicited proposal from a private company—but there are also
          ways to introduce competition in this case that help ensure value for money from the resulting
          project, described in Section 3.5: Managing PPP Transactions. Based on these considerations,
          some countries do not allow non-competitive procurement processes at all (such as Brazil, under
          the Federal PPP Law of 2004 [#34]). Elsewhere, direct negotiation may be allowed in particular
          circumstances. For example, Puerto Rico’s PPP Act also allows for direct negotiations if
          investment value is under US$5 million, there is lack of interest after issuing an RFP, the normal
          procurement process is burdensome, unreasonable, or impractical, or the technology required is
          only available from a single company [#210, Article 9.(b).ii]

The transaction stage typically includes the following five steps, as shown in Figure 3.7: Transaction Steps:

•	 Deciding on a procurement strategy, including the process and criteria for selecting the PPP contractor

•	 Marketing the upcoming PPP project, to interest prospective bidders (as well as potential lenders
   and sub-contractors)

•	 Identifying qualified bidders through a qualification process. This may be done as a separate step
   before requesting proposals, or may be part of the bidding process

•	 Managing the bid process, including preparing and issuing a Request for Proposal, interacting with
   bidders as they prepare proposals, and evaluating bids received to select a preferred bidder

•	 Executing the PPP contract and ensuring all conditions are met to reach contract effectiveness and
   financial close. This may require gaining final approval of the contract from government oversight agencies.

Sections 3.5.1: Deciding the Procurement Strategy to 3.5.5: Achieving Contract Effectiveness and Financial
Close describe each of these steps, and provide further resources and tools for practitioners interested in
managing PPP transactions.

The first step in managing a PPP transaction is defining the procurement strategy. This includes defining the
following key aspects of the procurement process:

•	 Pre-qualification—whether to use a pre-qualification process to select the firms or consortia that will
   participate in the bidding process
174   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      •	 Bid process—whether to use a single-stage process to select the preferred bidder, or a multi-stage
         process, in which proposals and the bidding documents may be reviewed and iterated

      •	 Negotiation with bidders—to what extent discussions with bidders may lead to changes in the initial
         draft contract: either during the bidding process (with multiple bidders), or after final bids have been
         submitted

      •	 Basis for award—whether to rank proposals and choose the preferred bidder based on a single
         financial or value-related criterion (after screening for technical merit), or some weighted evaluation of
         financial and technical criteria

      This section briefly describes each of these aspects, with links to guidance, resources and examples in each
      case. An additional point for consideration, also described in this Section, is dealing with bid costs—
      whether to charge a fee or require a bond to participate in the bid process; or conversely whether to
      provide support with bid costs.

      The overall goals of the procurement strategy, as described above, are both to find the best solution to the
      project’s objectives (from a technical and value for money perspective), and to select a competent firm or
      consortium to implement that solution. This typically requires a fair, competitive, transparent, and efficient
      procurement process. However, the best procurement strategy to achieve these objectives may depend
      on the context. For example, allowing dialogue with bidders can lead to stronger proposals, as described
      below. However, it can also make the process less transparent—so may not be the right choice in a country
      where achieving transparency and minimizing the risk of corruption is the more important consideration.
      This means the best procurement process may depend on the country context, and the nature and capacity
      of the government institutions involved, as well as on the characteristics of the particular project.

      There may also be some constraints in how the procurement strategy can be defined. Firstly, as described
      in Section 2.2: PPP Legal Framework, the procurement strategy for a PPP may be constrained by any laws or
      regulations on overall government procurement. Moreover, many governments choose to set PPP-specific
      procurement rules, in PPP laws, regulations or guidance material—that is, defining the procurement strategy
      for the PPP program as a whole, rather than on a project-by-project basis. Doing so can improve transparency
      of PPP procurements; although there are also advantages to retaining flexibility to adapt processes to the
      needs of particular projects. Table 3.3: Examples of PPP Procurement Procedures below provides examples
      of PPP procurement procedures as defined in national or international laws and regulations. Finally, where
      the project involves funding from a multilateral development bank or other agency, the procurement options
      may also be constrained by the procurement rules of the funding agency. For example, the World Bank
      publishes and regularly updates its Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, Works, and Non-Consulting
      Services [#283], which any project with World Bank funding must follow. The World Bank has not published
      specific guidelines for procurement of PPPs—Clause 3.14 of these guidelines states that for PPP projects,
      ‘open competitive bidding procedures determined acceptable by the Bank’ should be used.

      Qualifying bidders
      Most bidding processes set out ‘qualification criteria’ that all participating firms must meet. Requiring bidders
      to set out their qualifications helps ensure a competent firm is selected, with the capacity to implement the
      project. Clear qualification requirements can also encourage experienced firms to participate, and to invest
      in preparing quality proposals, as it reduces the risk that the bid process will be undermined by low-quality
      firms submitting very low bids.

      Most governments require bidders to ‘pre-qualify’—that is, check bidders’ qualifications before the start
      of the tender process, with a view to capping the number of bidders. Typically pre-qualification involves
      ranking potential bidders according to specified qualification criteria. The top-ranking bidders—typically
      between three and six—invited to submit proposals.

      The alternative is to set pass/fail qualification criteria, and qualify and invite proposals from all firms that pass.
      While this approach can be used in a pre-qualification process, it is more typically done simultaneously with
      the bidding process—sometimes called ‘post-qualification’. Under this approach, bidders can self-screen
      against the published qualification criteria before investing resources in preparing a proposal. For a few,
      large and very complex process the self-selection process (aided by the due-diligence that financing parties
      will exert upon prospective bidders) may be sufficiently stringent that no qualification is needed.

      Prequalification has both advantages and disadvantages:

      •	 The main advantage is in limiting the number of bidders. By reducing the number of bidders, the
         probability of success increases, and bidders may be incentivized to invest more effort in developing an
         efficient project and presenting a competitive bid. At the same time, the effort and resources required
         from government to evaluate bids can be reduced
                                                            MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                   177




•	 The main disadvantage is that making public the list of pre-qualified bidders may enable collusive
   behavior. Moreover, pre-qualifying a set number of bidders, in particular, can mean the same top-
   ranking firms tend to be invited to bid in a given sector, providing further temptation to collusion in the
   bidding process.

In some developing countries (particularly with new PPP programs) the problem can be too few rather than
too many bidders—in this case, there may be no advantage to pre-qualification, and it may unnecessarily
extend the procurement process.

The following resources provide more discussion and detail on the pros and cons of pre-qualification:

•	 PPIAF’s Toolkit for PPPs in Roads and Highways [#282], which includes a section on ‘Concessions:
   Main Steps in competitive bidding’

•	 A World Bank Technical Note on Procurement of Management Contracts [#278, pages 9-21]
   describes the pros and cons, and how some of the problems of pre-qualification can be overcome

•	 Farquharson et al [#95, pages 118-120] describes the pre-qualification process, some of its advantages
   and disadvantages, and the possible pitfalls. The authors also describe the option of a “pre-revision”
   phase, in countries where pre-qualification is not allowed by procurement law.

In practice, country approaches vary. For example, Infrastructure Australia Practitioner’s Guide [#16, page
16] recommends using pre-qualification to select a particular number of bidders—at least three, sometimes
more. On the other hand, Singapore PPP Handbook [#216, page 60] precludes pre-determining the
number of qualified bidders, because this would limit competition. Table 3.3: Examples of PPP Procurement
Procedures provides more examples of PPP procurement processes, including whether and what type of
pre-qualification process is included.


Bid process
The bid process is the process from issuing Requests for Proposals (RFPs) to selecting a preferred bidder.
The quickest and simplest is a single-stage bid process, in which bidders present both technical and
financial proposals, which are evaluated to select the preferred bidder.

The alternative is a two- or multi-stage bid process. Under this approach, bidders present an initial
proposal, which may include comments on the RFP and draft contract, and may or may not include a financial
bid. Based on these proposals, the government reviews and possibly revises the RFP and draft contract, and
requests revised proposals accordingly. The government may engage in discussion with bidders to varying
extent, as described below under ‘Negotiation with bidders: during bidding process’. The government
may also eliminate some bidders at this stage, and the revision process may be repeated more than once.
Bidders then submit final proposals, including a final financial bid.

A multi-stage process can have advantages over a single-stage process for complex projects, particularly
where there is room for innovation. It can help ensure solutions are aligned to needs, and improve final
178   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      quality of proposals. On the other hand, the multi-stage process is longer, more complex to manage and
      more expensive for all parties involved. Care needs to be taken to retain competitive pressure, protect
      intellectual property, and maintain transparency.

      The following resources provide more information on the bid process options:

      •	 Farquharson et al [#95, pages 113-114] summarizes the advantage of sequential screening over multiple
         stages—improving the quality of bids

      •	 A World Bank Technical Note on Procurement of Management Contracts [#278, pages 22-33],
         which describes different bidding processes and their relative advantages

      •	 PPIAF’s Toolkit for PPPs in Roads and Highways [#282] section on ‘Concessions: Main Steps in
         competitive bidding’ describes one- and two-stage bid processes.

      Many countries’ PPP frameworks leave open the decision of whether to use a single or multi-stage bidding
      process, depending on the nature of the project. Some also leave the option of asking for second bids
      open, as a means to resolve the problem of no clear bidder emerging from a single-stage process. For
      example, the South Africa PPP Manual procurement module [#219, Module 5, pages 51-52] states that
      a single-stage process with a clear winner is preferred, but that a ‘best and final offer’ may be requested
      from two or more bidders. Table 3.3: Examples of PPP Procurement Procedures provides further examples.


      Negotiation with bidders: during bidding process
      A major difference between procurement approaches in different countries is in the extent to which the
      government enters into negotiations with bidders. Negotiating at any stage can be challenging, and risks
      reducing the transparency of the bid process. For this reason, some governments do not allow negotiation
      on the contract at any stage of the process (although room for negotiation on bidders’ proposals may
      remain).

      In a multi-stage bidding process (see Section 3.5.4: Managing the Bid Process), the government may choose
      to dialogue or negotiate with multiple bidders in between bidding stages. This can help clarify aspects of
      the RFP, draft contract, and bidders’ initial proposals, and result in proposals that more closely meet the
      government’s requirements. In other cases, governments may enter into negotiation with a single bidder,
      after a preferred bidder has been selected.

      For example, in 2004 the European Commission introduced the ‘competitive dialogue’ procedure for
      procuring PPPs in the European Union. Under this process, having received initial bids, the government
      can enter into a dialogue with bidders on all aspects of the RFP, contract, or proposals, before re-issuing a
      final version of the RFP documents and inviting final bids. The United Kingdom Treasury’s guidance on
      the competitive dialogue procedure [#256] provides more details. In Australia, a similar process may be
      used, called an “interactive tender”. The Australian National PPP Practitioners’ Guide [#16, pages 70-71]
      describes the interactive tender process; protocols for the process are also provided in an appendix.
                                                             MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                    179




Kerf et al [#169, pages 110-112] provide further examples of competitive negotiations, and when it may be
useful. The World Bank’s water sector toolkit [#273, pages 169-170] also describes the advantages and
disadvantages of this approach. In general, competitive negotiation has been used less in less developed
countries.


Negotiation with bidders: post-bid
Once a preferred bidder has been identified, governments may then enter into post-bid negotiation—that
is, further dialogue with that bidder to finalize the PPP contract. If negotiating with a preferred bidder—
even if a reserve bidder is maintained as a fallback option—the implementing agency can no longer rely on
competitive tension to ensure value for money. For this reason, most governments limit the extent of post-
bid interaction to clarification and fine-tuning of proposals; some do not allow it at all, particularly where
transparency of the process is a primary concern. Table 3.3: Examples of PPP Procurement Procedures
provides some examples.

The need for post-bid negotiation typically arises for two reasons: because the RFP requirements or draft
contract were not clear, or because they were not acceptable to bidders and their lenders (in particular,
with respect to the proposed risk allocation). For either reason, bidders may incorporate changes in their
proposals, meaning the proposals no longer fully meet the government’s requirements. Some legal
frameworks mitigate this issue by mandating that conditional proposals will be excluded.

The following resources provide more guidance on the problems with post-bid negotiations, and whether
and to what extent to allow for negotiation or dialogue with a preferred bidder:

•	 EPEC’s Guide to Guidance [#83, page 31] briefly describes what matters should and should not be
   subject to negotiation post-bid, and the typical elements of a negotiation framework

•	 Yescombe [#295] also describes on the risks of post-bid negotiations, and why they typically arise

•	 Kerf et al’s Guide for Concessions [#169, page 123] focuses on the importance of limiting the extent
   of negotiation in the post-bid phase, and how this can be achieved.

The best way to avoid the need for post-bid negotiation is to prepare a clear and comprehensive RFP
and draft contract. Market sounding and pre-RFP consultation with bidders, as well as hiring experienced
advisors, can help ensure the contract structure is acceptable to investors. For particularly complex contracts,
the competitive negotiation procedure described above could be the best alternative.


Basis for Award
The government needs to evaluate the proposals received, to rank the proposals and select the preferred
bidder. The criteria for doing so typically include the technical merit of the proposal, and some measure
of their cost—given the overall aim of achieving value for money, or the optimum combination of costs
and benefits. There are two, broad options for how proposals will be evaluated and the preferred bidder
selected:
180   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      •	 Selection based on financial criteria—one approach is to undertake the evaluation in two stages,
         with the final selection based on the financial bid variable(s). Under this approach, technical proposals
         are evaluated first, on a pass-fail basis—only bidders that pass the technical evaluation proceed to the
         financial evaluation. The winning bidder is selected on the basis of the best financial proposal, among
         those that passed the technical evaluation

      •	 Selection based on financial and technical criteria—in some cases, proposals are evaluated based
         on a weighted combination of financial and technical criteria. This more closely encapsulates the idea
         of maximizing value for money. On the other hand, defining appropriate, quantitative criteria and how
         they will be weighted can be difficult and rely on subjective judgment by the evaluation team, which can
         undermine transparency of the tender process.

      The following resources further describe these options, with examples:

      •	 PPIAF’s Toolkit for PPPs in Roads and Highways, in its ‘Concessions: Main Steps in competitive
         bidding’ section, describes evaluation rules, financial evaluation criteria, and the multiple-parameter
         approach. This section also presents the evaluation criteria for 13 Latin American road concessions

      •	 Kerf et al Guide to Concessions [#169, pages 118-123] has sections on technical and financial proposal
         evaluation. These describe choice of technical criteria and of financial criteria, and the pros and cons of
         a combined score approach, with examples in each case

      •	 The World Bank Technical Note on Procurement of Management Contracts [#278, pages 22-28]
         describes evaluation options—from least cost selection, to quality-based selection, and provides
         guidance on how criteria can be set and weighted in each case.

      The best option, and the specific financial and technical criteria, may depend on project characteristics. It
      may also depend on the capacity of the public sector to undertake more complex evaluations, or on the
      risk of corruption, or perceived corruption, which could make transparency the most important objective.

      Many governments allow either approach to be used. For example, the PPP Guidelines for Mauritius
      [#182, Section 8.6, pg. 67-68] allows the project procurement team for evaluations of both the technical and
      financial considerations, or on price alone with pass/fail criteria for the technical evaluation. In Brazil, both
      the Federal Concessions Law (for user-pays PPPs) [#33 Article 15] and the Federal PPP Law (for government-
      pays PPPs) [#34 Article 12] allow both approaches. In all cases, the approach and criteria should be set in
      advance, and clearly communicated to potential bidders. Section 3.5.4: Managing the Bid Process provides
      more guidance and resources on selecting the specific evaluation criteria.


      Approach to Bid Costs and Payments
      Preparing a proposal for a PPP project is typically an expensive exercise. Equally, running a high-quality
      procurement process for a PPP can have high cost to government. Governments have different approaches
      to dealing with bid costs and commitments.
                                                             MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                   181




Many governments require bidders to submit a bid bond, to ensure commitment to the process, and
prevent the winning bidder from withdrawing without good cause. For example, the Spanish procurement
law prescribes that bidders should provide a temporary guarantee to back their proposal and increase it
to meet the definitive guarantee once the contract is awarded. The Philippines BOT Law implementing
regulations require a bid bond of between 1 and 2 percent of the estimated project cost [#202, Section 7.1
Clause b (vi)]. Kerf et al’s guide to concessions [#169, page 126] provides further examples, and briefly
describes the pros and cons of requiring a bid bond. The authors note, for example, that the United Kingdom
government discourages the use of bid bonds for PPP projects, on the basis that they are expensive, and
should only be sought in exceptional circumstances.

Governments have found different ways to deal with bid preparation costs. In some jurisdictions, the
government may share bid costs, to encourage more bidders to participate. For example, Australia’s PPP
practitioners’ guide [#16, page 29] states that bid costs may be reimbursed, but only in very limited and
clearly defined circumstances. Conversely, Chile has a mechanism for asking pre-qualified bidders to jointly
finance the engineering and other studies needed for the government to prepare for the transaction [#46].
This was an element of the reform to the PPP law that took place in 2010.

A KPMG review of PPP procurement in Australia [#173] describes typical bid costs for the private
party to a PPP in different countries. The report also draws on a survey of PPP practitioners to provide
recommendations for how bid costs can be reduced. These recommendations focus on improving the
efficiency of the PPP procurement process, as well as touching on the pros and cons of governments
contributing to bid costs.


3.5.2 Marketing the PPP


                 Decide                                            Manage          Achieve
                                   Market          Qualify
              Procurement                                          the Bid         Financial
                                   the PPP         Bidders
                Strategy                                           Process           Close




Marketing the PPP helps attract bidders and investors. This is particularly important in the early stage of a
PPP program—governments need to make a positive effort to build bidder interest, to increase competitive
pressure. Marketing also helps identify who might be the potential bidders. This can feed into designing
qualification criteria to avoid a situation where no firms qualify—as described in Kerf et al [#169, page 114].

At a minimum, marketing the PPP requires advertising the launch of the tender process. Many governments
have requirements for how PPP tenders should be advertised. For example, the EPEC Guide to Guidance
[#83, page 27] notes that EU governments must publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European
Union. The South Africa PPP Manual [#219, page 24] describes that the procurement must be advertised
in the Government Gazette, on the institution’s website, and through press advertisements.
182   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      Some governments take a more proactive approach to marketing, with a view to generating investor interest
      prior to the official project launch. This could include:

      •	 Conducting investor presentations, meetings, or ‘road shows’ to present the project. The scale and
         location of meetings can be tailored to the expected interested investors—for example, whether likely
         to be local or international

      •	 Releasing ‘teaser’ material about the project. This could include publishing material in industry publications,
         such as Global Water Intelligence, or dedicated project development platforms, such as Zanbato.

      There is limited guidance material available on marketing PPP projects. Farquharson et al [#95, page 105]
      briefly describes the advantage of releasing information about the project prior to the formal launch, to
      attract bidder interest. It also describes the value of marketing a pipeline of projects, rather than a single
      opportunity. Particularly for new PPP programs, this gives investors a stronger incentive to engage.


      3.5.3 Qualifying Bidders


                        Decide                                             Manage          Achieve
                                          Market           Qualify
                     Procurement                                           the Bid         Financial
                                          the PPP          Bidders
                       Strategy                                            Process           Close




      The next step may be to carry out a bidder pre-qualification process, to select the companies and consortia
      that will be invited to submit proposals. Not all countries select qualified bidders in advance, instead
      assessing qualifications as part of an open bidding process. The pros and cons the two approaches are
      described in Section 3.5.3: Qualifying Bidders.

      This section describes the pre-qualification process. This process consists of preparing and issuing the Request
      for Qualifications (RFQ)—along with advertising the launch of the tender process, as described in Section
      3.5.2: Marketing the PPP—and evaluating the information received to select a group of qualified bidders.

      Farquharson et al [#95, pages 113-120] describes the purpose of pre-qualification, typical types of criteria
      and processes, and provides brief guidance on project launch. The EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83, page
      27-28] also provides a helpful overview of the pre-qualification process.


      Preparing and issuing the Request for Qualifications
      For procurements that include a pre-qualification stage, the procurement process is officially launched
      when the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is issued. The RFQ typically includes enough information on the
      project for potential bidders to decide whether they are interested, and information on how the project will
      be procured. It should also clearly set out the process and requirements for the qualification process.
                                                            MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                    183




Information on the project at this stage could include an overview of technical and service requirements,
key commercial terms (although not typically a draft contract), and a list of the further information that will
be made available at the procurement stage. Information on the qualification process typically includes the
qualification criteria (see Box 3.12: Firm Qualification Criteria), the information required from firms and the
format in which that information should be presented, and the timeline and process for evaluation. The
following resources describe further the typical content of RFQ documents:

•	 South Africa PPP Manual procurement module [#219, pages 23-24] outlines the content of the
   RFQ document. This includes information about the project, procurement processes, instructions to
   respondents, information required about bidders, and the evaluation process

•	 Singapore’s PPP Handbook [#216, pages 56-60] lists RFQ contents, highlighting that it is not required
   to include the draft contract at this stage

•	 Australia’s National PPP Practitioners’ Guide [#16] calls the RFQ Expressions of Interest (EoI). Pages
   11-14 list the content that Request for EoIs should include—background, project scope and timetable,
   financial and commercial information, evaluation criteria, general terms and conditions, and EoI
   response requirements

•	 The World Bank’s toolkit for concessions in highways [#282] section on “prequalification” describes
   the information that should be included in the RFQ, and the information that should be requested from
   companies.

The following provide model, or example RFQ documents:

•	 India Planning Commission Guidelines for PPPs: Pre-Qualification of Bidders [#147] includes a model
   RFQ, as well as guidance on the steps of a qualification process

•	 World Bank Sample Bidding Documents for Management Contracts [#278] include a sample RFQ

•	 The World Bank PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center website [#286] includes a page on
   ‘Procurement Processes and Standardized Bidding Documents’ available at http://ppp.worldbank.org/
   public-private-partnership/content/procurement-processes-and-standardized-bidding-documents,
   with a link to a draft standard RFQ for Power Purchase Agreements, as well as links to actual bidding
   documents, including RFQs.

Some governments require approval of the RFQ documents, before issuing the procurement notice as
described in Section 3.5.2: Marketing the PPP. The procurement notice typically advises companies on how
to obtain the RFQ package. Governments may also alert investors directly that the RFQ package is available.


Evaluating the information received to identify qualified bidders
Having received statements of qualifications from interested firms, the implementing agency (or the
designated evaluation team) must evaluate those qualifications against the pre-defined qualification criteria.
184   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      Box 3.12: Firm Qualification Criteria describes typical firm qualification criteria, with resources and examples.
      These criteria can be defined and applied on a pass/fail basis, or used to rank firms, and qualify a certain
      number. See Section 3.5.3: Qualifying Bidders for more on these two approaches.

      Once the evaluation is completed, the implementing agency needs to inform both qualified firms or consortia,
      and those that have been unsuccessful. As described in the South Africa PPP Manual procurement module
      [#219, page 25], the list of qualified firms is typically published. The agency also needs to make sure it
      provides sufficient information on the decision to unsuccessful firms.




           Box 3.12: Firm Qualification Criteria

           One of the aims of the procurement process is to select a competent firm, with the capacity to
           implement the project. This means it is important to consider the qualifications of the firms behind
           each proposal. This can be done through a pre-qualification process to identify bidders, or as part
           of the first stage of the tender process (sometimes called “post qualification”). In either case, clear
           qualification criteria should be established before beginning the procurement process.

           Firm qualification criteria can be quantitative or qualitative. They typically involve considering
           the sponsoring firms’ financial robustness, previous experience with similar projects, and the
           experience of key members of the management team.

           Careful selection of these criteria is important, to avoid excluding firms (for example, smaller
           firms) that could make good partners; or including firms that prove poorly-qualified. The following
           provide discussion and examples of firm qualification criteria:

           •	 World Bank Technical Note on Procurement of Management Contracts [#278, pages 12-

The central step of procuring PPP projects is generally managing the bid process. This may follow pre-
qualification to select the participating bidders (although not always, as described in Section3.5.1: Deciding
the Procurement Strategy). The bid process ends with the selection of a preferred bidder, with whom the
implementing then works to execute the contract and reach financial close.

The particular steps in managing the bid process will vary, depending on the chosen bid process and
basis for award, as described in Section 3.5.1: Deciding the Procurement Strategy under ‘Bid process’. This
section describes and provides guidance on the following elements of managing the bid process:

•	 Preparing and issuing Request for Proposal (RFP) documents

•	 Interacting with bidders during the bidding period

•	 Receiving bids

•	 Evaluating bids to select the preferred bidder

•	 Dealing with problems such as receiving only one bid, or no fully compliant bids

•	 Finalizing the contract with the preferred bidder.

Farquharson et al [#95, pages 121-124] provides an overview of the bid process, and highlights some of the
important points for implementing agencies to consider at this stage.


Preparing and issuing Request for Proposal documents
The bid process formally begins when the government issues Request for Proposal (RFP) documents to
participating bidders. These documents set out the project structure and requirements, and the details of
the bid process. High-quality, detailed, and clear RFP documents are important to ensuring a competitive
process and a PPP that achieves value for money. RFP documents typically include the following:

•	 Information on the PPP project opportunity. This could include:

    -	   An Information Memorandum describing the key features of the project and the commercial terms
         of the PPP
186   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




          -	   Draft project agreements—that is, the output of the detailed PPP contract design process described
               in Section 3.4: Designing PPP Contracts

          -	   Copies of any permits or approvals obtained for the project

          -	 A description of the detailed technical information amassed during the project preparation stage
             that will be provided to bidders in a data room

      Information on the bid process. This could include:

          -	   Detailed bid rules and instructions to bidders, setting out the process and requirements

          -	   A timetable, which should build in enough time to allow bidders to prepare quality proposals

          -	   Box 3.13: Evaluation Criteria

          -	   Bid bond requirements (if any), as described in the section on ‘Approach to bid costs and payments’
               under 3.5.1: Deciding the Procurement Strategy.

Interacting with bidders during proposal preparation
After the RFP have been issued, bidders will prepare detailed proposals responding to the requirements of
the RFP. During this process, the government needs to define how and to what extent it will interact with
bidders as they prepare their proposals. Rules on the channels and permissible topics for interaction with
bidders are usually set in the RFP—important for transparency.

At a minimum, this interaction typically involves providing information to bidders, and responding to requests
for clarification on the RFP. In some cases, the government may consider updating the RFP documents as a
result. Typical channels for these types of communication include:

•	 Data room, which can be a physical or virtual space, where bidders can find all available information that
   is relevant to the project

•	 Question and Answer iterations, where bidders submit questions in writing and the implementing
   agency responds in writing to all bidders (ensuring that all bidders have access to the same information)

•	 Bidder’s Conferences, where the implementing agency presents the project and respond to questions
   from bidders. Some governments impose limits on when clarifications can be sought, to avoid revealing
   information close to the bid deadline that could benefit some bidders over others.

The following provide more information and examples of these approaches to interaction with bidders:

•	 PPIAF’s Toolkit for PPPs in Roads and Highways [#282] in its ‘Concessions: Main Steps in competitive
   bidding’ section, describes what technical information should be available in the data room

•	 The ADB PPP Handbook [#8, page 71] presents a sample data room index

•	 Australia’s national PPP practitioners’ guide [#16, pages 24-25] briefly describes the use of a data
   room, and a query process

•	 The Singapore PPP Handbook [#216, pages 61-62] presents the type of information that will be
   exchanged during the ”feedback period” when the RFP has been issued

•	 In Colombia, Law 80 of 1993 [#50] states that, after distributing the RFP documents to pre-selected
   bidders, if any of the bidders requests it, the contracting agency should hold a meeting with bidders
   to clarify any questions they may have, and listen to their concerns and comments. Based on this
   meeting the contracting agency may incorporate changes to the tender documents or may extend the
   submission date up to six days.
188   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      As described in ‘Negotiation with bidders: during bidding process’ under 3.5.1: Deciding the Procurement
      Strategy, some governments use an ‘interactive tender’ or ‘competitive dialogue’ process, which involves
      more extensive engagement with bidders as they prepare their proposals. Under this type of process,
      bidders typically initially submit technical proposals, which are then the subject of feedback and discussion
      with the contracting authority, to refine the proposed solutions to meet the authority’s needs, before
      submitting a final proposal. Some bidders may be dropped out of the process at different stages.

      For more detail and guidance on this procedure according to EU regulations, see the Government of the United
      Kingdom’s guidance on the use of competitive dialogue [#256]. Australia’s National PPP Practitioners’
      Guide [#16, pages 70-71] describes how a similar, “interactive tender” process is typically used in Australia.


      Receiving bids
      A reliable and credible system to ensure bids are handled confidentially is important, to prevent any
      opportunity for bid-tampering, and to protect commercially sensitive information in bids.

      Often bids are delivered in hard copy in sealed envelopes. Typically financial and technical bids are delivered
      in separate envelopes—financial bids are only opened for bidders that pass the technical assessment,
      and are often opened publicly to avoid any possibility of bid tampering. For example, the Philippines
      BOT law rules and regulations set out a two-envelope system for receiving bids [#202, Rule 7]. The World
      Bank sample bidding documents for output- and performance-based road contracts [#275, pages 19-21]
      also describe a sealed-envelope bid system, but allow for use of an electronic sealed bid system as an
      alternative. One advantage of an electronic system is that it prevents bidders from monitoring or interfering
      with physical bid delivery.

      Dumol’s diary of the Manila Water privatization by concession [#63, pages 85-98] includes a detailed
      description of the process for bid submission and bid opening in practice.


      Evaluating bids
      As described in the Partnerships Victoria Practitioners’ Guide [#19, pages 40-42], the evaluation process
      involves:

      •	 Assessing bid completeness, and compliance with minimum requirements of bid process

      •	 Assessing conformity with requirements of the project brief. The guide notes that conforming bids
         are evaluated before non-conforming bids—but that non-conforming bids may also be considered,
         particularly if no conforming bids are attractive (as described further below)

      •	 Bid clarification, which can involve a bidder presentation and a Q&A session. The guide notes that this
         should not include any opportunity to change bids

      •	 Detailed review by evaluation teams, following the pre-defined evaluation criteria. Box 3.13: Evaluation
         Criteria provides options and guidance for setting evaluation criteria.
                                                              MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects               189




•	 Preparation of evaluation reports, detailing the process followed and the analysis of the evaluation
   teams. Comprehensive reporting is important to the transparency of the process. In some cases, bidders
   may be invited to formally comment on a draft report, with the evaluation team required to address
   comments in the final version.

Partnerships Victoria Practitioners’ Guide [#19, Chapter 19.2] provides tips for evaluation, and lists what
should be included in an evaluation report. South Africa PPP Manual Module 5: Procurement [#219,
pages 45-51] also provides detailed guidance on how to evaluate bids, as well as describing South Africa’s
approach to defining evaluation teams.




     Box 3.13: Evaluation Criteria

     The selection of evaluation criteria can be key to ensuring the PPP provides value for money.
     Evaluation criteria should be decided in advance, and set out in the RFP documentation. Some
     countries specify evaluation criteria options in legislation. Evaluation criteria typically incorporate
     technical and financial elements. These may be evaluated separately—typically with a pass/fail
     technical evaluation, followed by ranking on financial criteria) or combined and weighted to rank
     bids (as described in Section 3.5.1: Deciding the Procurement Strategy under ‘Basis for Award’).

     The options for specific criteria depend on the nature of the project, as described (with examples)
     by Kerf et al [#169, pages 118-122]—for example, whether existing assets are involved, and
     whether the project will be user-pays or government-pays.

     Many PPPs are ranked on the basis of a financial criterion, subject to passing other technical
     and financial requirements. The most common option for a financial evaluation criterion is the
     remuneration of the private sector. This could be the lowest tariff to users, or lowest cost to
     government (whether as a government-pays PPP, or subsidy in addition to user charges). The
     Least Present Value of Revenue criterion, introduced in Chile and Peru for toll roads, is another
     alternative, described by Engel, Fischer and Galetovic [#73]. Related criteria can include length
     of concession, or amount of investment.

     Where technical requirements have been clearly set out in the proposal, technical evaluation
     requires checking compliance with those requirements. As Kerf et al [#169, page 118-119]
     describe, in some processes bidders are asked to submit project design, business, or investment
     plans, which are evaluated based on multiple criteria. The authors note the drawbacks of this
     approach—including the possible subjectivity of assessing plans, and the likelihood of plans
     changing substantially over the lifetime of the concession.

     The following resources provide further guidance and examples on choosing evaluation criteria:

     •	 EPEC’s Guide to Guidance [#83, page 23] briefly discusses the criteria that could be used
        for bidder selection
190   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




           •	 Guasch [#123, pages 97-105] describes the choice of award criteria, drawing on his extensive
              review of the factors leading to renegotiation in concession contracts in Latin America

           •	 The World Bank Toolkit for PPP in the water sector [#273, pages 171-179] describes and
              provides examples of evaluation criteria options for awarding a user-pays PPP contract in the
              water sector including technical, financial, and combined approaches

           Australia’s National PPP Practitioners’ Guide [#16, pages 62-65] describes a more holistic
           approach to evaluating bids. It includes quantitative and qualitative Value for Money, commercial
           and financial evaluation, service delivery evaluation, and project design evaluation.




      Dealing with issues—only one bid received
      If only one bid is received, this can raise concerns about whether that bid will provide value for money.
      As described in EPEC’s Guide to Guidance [#83, pages 29-30] there are two broad options in this case,
      depending on the reason for only receiving one bid:

      •	 Re-package and re-tender—this may be the best approach if the low turnout seems to be because of
         deficiency in the tender

      •	 Conduct thorough due diligence and select the sole bidder—may be a better option if it appears that
         the bidder believed the process would be competitive, and is in full compliance with the requirements.

      World Bank procurement guidelines [#283, page 25] note that rejection of all bids is justified where there is
      a lack of effective competition, but says “even when only one bid is submitted, the bidding process may be
      considered valid, if the bid was satisfactorily advertised, the qualification criteria were not unduly restrictive,
      and prices are reasonable in comparison with market value”’. The United Kingdom Government’s
      guidance on the competitive dialogue procedure [#256, Box 5.7] provides further guidance.


      Dealing with issues—no clear preferred bidder or no conforming bids
      In some cases, despite multiple bids being received, there may not be a clear preferred bidder. For example,
      this could be because no bids conform to requirements; or because a non-conforming bid appears to
      present a better value-for-money option than conforming bids.

      One common cause of this problem is poor clarity or quality of the RFP documents—the references listed
      above under ‘Preparing and issuing Request for Proposal documents’ provide guidance on preparing a
      clear, comprehensive, and well-structured RFP, to avoid this issue. The multi-stage and competitive dialogue
      procedures described in 3.5.1: Deciding the Procurement Strategy also help avoid this issue, by enabling
      changes to the RFP during the bid process that help ensure final bids are all comparable and compliant.
                                                           MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                   191




One option if no bids conform, and none appear to be of high quality, is simply to re-package and re-tender
the project. The alternative is to extend the procurement process, to identify a preferred bidder: typically
through discussions with the higher-ranked bidders on the points where the bids do not conform, often
followed by asking for a revised bid.

For further guidance, see Australia’s National PPP Practitioners’ Guide [#16, pages 27-28], which
describes two options in cases where no preferred bidder can be selected—entering into a ‘Best and Final
Offer’ (BAFO) process with two bidders, or structured negotiations. The South Africa PPP Manual Module
5 [#219, pages 51-56] also describes in detail when and how to run a BAFO process, if no clear preferred
bidder can be identified.


Finalizing the PPP contract with the preferred bidder
Once the preferred bidder has been selected, governments sometimes enter into further discussion, to
finalize the PPP contract. Extensive negotiation at this stage can undermine the competitive tender process,
as described in Section 3.5.1: Deciding the Procurement Strategy under ‘Negotiation with bidders: post-
bid’. However, some level of negotiation may be necessary, to clarify elements of the proposal or contract,
particularly when the bid process has not included significant interaction. If financing arrangements have
not already been finalized, lenders may also have demands at this stage that create pressure to negotiate
on elements of the contract and risk allocation.

Many governments define and limit the extent of negotiations possible at this stage. For example, the
EPEC’s Guide to Guidance [#83, page 31] describes a European Union rule that no issues that are material
to the procurement can be changed—that means that no change that could have resulted in a different
result from the bidding process should be incorporated during the post-bid negotiation phase. Where
changes are allowed at this stage, the final contract is often subject to further approval.
The following resources provide guidance on carefully managing post-bid negotiations:


•	 Australia’s National PPP Practitioners’ Guide [#16, page 30] provides guidance on setting up a
   ‘negotiation framework’ that includes, among other things, defining the negotiation issues and the
   timetable, setting the dispute resolution processes, and ensuring that the participants have the authority
   to make decisions on behalf of their organizations

•	 South Africa PPP Manual Module 5 [#219, pages 59-61] describes principles for negotiation, and the
   negotiation process

•	 ADB PPP Handbook [#8, pages 79-80] briefly describes important elements for negotiation—including
   having a fallback plan (which may be the second-place bidder).

      Once the government and the preferred bidder have signed the PPP contract, they are contractually
      committed to implementing the PPP. However, there are typically several additional steps before project
      implementation can begin. The preferred bidder may need to finalize the financing agreements for the
      PPP. The preferred bidder typically also needs to sign contracts with other parties in the PPP structure—for
      example, sub-contractors and insurers. The implementing agency typically also has tasks to fulfill, such as
      finalizing permits. Detailed contract management protocols and manuals are often also developed during
      this period (see Section 3.7: Managing PPP Contracts for more details).

      The PPP contract typically includes completion of (some of) these elements as Conditions Precedent, which
      must be met for the contract to become effective. PPP contracts often specify a final date by which the
      contract terminates, and/or a bid bond is forfeited, if the Conditions Precedent are not met. As noted in
      the PPIAF Toolkit for PPPs in Roads and Highways [#282] section on Contract Award, failing to specify
      requirements and stipulate a period for financial close can hold up project implementation for years.


      Finalizing financing agreements
      EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83, pages 31-33] describes the range of financing agreements for a typical
      PPP. These financing agreements are often not finalized until after the contract has been awarded. In most
      cases, interested lenders are identified at the proposal stage. However, before those lenders will commit
      to provide finance, they often carry out detailed due diligence on the project and PPP agreements (as
      described in Farquharson et al [#95, pages 124-125] There are risks associated with this process—lenders
      may require changes in the PPP agreements before agreeing to finance the project, or financing terms may
      change from what was assumed in the proposal. One way to mitigate these risks can be to ask for ‘firm’
      financing commitments at the proposal stage—but this can be difficult and expensive to procure, and risk
      reducing competition.

      Section 1.4: How PPPs Are Financed provides more information on the risks associated with PPP financing
      and reaching financial close.
                                                                       MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                            193




Meeting conditions for contract effectiveness and financial close
Financial close occurs when the all project and financing agreements have been signed, all conditions on
those agreements have been met, and the private party to the PPP can start drawing down the financing to
start work on the project. As noted in Yescombe [#295], financial close conditions are often circular—the
PPP contract does not become effective until funding is available for drawing (that is, funding availability is
a Condition Precedent for contract effectiveness), and vice versa.

EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83, Page 34] briefly describes common Conditions Precedent, and includes a
checklist for governments on finalizing the PPP contract and reaching financial close. Example requirements
include:

•	 Finalizing all project agreements and contracts

•	 Securing final approval from relevant government entities—for example, review and approval of the
   procurement process and final contract

•	 Securing permits and planning approvals

•	 Commencing or completing project land acquisition.

This process often requires a lot of detailed work and effort by both the public and private parties, to bring
the transaction stage to a close and begin project implementation.

3.6 Dealing with Unsolicited Proposals
An ‘unsolicited proposal’ is a proposal made by a private party to undertake a PPP project, submitted at
the initiative of the private firm, rather than in response to a request from the government. Accepting—
and encouraging—unsolicited proposals allow governments to benefit from the knowledge and ideas of the
private sector. However, unsolicited proposals also create challenges that mean they risk providing poor value
for money, particularly if the government chooses to negotiate a PPP directly with the project proponent.

Section 3.6.1 further describes these Benefits and Pitfalls of Unsolicited Proposals. The remainder of this
section then describes how some countries have introduced specific policies for dealing with unsolicited
proposals for PPPs. These policies are typically designed to provide incentives to private proponents
(to varying degrees) to submit high-quality PPP proposals; to deter poor quality proposals; to introduce
competitive tension; and to promote transparency.
196   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      Section 3.6.2: Creating Competitive Tension describes how competition can be introduced, while rewarding
      the original proponent with some form of advantage or compensation. Section 3.6.3 provides guidance
      and resources on Dealing with Intellectual Property in unsolicited proposals. Section 3.6.4: Defining Clear
      Processes describes and provides examples of processes for receiving, appraising, and implementing
      unsolicited proposals for PPP projects.


      3.6.1 Benefits and Pitfalls of Unsolicited Proposals
      Accepting unsolicited proposals allows governments to benefit from the knowledge and ideas of the private
      sector. This can be a significant advantage where limited government capacity means the private sector is
      better able to identify infrastructure bottlenecks and innovative solutions. It also provides government with
      information about where commercial opportunities and market interest lie. Box 1.5: Hot lanes in Virginia—
      An Example of Private Sector Innovation provided an example of a PPP project originated by a private
      company that provided an innovative solution to a transport infrastructure problem that the public sector
      had been struggling to solve.

      However, unsolicited proposals also create substantial challenges. First, most PPPs require government
      fiscal support: the government typically accepts risks, and the associated contingent liabilities, even if
      direct subsidies are not needed. As described in the PPIAF toolkit for PPPs in Roads and Highways
      [#282, Module 5, Stage 3 ‘Procurement’], experience suggests that proposals submitted by private
      companies often do not adequately assess the risks associated with the project, which may be borne by
      the government.

      Secondly, unsolicited proposals have not been originated as part of a government planning process,
      and, in some cases by definition, are not part of sector plans. This raises the question of whether the
      service proposed is sufficiently integrated with other sector plans for demand and benefits to be robust
      to changing circumstances and priorities. Moreover, unsolicited projects may divert government attention
      from a planned approach to infrastructure as a whole.

      Thirdly, negotiating with a project proponent on the basis of an unsolicited proposal—in the absence of
      a transparent or competitive procurement process—can create problems. It could result in poor value for
      money from the PPP project, given a lack of competitive tension. It could also provide opportunities for
      corruption. In the absence of corruption, it could nonetheless give rise to complaints about the fairness of
      the process, if a company is seen to benefit from a PPP without opening the opportunity to competitors.
      This lack of transparency can undermine the legitimacy and popular support for the PPP program.

      Box 3.14: Costs of Direct Negotiation—Independent Power Tanzania provides an example of a power
      project in Tanzania that was directly negotiated following an unsolicited approach by the private investor,
      which under arbitration was found to have provided poor value for money, and possibly been corrupt.
                                                            MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                 197




     Box 3.14: Costs of Direct Negotiation—Independent Power Tanzania

     The Government of Tanzania and the Tanzania Electricity Supply Company entered into
     contractual agreements with Independent Power Tanzania Limited (IPTL) of Malaysia for the
     supply of 100 megawatts of power over a 20-year period. This transaction was directly negotiated
     following an approach by the private investors during a power crisis. The transaction was
     contested by some government officials and by the international donor community and other
     interested stakeholders, on the grounds that it was the wrong technology (heavy fuel oil instead
     of indigenous gas), that it was not part of the least-cost generation plan, that it was not procured
     on a transparent and competitive basis, and that the power was not needed.

     The government ultimately submitted the case to arbitration. Under the final arbitral ruling, the
     project costs were reduced by about 18 percent. Even so, the costs remain well above international
     comparators. In the arbitration hearings the Government alleged that the contract award had
     been corrupt, bit failed to produce evidence to satisfy the Tribunal of this. The government has
     not subsequently pursued the corruption investigation. However, legal disputes between the
     IPTL and the government continue.

     Determinants of Success, Washington, D.C.: World Bank




The PPIAF toolkit for PPPs in Roads and Highways section on unsolicited proposals [#282, Module 5,
Stage 3 ‘Procurement’] further describes these challenges of unsolicited proposals. It sets out the ‘current
view’ of the World Bank as follows:

    …there is a place for genuine and innovative [unsolicited] proposals, but these are the exceptional
    case. The private sector must put up strong independently analyzed cases for unsolicited proposals
    at an early stage, before governments are sucked in to supporting projects that are financially weak,
    high risk, will take up significant human resources of the government, and will likely take a longer
    than normal time to implement because of these difficulties.

According to the World Bank’s PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center Website section on unsolicited
proposals [#286], the World Bank ‘considers that unsolicited proposals should be dealt with extreme caution,
and does not permit the use of unsolicited proposals in Bank-funded projects’.


3.6.2 Creating Competitive Tension
Many private companies submit unsolicited proposals with a view to directly negotiating a contract for the
proposed project—creating the problems described above. Box 3.11: Competitive Procurement or Direct
Negotiation describes some [#129] sets out the following approaches:
198   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      •	 Access to best and final offer—a two-stage bid process is used, in which the highest-ranked bidders
         from the first stage are invited to submit final proposals in a second stage (see Section 3.5.4: Managing
         the Bid Process). The proponent is automatically included in the second stage. This approach is used in
         the South Africa roads sector, as set out in a South Africa Roads Agency policy note [#219]

      •	 Developer’s fee—the proponent is paid a fee by the government or the winning bidder. The fee can
         simply reimburse some project development costs, or be defined to provide a return on developing
         the project concept and proposal. This is one option for dealing with unsolicited proposals permitted
         in Indonesia under the presidential regulations governing PPP [#148].

      •	 Bid bonus—the proponent receives a scoring advantage—typically defined as an additional percentage
         added to its evaluation score—in an open bidding process. This approach is used in Chile, where the
         bid bonus can be between 3 and 9 percent of the financial evaluation score (in addition, the proponent
         is reimbursed for the cost of detailed studies) [#46]

      •	 Swiss challenge—following an unsolicited approach, an open bidding process is conducted.
         If unsuccessful, the proponent has the option to match the winning bid and win the contract. This
         approach has been used in several states in India, as described further in Reddy and Kalyanapu’s
         paper on managing unsolicited proposals for PPPs in India [#212].

      Table 3.5: Examples of Procurement Strategies for Unsolicited Proposals provides further examples and
      references. These alternatives have not all proved equally effective at enabling competition. Hodges and
      Dellacha reviewed several countries’ experience with unsolicited proposals [#129, Appendix B]. In Chile, for
      example, of 12 concessions awarded from unsolicited proposals as of March 2006, 10 attracted competing
      bids, and only 5 were awarded to the original proponent. On the other hand, in the Philippines under the
      Swiss Challenge approach, all 11 PPP contracts awarded from unsolicited proposals by 2006 went to the
      original proponent.

      3.6.3 Dealing with Intellectual Property
      Private investors may be reluctant to submit unsolicited proposals if the proposal will be subject to
      competition, and if it is not clear how any intellectual property or commercially-sensitive information will be
      protected during the bidding process.

      There are different approaches to dealing with intellectual property in an unsolicited proposal, which may
      depend on the nature of the proposal. For example, the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide for Privately-
      Financed Infrastructure Projects section on unsolicited proposals [#259, pages 91-97] describes two
      options:

      •	 Where possible, the government can competitively tender the project, by specifying required outputs,
         and not the required technology to deliver those outputs. This approach is consistent with good
         practice in defining output-based performance requirements for PPPs (see Section 3.4.1: Performance
         Requirements)

      •	 In cases where intellectual property is crucial to the project, such that it could not be implemented
         otherwise, the UNCITRAL guidance suggests direct negotiation may be warranted, along with
         procedures to benchmark project costs.

      The Government of New South Wales in Australia provides guidance for practitioners on handling
      intellectual property [#17], which follows a similar approach to UNCITRAL, allowing direct negotiation
      of the PPP in certain circumstances. The Partnerships Victoria Practitioner’s Guide [#19] also provides
      guidance, and takes a slightly different approach. Proponents agree must identify any intellectual property
      they wish to protect (subject to agreement with government). The project is then tendered based on output
      specifications without revealing technology information if possible. If the intellectual property is “crucial to
      the existence of the service need”, the government negotiates with the proponent to obtain the rights to
      the necessary intellectual property, before procuring the project competitively.


      3.6.4 Defining Clear Processes
      Clear processes for handling unsolicited proposals are important for transparency, helping build confidence
      among all stakeholders that projects developed from unsolicited proposals deliver value for money. Clear
      processes can also help incentivize private developers to invest resources in developing good-quality
      project proposals, and encourage potential competitors to engage in the bidding process.

      Hodges and Dellacha [#129] describe a well-defined process to assess, approve and bid out a project
      from an unsolicited proposal, as illustrated Figure 3.8: Process for Assessing, Approving and Bidding an
      Unsolicited Proposal. First, a private company submits an unsolicited proposal, following clear content
      and presentation requirements. This proposal is screened, often following a similar approach as described
      in Section 3.1.2: Screening for PPP Potential. If the proposal passes the initial screening, the proponent is
      invited to complete any necessary studies before the proposal is assessed against the same criteria as any
      PPP (as described in Section 3.2: Appraising PPP Projects). If approved, any developers’ fee or bonus that
      will apply is often agreed at this stage.
                                                                                MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                        201




                    The responsible government agency then prepares bid documents, based on the final proposal, and
                    conducts a tender process. Proponents may or may not have an opportunity to respond to the bid documents
                    and submit a final bid. For example, in Korea the proponent may modify its original proposal and bid, but in
                    doing so forfeits some of its bid bonus (as described in an ADB/KDI report on PPP experience in Korea
                    [#171, pages 67-69]).

                    Many countries specify time periods within which each of these steps will be taken. Hodges and Dellacha
                    [#129, pages 12-13] describe the benefits and risks of doing so. On the one hand, specific deadlines within
                    which the government will deal with proposals can be helpful to provide assurance to the private sector that
                    their proposal will not languish in the process.

                    On the other hand, some countries introduce tight limits on the time allowed for competing proposals, which
                    could deter competition. For example, in the Philippines, the BOT Law of 1993 [#202] requires authorities to
                    advertise an opportunity for three weeks, and allow 60 days for competitors to respond—which is unlikely to
                    allow competitors to carry out the due diligence necessary to prepare a high-quality proposal.

                    Table 3.5: Examples of Procurement Strategies for Unsolicited Proposals briefly describes processes for
                    dealing with unsolicited proposals in several countries. Chile’s concessions law [#46], in particular, sets out

3.7 Managing PPP Contracts

Managing PPP contracts involves monitoring and enforcing the PPP contract requirements, and managing
the relationship between the public and private partners. The contract management stage spans the lifetime
of the PPP agreement, from the date of contract effectiveness to the end of the contract period.

Managing PPP contracts differs from managing traditional government contracts. PPPs are long-term and
complex, and contracts are necessarily incomplete—that is, the requirements and rules in all scenarios
cannot be specified in the contract. The aims of contract management for PPPs are to ensure:
204   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      •	 Services are delivered continuously and to a high standard, in accordance with the contract, and
         payments or penalties are made accordingly

      •	 Contractual responsibilities and risk allocations are maintained in practice, and the government’s
         responsibilities and risks managed efficiently

      •	 Changes in the external environment—both risks and opportunities—are spotted and acted on effectively.

      These aims of contract management are elaborated in the 4Ps Guide to Contract Management for PFI
      and PPP Contracts in the United Kingdom [#229, page 5]. The South Africa PPP Manual section on PPP
      Agreement Management [#219, Module 6, pages 11-12] describes what is needed and what is meant by
      successful management of a PPP contract, as well as what can go wrong in contract management, and why.
      EPEC’s 2014 Guidance for Managing PPPs [#89] condensates European experiences on the topic.

      The foundations for effective contract management are laid earlier in the PPP implementation process.
      Many aspects of contract management—such as procedures for dealing with change, and dispute resolution
      mechanisms—are set out in the PPP agreements, as described in Section 3.4: Designing PPP Contracts.

      This section describes four key aspects of putting contract management into practice for PPP projects:

      •	 Establishing contract management institutions—defining and establishing the responsibilities and
         communication mechanisms that will enable an effective relationship between the public and private
         partners to the contract

      •	 Monitoring PPP delivery and risk—monitoring and enforcing contract compliance and service
         performance by the private party, ensuring the government delivers on its responsibilities under the
         contract efficiently, and monitoring and mitigating risk

      •	 Dealing with change—putting into practice the mechanisms described in Section 3.4: Designing PPP
         Contracts to deal with contract adjustments, dispute resolution, and contract termination, as well as
         deciding whether, when and how to re-negotiate

      •	 Managing contract expiry and asset handover—managing the transition of assets and operations at
         the end of the contract term.

      The United Kingdom Treasury’s Operational Taskforce, part of the PPP Unit, has produced comprehensive
      guidance notes covering several topics on contract management for PPPs [#232].


      3.7.1 Establishing Contract Management Structures
      Establishing the contract management structures means defining responsibilities for contract management
      within government, and how the relationship with the private party will be managed. This includes designating
      a PPP contract manager (or management team) within the implementing agency, as well as defining the
      roles of other entities within government in managing the PPP. The government will need to be clear on
      where the contract manager has autonomy, and can act with discretion, and where it needs to consult or
                                                              MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                     205




gain approval from someone else—a higher level officer, or another entity such as a Finance Ministry. It
also requires establishing communication and contract management protocols for the relationship with the
private party.

The United Kingdom Treasury Operational Taskforce project transition guidance is a helpful overview
resource for establishing contract management institutions. The guide covers resource planning for contract
management, setting up monitoring and management arrangements, and establishing the communication
approach.


Designating a PPP contract manager and management roles
The implementing agency typically has primary responsibility for contract management. This responsibility
is often centered on a designated “PPP contract manager”—the main point of contact within government
for all matters relating to the PPP.

The PPP contract typically designates a particular entity as the contractual counterpart—for example, a Health
Board for a new hospital. The contract may also specify the individual contract point (and should provide for this
to be changed simply, by notice to the private party). In practice, there is a lot more to contract management
than these statements in the contract. The PPP contract manager—or management team—needs:

•	 Sufficient resources. Depending on the complexity of the contract—and resources available—the
   manager may be supported by a team, with members responsible for different aspects of contract
   management. The same individual or team could also manage more than one PPP contract. Farquharson
   et al’s chapter on contract management [#95, pages 136-137] highlights the need for the implementing
   agency to budget for the cost of the team, and their training

•	 Appropriate skills. The 4Ps Guide to Contract Management for PFI and PPP Projects in the United
   Kingdom [#229, pages 15-16] provides a typical job profile and skills required for a contract manager.
   The United Kingdom Operational Taskforce guidance [#232, page 2] emphasizes five key skills:
   communication, negotiation, change management, financial competence (to understand the payment
   mechanism), and analytical skills. This Taskforce was itself set up in part as a response to concerns about
   a lack of commercially-skilled contract managers in public authorities

•	 Appropriate seniority. For example, the South Africa PPP Manual module on contract management
   [#219, pages 15-16] notes that the contract manager needs to be senior enough to have the ear of
   senior staff at the implementing agency and other government entities, to deal with emerging issues.

The 4Ps Guide to Contract Management for PFI and PPP Projects [#229, page 8-10] describes the process of
setting up a contract management team. Drawing on the experience of contract managers in the UK, the guide
emphasizes the benefit of having the contract manager involved early—ideally when contract management
provisions in the contract are being designed. Continuity is also important during the contract lifetime, since
the contract will most likely outlast its management team. The guide describes how careful succession planning,
supported by a detailed contract management manual, can help ensure continuity [#229, page 19].
206   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      Roles of other entities in contract management
      Several other entities within government can also have roles to play in managing a PPP contract, typically
      working with the contracting authority and designated contract management team. These can include:

      •	 Sector regulators, which often have responsibility for monitoring service standards and managing
         changes in tariffs for PPP companies providing services directly to the public (see Section 2.3: PPP
         Processes and Institutional Responsibilities). For example, in Peru, contract management responsibilities
         in the transport sector are mostly allocated to OSITRAN—Organismo Supervisor de la Inversión en
         Infraestructura de Transporte de Uso Público—an agency in charge of regulating and supervising the
         management of public transport infrastructure. OSITRAN is in charge of monitoring the concessionaire’s
         compliance with the Concession Contract. This includes monitoring economic, commercial, operation,
         investment, administrative, and financial aspects of the contract. OSITRAN also has the authority to
         resolve controversies between users and the concessionaire. Zevallos Ugarte’s book on lessons
         learned in concessions in Peru [#297] further describes the responsibilities of OSITRAN. Similar
         regulatory agencies exist in other infrastructure sectors in Peru

      •	 The Finance Ministry is often involved, particularly where any possible changes to the contract could
         have a fiscal implication. For example, in Chile the Concessions Law (updated 2010) states that any
         changes introduced in the PPP contract during implementation must be done through a Supreme
         Decree of the Ministry of Public Works, and that the Decree must be approved (signed) by the Ministry
         of Finance [#46]

      •	 Central PPP units or other specialized support units may have a role in supporting the contracting
         authority’s contract management team. Farquharson et al [#95, pages 137-138] notes this can be
         particularly useful for dealing with complex issues—such as a refinancing—that may only occur
         once in a project lifetime. For example, the United Kingdom Treasury Operational Task Force was
         established under the United Kingdom’s PPP Unit, to provide help and guidance to public sector
         managers of PPP projects on contract management strategies, benchmarking, and refinancing of
         operational contracts.

      The World Bank’s Water PPP Toolkit [#273, pages 126-130] describes a range of options for institutional
      structures for monitoring and managing PPPs (focusing on PPPs providing services to users), with examples.
      It also sets out criteria for choosing the most appropriate institutions.

      Other actors within and outside government may also be drawn on to fulfill particular roles. For example,
      private contractors and end users can play a role in service monitoring, as described in Section 3.7.2:
      Monitoring and Managing PPP Delivery and Risk. Independent expert advisors or panels are also often used
      to help deal with change in the PPP contract, as described in Section 3.7.3: Dealing with Change.


      Communication and contract management protocols
      As well as establishing institutions, the government needs to specify the structure for communication between
      the public implementing agency and the private party. This often requires relationships at different levels
                                                           MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                  207




of both organizations—from the more senior levels (if dealing with emerging problems with the contract),
through those primarily responsible for contract management, to the operational staff. For example:

•	 The 4Ps Guide to Contract Management for PFI and PPP Projects in the United Kingdom [#229,
   pages 11-13] describes the set-up recommended for municipal councils in the United Kingdom, which
   comprises a ‘partnership board’ at the most senior level, a ‘contract management board’, and an
   “operational management team” to deal with day to day management. The guide describes how often
   each would meet, and the types of issues they would deal with

•	 South Africa PPP Manual module on contract management [#219, pages 13-17] also describes a
   similar structure, setting out the focus and typical parties to communication at the strategic, business,
   and operational level.

Some governments formally establish the communication and relationship management arrangements
in a contract administration manual, or plan. The 4Ps Guide [#229, pages 19-20] describes and provides
suggested contents for an operational contract manual, which includes defining the governance structure
and communication approach.

As important as the formal protocols is the nature of the relationship between the government agency and
the private party. The United Kingdom Operational Taskforce note on project transition describes the
importance of building good relations with the contractor [#232, pages 21-22]. The 4Ps Guide [#229, page
26] also describes the need for trust, while also setting boundaries and being ready to challenge. The guide
emphasizes the need to avoid developing a ‘cozy’ relationship that could lead to opportunism.


3.7.2 Monitoring and Managing PPP Delivery and Risk
To achieve the value for money promised by a PPP, the government needs to make sure that the planned
allocation of responsibilities and risks is put into practice. Throughout the lifetime of the contract, the
contract manager needs to:

•	 Monitor contract compliance and service performance by the private party, and ensure penalties or
   bonuses are paid appropriately

•	 Monitor and ensure compliance by government with its responsibilities under the contract

•	 Monitor and mitigate risks.

The actual activities required will differ between implementation stages—design, construction,
implementation, and project close. For an overview of service delivery management—including key
elements of risk management and performance management—see the South Africa PPP Manual module
on contract management [#219, pages 20-28] and Fortea et al’s Seguimiento de una Concesión [#104],
which describes the project monitoring process in Spain.
208   Public-Private Partnerships Reference Guide Version 2.0




      Monitoring and enforcing service performance and contract compliance
      The implementing agency needs to ensure the private party meets its obligations under the partnership, by
      monitoring outputs, or service standards. This does not generally involve detailed monitoring of construction,
      which is the responsibility of the private party. Instead, it means monitoring against the performance
      indicators established in the contract, as described in Section 3.4.1: Performance Requirements. The 4Ps
      guide to contract management for PPPs [#229, pages 28-36] provides an overview of managing service
      performance (focused on government-pays PPPs), and a checklist of key issues.

      As described in Section 3.7.1: Establishing Contract Management Structures, monitoring service
      performance and contract compliance is often the responsibility of the contract manager and management
      team. For PPPs in sectors that are regulated, the sector regulator may also undertake some or all monitoring
      responsibility. In either case, sources of monitoring information can include:

      •	 Data provided by the private party. Typically, the private party is responsible for providing project
         performance data in regular reports to the contracting authority. The content, format and frequency
         of these reports should be specified in the contract. For example, the Partnerships Victoria Contract
         Management Guide [#20, pages 54-55] describes how reporting requirements can be specified,
         including suggested templates for the different contract stages

      •	 Independent experts can be used to carry out checks on construction, maintenance on service
         standards, while avoiding concerns of bias in results. For example, the Partnerships Victoria Contract
         Management Guide [#20, page 55] describes how independent reviewers are used at construction and
         service delivery stages. India’s guidelines on monitoring PPP projects [#145, page 8] also describe
         the use of an independent engineer to monitor compliance during design, construction, and operations

      •	 Service users have a wealth of information on the quality of service and the prevalence of faults, which
         the government can draw on by setting up processes for feedback. For example the 4Ps Guide to
         Contract Management [#229, page 33] describes a helpdesk, to be established by the service provider,
         as a good practice.

      These arrangements should be specified in the contract, as described in Section 3.4.1: Performance
      Requirements.

      The implementing agency also needs to ensure enforcement mechanisms are implemented as appropriate,
      based on the monitoring information received. This could include adjusting payments (for government-
      pays PPPs) following the rules in the contract, or in severe cases, calling performance bonds. It also includes
      communicating with the contractor, and monitoring attempts to rectify performance shortfalls. Finally, it
      could include identifying if and when trigger points are reached for default, step-in by the lenders or the
      public party, or termination (see Section 3.7.3: Dealing with Change).


      Monitoring and managing government responsibilities and risks
      A crucial element in ensuring good performance and sustained service delivery under a PPP contract is
      monitoring and managing the risks and responsibilities allocated to government. A central tool often used
                                                                        MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                       209




by implementing agencies in doing so is a ‘risk management plan’.

A risk management plan typically lists each risk and associated responsibilities borne or shared by the
government, as well as those that may undermine sustainability of the PPP (and so lead to risk of default, or
poor performance). For each risk, the plan should also identify the information needed to monitor the risk,
and possible actions to mitigate the risk or its impact. These information requirements should also be part
of the reporting requirements defined in the contract. Farquharson et al [#95, pages 153-158] provides a
sample extract of a risk management plan for a PPP, which lists risks, and for each risk describes the ‘owner’,
status, estimated impact, comments, mitigating actions, target dates for action, and current risk status.

The risk management plan should be developed by the contract manager prior to the start of the contract,
then act as a resource and guide throughout the duration of the contract. The contract manager typically
collects the relevant risk monitoring information from the private party, and relevant external information
(such as on economic trends), to regularly update the plan. The contract manager then needs to:

•	 Monitor indicators against expected levels, to identify emerging risks. For example, traffic levels failing
   to climb as projected may indicate a risk that a minimum traffic payment will be triggered

•	 Take the planned mitigating actions, where there are risks that the implementing agency can control
   (or ensuring private party is doing the same). For example, if government is responsible for associated
   infrastructure that is falling behind schedule, the plan may be to transfer responsibility for that
   infrastructure to a higher level team in government, or to the private party

•	 Even where risks cannot be controlled, consider possible actions and responses. For instance, if
   floods threaten critical water service facilities, government may start work with the private party on an
   emergency response, including alternative supplies, rationing, and a service re-instatement plan.

     Box 3.15: Example of Weak Risk Monitoring—Victoria Trams and Trains

     The trams and trains franchises in Melbourne, Australia provide an example of the implications
     of inadequate risk monitoring. The government awarded a series of franchises for the city’s urban
     transport system, in which demand risk was largely borne by the private parties. Demand turned
     out to be substantially lower than expected, resulting in financial difficulties for the companies. The
     government’s contract monitor was receiving information from the private parties, which showed
     the deteriorating financial performance. However, the monitor failed to hear the alarm bells or take
     any remedial action. Performance continued to deteriorate, to the point that the private parties’ best
     option was to walk away from the contract, and the government had no option but to renegotiate.

      The following resources provide further guidance and examples of risk management approaches:

      •	 The South Africa PPP Manual module on contract management [#219, pages 20-24] describes how risk
         monitoring and management should center around a risk management plan

      •	 The Partnerships Victoria Contract Management Guide [#20, pages 49-54] describes the monitoring
         information—beyond KPIs—that the government will typically collect, to monitor risks to the sustainability
         of the contract.


      3.7.3 Dealing with Change
      Over the life of a typical PPP contract—10 to 30 years—things will inevitably happen that could not have
      been predicted when the contract was signed. It is also likely that the parties will get into a dispute over
      how the contract should be interpreted, or whether both parties have been performing as agreed. In some
      cases, these disputes may result in early termination of the contract. These risks cannot be avoided—but
      they can be managed.

      Some general guidance material that is available on dealing with change in PPPs is:

      •	 The United Kingdom’s National Audit Office publication on managing the PFI relationship [#250],
         which emphasizes the need for: public authorities to address the question of contract management
         early in the project preparation; appropriate skills in the public authority; and highlights the importance
         of an open and cooperative attitude

      •	 A shorter overview on similar topics is provided in Quick’s article on managing PPP contracts [#211]
         which also adds an Australian perspective

      •	 UNESCAP’s PPP guidebook [#261, Chapter 6] offers an overview of contract management intended
         for developing countries. It focuses on institutional arrangements for contract management, and
         mechanisms for dispute resolution.

      These materials do not provide a great deal of detailed guidance of the sort that would benefit government
      officials in developing countries. Therefore, the approach taken in this section is to also provide examples
      of where these issues have come up, and ways in which they have been handled, from which practitioners
      can draw lessons. These ‘change’ situations can usefully be discussed in four categories: planned reviews
      and adjustments; renegotiations; disputes; and contract expiry or termination.


      Planned reviews and adjustments
      Well-structured PPP contracts build in adjustment mechanisms for dealing with the more common types of
      ‘unexpected’ change, as described in Section 3.4.3: Adjustment Mechanisms. In addition to being aware of,
      and following, the rules in the contract, contract managers need to make sure required institutional elements
      are in place, as described in the EPEC Guide to Guidance [#83, pages 37-38]. For example, this could include
      ensuring expert panels have been identified and are qualified, and all the steps are clear to all parties involved.
                                                            MODULE 3 Implementing PPP Projects                   211




Renegotiation or contract variations
Many PPP contracts are renegotiated, often quite early in their lives, as described by Guasch in his book
on renegotiation in PPPs [#123]. ‘Renegotiation’ refers to changes in the contractual provisions, otherwise
than through an adjustment mechanism provided for in the contract. Renegotiation is something to avoid
where possible, as Guasch also explains. Good use of adjustment provisions, as outlined above, can obviate
the need for renegotiation.

Still, renegotiations will from time to time be needed, and governments will benefit from understanding
good policy for renegotiations. Partnerships Victoria’s Contract Management Manual [#20, Section
7.3] describes the understanding that public parties should have of the private party’s financial health, as
well as project performance. While not focused specifically on renegotiation, having this information and
understanding will certainly benefit government as it considers decisions that could result in renegotiation.

There are a few examples of renegotiations that may offer some insights into good practice, and which have
been documented. These include:

•	 The Melbourne Tram and Train concessions. When these concessions were in financial difficulty,
   the government decided to renegotiate rather than terminate, as this was expected to provide better
   value for money (see Ehrhardt and Irwin [#72]) To provide transparency and quality assurance on the
   process, the government announced early in the process that, after the negotiations were complete,
   they would be subject to an ex-post value for money analysis. This analysis was published as an Auditor
   General’s report [#11], which describes the renegotiation process and results

•	 The United Kingdom National Air Traffic Services (NATS) PPP, also described by Ehrhardt and
   Irwin [#72], was a more controversial restructuring. The PPP Company faced falling revenue, because
   of a sharp downturn in air travel after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. The
   company looked certain to default on its debt. The Board of the Civil Aviation Authority (the public party
   to the PPP) was split. The Board member directly responsible for the contract insisted the government
   should not renegotiate, stating the solution was a private sector financial restructuring, in which the
   lenders to the company would bear some of the losses. The majority of the Board disagreed however,
   and agreed to change the terms of the contract, as part of a package deal that also involved some debt
   restructuring.

In contrast to the United Kingdom NATS experience, the government of New South Wales managed to
avoid renegotiating the PPP contract for a highway tunnel under Sydney’s central business district when
it went into financial distress. Instead, the matter was left to be resolved entirely through a private sector
financial restructuring. Johnston and Gudergan subsequently reviewed the experience to draw lessons for
PPP governance [#167].

Road contract renegotiations in Portugal and Spain, during the recent economic and financial crisis,
present an interesting case of renegotiation under fiscal stress—but lessons are not yet reported. The
British National Audit Office already reported on similar renegotiations for reducing service levels and
obtaining project savings.

      Disputes
      Contractual disputes arise when one party believes the other has not done something it was contractually
      obliged to do, but the other party disagrees as to what its obligations were, or what should be done to
      remedy the situation.

      The Partnerships Victoria Contract Management Guide [#20, Section 8.3] includes a section on issue
      management and dispute resolution. A helpful distinction is made between ‘issues’ and ‘disputes’, as set
      out in Table 3.6: Distinction between Service Delivery Issues and Disputes.

      Source: Australia, Partnership Victoria (2003), Contract Management Guide. Melbourne


      The Partnerships Victoria Contract Management Guide also contains sample templates for specifying
      how issues may be escalated [#20, Template M] and disputes resolved [#20, Template N]. The practical
      advice offered focuses on the desirability of speedy informal resolution of disputes, understanding the
      other side’s position, and avoiding inappropriate dispute processes, since these can damage the long term
      relationship.

      While a focus on finding practical solutions quickly and taking account of the realities of the other side’s
      position will almost always be valuable, countries with different administrative and legal traditions and
      capacities will not necessarily find it appropriate to seek informal dispute resolution. Rather, it will often be
      desirable to follow the formal steps set out in the contract—but to do so in a way that is directed toward
      finding a practical solution.

      There are numerous examples of the costs that governments end up bearing as a result of choosing
      inappropriate dispute resolution methods. For example, the Government of Tanzania was justifiably
      dissatisfied with the performance of the private firm operating the water system in Dar es Salaam. The
      PPP contract provided a dispute resolution mechanism under which the government could very likely have
      achieved the redress if sought, and indeed won damages from the contractor. However, as described in a
      review of the dispute case [#226, page 6]:

           “While the contractual relationship was headed inevitably towards dissolution, Tanzanian
           Government officials, motivated by electoral concerns, among others, took a series of drastic
           measures that went far beyond the contractually mandated process for termination of the Project
           Contracts. In May 2005, Tanzanian Government officials, causing public furor, repudiated unilaterally

    and rather publicly the lease agreement with City Water while calling on the performance bond
    posted by BGT, reinstated the previously waived VAT on purchases by City Water, repossessed
    forcibly the assets previously leased to City Water, and deported City Water’s BGT-appointed
    management”.

Cases of PPP disputes and how they have been handled are available on the website of the International
Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID, a part of the World Bank Group)—see Box 3.10:
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). In July 2010, ICSID ruled that the
Argentinian government unfairly refused to allow the private concessionaires to raise tariffs during the
period after the devaluation of the Argentine peso in 2001 and that the private companies are entitled to
damages—see Box 1.6: When PPPs fail—The case of the 1993 water concession in Buenos Aires on this
conflict.

Overly [#197] also provides a critical review of the experience of international arbitration, in a range of PPP
and similar cases. Many of these cases suggest that governments can minimize the costs of disputes to the
public sector if they:

•	 Act quickly when problems start to arise

•	 Have teams with the right skills and appropriate levels of decision-making authority working on resolving
   the issue

•	 Follow processes set out in the contract

•	 Look for win-win solutions, taking into account the broader public interest, as well as the private parties’
   options

•	 Resolve the issues at the lowest level possible and only escalate if they are not resolved.


3.7.4 Contract Expiry and Asset Handover
The final task in managing a PPP contract is to manage the transition of assets and operations at the end
of the contract term. The approach to this transition should be clearly defined in the contract. As set out
in Section 3.4: Designing PPP Contracts, this typically includes defining how quality of the assets will be
defined and assessed, whether a payment will be made on asset handover, and how the amount of any
payment will be determined. Options include clearly specified handover requirements, or the involvement
of independent assessors.

As noted in The World Bank’s toolkit for PPPs in roads and highways section on hand back of facilities at
contract end [#28 2, Module 5, Stage 5], there has been relatively limited practical experience in completion
of PPP agreements. Equally, there is limited practical guidance on dealing with this stage of contract
management.
