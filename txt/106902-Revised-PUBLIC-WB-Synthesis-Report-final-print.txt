Pathways to Reducing Poverty
and Sharing Prosperity in India
                  Lessons from the Last Two Decades
Urmila Chatterjee, Rinku Murgai, Ambar Narayan and Martin Rama
ABSTRACT
India is uniquely placed to help reduce global poverty and boost prosperity. The country has the largest
number of poor people in the world, as well as the largest number of people who have recently escaped
poverty. There is an emerging middle class but the majority of people are still vulnerable to falling
back into poverty. What lessons do the past two decades offer for what it will take for the country
to sustain progress and bring about deeper changes? This synthesis brings together the key insights
from extensive and in-depth research conducted by the World Bank on India’s experience in reducing
poverty and sharing prosperity. The first chapter offers an overview of the trends in living standards
and mobility in India. This is followed by a chapter on the main drivers of poverty reduction. The
third chapter sheds light on some of the gaps India needs to fill for sustaining mobility and spreading
prosperity more widely.

Tackling Poverty in India
The Indian Express series

Five key drivers of reducing poverty in India
May 17, 2016 – Onno Ruhl and Ana Revenga
India completes 25 years of the beginning of economic reforms this July. Starting today, The Indian Express will
publish findings from an e-symposium that brings together recent research by The World Bank on poverty in India.
On poverty and prosperity, lot done, lot to do
May 18, 2016 – Ambar Narayan and Rinku Murgai
The rapid decline in India’s poverty levels over the last decade augurs well for the country’s efforts to eradicate poverty.
Poverty down, but 1 in 2 hangs by a thread
May 25, 2016 – Peter Lanjouw and Rinku Murgai
Scheduled Tribes stand out as a group that has fallen further behind, with one-third stuck in chronic poverty.
1 in 3 has piped water, 2 of 5 kids stunted
May 27, 2016 – Ambar Narayan and Swati Puri
Decline in consumption poverty notwithstanding, on parameters like tackling open defecation, India lags behind
even Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan.
The low income, low growth trap
June 7, 2016 – Urmila Chatterjee and Swati Puri
Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh continue to lag behind the
rest of the country in income and growth. Despite the success of these states on a few important fronts, where you
live still determines how well you live.
India, the driver of growth for Bharat
June 13, 2016 – Gaurav Datt, Martin Ravallion, and Rinku Murgai
Since 1991, 80% of the total reduction in poverty has been due to urban growth — rural poor have gained more
from urban growth than from rural growth. Also, post-1991, secondary and tertiary sectors have helped more to
reduce poverty than primary sector.
Jobs, not transfers, the big poverty-buster
June 17, 2016 – Carlos Felipe Balcazar, Sonalde Desai, Rinku Murgai and Ambar Narayan
Between 2005 and 2012, structural changes drove poverty reduction — non-agricultural incomes rose the fastest,
and the largest shifts from farm to salaried non-farm employment were seen among the poorest.
Where you live decides how ‘well’ you live
June 28, 2016 – Yue Li and Martin Rama
‘Good’ living spots tend to be found in clusters; some ‘good’ locations spread more prosperity than others.
Three jobs deficits in unfolding India story
July 25, 2016 – Martin Rama, Urmila Chatterjee and Rinku Murgai
The quantity and quality of jobs created raise concerns about the sustainability of poverty reduction, and the
prospects for enlarging the middle class.
Since 2005, fewer jobs for women in India
July 26, 2016 – Urmila Chatterjee, Martin Rama and Rinku Murgai
After farming jobs collapsed post 2005, alternative jobs considered suitable for women failed to replace them,
leading to women withdrawing from the labor force.
Key lessons on road to sharing prosperity
August 17, 2016 – Martin Rama
A review of India’s experience over the last two decades confirms the links between poverty and the lack of assets
at the household level, but the importance of location suggests interventions by policymakers to go beyond
simply investing in education and health.

Survey (NSS)                         different topics over time. Data on consumption expenditure are collected nearly
                                     every year, with larger samples of households interviewed in the “thick” rounds
                                     that are used for estimating poverty rates. Detailed information on employment is
                                     also collected in the thick rounds. The most recent survey years on consumption
                                     and employment are from 2004-05, 2009-10 and 2011-12. The NSS is also the
                                     source for non-monetary indicators of well-being such as educational attainment,
                                     access to electricity, and open defecation. The NSS is produced by the National
                                     Sample Survey Organization.

                                     Consumer price indices for agricultural laborers are used to compute real wage

                                     released by the Reserve Bank of India.


Population Census                    Data from the Census of India is used to compute population at all administrative
                                     levels. It is also used to determine the class and size of cities, and to estimate
                                     urbanization rates. This source allows the identification of sampling substratum
                                     in the NSS, serving as the basis for analyses below the district level. The custodian
                                     for this data is the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India.


National Accounts                    This is the source of data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the national levels,
                                     as well as for states and districts. Data on GDP per capita is used to measure
                                     economic growth, to identify low-income states, and to estimate the elasticity of
