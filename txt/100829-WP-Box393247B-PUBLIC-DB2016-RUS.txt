THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in this year’s economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

STARTING A BUSINESS
What are the details?

                                                              STANDARDIZED COMPANY
Russian Federation is a set of specific procedures—
the bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                Legal form: Private Limited Liability Company
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through           (OOO)
collaboration with relevant local professionals and
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available          Paid-in minimum capital requirement: RUB 0
information on business entry in that economy.                 City: Moscow, Saint Petersburg
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,
along with the associated time and cost. These                 Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).
Table 2.2 Summary of time, cost and procedures for starting a business in Russian Federation - Moscow
                                                                                    Time to

                                                                                   complete
       Notarize company registration application

       Each founder must fill out and sign a standard registration application,
       which must be notarized. There is a stamp duty of RUB200 per copy.
       This cost does not include fees for technical work charged by notaries
       or lawyers if this application form is completed by them – the cost of
       RUB 200 assumes that the application form is filled out by the
       entrepreneur themselves. Fees of technical work by lawyer/notaries are
       only applicable in cases where there is a need to draft a charter, and
       thus are not applicable to the Starting a Business case study.

       Starting from May 5, 2014 this procedure ceased to be compulsory. If
       the founder is able to attend the Tax Service office and file all the
       documents in person, the application does not have to be notarized
       and the tax officer can certify the founder’s signature instead. However,
       this is possible only in case when all the founders are able to visit the
       Tax Service in person, otherwise the application must be notarized.

       Pay registration fee

       New company must pay a registration fee of RUB 4,000, and collect a
       payment receipt from a terminal machine. Business registration receipt
   2   is required for Procedure 4, registration with Federal Tax Service. The      1 day           no charge
       entire process takes only a few minutes, but it must be done in person.
       Payments can be made at the post office, any bank office, including
       Sberbank offices throughout Moscow, or at payment terminals at the
       Moscow Tax Service Office #46, where business registration is done.

      The company must submit the following documents for registration:
      • Resolution of the founders on the establishment of the company;
      • Charter (2 originals required, one is stamped by the Federal Tax
      Services and returned to applicants after the registration);
      • Notarized Registration Application;
      • Receipt of payment of the state registration fee (procedure 2).
      • Document Certifying the Physical Address of the New Company (this
      could be a lease agreement or a letter by the property owner of the
      leased property, certified with signature and building company’s stamp.
      If the leasing office space is from an individual owner this document
      would need notarization.)

      The tax authorities sometimes implement a number of additional
      requirements, and failure to comply may lead to the rejection of the
      application.

      At the time of application, the applicant receives a confirmation slip,        7 days      RUB 4,000
3
      which specifies the date that the registration will be complete and ready
      for pick up. This is always 5 working days (not counting the day of the
      application) after application. The registration fee is RUB 4,000.

      On the day of pick up, the applicant will receive a package of
      documents, including Abstract of the state registration, abstract of tax
      registration with a Tax Identification Number (TIN), one of the original
      company charters (that the applicant submitted) stamped by the
      government, and certificate of business entry in the unified State
      Register of Legal Entities. If the applicant does not pick the registration
      documents from the office, it is sent by mail.

      The procedure could also be done online
      http://www.nalog.ru/rn77/service/gosreg_eldocs/- with electronic
      signature. However, obtaining online signature is costly and time
      consuming. In practice, most businesses do not utilize the online
      services. The online service has been available since 2012.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                   Answer                                    Explanation
                                             In accordance with Art. 9 of the Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy), the
                                             management of Mirage must petition the court to declare the
                                             company bankrupt within 1 month of failing to pay the Bank’s claims.
                                             The court will institute a supervisory procedure and will appoint a
                Moscow,                      temporary administrator. Temporary administrator will convene the
Proceeding        Saint        liquidation   first creditors’ meeting, where the creditors will decide whether to
               Petersburg                    petition the court for liquidation or reorganization. Under the case
                                             study assumptions, creditors, most likely, will choose the liquidation
                                             procedure, because it is not likely that other procedures can lead to
                                             restoration of the debtor’s solvency. On the contrary, in liquidation, the
                                             bank can partially satisfy its claims.

                Moscow,                     Despite the fact that the value of the business will be higher if it is sold

               Petersburg                   purchase all the assets as a whole.

                                             In accordance with Article 51 of the Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy), a
                                             bankruptcy case must be considered within 7 months of the day the
                                             petition was received by the arbitrazh court. Liquidation proceedings
                                             by law are limited to 6 months and can be extended by 6 more
                Moscow,                      months (art. 124 of the Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy)). Therefore, the

               Petersburg                    proceedings are extended more than once and for longer periods. One
                                             reason for extension, for example, is that not all mechanisms were
                                             used to collect on the debt, and court decisions on this issue become
                                             effective only after appeals. Additionally, time is needed to execute
                                             judicial acts.

                                             Total cost of the insolvency proceedings will be around 9% of the
                                             value of the estate, including:
                                             - Fees of attorneys will be around RUB 1,000,000

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
