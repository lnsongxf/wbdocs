                                                          Executive Summary
This synthesis report documents the implementation process, results and lessons learned under a three-
year Technical Assistance (TA) program undertaken by the Water and Sanitation Program of the World
Bank’s Water Global Practice (WSP) in Cambodia between May 2013 and June 2016. It also presents
recommendations for the government on key steps to accelerate service delivery at scale for Rural Water
Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (RWSSH) and for the World Bank to strategically engage in the sector. For
comprehensiveness, annexes are attached that include key supporting documentation, and resources and
deliverables developed under this TA are also provided in the resource pack (the resource pack is linked
to Box folder which is available upon request).
Why this TA?
As of 2015, approximately one third of Cambodia’s rural population are relying on unimproved water
sources for their daily consumption; and 60% are still practicing open defecation in rural areas.1 With over
three quarters of Cambodians living in rural areas, and considering that rural areas are home to 90% of
Cambodia’s poor,2 lack of access to improved water and sanitation takes a high toll on health and
nutritional status, dignity and well-being. Such conditions limit the overall economic opportunities for
rural households, trapping them in the poverty cycle leading to trans-generational poverty.
The Government of Cambodia envisions that by 2025, everyone in rural areas lives in communities with
universal access to water supply and sanitation.3 With the pace of progress that the sector has achieved
to date, realizing the 2025 vision remains a huge challenge, especially for rural sanitation.
To address the challenges in the RWSSH sector, the TA was formulated with the objective of increasing
the capacity of the Government of Cambodia to lead, coordinate and mobilize resources for developing
and sustaining poor-inclusive rural water supply and sanitation services.
To achieve the objectives, the TA focused on two pillars: (i) Support the government capacity to
operationalize the sector strategy and decentralization, and (ii) Support the government capacity in sector
monitoring and learning. Although the TA covered both rural water supply and sanitation, the
predominant focus has been on the latter, given its off-track progress in reaching the related Millennium
Development Goals (MDG).
What did the TA cover and what was achieved?
Grouped into two pillars above, the activities undertaken under the TA are summarized as follows:
Pillar 1: Support the government capacity to operationalize the sector strategy and decentralization
          Conducting Sector Partner Mapping: The TA supported the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD)
           in conducting a partner mapping survey to better understand the stakeholder landscape in the
           sector including the areas of partner support and the resources flowing into the sector. This
           exercise provided an opportunity for the government to improve coordination mechanisms and
           for RWSSH partners to proactively adjust their strategy and program. It has also led to a stronger
           commitment to develop a joint national action plan which all partners would contribute to.
          Raising the Profile and Dissemination of the National Strategy for RWSSH: The TA assisted MRD
           in disseminating the RWSSH Strategy, approved by MRD in 2011, to all 25 provinces to build a
           shared vision for the RWSSH sector. WSP also supported MRD in transforming the RWSSH Strategy

           into the National Strategic Plan for RWSSH 2014-2025 which was approved by the Government of
           Cambodia, the Council of Ministers, in January 2014.
          Formulating the RWSSH National Action Plan: To help the government operationalize the
           National Strategic Plan, the TA supported the formulation of a medium-term action plan up to
           2018. The National Action Plan for RWSSH 2014-18 (NAP) was developed (and to be approved)
           with realistic activities, outputs, clear timeline, resource envelope and results framework.
          Consolidating Behavior Change Communications (BCC) through National Guidelines: Since the
           sector strategic direction strongly emphasizes Behavior Change Communications (BCC) in the
           delivery of water supply, sanitation and hygiene services, the TA supported MRD in developing
           the National Guidelines for Behavior Change Communications for Rural Sanitation and Hygiene in
           Cambodia. The Guidelines pave the way for development of an umbrella BCC campaign for the
           sector so that coherent messages could be effectively conveyed to the target population.
          Piloting a Decentralized Service Delivery Model for Rural Sanitation: The government’s reform
           agenda on decentralization calls for strengthening the mandate of the district level in service
           delivery to improve responsiveness, quality and access of services for its citizens. The TA
           supported MRD and the National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development (NCDD)
           to implement a pilot of rural sanitation functional assignment in two provinces. The pilot provides
           lessons for the roll-out of function transfer nationwide.
Pillar 2: Support the government capacity in sector monitoring and learning
          Supporting the Development of a Monitoring System for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation:
           The National Strategic Plan for RWSSH calls for a unified government-owned Management
           Information System (MIS) for monitoring sector performance. The TA conducted an M&E situation
           analysis and helped design the sector performance monitoring framework which are the
           backbone of the MIS design.
          Undertaking Strategic Research to Inform Programmatic Approaches: Two studies have been
           conducted to address important knowledge gaps in the sector: (i) the link between rural sanitation
           and stunting, and (ii) the effect of Output-Based Aid (OBA) subsidies and sanitation marketing on
           sanitation uptake among the poor. While the first one fosters cross-sector collaboration, the
           second one provides inputs to the development of the pro-poor support guidelines to be
           developed by MRD.
What have we learnt?
The implementation of the TA has yielded a number of experiences and lessons learnt that could be
particularly beneficial for the sector to put forward strategic programming for RWSSH and to inform future
support to the Cambodian Government and World Bank engagement. Below are the key lessons learned
captured during the course of TA implementation.
Operationalization of the sector strategy and decentralization
          Engaging sub-national stakeholders in an interactive learning experience on the new service
           delivery approaches in the RWSSH Strategy maximizes ownership.
          Elevating the political profile of the RWSSH sector along with a medium-term National Action Plan
           can facilitate resource mobilization by the government, both from domestic sources as well as
           grants and loans from development partners.




Page | 2
          Participatory development of the National Action Plan for RWSSH 2014-18 contributes to better
           harmonization and alignment, builds momentum for sector support, and leads to increasing
           demand for institutional strengthening.
          Government leadership is essential for the development of an overarching BCC guideline to
           facilitate joint collaborative action in the execution of a sector-wide BCC campaigns.
          Getting high-level ministerial support is essential to move decentralization agenda forward for
           rural sanitation.
          With the right technical assistance support, districts – with the help of communes – have proven
           to obtain reasonable capacity to plan and deliver rural sanitation function in a decentralized
           model. Yet, unless financial and human resources are sufficiently transferred to district level, and
           PDRD/MRD retains a technical support role, an optimal execution of this function cannot be
           realized.
          Helping the districts to develop district-wide sanitation plans with strong participation from the
           communes has empowered the communes to tap into social service fund effectively for improving
           rural sanitation.
Sector monitoring and learning
          Lack of robust institutional support and government resources committed to operate the RWSSH
           sector MIS can jeopardize the sustainable use of the MIS.
          Introducing evidence-based behavior change communications beyond traditional health-based
           messages requires intense capacity development and mindset shift by government and
           stakeholders.
          Creating demand for evidence-based policy development has helped to embed an explicit
           knowledge agenda in the government National Action Plan.
Recommendations and Way Forward
Based on the TA results and lessons, a set of key recommendations has been generated both for action
by the Government of Cambodia and for future World Bank engagement to support the sector.
Operationalization of sector strategy and decentralization
          With the approval of the NAP, MRD may use this as an opportunity to dialogue with MEF for better
           resource allocation to support programming in RWSSH sector.
          Since the NAP was already approved, MRD could opt to strengthen the role and capacity of the
           TWG-RWSSH in closely monitoring the implementation of the NAP ensuring activities and outputs
           are achieved within the stated timeframe.
          As there are many sector stakeholders in the RWSSH sector, MRD could consider the possibility
           to periodically conduct partnership assessment to take stock of the external support for the
           RWSSH sector and understand the resource commitments among sector stakeholders.
          To enhance effectiveness and impacts of sector interventions, MRD could consider develop and
           rollout the national umbrella BCC campaign for rural sanitation and hygiene based on the BCC
           Guidelines.
          MRD, in collaboration with NCDD Secretariat and MEF, may rigorously assess the adequacy of the
           budget transferred to pilot districts vis-à-vis the function transferred to them, and identify
           opportunities for increase the resource transfer during the second year of pilot implementation.
          MRD and NCDD Secretariat could jointly develop and agree on the roadmap for rolling out rural
           sanitation function transfer nationwide.

Page | 3
          Once the rural sanitation function is formally transferred to districts, NCDD Secretariat, in
           collaboration with MRD, could implement an at-scale capacity development program for districts
           on rural sanitation service delivery to support the function transfer.
Sector monitoring and learning
          MRD may consider establishing M&E unit for RWSSH within the DRHC and/or DRWS with clear
           institutional roles and responsibilities in managing RWSSH MIS.
          As sector progresses, MRD could consider conducting annual joint sector review to take stock of
           the lessons and emerging learning from the NAP implementation with the view of adjusting the
           NAP on annual basis.
          In the medium term, once the MIS is functional, MRD could consider establishing a reliable
           benchmarking system to monitor the sanitation progress at district level.
The following are suggestions for the World Bank to maintain and deepen strategic engagement in the
RWSSH sector:
          Continue to support MRD and TWG-RWSSH capacity in implementation and monitoring of the
           NAP.
          In the immediate term, support the continuation of the current rural sanitation decentralized
           service delivery pilot to gather additional evidence and foster stronger political support.
          Support the government in implementing the agreed roadmap, including the preparations of
           necessary legal documents and manuals.
          Integrating the rural water supply and sanitation in Disaster Risk Management Project (P149149),
           Livelihood Enhancement and Association Project (P153591) and Social Accountability Project.
Longer-term engagement under the World Bank future Country Partnership Framework is expected in the
next two-years, and may lead to a multi-sectoral IDA operation, for example to support nutrition and
RWSSH.

1. Introduction
This report provides the synthesis of the results, experiences and lessons learnt from the implementation
of the Technical Assistance (TA) “Cambodia Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Improvement
Support (P132212)” carried out by the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program of the Water Global
Practice (WSP) from May 2013 to June 2016.4 Based on the lessons learnt, it also provides recommended
actions and pathways for the Government of Cambodia, particularly the Ministry of Rural Development
(MRD), to accelerate water supply and sanitation service delivery at scale.
Although the TA addresses broad sector issues pertaining to both rural water supply and sanitation, the
TA mostly focused on the rural sanitation sub-sector, which progress has been far from reaching the
Millennium Development Goals (MDG).5 Specifically for rural sanitation, the TA was developed based on
WSP’s Global Theory of Change, which has been tested and implemented in over 16 countries worldwide,
tailored to the Cambodia context. It promotes a sanitation programmatic approach at-scale that connects
strengthening local supply chains with behavior change and demand creation for sanitation, while
improving the enabling environment. Figure 1 below illustrates WSP’s Theory of Change for rural
sanitation in Cambodia.

  Based on the definition of the MDG, Cambodia should have reached a rural sanitation target of 53% by 2015. The government has adopted a
lower target for the country whereby by 2015, 30% of rural population should gain access to sanitation.

While another TA P132201 (already closed in May 2015) explicitly addresses the strengthening of the local
private sector to facilitate market-based service delivery as well as demand creation for sanitation
products and services, this TA specifically supports the strengthening of the enabling environment. This
report therefore sets out key lessons and achievements and highlights the various deliverables produced
as a result of a close engagement with the government during the TA implementation over the past three
years.
2. Background and Context
2.1. Sector Context and Progress
Over the past two decades, Cambodia has made significant progress on improving access to water and
sanitation in rural areas, albeit from a very low base. According to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring
Programme (JMP), access to water supply and sanitation in rural areas has improved respectively from
38% and 10% in 2000 to 69% and 30% in 2015.6 While the increase in rural access to improved water
supply since 1995 was in itself remarkable, with an annual increase rate of 3.1% per year up to 2010, it
slowed down over the past five years to 2.1%. The reverse is true for rural sanitation which has observed
accelerated progress over the past five years between 2010 and 2015.7 The annual increase rate of gaining
access to rural sanitation during this five-year period nearly doubles the rate before 2010. Before 2010,
the annual increase rate for rural sanitation was around 1.2%, while after 2010, the rate is at 2% per year.
Figure 2 below shows the progress in coverage for rural water supply and sanitation between 1995 and
2015.

Despite this progress, the country’s rural water and sanitation coverage remains the lowest in the South
East Asian region. As of 2015, approximately one third of the rural population, equivalent to 3.8 million
people, are relying on unimproved water sources for their daily consumption; and 60%, or around 7.4
million people still practice open defecation in rural areas.8 With over three quarters of Cambodians living
in rural areas, and considering that rural areas are home to more than 90% of Cambodia’s poor,9 lack of
access to improved water and sanitation takes a high toll on the health and nutritional status, dignity and
well-being. Such conditions limit the overall economic opportunities for rural households, trapping them
in the poverty cycle leading to trans-generational poverty. Various studies in Cambodia suggest that lack
of access to improved water and sanitation does have impacts on the economy10 and is strongly associated

The government institution responsible for rural water supply and sanitation is the Ministry of Rural
         Sour
Development (MRD), through the Department of Rural Health Care (DRHC) for rural sanitation promotion
and the Department of Rural Water Supply (DRWS) for rural water supply. The latter is related to the
community-based, non-commercial rural water supply schemes.
The Government of Cambodia envisions that by 2025, everyone in rural areas lives in communities with
universal access to water supply and sanitation.13 With the pace of progress that the sector has achieved
to date, realizing the 2025 vision remains a huge challenge, especially for rural sanitation. If rural
sanitation progress is maintained at the rate of post-2010 (2% a year), universal access will only be
achieved by 2050, which is far beyond the government target as well as the Sustainable Development
Goal (SDG) that set universal access as a target by 2030. To meet the government target, the progress
needs to be accelerated by 3.5 times the post-2010 rate, requiring concerted efforts by government to
formulate and implement a medium- and long-term strategy and concrete action plan with support of
development partners. The focus would need to be on accelerating the service delivery to the unserved
population including the poor and vulnerable groups, and building institutional capacity to sustain the
service provision.
Acknowledging the challenges in rural sanitation, the government and sector stakeholders have made
some progress on key enabling environment indicators paving the way for effective implementation of
rural sanitation at scale. Table 1 provides a snapshot of the progress,14 during the course of the
implementation of the TA between 2013 and 2015. In 2013, the enabling environment was weak, due to
lack of a clear implementation strategy, sub-optimal institutional arrangement, low implementation

It is observed that during 2013-2015 some enabling environment areas for rural sanitation have made
good progress, thus moving the status of some indicators from “red” to “green”, indicating positive
changes in the sector over past years. However, it is important to note that although some indicators are
marked “green”, that does not necessarily mean that the indicators are fully achieved: some of the
indicators have had satisfactory improvement that gives strong indication that the indicators are
progressing well toward full achievement. Progress in some of the key areas during 2013-2015 is
highlighted below.
Traditionally, DRHC has had limited budget for rural sanitation activities which is marginal compared to
what is needed. In 2015, however, the budget for the DRHC significantly increased by 75% compared to
2014, which was substantial compared to the increases in the past years. More importantly, DRHC has
become a budget entity in 2015 whereby the department can formulate their budget based on a program-
based budgeting framework. Such development would give more flexibility to DRHC on the way the
budget is to be spent on the rural sanitation program, which used to be hardcoded for hardware support
interventions.
There has also been good progress in terms of capacity at the national level in relation to delivering rural
sanitation. Although some challenges may remain, DRHC has accumulated understanding, knowledge and
experience on the overall management and planning of the sector, the need to bring all the approaches
together and the significance of the decentralization agenda in the sector. What is also important is the
improvement of capacity within the National Committee for subnational Democratic Development
(NCDD) Secretariat in understanding rural sanitation service delivery. Such understanding and
commitment has led to the pilot for the decentralization of rural sanitation function in the first place.
Another important development was that the linkage between sanitation and nutrition has been well
recognized both at policy and operational level. The Council for Agriculture and Rural Development
(CARD) which is tasked with a policy role on nutrition has recognized water and sanitation as a key
contributor to improved nutrition. At the policy level, the National Strategy for Food Security and Nutrition
issued in 2014 explicitly includes water and sanitation as one of the priority actions. In addition, the
technical group tasked to facilitate collaboration among the two subsectors was established so that
practical guidance can be developed to guide implementation in the future. At the operational level, some
nutrition projects have included water and sanitation as part of the design. For example, the USAID-
supported NOURISH project in 20 districts in three provinces has included large sanitation interventions
in their program. Impact evaluation for the effectiveness of such integration is planned to be conducted
to see how much sanitation improvement has a role in improving the nutrition status within the
intervention areas.
Although it is difficult to quantify, such improvement could potentially facilitate the service delivery on
the ground. This TA has helped – alongside other development partners – support the government in
realizing the positive changes in the enabling environment over the past years.
2.2. Rationale of the TA
As mentioned earlier, although showing good progress, access to water supply and sanitation in rural
Cambodia remains the lowest in the region and the progress of rural sanitation has been seriously off-
track to reach the MDG and sector vision. A partner mapping exercise conducted by the MRD in 2013,16
with support of this TA, showed that there are many partners and NGOs working with the government to
support the delivery of rural water supply and sanitation. However, most of them are largely involved in
direct service delivery with varying – and sometimes limited – degree of coordination and collaboration
with government authorities, resulting unintentionally in fragmentation and lack of harmonized service

delivery approaches. Few partners, such as UNICEF, WHO, WaterAid, together with WSP, have been
addressing upstream bottlenecks in the broader enabling environment and focusing on the strengthening
of government institutions to facilitate sustainable service delivery at scale.
Based on WSP’s global experience on scaling up rural sanitation,17 support to the sector in strengthening
the enabling environment is key for achieving scale and sustainability. As indicated in Table 1, this
encompasses the following dimensions: (i) policy, strategy, and direction, (ii) institutional arrangements,
(iii) program methodology, (iv) implementation capacity, (v) availability of products and services, (vi)
financing incentives, (vii) cost-effective implementation, and (viii) monitoring and evaluation.
In this regard, this TA has filled a critical gap, where at national level the focus was on strengthening overall
sector management, planning, policy development, and capacity building in results monitoring for rural
water supply and sanitation. At sub-national level, the TA supported institutional change through building
local governments’ capacity in rural sanitation service delivery in line with the decentralization reform.
3. Technical Assistance Overview and Results
3.1. Objective
The development objective of this TA was to increase the capacity of the Government of Cambodia to
lead, coordinate, and mobilize resources for developing and sustaining poor-inclusive rural water supply
and sanitation services. It aimed to accelerate sustainable and equitable access to rural water supply and
sanitation through sector reforms that improve the enabling environment for at-scale implementation,
with a specific focus on rural sanitation service delivery at sub-national level.
The activities identified in the TA included strategic engagement with the government at national and sub-
national level, which are necessary to achieve the development objective of the TA. While capacity
building is embedded in the government sector strategy, the support at national level to implement the
strategy has been an important impetus for delivering capacity building at scale. At the sub-national level,
the TA has focused on building capacity of district administration to lead the sanitation agenda at the
district level where they can plan, implement and monitor rural sanitation. In addition, the TA also
supported the government in strengthening the learning agenda of the sector.
The TA was organized in two main pillars,18 to respond to specific sector roadblocks identified in Table 1
above and to align with the priorities set forward by the Technical Working Group of the Rural Water
Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (TWG-RWSSH).19 The two pillars of the TA along with corresponding
intermediate outcomes are as follows:
     i.   Support the government capacity to operationalize the sector strategy and decentralization
          Intermediate Outcomes:
           IO 1: Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy effectively implemented
           IO 2: Sub-national government capacity in implementing rural sanitation at scale strengthened
     ii. Support the government capacity in sector monitoring and learning
         Intermediate Outcomes:
          IO 3: Government’s capacity to monitor and evaluate the rural water supply and sanitation
             sector strengthened
          IO 4: Knowledge of at scale program implementation deepened

   The Project Concept Note consists of four components under this TA, but for the simplicity in this final report, these four components are
classified in two main pillars.
19
   The TWG-RWSSH is the main coordinating body, chaired by the Minister of Rural Development with participation from different ministries
including Ministry of Economy and Finance and Ministry of Interior as well as various development partners. Its role is to help coordinate
development partner contributions with the Government of Cambodia priorities and ensure better harmonization and alignment.

Although the TA covered rural water supply and sanitation, the support to rural water supply was marginal
and indirect, largely through IO 1 and IO 3. More direct and predominant support was provided to rural
sanitation, which was classified as a sub-sector that had been off-track in reaching the MDG and where
more supports were needed.
3.2. Summary of TA Results
After three years of implementation, the TA achieved substantial progress for most intended intermediate
outcomes and the expected target indicators. Table 2 shows the summary of results achieved over the
course of TA implementation, which are discussed in more details in Section 3.3.

3.3. Key activities and results achieved under the TA
Over the three-year implementation period, various activities were conducted in close collaboration with
DRHC and DRWS, with the strategic guidance provided by the TWG-RWSSH in order to meet the objectives
of the TA. On the third component of the TA, WSP supported not only MRD but also the NCDD and the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to help pilot the decentralization of the rural sanitation function.
The implementation process was guided by the following principles:
          To focus on technical and upstream support rather than direct implementation, fostering
           systematic institutional change;
          To work with, and add value to, government systems and, along the process strengthen
           government ownership and capacities to improve sector management; and
          To undertake research of strategic and policy relevance, facilitate knowledge exchange and pilots
           to address specific priority needs and inform sector reform.
The TA engaged experienced international and local consultants as well as an NGO, SNV Netherlands
Development Organization, to deliver the various activities in the TA. Guided by the principles listed
above, Figure 4 shows the sequence of TA activities and key milestones, while the subsequent sub-
sections provide highlights of the key activities, milestones and results achieved.

The following section provides detailed activities implemented under the TA, structured around the two
pillars of the TA mentioned above.
Pillar 1: Support the Government Capacity to Operationalize the Sector Strategy and Decentralization
3.3.1. Conducting Sector Partner Mapping
In 2013, as per the TWG-RWSSH workplan, a partner mapping survey was conducted to better understand
the stakeholder landscape in the sector including the areas of partner support and the resources flowing
into the sector.
The survey showed that over the period of 2009-2015, USD103 million were committed to the RWSSH
sector by 48 partner organizations, a significant amount that can make a huge difference if well-
coordinated. The partner mapping exercise also indicated the concentration of partner organizations
across the country, with a high density of partner organizations found around the Tonle Sap plain areas.
The presence of partners does not always match with the service gaps in the country, especially for areas
which are remote and challenging. Figure 5 shows the concentration of RWSSH partner organizations
based on the survey. This exercise does not only provide an opportunity for the government to improve
coordination mechanisms, but also helps all RWSSH partners to proactively adjust their strategy and
program according to the identified gaps.
More importantly, this exercise has also led to a stronger commitment to develop a joint national action
plan which all partners would contribute to. The key results of the partner mapping survey are in Annex
1, and the full report is in the resource pack.

3.3.2. Raising Profile and Dissemination of the National Strategy for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and
Hygiene
In 2003, the Government of Cambodia issued the National Water Supply and Sanitation policy, setting the
vision of universal coverage in rural areas by 2025 and laying out general principles that would steer the
sector towards achieving the vision. Despite the issuance of the policy, implementation of rural water
supply and sanitation has not been properly guided leading to sub-optimal coordination, a variety in
delivery models and approaches – sometimes even contradicting each other – and inefficiencies in terms
of resource utilization and limited domestic resource mobilization. This has likely contributed to the slow
progress in rural sanitation access in the decade from 2000 to 2010 as shown in Figure 2. While rural
access has improved relatively fast recently due to several large-scale donor investment programs and
support from NGOs, challenges are arising in how to sustain and expand those services, with adequate
institutional structures.
Recognizing these challenges, in 2011, MRD developed the National Strategy for Rural Water Supply,
Sanitation and Hygiene 2011-2025, hereinafter referred to as “RWSSH Strategy”, to set the direction for
the implementation of the national policy, the medium-term and long-term objectives and articulate
components to achieve the 2025 vision. The RWSSH Strategy is organized around five pillars:
     i.     Increase access to sustainable improved water supply
     ii.    Increase access to improved sanitation
     iii.   Improve hygiene behavior related to water and sanitation
     iv.    Strengthen institutional capacity and arrangement to improve sector management
     v.     Improve sector financing for capital costs and recurrent cost.
Elevating the Strategy to a National Strategic Plan with broad Government Endorsement
Since the RWSSH Strategy was approved at ministerial level, its influence and applicability are limited to
MRD and its provincial line agencies. Given the cross-cutting nature of water and sanitation with other
sectors, concerted efforts from different ministries and sub-national governments are required.
Therefore, elevating the strategy to a Government of Cambodia Strategic Plan could better facilitate cross-
sectoral collaboration and align all government agencies toward a common vision for rural water supply
and sanitation.
In January 2014, the National Strategic Plan for RWSSH 2014-2025 was approved by the Government of
Cambodia, the Council of Ministers (COM),20 making RWSSH a priority agenda for the development of the
country. This high-level endorsement could potentially support MRD in facilitating cross-ministerial
collaboration, working with the sub-national level of government and mobilizing resources for achieving
the sector vision. The TA prepared technical inputs for the National Strategic Plan, which can be found in
the TA resource pack. Figure 6 provides an overview of the evolvement of the RWSSH sector strategic
framework up to now.
Disseminating the national strategy for RWSSH to the sub-national level for bottom-up support
Aside from raising the visibility of RWSSH within the high-level government to gain political support, the,
the RWSSH Strategy was widely disseminated to all the provinces including relevant departments,21
districts and communes to build a shared vision for the RWSSH sector. The TA, in partnership with UNICEF,
conducted a series of interactive learning workshops between February and April 2013 to disseminate the
RWSSH Strategy in the provinces with the objective for all stakeholders to be made aware and informed

principles, and the relevant roles and responsibilities.22

The workshops were conducted in five regions covering all 25 provinces in Cambodia, with over 300
participants using an interactive approach to facilitate in-depth discussions among participants to enrich
their understanding of the RWSSH Strategy.
The workshops allowed the participants to collectively compare the direction, approaches and principles
set out in the RWSSH Strategy to their local context and current practices, so as to reflect the new
directions in their future provincial, district and commune planning. Such understanding is crucial to form
bottom-up support that would lead to successful implementation of the Strategy in the long run. It also
helps the Provincial Department of Rural Development (PDRD) to coordinate with sector partners in
respective provinces to optimize the use of limited resource, which was important given the
fragmentation in the sector.23
3.3.3. Formulating RWSSH Sector Medium-Term Action Plan and Results Framework
To operationalize the National Strategic Plan for RWSSH 2014-2025 the government needs a medium-
term action plan with realistic activities, outputs, clear timeline, resource envelope and results
framework. The TA supported MRD to develop the National Action Plan for RWSSH 2014-2018 (NAP) to
align with the timeframe of the government’s umbrella National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018.24
The overall purpose of the NAP is three-fold:

           To put into implementation the key priorities identified in the National Strategic Plan with clear
            roles and responsibilities of government at national level and sub-national level;25
           To align resource of various development partners and NGOs to support the RWSSH sector under
            the leadership of the government; and
           To harmonize the implementation approaches by different partners and NGOs to ensure they are
            complementing each other and supporting the government to reach the targets faster.
Shaping sector focus and aligning priority through agreed results framework
The NAP aims to achieve 60% access to water supply, sanitation and hygiene26 in rural areas by 2018, a
stretch target for rural sanitation while for rural water the target seems more modest27, recognizing the
need to ensure sustainability of existing service levels. With these targets, the NAP provides a roadmap
for the RWSSH sector including specific priority actions, annual outputs and resource requirements using
a defined results framework. Its focus is on accelerating service delivery to keep the access on track
toward achieving universal coverage, strengthening institution to sustain the RWSSH service over the long
run and learning from implementation for future improvement. Figure 7 shows the RWSSH results chain
used in the formulation of the NAP. Annex 2 provides the executive summary of the draft NAP, and the
approved NAP can be found in the TA resource pack.
With support of the TA, the process of formulation of the NAP was carefully discussed and designed to
ensure the process is participatory, transparent and strategic. With the guidance of the TWG-RWSSH, the
following steps have been undertaken starting July 2014 to formulate the NAP:
           Agreement on approach and process: MRD and key sector stakeholders met at the national level
            and built consensus on how to formulate the NAP.
           Strategic priority setting: MRD and stakeholders discussed and agreed upon the highest-priority
            actions and outcomes for the RWSSH sector for 2014-2018 (based upon the National Strategic
            Plan), providing the foundation upon which the NAP was built.
           Formulating the ‘Results Framework’: Priority actions were used to establish the high-level
            outcomes and results framework for the NAP.
           Developing key elements of the NAP: Using the results framework, MRD and its key partners
            drafted a detailed set of activities, outputs, estimated costs, and responsible agencies for the NAP.
           Developing Provincial Action Plans: As part of this process, Provincial Action Plans (PAPs) were
            developed by each PDRD, along with their key development partners and sector stakeholders, in
            a series of over 20 workshops held in provincial locations.
           National Consolidation Workshop: A consultation workshop was held with all 25 PDRDs, MRD,
            and key development partners to review results of the PAP process and to incorporate its key
            findings into the NAP.
           Review and finalizing the NAP: The NAP elements were updated following the consultation
            workshop with the provinces and the TWG-RWSSH, and then finalized.


25
   With the caveat that the decentralization process is evolving; formal function transfer for rural sanitation promotion, as well as for O&M of
rural water supplies is expected to take place by July 2017
26
   According to the NAP, hygiene targets contain two key behaviors, handwashing with soap and using appropriate water treatment methods at
home. The targets are 60% for the former (self-reported behavior), and 80% for the latter.
27
   The targets set in the NAP were based on the baseline figure from national data where rural sanitation access is 40.9% while water supply
access is 46.6% in 2013 (Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey). These figures are different from that generated by the JMP where, in 2015, rural
sanitation access is 30% and rural water access is 69%.

                    The NAP is designed with a strong emphasis on monitoring, evaluation and learning. It requires annual
                    reviews to identify lessons learned, to revise and optimize the plan accordingly. The intention is to make
                    the NAP a ‘living document’ which responds to the situation on the ground – learning from both successes
                    and failures, and seeking to continuously improve performance. The NAP was finally approved by the MRD
                    in April 2016. Although this approval is a key milestone, it is also important to note that while the NAP
                    was meant to shape sector focus and align the sector priorities among stakeholders, some of the activities
                    in the NAP were taking place prior to the NAP approval.

                    With the defined priorities and activities, the NAP estimates that public funding required for the RWSSH
                    sector to reach 60% by 2018 is USD 88.9 million between 2014 and 2018. Figure 8 shows the breakdown
                    of the public funding required to reach the 2018 outcomes. Delivering water supply service to rural
                    households account for about 64% of the total required funding as the investment is largely expected to
                    be sourced from public financing. For sanitation, however, the required funding is 29% of the total costs
                    which is expected to be spent on improving the enabling environment in creating household demand,
                    strengthening the supply chain, targeted support to the poor and vulnerable groups, and construction of

Historically, the sector has relied on external support given the minimal government budget for RWSSH28
as highlighted in Section 3.3.1 above. With huge resources needed for the NAP and the many stakeholders
involved in the RWSSH, it is expected that development partners and implementing partners such as NGOs
will be heavily engaged in delivering the NAP activities, yet under strong government coordination,
leadership, as well as executing roles. Although domestic government budget has gradually increased over
the past years, starting from a very low base, resources from RWSSH partners will likely remain a
significant source of funding at least over the medium-term.
The TA is currently supporting MRD in conducting a second round of partnership mapping to understand
the contributions and future resource allocation of key actors in the sector. Such exercise will help the
government and implementing partners to prioritize and harmonize the implementation strategy, and
optimize the use of resources towards achieving the common goals stated in the NAP.
Aligning provincial plans for RWSSH with national priorities
One important element in the process of formulating the NAP was the development of the Provincial
Action Plans (PAP) for all the 25 provinces based on strategic priorities identified in the NAP. In close
collaboration with UNICEF and GSF,29 through the provincial coordinators financed by UNICEF, GSF, and
the Stone Family Foundation the TA has provided technical inputs to PDRDs in formulating the PAP for
RWSSH in their respective provinces.
As the service coverage and context differs from one province to another, a customized plan for each
province is needed. The NAP results framework thus provides the framework and direction for the
provinces to come up with their own plans to address the specific challenges they are facing, while at the
same time contributing to the national-level results. To achieve the latter, the TA has supported MRD in
consolidating and aligning the 25 PAPs with the NAP to optimize the consistency among them. In the same
way as the NAP, the PAPs also provide detailed baseline, targets, priorities and costs for the respective

province and they function as medium-term plans to achieve provincial water and sanitation outcomes.
The PAPs are expected to help empower PDRDs and to facilitate the province level coordination effort in
RWSSH sector towards a common vision. Similarly to the NAP formulation process, the development of
the PAPs followed a participatory approach with strong participation by relevant provincial stakeholders
including provincial municipality (governor’s office), other line provincial departments, NGOs, and local
government at district and commune level.
PDRDs proposed to develop “provincial profiles for RWSSH”, a summary of the PAP for each province,
containing key information on the provincial context, water and sanitation information, priority actions,
supporting agencies and budget. The provincial profiles would be tools for PDRDs to promote the PAPs to
the provincial government to raise the RWSSH sector profile and to implementing agencies to ease
resource mobilization and coordination. The TA also provided support in the development of the
provincial profiles using information and data from the PAPs. An example of provincial profile is provided
in Annex 3. All 25 provincial profiles have been developed and are ready for the official launching of the
NAP and the PAPs planned for mid-2016 by MRD.
3.3.4. Consolidating Behavior Change Communications through National Guidelines
With sector progress, the demand for stronger government ownership and leadership increases,
especially in a context where many stakeholders are involved in the implementation. The National
Strategic Plan and the NAP point out the importance of Behavior Change Communications (BCC) as part
of the delivery of water supply, sanitation and hygiene services, if sustainable change is to be achieved.
Yet, an overarching guidance on how to develop and deliver a BCC campaign at scale was not available.
Although in 2012 MRD issued hygiene promotion guidelines,30 these guidelines mainly focus on awareness
raising around three key behaviors: (i) ceasing open defecation and adopting a household latrine, (ii)
handwashing with soap at critical times, and (iii) consistent consumption of treated household water.
According to the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey conducted in 2010, people’s knowledge
about sanitation and hygiene is relatively high,31 while actual practice of hygienic behaviors is low.
According to the 2010 survey, the practice of open defecation in rural areas was 70%, reported
handwashing with soap after defecation was as low as 57%, whereas the rate of always treating water
before consumption was only at 65%.32 Given the well documented respondent bias that actual behaviors
is lower than reported behaviors, the KAP survey results suggest that the proportion of rural people
practicing unhygienic behavior is alarming. This requires a different approach to addressing sanitation and
hygiene behavior through better understanding of the drivers and barriers for households to change
behaviors.
In response, a number of partner organizations such as Lien Aid, WaterSHED, SNV, iDE, WSP and others
have conducted formative research and studies on drivers and barriers for uptake of sanitation and
hygiene behavior among the rural population. Various tools, materials and campaigns were developed as
a result for use in their respective areas, which were shared among implementing partners. However,
parallel efforts have also been undertaken by other sector partners, sometimes leading to duplication or
even contradicting messages, resulting in sub-optimal impact of the BCC interventions. Recognizing the
plethora of BCC approaches and the shortcomings of traditional awareness raising through health-
motivated messaging, MRD expressed strong interest in harmonizing evidence-based BCC efforts so that
a comprehensive national umbrella campaign can be developed to increase impact.

To respond to this need, the TA supported MRD in developing the National Guidelines for Behavior Change
Communications for Rural Sanitation and Hygiene in Cambodia, hereinafter referred to as BCC Guidelines.
The BCC guidelines are based on evidence and experience from past implementation in Cambodia. An
executive summary of the BCC Guidelines is provided in Annex 4.
Consolidating sector BCC experiences and knowledge to make the guidelines as evidence-based as possible
The BCC Guidelines use three key behaviors proposed in the Implementation Guidelines on Hygiene
Promotion, to ensure relevance and consistency with the National Strategic Plan and the NAP. In addition,
the TA introduced state-of-the-art methodology to the formulation of the BCC Guidelines using
SaniFOAM33 and FOAM34 framework in analyzing the determinants pertaining to drivers and barriers for
adopting these three sanitation and hygiene behaviors.
Drawing from findings, lessons and knowledge from various studies and implementation experiences in
Cambodia, behavioral determinants were identified and communication objectives were formulated
accordingly. The communication objectives are the backbone of the guidelines and guide the
development of messages in the BCC campaign, and are based on the drivers and barriers for the adoption
of a certain behavior.35 Five behavioral determinants were identified related to stopping open defecation
and adopting a latrine. Those determinants include social norms, values, physical and social drivers,
attitudes and knowledge. For behavior related to handwashing with soap, five determinants were also
identified: knowledge, intention, access, outcome expectations, and social norms
Box 1 provides an example of the communication objectives for sanitation behavior related to the toilet
adoption and stopping open defecation. The details can be found in the actual BCC Guidelines available
in the TA resource pack.
        Box 1: Communication Objectives Related to Ceasing Open Defecation and Adopting a Latrine
     For household decision makers:
     Following the campaign(s), heads of households and their spouses living in rural Cambodia will:
        i.    Feel that they are one of the few families left that do not own a latrine (social norms);
       ii.    Feel that their family will lose face/status if they do not have a latrine (social driver);
      iii.    Feel that they can no longer wait; installing any type of latrine now can still provide convenience, safety and pride
              (attitude, physical drivers);
      iv.     Believe that investing in a latrine is a way to show that they are taking care of their family (values);
       v.     Know the actual price of a pour-flush latrine (knowledge/ perceived affordability).


Gaining sector stakeholders buy-in to develop an umbrella campaign
The TA has organized capacity building events for relevant staff of MRD as well as sector stakeholders to
foster an in-depth understanding of the guidelines and in planning for the umbrella BCC campaign. As a
result, GSF has committed support to MRD to develop the national BCC campaign for sanitation and
hygiene. At the same time, WHO is conducting further studies on identifying determinants related to
consumption of treated household water to fill in the knowledge gaps identified in the BCC Guidelines.
Such collective efforts by sector stakeholders are expected to lead to an umbrella BCC campaign in the
near future that optimizes the use of resource, maximize impacts on behavior change and enable
collective learning.

   It is important to note that BCC alone is insufficient to ensure adoption of certain behaviors. For using an improved toilet, for example, supply-
chain constraints and financing mechanisms are equally important.

3.3.5. Piloting a Decentralized Service Delivery Model for Rural Sanitation
The government’s reform agenda on decentralization calls for strengthening the mandate of the district
level in service delivery to improve responsiveness, quality and access to services for its citizens. According
to the three-year Implementation Plan of the National Program for Sub-National Democratic
Development (IP3),36 sector ministries were requested to review and consider transferring relevant
functions to the districts. MRD, with the support of Asian Development Bank (ADB) and NCDD Secretariat,
conducted a review of all the functions37 to determine what functions could be feasibly transferred to
districts. Delivering rural sanitation service and managing operation and maintenance (O&M) of water
supply at post construction stage are the priority functions that MRD has put forward to transfer to
districts. MRD’s functional review report also suggests careful consideration during the process of function
transfer through conducting a pilot and relevant capacity building for districts.
To support MRD and NCDD Secretariat in the function transfer process for rural sanitation, the TA
provided assistance to pilot rural sanitation function transfer to the district level, so that experience and
learning could inform the strategy for roll-out of the function transfer nationwide. Similar support has
been provided separately by ADB technical assistance to pilot the decentralization of water supply O&M
function in seven districts of two provinces.
Getting political buy-in through strategic knowledge exchange
Although the decentralized service delivery model for sanitation is part of the government reform agenda,
strong political support from senior staff of the MRD and NCDD Secretariat was needed. To this end, a
high-level knowledge exchange visit was organized for Cambodian officials to Bangladesh in April 2014.
The aim was to learn about the Bangladeshi decentralized service delivery model for rural sanitation and
how this has contributed to Bangladesh’s remarkable success in reducing open defecation in rural areas.
The learning experience, led by Under-Secretary of State of MRD, helped to establish a joint understanding
and agreement to move forward with a function transfer pilot. A two-year pilot was agreed (from July
2015 to July 2017), and was formally launched in July 2015. The report of the knowledge exchange visit
by the Cambodian delegates to Bangladesh is available in the resource pack.
Implementing the pilot based on an agreed strategy
A document that outlines the strategy for the pilot was produced and endorsed by the MRD and NCDD
Secretariat, which formed the basis for the pilot implementation. One of the important aspects in this
reform agenda is the emphasis on mandating the districts in planning, coordinating and implementing
rural sanitation activities, in collaboration with the communes. The transfer means that districts – which
previously played minor supportive roles in rural sanitation – would take on a leading role in sanitation
service delivery, so that clearer accountability mechanism can be established between citizens and the
local government as service provider. MRD, on the other hand, would maintain its role in the development
of sector policy and implementation guidelines, while the PDRD assumes a technical support role to the
districts in performing its rural sanitation function.
With inputs from the MRD and NCDD Secretariat as well as other stakeholders, key roles and
responsibilities of the district and other agencies were clarified in the context of decentralized service
delivery for rural sanitation. Box 2 provides the identified roles that each level of government would
perform when the sanitation function is transferred. The pilot design document is also provided in the
resource pack.

Based on the strategy laid out in the design document, the TA supported the pilot implementation
between February 2015 and June 2016, in ten districts38 across two provinces, Kampong Speu and Thbong
Khmum. The pilot districts cover around 243,500 households including 177,000 households without a
toilet. The districts were selected based on a set of criteria with considerations of sanitation coverage,
poverty, availability of sanitation supply chain, and commitments from the districts. The purpose of the
pilot is to understand the district capability in absorbing the rural sanitation function, to assess the
capacity building needs of the district, to understand opportunities and bottlenecks for the sanitation
function to be performed effectively, and to develop a strategic roadmap for rolling the function transfer
out nationwide.

The ten pilot districts formally signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with MRD/DRHC on July
27, 2015. This MOU forms a legal basis for the function and resources to be transferred by MRD during
the pilot duration from July 2015 to July 2017. It also includes the establishment of a new fund flow
channel set up by MEF, for fund transfer from MRD to the districts. For 2015, the commitment fund
transfer has been limited, at only USD 365 for each of the ten districts, but is expected to be increased for
2016 and 2017. Enclosed with the MOU, operational guidelines for the pilot districts were also prepared
to serve as guidance for the pilot districts in implementing the transferred functions.
The pilot is being implemented under the leadership of a Joint Technical Working Group (JTWG) that
consists of MRD, NCDD Secretariat, and MEF. Chaired by the Deputy Director General for Administration
and Finance of MRD, the primary tasks of this JTWG are to guide, facilitate, and carry out M&E as well as
gather lessons and experiences from this pilot for further decision-making on the rural sanitation function
and resource transfer.
Continuously generating results from the pilot
The pilot was implemented by a resource agency, SNV Netherlands Development Organization, to
strengthen the capacity of district and commune in planning, budgeting and facilitating sanitation
implementation activities. During the course of the pilot, 105 focal persons from Commune Committee
for Women and Children (CCWC) and 28 district staff from the Planning and Commune Support office,
District Committee for Women and Children, a Chairperson of District Sanitation Committee39 were
trained and coached in both management and technical skills. As a result, CWCCs have conducted BCC
sessions in their communes’ priority villages, at least once per village, using communes’ own budget.
Under the leadership of the district administration, communes have developed commune sanitation plans
using social service budget, and each commune has allocated a budget of around USD 500 per year to
carry out sanitation activities in their respective commune. Early results from the pilot show that all the
communes across the ten pilot districts have conducted BCC activities in 525 villages by the end of
December 2015, resulting in 2,333 latrines sold to rural households by local latrine suppliers within two
months, i.e. November and December 2015. This latrine sales represents an increase in sanitation access
of around one percentage point in the pilot districts within two months. Further data collection is ongoing
and by June 2016, detailed results will become available in terms of how sanitation access has progressed
in the ten districts during the pilot implementation, especially in reaching the poor.
After nearly one year of pilot implementation, lessons and insights are generated on the challenges and
opportunities for districts in performing the rural sanitation function. Despite a number of challenges
regarding lack of capacity and resources, districts and communes have shown strong commitment to
implement rural sanitation function, and have allocated resources in their District and Commune
Investment Plans. It appears that due to mobilizing the commune cadre as frontline workers, the transfer
of rural sanitation is one of the most efficient ways to improve service delivery on the ground, especially
for ‘last-mile’ delivery (i.e. those still to be reached).
These insights are currently used as inputs to the formulation of the strategic roadmap for the government
to scale up decentralizing rural sanitation function, which will be the key outcome of this TA. The roadmap
includes recommended actions to support policy engagement at national level, i.e. required processes
and legal instruments including the revision of operational and financial guidelines for districts, and to
support the actual roll out of the function transfer with a capacity building strategy and packages and

  District Sanitation Committee was established and led by district governor to coordinate and implement district sanitation plan. The committee
members comprise of District Governor, Administration and Finance office, Inter-sector Office and Planning and Commune Support office, District
Committee for Women and Children, and Commune Committee for Women and Children.

costing for the districts to perform the function. The roadmap that spells out strategic actions for rural
sanitation function transfer is currently under development and will be finalized in June 2016.
Disseminating lessons on function transfer beyond rural sanitation
Under the IP3, rural sanitation is only one among many other functions being transferred to the districts.
There are currently six ministries who are in the process of functional assignment to the district level
including (i) the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MOEYS), (ii) the Ministry of Health (MOH), (iii)
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), (iv) the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD),
(v) the Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA), and (vi) the Ministry of Environment (MoE). However, different
ministries are at different stages of functional assignment.
At this stage, the rural sanitation functional assignment is more advanced compared to other sectors.
Under the initiative of NCDD Secretariat, the TA has supported NCDD Secretariat to initiate a cross-sector
learning platform.40 The objective of the learning platform is to expedite and facilitate experience and
knowledge sharing across sectors to optimize the implementation of functional assignment.
The first national cross-sector learning event was held on February 25-26, 2016 with participation from
key development partners supporting the functional assignments and the ministries who are currently
transferring functions to districts. The event sought to share experiences and bottlenecks the districts face
in performing rural sanitation function. As a result, solutions were sought and collaboration among
various cross-sector partners are further built to collectively facilitate a more effective and efficient
decentralization process.
Pillar 2: Support the Government Capacity in Sector Monitoring and Learning
3.3.6. Supporting Development of a Monitoring System for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
The National Strategic Plan for RWSSH calls for a unified government-owned Management Information
System (MIS) for monitoring sector performance. In addition, the system could enhance transparency,
accountability and report on results and progress for both rural water supply and sanitation, and thus help
to steer program planning.
In conjunction with UNICEF and the GSF, it was agreed to jointly undertake this important work by sharing
the following tasks as stipulated in Table 3.
       Table 3: Sharing of Task among Partners in Supporting the Development of Monitoring System
     Tasks                                                                                          Supporting organization

     5. Scale up the system                                                                                          MRD
Conducting situation analysis of the sector M&E to understand the issues that need to be addressed
A situation analysis of current M&E practices in rural sanitation and hygiene was carried out 41, informed
by interviews with national, provincial, district and commune staff. The analysis provided in-depth
understanding of the key issues pertaining to RWSSH M&E and reviewed potential opportunities of
40
   Initiated by NCDD Secretariat, the platform is a means for sharing knowledge among sector ministries involved in function transfer. As a kick-
off, rural sanitation functional assignment was the first learning event to showcase the challenges and opportunities for other sectors working
on the same agenda.
41
   The M&E situation analysis was conducted only for rural sanitation since separate exercise was conducted for rural water supply building on
the existing WellMap database.

existing systems and initiatives that can be leveraged for system design and implementation. The full
report is available in resource pack. Key findings of the study are provided below, which are useful in
developing the M&E system.
           MRD does not have an appropriate structure up to the local level for routine primary data
            generation on rural sanitation. The data generation is mainly done by local authorities, i.e.
            communes and villages, as part of their general reporting on local development with little
            supervision or support. MRD and its provincial line agencies rely on the data generated from local
            authorities, and data checking at the local level is not practiced.
           There is no dedicated and well-resourced M&E unit for rural sanitation at the national and sub-
            national levels.
           There is sub-optimal collaboration among the ministries such Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry
            of Education Youth and Sports (MOEYS), National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning
            (MOP) and MRD in terms of M&E data and resource sharing. The sharing of data only happens on
            case-by-case basis.
           Advocacy for use of rural sanitation M&E is not happening, leading to low political visibility and
            thus low incentives for system development.
           Skills in database management are non-existent, and limited computer skills are available at
            district level and below. Local authorities and PDRDs are only familiar with paper-based reporting.
           An M&E Plan for rural sanitation does not exist and there is no feedback loop between data and
            its use for planning, steering and resource allocation.
Despite the above challenges, some opportunities such as appropriate educational background of
relevant staff at the national, provincial and district levels were also identified that could be the
foundation upon which M&E capacity can be built.
Based on these findings, a conceptual framework for rural sanitation monitoring was proposed to address
the shortcomings identified in the current practices, by optimizing the information flow and facilitating
data check at the local level. Figure 9 shows the proposed conceptual framework used for developing the
M&E system for rural sanitation.

In addition to the situation analysis for rural sanitation and hygiene, a review was conducted for the
functionality and usability of the well database (WellMap) previously developed for MRD42 with support
of WSP. The review found that while most technical information provided in the database is useful in
understanding the water quality of wells across the country, its applicability, comprehensiveness and user
friendliness for water supply planning and programming is sub-optimal. Thus, redesigning the application
to fit the need of users is required.
Based on discussions with MRD and various sector stakeholders, it was agreed to integrate water supply
and sanitation under one MIS platform, where data need to be presentable at the lowest level of
government administration, i.e. commune level. Such integration would also be in line with the priority
set out in the National Strategic Plan. The report on the review of WellMap database functionality is also
available in resource pack.
As a next step, a performance monitoring framework for the RWSSH sector was developed through a
series of broad consultative workshops. A consistency check between the performance monitoring
framework and the indicators in the NAP was conducted to ensure the MIS can feed into the monitoring
process for the results framework in the NAP. The performance monitoring framework along with the
conceptual framework presented in Figure 9 were then used for the basis of the development of the
RWSSH sector MIS supported by UNICEF. WSP has maintained a strong engagement in that process, and
the monitoring framework went through various iterations and improvements to fit with the local capacity
and the NAP. The final draft performance monitoring framework for RWSSH is provided in Annex 5.
Developing the RWSSH sector Management Information System and progress to date
Once the performance monitoring framework was agreed, which is an integral part of the system and
feature design, the process of system design could start. The MIS prototype was developed and tested.
Led by the MRD and UNICEF, WSP has provided technical inputs to the development process of the
system. The final system has a web-enabled design, accessible to its users through internet using a web
browser. It includes an online data entry interface, which allows users at district, provincial and national
level to enter and modify RWSSH M&E data. Instead of paper based reporting, an additional interface for
phone-based data collection was designed to facilitate the data entry by village and commune chiefs,
facilitating easier data reporting with a higher frequency and with reduced errors.
Although the development of MIS has made some progress, a number of issues in terms of quality and
delivery have caused delays in completion of the system development. The finalization of the MIS is
currently put on hold pending confirmation from MRD in setting up a unit that would operate and
maintain the system after the development phase. It is expected that the MIS development is completed
by 2016, and will be followed by subsequent pilot in ten provinces to be supported by GSF. For the
sustainability of the MIS, key partners including UNICEF, GSF and WSP are continuously advocating to
MRD to establish a RWSSH M&E unit with clear mandate, operational structure and minimum required
budget. Thus far, this has not yet been taken further by MRD.
3.3.7. Undertaking Strategic Research to Inform Programmatic Approach for Sanitation Interventions
Two studies have been conducted that address important knowledge gaps in the sector: (i) the link
between rural sanitation and stunting, and (ii) the effect of Output-Based Aid (OBA) subsidies and
sanitation marketing on sanitation uptake among the poor.
Understanding the link between sanitation access and stunting to foster sanitation-nutrition collaboration
In the past, the programming of sanitation intervention and nutrition intervention are often separate and
joint collaboration efforts rarely exist globally, including in Cambodia. There is a growing body of evidence

42
     www.cambodiawellmap.com

Page | 23
that suggests the link between open defecation and child stunting, due to a sub-clinical condition called
environmental enteropathy43 caused by the indigestion of feces. To advocate the importance of sanitation
in tackling undernutrition, and to foster greater cross-sector collaboration, the study was conducted to
understand such links in Cambodia.
Using the Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) 2010, the study confirmed that open
defecation does have a stake in child stunting in Cambodia. The findings confirm that open defecation has
strong negative spillovers: poor sanitation does not only affects one’s own health, it also affects the health
of one’s neighbors. More importantly, the extent of open defecation in a community is more important
for a child’s development than whether the child’s household itself openly defecates. Figure 10 illustrates
growth faltering of under-five children with increasing levels of open defecation. The research brief is
available in the resource pack.
         Figure 10: Growth faltering for children under five in households with and without a toilet for
                         different levels of open defecation in the child’s community




                              0%                20%                40%                60%               80%                100%




The research findings were presented by MRD in the government’s nutrition conference in March 2015
stimulating policy discussion around the integration between sanitation and nutrition programs. This
discussion also resulted in the establishment of a government-led working group in water, sanitation and
nutrition that would look into practical ways of integrating water and sanitation interventions and
nutrition programs. One of the tasks of this working group is to develop the guidance on water, sanitation
and nutrition integration that would be available for use in the sector.
At operational level, there have also been a number of nutrition intervention programs in the country that
include water and sanitation interventions such as the USAID-supported NOURISH project and the World
Bank’s Cash Transfer Pilot Project Focused on Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition (P132751).
Understanding the effect of subsidies and sanitation marketing on sanitation uptake among poor
households to inform the discussion on pro-poor support mechanisms
The RWSSH Strategy encourages the use of public finance to leverage household’s own investment in
sanitation through creating demand, strengthening local supply chains and supporting the enabling
environment. Given the existing inequalities in sanitation access, the RWSSH Strategy also suggests a
complementary approach to support the poorest households to help them gain access to sanitation.

Several implementing partners are utilizing sanitation hardware subsidies in various forms and
approaches with some being well targeted and some not. It has been demonstrated in both published
experiments and scaled-up delivery programs in Bangladesh that smart subsidies significantly increase the
adoption of improved sanitation among underserved populations, and moreover, that the increases can
produce spillover benefits to neighboring households that are ineligible for subsidy (Guiteras et al, 2015).
However, valid questions have been raised about the risks these subsidies may pose to demand for
latrines in geographically close markets or among those segments of the population where subsidies have
not been made available. A hypothetical scenario is that in areas where the sanitation marketing approach
has been used to develop and enhance local supply chains for sanitation goods and services, the
introduction of time-limited poor-targeted consumer rebates can dampen sales of latrines to others.
While this scenario is mostly informed through anecdotal evidence, it underpins a lively debate, globally
and in Cambodia, whether so-called smart subsidies (i.e. well targeted, partial and preferably output-
based) can be delivered without the occurrence of this dampening effect.
As part of the NAP, the government plans to develop pro-poor sanitation guidelines that would provide a
clear guidance for future programs on how to address and deliver smart subsidies to poor households
and/or communities. To support the government in this effort, WSP, in partnership with East Meets West
Foundation (EMWF), conducted a rigorous quasi-experimental study to measure the impact of subsidies
delivered through output-based aid consumer rebates, called Community Hygiene Output Based Aid
(CHOBA),44 and sanitation marketing on sanitation adoption. The study examined the interactions
between output-based aid consumer rebates45 and sanitation marketing in rural Cambodia. The objective
of this quasi-experimental research was to determine whether latrine coverage is different in villages that
implemented only consumer rebates, only sanitation marketing, or both programs, across different
income levels: the poor,46 near-poor and non-poor. The consumer rebate was USD 18-20, while the
average price of a latrine (excluding shelter) is around USD 50.
The study revealed that CHOBA (consumer rebates) is more effective than sanitation marketing in
increasing latrine coverage among the poor. Additionally, it demonstrated the synergistic effect of the
combined interventions in increasing latrine adoption among the poor. More importantly, the dampening
effect of consumer rebates on the non-poor could not be detected47. In fact, villages that implemented
both programs saw higher latrine coverage across all income levels than villages that implemented CHOBA
only or sanitation marketing only (see Figure 11).
This suggests that a well-targeted and transparently implemented partial subsidy, combined with
sanitation marketing activities, can play a major role in increasing access in rural areas and in closing the
gap between the better-off and the poor. The findings are expected to enrich the evidence for the
development of the pro-poor guidelines. The presentation of the study as well as the draft research brief 48
is available in the resource pack.

   ID Poor 1 and ID Poor 2 are the government classification of poor household through the national identification of the poor program. ID Poor
3 is not part of the government classification program, but is used by EMWF to identify addition poor households using the same government
methodology. This term ID Poor 3 is only used for the purpose of the study.
47
   This finding is in line with a recent RCT conducted in Bangladesh, where a multiplier rather than a spillover effect was found. Guiteras, R.,

4. Lessons Learned, Recommendations and Way Forward
Based on the experience of implementing the TA, a number of lessons have been learned that could be
particularly relevant for a sector that moves from a historically determined post-conflict rehabilitation
mode to a development mode, putting in place sustainable and robust institutions for service delivery.
Such shift requires mindset changes among policy makers, implementers both within and outside the
government. It also requires strong leadership from the government at national and subnational level to
coordinate and mobilize the resources for the sector to achieve its targets, and to capacitate its sub-
national agencies and local governments for last mile service delivery. The following section provides key
lessons emerging from the TA implementation and the recommendations for the sector.
4.1. Lessons Learned
4.1.1. Operationalization of Sector Strategy and Decentralization
Engaging sub-national stakeholders in an interactive learning experience on the new service delivery
approaches in the RWSSH Strategy maximizes ownership.
The RWSSH Strategy emphasizes certain key principles including the focus on sustainability, demand-
responsive approach to service delivery, cost-sharing principles for investments and maintenance of water
supply schemes, sustained behavior change at household level, and decentralization of functions for
RWSSH. While most PDRD staff are used to conducting a traditional top-down approach to deliver RWSSH,
introducing new approaches requires intensive and interactive learning and reflection to generate
understanding and ownership of the RWSSH Strategy. The dissemination process of the RWSSH Strategy
went beyond the traditional way of one-way communication but engaged participants on underlying
reason and evidence behind the proposed new approaches. This has proved to be a most important first
step for the successful implementation of the strategy and later the PAP development. Feedback from
the learning workshops indicated that sub-national participants require continued advice and capacity
building to support implementation at the local level.

Elevating the political profile of the RWSSH sector along with a medium-term National Action Plan can
facilitate resource mobilization by the government, both from domestic sources as well as grants and loans
from development partners.
The water and sanitation sector in general has historically received little attention, and thus has often not
been on the development priority list. In 2009, the total sector budget, including external donor financing
for urban and rural sectors, was only 0.2% of the total public expenditure budget, while a benchmark is
internationally assumed to be in the order of 4%-10% in many developing countries.49 Estimated average
annual investment financing over the period 2011-2012 for rural water supply was only USD9 million
annually, of which 90% by external development partners.50 According to MRD’s report,51 the government
domestic expenditure52 for rural sanitation through DRHC has been USD 333,250 in 2014 and USD 583,250
in 2015; and for rural water supply through DRWS USD 922,750 in 2014 and USD 1,173,000 in 2015 – i.e.,
minimal compared to sector needs.53
MRD’s issuance of the RWSSH Strategy and the subsequent approval of the National Strategic Plan for
RWSSH 2014-25 by the Government of Cambodia has helped raise the RWSSH sector profile, although not
yet on a par with other sectors in terms of prioritization on the development agenda and consequent
resource allocation. In 2015, the government budget for DRHC almost doubled compared to 2014,
although from a low base. Although the amount is insignificant to respond to the scale of rural sanitation
issue in the country, it indicates the government’s increasing recognition of rural sanitation.
Now that MRD is developing the NAP articulating clearer the needs for the sector in the medium-term up
to 2018, it is expected that more resources would be made available both from government domestic
budget as well as from development partners via loans and grant assistance. Thus, having the strategy
and plan in place for the RWSSH sector has become instrumental for mobilizing resources, including grants
and loans, to support the implementation program.54
Participatory development of the National Action Plan for RWSSH 2014-18 contributes to better
harmonization and alignment, builds momentum for sector support, and leads to increasing demand for
institutional strengthening.
Over the past decade, much of the progress in the sector has been achieved through a set of project-
based approaches, with insufficient coordination, and without a clear national strategic direction for a
service delivery model that can deliver impact at scale.
During the course of the formulation of the NAP, the process of involving stakeholders from the early
stage of diagnosing sector issues to finalization of the action plan was one of the fundamental elements
to create real demand for better sector harmonization and alignment with the government strategy under
one umbrella plan. Informed by in-country and global evidence, the results framework, being the
backbone of the NAP, was developed with significant inputs from stakeholders. The process of
constructing the results framework helped stakeholders think collectively beyond project-based delivery
and to focus on the result chain that will deliver the desired sector outcomes.

and sanitation.

This intensive stakeholder involvement also helped to build momentum among many local NGOs and
development partners to support the NAP, while leveraging the comparative advantage of each partner.
With a history of weak harmonization and fragmentation among the many sector stakeholders, this is
expected to help accelerate progress on RWSSH in a coherent manner.
The NAP preparation has also sparked discussions around key issues, such as for strengthening institutions
for long-term sustainability, including those at decentralized level. As the service coverage increases, risks
of service slippage and exclusion are increasing, e.g. breakdown or service deterioration due to lack of
post-construction support mechanism for water supply schemes, or sustaining behavior change after
reaching open defecation free status, and getting service to hard-to-reach segments of the population.
Institutional strengthening at national and sub-national level and learning from the implementation are
key thrusts in the NAP. This requires clearer roles and responsibilities among government staff at national
and sub-national level, and decentralizing water supply O&M function and rural sanitation function to
districts. Strengthening district and communes institutions are of critical importance.
Government leadership is essential for the development of an overarching BCC guideline to facilitate joint
collaborative action in the execution of a sector-wide BCC campaigns.
Following global best practice, the development of BCC normally follows specific steps: (i) conducting
formative research to understand the behavioral determinants, (ii) developing the communications
objectives, and (iii) developing the messages and tools and delivery mechanisms. In the past this process
has been mostly characterized by isolated project-specific efforts of individual organizations, with a
limited extent of sharing. With the purpose of building on existing knowledge and past efforts by various
stakeholders, national BCC Guidelines were developed. While the idea was to connect project-based
knowledge to a broader sector-level agenda on BCC to enhance efficiency and impact, government
leadership needs to be exerted to carefully manage the stakeholder process and deal with sensitivities
about quality and relevance of existing project-based BCC tools.
The Cambodian experience suggests that under the current environment of limited leadership,
coordination and resources, the development of BCC guidelines, although challenging, has significant
potential to form the basis for sector-wide BCC campaign development and execution.
Sector partners, such as GSF, are committed to support the development of the BCC campaign based on
the BCC Guidelines. WHO is also committed to conduct additional formative research on drinking water
related behavior in order to fill a knowledge gap identified in the BCC Guidelines. These collective efforts
are expected to create synergies in the delivery of BCC at scale under a coherent umbrella campaign.
However, leadership for developing and executing an umbrella campaign rests with MRD. While NGOs
and development partners have articulated their demand for stronger guidance on BCC, until now, the
importance of a coherent evidence-based approach following – regularly updated – BCC Guidelines has
not been fully underscored by MRD’s leadership.
Getting high-level ministerial support is essential to move the decentralization agenda forward for rural
sanitation.
The experience from the pilot of the decentralized service delivery model for rural sanitation suggests
that building high-level political support from the beginning is key. Although decentralization is part of the
broader government’s reform agenda, operationalizing this reform requires a champion within the
ministry. A joint effort from ministerial leaders of both MRD and NCDD Secretariat was critical in pushing
the functional assignment on rural sanitation. Engaging these champion in delivering key messages to the
ministry staff and districts helped speed up pilot implementation.




Page | 28
With the right technical assistance support, districts – with the help of communes – have been proven to
obtain reasonable capacity to plan and deliver rural sanitation function in a decentralized model. Yet, unless
financial and human resources are sufficiently transferred to district level, and PDRD/MRD retains a
technical support role, an optimal execution of this function cannot be realized.
The pilot of Rural Sanitation Decentralized Service Delivery has been one of a few in supporting the
government’s effort to assign functions to the districts to promote democratic development and
improved service delivery. Within a short period of time, all ten pilot districts have managed to
operationalize its delegated functions in sanitation service delivery. Early experience shows that both the
district and commune levels can show ownership, confidence and ability in delivering rural sanitation
services despite resource constraints. Continued support on capacity development for the districts and
communes is still needed, at least in the short to medium-term, to consolidate their newly gained
capacities in planning, budgeting and facilitating sanitation related activities within their jurisdictions.
Continued technical support from PDRD and the MRD is needed to ensure rural sanitation programmatic
approach is implemented well and consistently and that innovations are integrated. Financial resources
are essential for districts and communes. Sanitation champions from different provinces, districts, and
communes have provided proof of the effectiveness of advocacy with local leaders and administrators, to
ensure budget is allocated from districts and communes existing funds. In the future, such increased funds
could be mobilized directly by NCDD/MRD from MEF, but would continue to require the complimentary
use of Commune/Sangkat Fund.55 This increased resource envelope would also allow the district to
mobilize additional human resources at district and commune level, as last-mile delivery and outreach is
labor intensive. A (part-time) RWSSH coordinator would be a minimum staffing requirement at district
level.
The successes and challenges from the pilot have helped to formulate a road-map for nationwide transfer,
using a phased approach to capacity development, and putting in place the necessary policies, operational
manuals and guidelines for legalizing the country-wide transfer.
Helping the districts to develop district-wide sanitation plans with strong participation from the communes
has empowered the communes to tap on social service fund effectively for improving rural sanitation.
In every commune, a fund amounting up to USD 1,500 – 2,000 per commune per year was set aside for
social service delivery. Given the many social challenges, the use of social service funding at the
communes has often been less results-oriented. With the availability of district-wide sanitation plans and
with the involvement of the communes in the planning process, the communes have clearer plan for the
use of social service funding for rural sanitation activities. The experience from the pilot showed that, out
of the total around USD 250 – 500 per year per commune has been allocated for rural sanitation activities.
This allocation has enabled the communes to conduct community behavior change communication events
and necessary follow up to improve sanitation situation in the communes.
4.1.2. Sector Monitoring and Learning
Lack of robust institutional support and government resources committed to operate the RWSSH sector
Management Information System (MIS) can jeopardize the sustainable use of the MIS.
A performance monitoring framework for the MIS was designed to align with the NAP. While UNICEF has
allocated significant resources to develop the MIS for RWSSH sector, fundamental questions around
institutional hosting and financial and human resources allocations to support the operation and

55 Commune/Sangkat Fund is the Fund available at the commune/Sangkat level which enables communes/Sangkats to assume their general
responsibilities and promote local development. The Fund is established by the Law on the Administration and Management of
Communes/Sangkats.



Page | 29
maintenance of the system have not yet been clarified. This will be required for the future launch, roll-
out and sustainable usage of the MIS.
Introducing evidence-based behavior change communications beyond traditional health-based messages
requires intense capacity development and mindset shift by government and stakeholders.
While many government and local NGO implementers at national and local level may be quite comfortable
with traditional health-based messages for hygiene promotion,56 introducing a new approach based on
socio-emotional drivers and normative barriers for behavior change requires significant engagement and
capacity building. Exposure visits, sharing global experiences, and workshops to adopt the BCC Guidelines
have proved to be instrumental to develop acceptance and motivation for application of such new
approaches.
It is expected that with this deepened understanding on BCC, concerted efforts can be mobilized that
would lead to coherent evidence-based messages and tools used to change rural household behavior in
sanitation and hygiene.
Creating demand for evidence-based policy development has helped embed an explicit knowledge agenda
in the government National Action Plan.
The TA activities have fostered an evidence-based approach to policy and sector reform, which is reflected
in the NAP. It clearly indicates where the knowledge gaps are and key milestones for those knowledge
gaps to be filled. In addition, a government-led annual joint sector review at the national and provincial
level is included to assess performance and take-stock of lessons learned so that interventions can be
adjusted or initiated. Examples are how sanitation and stunting research has informed closer
collaboration between nutrition and WASH sectors, now leading to the development of a future guideline
on integration. Another example is the research on consumer rebates for poor households in the context
of sanitation marketing. This research and other ongoing studies are expected to inform a guideline on
pro-poor support mechanisms later in 2016.
4.2. Recommendations
Over the past years, the focus of MRD has been on the development of the tools and instruments that
would help boost the RWSSH sector achieve the universal coverage by 2025. A number of strategic sector
documents were developed including the long-term strategy, the medium-term action plan and some
important guidelines. This development forms a solid basis for MRD to lead a more coherent sector
implementation at scale.
The next phase would be to focus on the operationalization of the action plan and the monitoring of its
effectiveness at both national and provincial level through a joint annual review process led by
government. Below are the recommendations for short, medium and long-term to help accelerate access
to rural water and sanitation through improved sector management and decentralized sanitation service
delivery model.57 The following section suggests recommended actions that would be useful for relevant
institutions to consider in moving the rural water and sanitation agenda forward.
4.2.1. Operationalization of Sector Strategy and Decentralization
            With the approval of the NAP, MRD may use this as opportunity to dialogue with MEF for better
             resource allocation to support programming in RWSSH sector. Since the NAP is aligned with the
             government strategy and has clearly identified resource requirement and implementation
             activities, it can strengthen the position of the MRD to advocate for resource mobilization,
             including from development partners.

     As advocated through the MRD adopted Hygiene Promotion Guidelines
57
     Since the main aspect of the TA has been sanitation, the recommendations provided are mostly relevant for rural sanitation.

           Since the NAP was already approved, the focus is now on the implementation. MRD could opt to
            strengthen the role and capacity of the TWG-RWSSH in closely monitoring the implementation of
            the NAP ensuring activities and outputs are achieved within the stated timeframe.
           As there are many sector stakeholders in RWSSH sector, MRD could consider the possibility to
            periodically conduct partnership assessment to take stock of the external support for the RWSSH
            sector and understand the resource commitments among sector stakeholders. As part of the
            process, stakeholders may be encouraged to make their intervention program become integral
            part of the NAP which will contribute to better sector harmonization and alignment.
           To enhance effectiveness and impacts of sector interventions, MRD could consider develop and
            rollout the national umbrella BCC campaign for rural sanitation and hygiene based on the BCC
            Guidelines.
           MRD, in collaboration with NCDD Secretariat and MEF, may rigorously assess the adequacy of the
            budget transferred to pilot districts vis-à-vis the function transferred to them, and identify
            opportunities for increase the resource transfer during the second year of pilot implementation.
           MRD and NCDD Secretariat could jointly develop and agree on the roadmap for rolling out rural
            sanitation function transfer nationwide. Once agreed, implementation could start with
            preparatory activities as identified in the roadmap to allow nationwide transfer by mid-2017.
           Once the rural sanitation function is formally transferred to districts, NCDD Secretariat, in
            collaboration with MRD, could implement an at-scale capacity development program for districts
            on rural sanitation service delivery to support the function transfer.
4.2.2. Sector Monitoring and Learning
           MRD may consider establishing M&E unit for RWSSH within the DRHC and/or DRWS with clear
            institutional roles and responsibilities in managing RWSSH MIS. Appropriate staff and resource
            may need to be assigned to the M&E unit to operate the RWSSH MIS with sustainability.
           As sector progresses, MRD could consider conducting annual joint sector review to take stock of
            the lessons and emerging learning from the NAP implementation with the view of adjusting the
            NAP on annual basis. The joint sector review could take place at national level for the NAP, and at
            the provincial level for the PAP.
           In medium term, once MIS is functional, MRD could consider establishing a reliable benchmarking
            system to monitor the sanitation progress at district level and introduce incentives for good
            performing districts and mobilize additional support for underperformers.
4.3. Opportunities for Future World Bank Engagement
Opportunities for the World Bank to support the government to implement the above recommendations
is framed as part of the draft Country Engagement Note. The following are suggestions for the World Bank
to maintain and deepen strategic engagement in the RWSSH sector, especially with respect to rural water
supply, which has not been a strong focus under this TA.
4.3.1. Technical Assistance
A technical assistance could be considered to pursue the sector agenda with the following considerations:
           Continue to support the MRD and TWG-RWSSH capacity in implementation and monitoring of the
            NAP.
           In the immediate term, support the continuation of the current rural sanitation decentralized
            service delivery pilot to gather additional evidence and foster stronger political support. Thorough
            assessments need to be conducted to understand better the district capacities and constraints,
            so as to design an at-scale capacity building program for nationwide function transfer.



Page | 31
           Support the government in implementing the agreed roadmap, including the preparations of
            necessary legal documents and manuals; this will be done in close coordination with WB teams
            working on the local government agenda (Governance Global Practice and Social, Urban, Rural
            and Resilience Global Practice).
4.3.2. Integration with World Bank Operations
Currently, the potential for integrating rural water supply and sanitation has been identified for the
following projects:
           Disaster Risk Management Project (P149149): The Project Development Objective of this project
            is to help reduce the risk of flooding and enhance disaster risk financing capacity in the Mekong
            region. The opportunity for integrating RWSSH in this project could focus on developing district
            capacity for building resilient water supply and sanitation services. This could include introducing
            sanitation services for challenging areas (flood plains), including the required smart incentives
            that are needed to foster adoption of these facilities by poor households. Resilience of water
            supply services and measures to improve the sustainability of such services could be also
            supported through developing better post-construction support functions, involvement of private
            sector in rural areas, and helping to operationalize the future decentralized O&M roles for district
            government.
           Livelihood Enhancement and Association Project (P153591): The Project Development Objective
            of this project is to improve livelihood of the targeted poor households in selected provinces and
            communities. One component of the project is to support the delivery of basic services and
            infrastructure including water and sanitation. In this regard, the opportunity for including RWSSH
            in this project would be on integrating RWSSH as part of the community driven development
            process. Existing BCC and marketing approaches can be integrated within the project cycle in
            targeted communities.
           Social Accountability Project: At the moment, the focus of service improvement through social
            accountability is on health centers, schools and communes, but this could be expanded to cover
            water supply and sanitation services as well. In this regard, developing standards and a process of
            community engagement to focus on the quality of services, perhaps in the pilot decentralization
            provinces where the TA has supported, could be a potential avenue. This would also need the
            joint Bank’s Global Practice (GP) support from Water GP and Urban, Rural and Resilience GP.
Longer-term engagement under the World Bank future Country Partnership Framework is expected in the
next two-years, and may lead to a multi-sectoral IDA operation, for example to support nutrition and
RWSSH.

                         Annex 1. Key Results of the Partner Mapping Survey
In early 2013, the Ministry of Rural Development developed and disseminated the National Strategy on
Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene 2011-2025, which determines the direction and
commitments to achieving the above national vision. The vision of the National Strategy and the
development status of the entire sector show that this is a great ambition. This requires commitment to
implementation from all levels and participation from all stakeholders, especially the Ministry of Rural
Development, which leads the coordination and mobilizes collaboration from relevant ministries as well
as support from partner organizations in order to focus on ensuring that this sector is successful with
quality and sustainability.
At present, although there is no exact number, it is understood that many partner organizations have
been implementing rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene programs with direct or indirect
collaboration with the Ministry of Rural Development. Based on a partner mapping survey with
participation of 48 partner organizations /programs, the budget for implementation of rural water supply,
sanitation and hygiene programs for 2009-2015 is approximately USD103 million in total, i.e., about
USD15 million per annum, with 2.7 million households as direct beneficiaries. Among partner
organizations working on rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene, about 69% (33) are international
organizations that are active in Cambodia, and another 31% (15) are local partner organizations. It is
noted that 94% (45) of these partner organizations consider rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene
their core programs, and 6% (3) consider implementation of rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene
programs their secondary programs. Among the organizations participating in the survey, about 46% (22)
have collaborated directly with the Ministry of Rural Development in program implementation, and
another 50% (26) collaborated with other relevant ministries or agencies working in development of rural
communities, health and water supply.
Programs implemented by partner organizations have different durations. Thirty-eight percent (18) of
partners implement long-term programs (4-5 years) and 19% (9), especially large organizations,
implement programs lasting 3-4 years, and 13% (6) implement medium-term programs (2-3 years) and
31% (15) implement short-term programs (1-2 years).
The survey also shows that 42% (20) of partner organizations implement programs by themselves and
collaborate with ministries/provincial departments through funding for the implementation of the
programs, 33% (16) implement programs by themselves, and 25% (12) by themselves and through
implementing partners or private agencies. We also observe that among all the programs implemented
by partner organizations, 44% of the programs focus on development of water supply, 39% focus on
sanitation and hygiene, and 17% focus on hygiene promotion in rural communities.
Map 1and Map 2 show the number of partner organizations and the number of households without
access to improved sanitation and households without access to improved water in each province. Based
on the two maps, we see that the number of partner organizations in each province does not seem to be
proportionate completely to the size of the sector problems in the provinces. In some provinces, the size
of the problems was not big, but there was a high concentration of partner organizations. For example,
the provinces around the Tonle Sap Lake had more partners than other provinces where the number of
households without access to toilets was higher than that of the provinces around the Tonle Sap Lake.
We also observed that in the northeast and coastal areas there was little presence of partner
organizations. This is because these areas have a small number of population without access to the
service although the percentage of the population without access to the service is high.

All partners are happy with the initiative to conduct this survey because they believe that it gives a lot of
benefits to the Ministry of Rural Development as well as their organizations, which seek to understand
development partners or NGOs working in the area of rural water supply and sanitation.
Key points that the survey has found include the following:


Page | 36
           Many partners have been in need of assistance from the Ministry of Rural Development on clear
            and systematic support to help coordinate better implementation of projects/programs in line
            with national development strategies.

           At present, although the Ministry of Rural Development has established a number of
            mechanisms, the coordination mechanism among partner organizations is still limited, which
            makes it difficult for partners to seek cooperation.

           Funding for the sector received from partners and organizations is large compared with the
            national budget. In 2009-2015, the funding for implementing sanitation and hygiene programs is
            about 5% higher than the funding for water supply programs. Starting from 2012, the annual
            funding by partners for the sanitation and hygiene programs tends to be larger than that for the
            water supply as the former needs to be further expedited in order to achieve the Millennium
            Development Goals.

           Partner organizations’ annual budget for implementing programs shows a decrease after 2012.
            This trend can become a challenge for the whole sector, which requires development of an
            appropriate strategy for coordination and effective use of funding available in this sector and for
            creation of opportunities for more investment in this sector.

           The presence of partner organizations is geographically concentrated. Some areas with a low
            coverage of water supply and sanitation have not yet received serious attention. This indicates a
            gap in the coordination mechanism.

           Increasing access to improved rural sanitation requires multiple instruments for interventions,
            which may be carried out at the same time with consistency with national strategies. However,
            most partner organizations implement programs according to their own expertise and strategies
            only.

           The number of households directly benefitting from the implementation of water and sanitation
            programs by partner organizations is determined to be up to 2.7 million households by 2015, but
            the achievable results are not clear yet requiring monitoring and supervision.

                                                      Executive Summary
Although Cambodia has made good progress towards achieving its country-specific Millennium
Development Goals for water supply and sanitation, there is still a great deal of work left to be done.
National access to improved water supply and sanitation are still only 54.2% and 51.7%, respectively;
meaning nearly half the country still lacks these basic services. In addition, wide disparities exist between
access in rural and urban areas, and by the poor and the better-off. Cambodia’s rural sanitation coverage
is currently the lowest in Southeast Asia; over 50 percent of the rural population still practice open
defecation (OD).58
Lack of adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities and practices has many negative
consequences, especially for the rural poor. Six out 10 reported diseases in Cambodia are water-borne.
Poor sanitation and hygiene may be responsible for 10,000 deaths annually, mainly among children.59
The economic losses associated with these conditions is estimated to be over seven percent of
Cambodia’s gross domestic product (GDP), or US$32 per person.60
In 2014, the Royal Government of Cambodia officially adopted a National Strategic Plan (NSP) for rural
water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (RWSSH). The NSP’s goal is simple but challenging: Every person in
rural communities has sustained access to safe water supply and sanitation services and lives in a
hygienic environment by 2025. This work will be carried out in two phases; Phase I runs from 2014-2018,
the period covered by this National Action Plan (NAP) for RWSSH.
The Technical Working Group (TWG) for RWSSH led the development of the NAP, which translates the
Strategic Objectives of the NSP into specific activities with output indicators, targets, implementation
timeframes, and detailed budget estimates. The participatory process to develop the NAP was carried
out by the TWG at the national level. At the provincial level, the Provincial Departments of Rural
Development (PDRDs) carried out similar efforts to create Provincial Action Plans (PAPs), which were used
to inform both local and national planning efforts.
The primary reason for the creation of the NAP is to accelerate progress in the RWSSH sector by improving
sector efficiency, strengthening institutional capacity (especially local government), and increasing
investment. In addition, the NAP (and each PAP) will be reviewed and updated annually, and will be
treated as ‘rolling’ plans that will be revised, based on progress and experience, such that the plan
continues evolve and improve over time.
The four high-level outcomes for the NAP, and their associated targets are presented in Table 1 below:

The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) is the agency responsible for implementing the NAP, and is
accountable for delivering results. The TWG will oversee the process from a management perspective. At
the provincial level, the Provincial Departments of Rural Development (PDRDs) and the PWGs will play
identical roles regarding the PAPs.
The NAP calls for local Government, including District Administrations and Commune Councils, to play
increasingly active roles in identifying RWSSH priorities, and allocating investment funds towards those
priorities. To assist with this process, the NAP calls for selection and training of District and Commune
RWSSH Focal Persons who will advocate for and support NAP (PAP) implementation at the local level, as
part of the District and Commune Development Planning processes. PDRDs and PWGs will help oversee
and support this decentralization effort.62
RWSSH Development Partners (DPs), including both financing and implementation agencies, will play
important roles under the NAP. The TWG and PWGs are co-chaired by key DPs, and field programs will
continue to be a significant area of DP engagement. Under the NAP, it is anticipated that DP project
targeting and planning will be better coordinated at the National, Provincial and local levels, with the
goals of improving sector efficiency, increasing the focus on poor and underserved populations, and
strengthening sector learning and knowledge sharing.
The estimated cost of implementing the NAP (2014-2018) is US$88.95 million (KHR 365 billion). Of this,
79 percent is for programming (improved water supply, sanitation, and hygiene). Approximately 3.4
percent of the budget is devoted to strengthening institutional capacity and advocating for increased
RWSSH sector investment63. Indirect costs were calculated as 21 percent of all programming (direct)
costs, and are intended to cover administration and staffing, communications, and other ‘overhead’ or
management costs.
An explicit objective of the NAP is to help raise awareness of the nation’s RWSSH needs, and to advocate
for additional investment of capital and human resources to tackle these critical challenges. It is hoped
that the NAP, which has been developed based upon decades of RWSSH sector experience and an
extensive national consultative effort, will become the catalyst for sector reform, stronger investment,
and an accelerated drive towards the 2018 targets and to the 2025 Sector Vision of universal access.

 Annex 4. National Guidelines for Behavior Change Communications for Rural Sanitation and Hygiene
                                            in Cambodia


                                             Executive Summary
Cambodia has made significant progress over the past few years in addressing increased access to
improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for its rural population. Nonetheless, key challenges
remain, including with respect to sanitation coverage rates, poor hygiene and access to improved drinking
water in rural areas, and other WASH-related health issues and economic impacts.
Behavior change communications (BCC) is the strategic use of communication based on established
theories and models of behavior change to promote adoption of healthy behaviors to improve health
outcomes. BCC actively steps away from pre-formulated assumptions about behavior change, its
motivators and barriers; instead, BCC employs a systematic process which includes formative research,
communication planning, and monitoring and evaluation. This process can help ensure a consistent,
evidence-based and effective approach to BCC activities across the WASH sector, and, ultimately, help
the sector reach its 2025 goal of 100% coverage and use of improved sanitation and hygiene facilities by
rural households in Cambodia.
The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) of the Royal Government of Cambodia developed the National
Behavior Change Communication Guidelines for Sanitation and Hygiene 2015-2018 to guide stakeholders
and those working in the rural water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector in Cambodia to develop a
strategic, consistent approach to promoting behavior change.
The BCC Guidelines seek to promote the following three key behaviors among target audiences of rural
households
     1. Ceasing open defecation (OD) and adopting a household latrine;
     2. Handwashing with soap (HWWS) at critical times , in particular by caretakers of children under
        five; and
     3. Consistent consumption of trader household water.

The guidelines set forth overarching recommendations as well as findings and recommendations specific
to each of the three key behaviors. Overarching recommendations are developed for BCC initiatives to
promote improved WASH behaviors, grouped according to the following categories: behavioral
determinants; campaign development and implementation; and stakeholder coordination and formative
research.

                                         from existing campaigns.



The guidelines also provide key findings, identify target audiences and communication objectives, assess
existing communication materials and present recommendations for each of the three key behaviors to
be promoted among rural households.
Among key findings for the behavior of ceasing OD and adopting a household latrine is a lack of urgency
towards investing in a latrine, despite the common recognition of benefits that a latrine can bring, such
as status, comfort and privacy. It is also clear that health is not a driver for latrine adoption, but that peer
pressure and the desire to emulate successful neighbors are. Dry-pit latrines are unpopular as they are
perceived as unhygienic and unattractive, whereas a pour-flush latrine complete with a concrete shelter
is the “gold standard” to which rural household aspire. Furthermore, money constraint is often
mentioned as a key barrier to buying a latrine; many rural households perceive the cost of a pour-flush
latrine as being too high.
Behavior specific recommendations for ceasing OD and adopting a household latrine include behavioral
determinants to be addressed in future campaigns (e.g. social norms and social drivers), campaign
developments and implementation suggestions (e.g. additional materials, target audiences and
activities), and additional needs for formative research.

Key findings for HWWS at critical times include that handwashing mostly takes place when hands are
visibly dirty or before eating or preparing food. Very few associate HWWS with the clean ing of a baby’s
bottom. Access to ready availability of soap and water is crucial to break down structural barriers to
handwashing as many state non-compliance with HWWS due to lack of water and soap in the household.
Although health is mentioned as a driving factor for HWWS, there is lack of clarity as to what is meant by
health and whether or not diarrhea is considered a threat severe enough to warrant change among rural
Cambodian households.
Recommendations for HWWS at critical times include behavioral determinants to be addressed in future
campaigns (e.g. social norms, physical drivers and access to ready availability of soap and water),
campaign developments and implementation suggestions (e.g. additional materials, target audiences and
activities), and additional needs for formative research (e.g. what is meant by “good health” and
“illness”).
Among key findings for consistent consumption of treated household water are that most people prefer
boiling as a treatment method; however, only about 1/3 of rural households consistently treat their
drinking water. There exists a belief that clear looking and non-smelling rain water does not need to be
boiled/treated and many cite being “too busy” as a reason for drinking untreated water. More
information is required about water storage and handling behaviors, but major reasons for storing water
in the house include convenience and safety. As with HWWS, health is mentioned as a reason for treating
drinking water, but it is unclear what is meant by “good health” and “illness” and whether or not diarrhea
is considered a threat severe enough to warrant change.
Recommendations for consistent consumption of treated household water include behavioral
determinants to be addressed in future campaigns (e.g. physical drivers (convenience), values (family
values)), and additional needs for formative research (e.g. what is meant by “good health” and “illness”
and deeper insights to water storage and handling behaviors).
Beyond behavior-specific recommendations, the BCC Guidelines also contains sections which gives
insights and suggestions for future suitable communication channels to employ, a monitoring and
evaluation framework complete with suggested indicators for each of the three behaviors and an
illustrative BCC action plan with key steps needed for future BCC efforts in the WASH sector.
