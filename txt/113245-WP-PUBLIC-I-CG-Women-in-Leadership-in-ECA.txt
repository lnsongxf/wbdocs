     Strengthening Businesses in Europe and Central Asia Through Women Leaders
Only 20% of firms in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) have female top managers. In this part of the world,
the average level of women’s representation in board rooms and [in positions of] corporate leadership is lower
than in both East Asia and Latin America. While there are countries in the region, such as Belarus, where the
share of firms with women in top management is among the highest in the world, there are also places like
Kosovo which has almost no firms with women in top management - something only seen in places like Yemen.

                                                       It doesn’t of course help that there is little appreciation

to say that women have overall poorer business knowledge than men. On the contrary, data tells us that on
average, women in this region are better educated than men.

And not just that. “Our recent IFC study told us that women are often more willing to compromise and take into
account the interests of different stakeholders. These are valuable abilities in the business world," said Merima
Zupčević Buzadzic, who leads IFC’s corporate governance work in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

But clearly, the need to strengthen the knowledge and skills of aspiring leaders and board members in the areas of
risk management and board function is more critical for women than men. “The female talent pool is there. Its
contribution to businesses is valuable. But it’s idle because it’s just not being developed, she said.

IFC’s Corporate Governance Program for Eastern Europe and Central Asia is trying to address exactly that with a
series of special training events for women”, explains Merima. And Oliver Orton, the Program Manager, adds:
“This is not simply an effort to promote diversity on boards simply to get more women on boards. This is about
promoting board diversity as a powerful means to improve company dynamics and performance.”

In March 2014, IFC’s Corporate Governance Program in ECA launched a series of events across the region
specifically targeting existing or aspiring female leaders and board members. The trainings aimed at improving
their corporate governance skills and focused on educating participants in areas where there is the greatest need
for better knowledge and skills among women executives, i.e. corporate finance and the role of board members in
monitoring company risk.

                                                           “If you look at the data, then Kosovo is the country, where
                                                           the issue is most pressing”, explains Kiril Nejkov, who leads
                                                           the corporate governance work in Kosovo. Less than three

                                                           few young professional women working in the private

                                                           struggling to climb up the corporate ladder despite the
                                                           value they could bring to their company’s leadership. But
                                                           they are held back by a legacy of cultural prejudices and a
                                                           widespread lack of opportunities for women in Kosovo’s

IFC is supporting those aspiring women business leaders in Kosovo through a comprehensive program. “We
recently held training-of-trainers workshop with managers of leading companies in Kosovo. Going forward, we’ll
do more”, Kiril adds.

Indeed, this is only the first step in a broader engagement in Kosovo which will offer a six -month training and
mentoring program for female junior and middle management professionals from real sector companies. “I’m very
excited about this program because it’s supported by a wide range of private sector players, including Raiffeisen
Bank, ProCredit Bank, IPKO Telecommunications, Crimson Capital and NLB Bank Kosovo. This shows that the
private sector is taking the issue seriously and seeing the business value in developing female talent in the
corporate world.” says Kiril.

                                                            jointly hosted a training event in Baku for female directors

                                                             The training was attended by fifteen participants,
                                                             representing Azerbaijan‘s banking and real sector. It
                                                              targeted both, existing and aspiring     board members.
 Participants at event held jointly with the Azerbaijan Risk
 Professionals Association.                                   “We  had  a good  mix  of representatives from large and
                                                              medium-sized enterprises”, he further explains. ““The
training definitely helped me improve my understanding of corporate governance practices, including the role of
the board in strategy and risk management.” said Ms Jhale Hajiyeva, who works Executive Director, at AMFA and
who was one of the participants.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, where IFC has with BEKTO PRECISA one of the few IFC investee companies led by
a female CEO, the picture is slightly better than in Azerbaijan. “Less than 14 percent of firms have female top
managers. That may be better than in many other parts of the region. But it’s well below the regional average of
20 percent, which is already not very high”, says Lada Busevac, Senior Country officer for Bosnia and
Herzegovina. It is difficult for women to move into managerial positions, despite the value they can bring to the
company. Barriers to women’s top management careers are often a mix of companies’ poor appreciation of the
value they bring and insufficient investment into female talent.

To address the latter, IFC teamed up with its local
corporate governance partner in BiH, the
Association of Board Members of Companies in
Bosnia And Herzegovina, to host a training event
for female members of management and
supervisory boards of companies. The training
aimed to strengthen corporate governance skills of
women executives in particular.

In Serbia, which ranks globally among the
countries with higher rates of firms with women in
top management (26%), the issue may be less
pressing        but     equally    important.     The
unemployment rate in Serbia is much higher in the
case of women. They find it generally more
difficult to enter the job market and start a career. IFC collaborated with the Association of Board Members of Companies in
                                                          Bosnia And Herzegovina to host a training event for female members of

the prospects are dim. The recent IFC study
showed that aspiring women leaders need more time and skills to advance professionally and become members
of boards.

To address this skills challenge, IFC teamed up with its local corporate governance partner, the Serbian Chamber
of Commerce and organized a training event for female members of boards of directors and supervisory boards.
“The Serbian Chamber of Commerce is keen to contribute to the development of skills of women on boards
through targeted and dedicated trainings” said Ms. Vidosava Dzagic, Vice-President of the Serbian Chamber of
Commerce. The Swiss Secretariat for Economic Affairs, or SECO, who is supporting IFC’s Corporate Governance
Program for ECA is very supportive of the increased gender focus in the program.

And more is planned. In Kazakhstan, IFC is teaming up with Executive Education Center at KIMEP University to
deliver a training program for high potential women-managers in international and Kazakhstani companies. Since
launching this regional initiative to target and train more women for board and leadership functions as part of an
effort to promote gender diversity on boards, IFC’s Corporate Governance Program for ECA has led half a dozen
workshops across Azerbaijan, BiH, Kosovo and Serbia and is planning work in Kazakhstan.
