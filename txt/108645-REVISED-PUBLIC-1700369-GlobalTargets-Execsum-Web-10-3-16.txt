These analyses also confirm the high returns on invest-
ment that come from investing in nutrition among chil-
dren and women (box ES.1). Not only do investments in
nutrition make one of the best value-for-money develop-
ment actions, they also lay the groundwork for the suc-
cess of investments in other sectors.

Achieving the targets is within reach if partners work
together to immediately step up in investments in nutri-
tion. Indeed, some countries (Peru, Senegal, and others)
have shown that rapid scale-up of nutrition interventions
can be achieved and lead to swift declines in stunting
rates (see chapter 9 in the report for a discussion of coun-
try achievements in reducing malnutrition).



Key Recommendations
1. The world needs $70 billion over 10 years to invest
in high-impact nutrition-specific interventions in order to
reach the global targets for stunting, anemia in women,
and exclusive breastfeeding for infants and to scale up
the treatment of severe wasting among young children.

Although $7 billion a year may seem to be a large invest-
ment, it pales in comparison to the $500 billion per year
