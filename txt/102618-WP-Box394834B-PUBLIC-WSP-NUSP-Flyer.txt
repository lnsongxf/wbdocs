National Rating and Award Scheme for
Sanitation for Indian Cities
Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India




Goal
In order to rapidly promote sanitation in urban areas of the country (as provided for in the
National Urban Sanitation Policy and Goals 2008), and to recognize excellent performance in
this area, the Government of India intends to institute an annual rating award scheme for cities.

The award is based on the premise that improved public health and environmental standards
are the two outcomes that cities must seek to ensure for urban citizens. In doing so,
governments in states and urban areas will need to plan and implement holistic city-wide
sanitation plans, thereby put in place processes that help reach outputs pertaining to safe
collection, confinement and disposal (including conveyance, treatment, and/ or re-use without
adverse impacts on the environment in and around the cities). It may be noted that the awards
will not recognize mere inputs, hardware or expenditure incurred in urban sanitation but
assess how these lead to achievements of intermediate milestones toward the final result of
100 percent safe disposal of wastes from the city on a sustainable basis. Cities will need to
raise the awareness of city stakeholders (households, establishments, industries, municipal
functionaries, media, etc.) since improved sanitation can ensure improved public health and
environmental outcomes only if considerable changes in behavior and practice take place
across the spectrum of society.

Concept of Totally Sanitized Cities
A totally Sanitized City will be one that has achieved the outputs or milestones specified in the
National Urban Sanitation policy, the salient features of which are as follows:
•   Cities must be open defecation free.
•   Must eliminate the practice of manual scavenging and provide adequate personnel
    protection equipment that addresses the safety of sanitation workers.
•   Municipal wastewater and storm water drainage must be safely managed.
•   Recycle and reuse of treated wastewater for non potable applications should be
    implemented wherever possible.
•   Solid waste collected and disposed off fully and safely.
•   Services to the poor and systems for sustaining results.
•   Improved public health outcomes and environmental standards.
                                                     Cities will need to raise the awareness of city stakeholders since
                                                     improved sanitation can ensure improved public health and
                                                     environmental outcomes only if considerable changes in behavior
                                                     and practice take place across the spectrum of society.

Rating and Categorization of Cities

  indicators of outputs, processes and outcomes, as presented in Table 1.

* The marks for the above indicators will be
revised every two to three years. Over time, indicators about more stringent
conditions e.g. no-urination, or spitting in open/public spaces, etc. will be introduced as indicators.
The weights accorded to each category and specific indicators will also be revised.** In this context, bigger
cities may consider instituting good practice systems that comply with ISO (International Standards Organization) and/or BIS
(Bureau of Indian Standards) process systems.

• On the basis of the above rating scheme, cities will be placed in different categories as presented in Table 2.
  National rating survey data will utilize these categories for publication of results.

• On the basis of plans prepared and implemented,
  cities will be able to measure the results of their
  actions, and be able to clearly chart out their
  improvements over time compared to their
  baseline situation.
• On achievement of remarkable results, i.e. coming
  into the Green category (Healthy and Clean City),
  cities will typically become eligible for the national
  award. Other cities showing remarkable
  incremental performance or selective
  achievements may also be given special or
  honorary awards. Cities in different size-classes
  may also be considered for category-wise awards.
• Based on results of the Rating survey and selection

  National Urban Sanitation Award ceremony.
