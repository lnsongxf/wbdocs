Preface
This report presents the findings of a project conducted by the World Bank during 2014–2015 at the request of Poland’s
Ministry of Economic Development.

The key objective of the project was to help Poland enhance the impact of the more than 10 billion euro that it will
invest in innovation by 2020, largely financed by the European Union. Such funding is likely to diminish after 2020. It
will therefore be critical for Poland to spend it efficiently, to gradually shift from a growth model based on imitation to
a growth model based on innovation and sustain a fast pace of income convergence with the West.

To invest more effectively, Poland needs to better prioritize its innovation spending and focus it on economic activities
with the largest innovation potential. The best way to achieve this is to move away from an old-fashioned, top-down,
supply-driven, bureaucratic innovation policy that tends to perpetuate the status quo and to adopt a new, bottom-up,
demand-driven policy that puts business in the driver’s seat of innovation policy making and helps discover new areas
of growth.

The World Bank project summarized in this report contributes to this objective by proposing a pioneering approach
to engaging the private sector, as well as science, public administration, and civic society, in co-creating innovation
policy, selecting priorities for public innovation spending, and adjusting public support instruments to the real needs
of Polish enterprises.

The new approach, called the entrepreneurial discovery process (EDP), consists of (i) face-to-face interviews with the
top management of mostly small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), which help to understand the real drivers and
constraints to enterprise innovation that are hard to detect through standard surveys; (ii) Smart Labs, which are a series
of business-friendly, time-efficient workshops that help assess the innovation potential of a specific economic activity;
(iii) innovation maps, which help tease out information about technological trends perceived by the private sector;
and (iv) crowdsourcing, online surveys that reach enterprises that usually do not interact with the public sector.

The EDP designed and tested within the project helped produce new, bottom-up, and heretofore often unavailable
information about the needs, ambitions, strengths, and potential of the enterprise sector.

For instance, it helped identify companies with large innovation-based growth potential, so-called “champions,”
which—if properly supported by the public sector—could become national, European, or perhaps even global lead-
ers and key drivers of growth. The Polish “champions” are characterized by above-average revenue growth rates; high
expenditure on research and development (R&D); a high percentage of export sales; a large proportion of science,
technology, engineering, and math (STEM) employees; and—above all—a specific “growth mind-set” among top
management, which considers innovation the key source of their company’s competitive advantage. The proposed
EDP also helped identify “sleeping beauties,” companies that do not yet seem to fully leverage their growth potential
and could grow much faster if they were “awakened” through, for instance, improved management practices, better
access to “smart” financing, and support for exports. The project also found that many SMEs did not seem to be well
networked, were often wary of cooperating with peer companies in the same sector, and seemed to have a low level of
social capital, which might be a key barrier for innovation development. Finally, it showed that there was a large scope
for improvement in the quality of enterprise support among public institutions.

The report concludes with policy recommendations on how to implement the EDP; use it to validate, modify, or elimi-
nate innovation policy priorities (so-called “smart specializations”); and make it sustainable. It provides ideas on how
to build social capital in the private sector, reform business support institutions, and help coordinate national and
regional smart specialization policies. Finally, it suggests how to adjust public support instruments to the needs of
Polish enterprises, encourage the public sector to be more proactive, and ensure that innovation spending will have
a real impact.

Executive Summary
Poland is the European growth champion. Since 1989, it has more than doubled its gross domestic product (GDP)
per capita, coming in ahead of all European peers. It was the only EU economy to avoid the 2008–2009 global financial
crisis. It has also grown faster than all its global peers, including the so-called Asian Tigers. Quality of life improved in
tandem. Poland has never done so well before. It is now entering its new Golden Age.

But past success does not guarantee future success. With only two-thirds of the level of income of the euro zone,
Poland is still far from full convergence with the West. Although midterm growth prospects are positive, becoming a
fully developed economy will be a challenge: only a few countries in the past have succeeded in doing so, including
Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, and Ireland. Poland’s longer-term growth prospects will depend on its ability
to further reform higher education, stem demographic decline, and—above all—enhance innovation.

Poland needs to innovate to invigorate its growth. Outside oil-based economies, there are no countries that have
ever become rich without innovation. Poland needs to follow in the footsteps of innovators. It will need to do much
more to raise its research and development (R&D) spending and innovation potential. Given the still large difference
in labor productivity levels (Poland’s GDP per hour amounts to around half that of Germany), Poland should continue
to support innovation new to the firm and to the country (technology absorption) by further improving the business
climate, access to financing, infrastructure, and availability of skills. However, to raise its current growth rate and fully
catch up with the West, Poland will need to start shifting to innovation new to the world, producing original products
and services developed by the country’s new global champions. This will be a long and difficult process because tech-
nological innovation does not yet seem to be a part of Poland’s economic DNA.

Poland needs to prioritize its innovation spending. In line with the new smart specialization policy promoted
by the European Commission (EC), in the new 2014–2020 budget perspective all EU member states are required to
focus their innovation support policies on business areas with the largest economic and scientific potential, based on
endogenous strengths and comparative advantages. This is a necessary condition to access the innovation-related
funding from the EU.

The entrepreneurial discovery process (EDP) is the key part of the new smart specialization framework and
research and innovation strategies for smart specialization (RIS3s). The aim of the EDP process is to help countries
and regions to identify, validate, and modify priorities for their innovation spending, the so-called “smart specializa-
tions,” based on a bottom-up process involving the private sector, science, business support institutions, nongovern-
mental organizations (NGOs), public administration, and society. The EDP process should help the government “listen”
to companies to identify new technological trends and new business opportunities and adjust public innovation poli-
cies and instruments accordingly. It should thus help the authorities shift from “supply-driven” to “demand-driven”
policies. Moreover, the EDP process should help eliminate market and coordination failures, helping the private sector
reach a critical mass of innovation-based development. Finally, it should also help create new public goods, such as
new coordination, networking, and knowledge-sharing opportunities that will strengthen indigenous entrepreneurial
discovery. In the end, the rate of return on public investment in innovation should increase and help spur sustained
productivity growth.

The World Bank has helped the government of Poland strengthen the smart specialization process. At the
request of the Ministry of Economic Development (MoED), the World Bank has designed and tested an EDP “made in
Poland” as an element of the National Smart Specialization process (Krajowa Inteligentna Specjalizacja, KIS). The three
main goals of the Bank project were to: (i) identify and assess Polish enterprises’ needs in terms of innovation and devel-
opment potential and provide recommendations on how to adjust the public support system accordingly, (ii) help
meet the EC’s ex ante conditionalities to access EU funding in the 2014–2020 budget perspective, and (iii) strengthen
the capacity of the public administration and selected business support institutions (BSIs) to ensure EDP continuity
after termination of the project by the end of 2015. The EDP process is part of the government’s Action Plan to meet
the EU ex ante conditionality.

      The proposed EDP process comprises several components. It includes: (i) in-depth interviews with top manage-
      ment of innovation-oriented small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) selected from within 10 national smart spe-
      cializations, conducted by seasoned experts; (ii) “Smart Labs,” focus groups featuring companies with high growth
      potential (“champions”) selected through interviews, representatives of science and research and development insti-
      tutions (RDIs), business support institutions, and public administration, which aim to “discover” a business area and
      prove its innovation and growth potential; (iii) crowdsourcing, a new platform of public–private innovation dialogue;
      and (iv) innovation maps, a new way to collect and analyze data from the private sector’s R&D and innovation grant
      applications to identify emerging areas of business and technological strengths (Figure 1).

      The proposed EDP has been tested thoroughly. As part of the project, the Bank conducted more than 630 face-to-
      face interviews with firms in five regions, four of which were chosen by the MoED (Dolnoslaskie, Zachodniopomor-
      skie, Swietokrzyskie, and Slaskie) and one (Lubuskie) that volunteered to join the project in July 2015. Bank experts
      conducted more than 500 of these interviews, and regional consultants selected by the Bank and working under its
      supervision conducted an additional 130 interviews. The Bank also organized a number of Smart Labs (SLs) in each
      of the four regions and one national-level Smart Lab. It prepared a “business and technology roadmap” (BTR) as an
      element of the Smart Lab process and a blueprint for how to create public goods for national and regional smart
      specializations. The Bank collected information from more than 40 companies through crowdsourcing and helped
      the National Center for Research and Development (NCBR) create a pioneering innovation map based on applications
      for R&D support submitted by the private sector during 2007–2013 and within the ongoing “fast track” R&D matching
      grant program. The Bank also organized two Champions Clubs, a new networking and knowledge-sharing platform
      for the “champion” companies identified through the EDP. To ensure the sustainability of the EDP going forward, the
      Bank held workshops for BSIs in each of the regions to discuss the parameters of their participation in the EDP and
      trained more than 40 regional consultants, whom the Polish government will be able to leverage to continue the EDP
      beyond the Bank’s involvement.

   The proposed EDP is one of the elements of a national smart specialization policy. In response to the new EU
   policy and with a view to meeting the ex ante criteria for accessing EU funding, the MoED has developed a system
   of identifying, modifying, and monitoring national smart specializations as part of the “Program of Enterprise Devel-
   opment.” The MoED selected 20 smart specializations that aim to enhance competitiveness and labor productivity
   growth based on R&D and innovation. The list of smart specializations is expected to be constantly monitored and
   updated based on the results of the proposed bottom-up EDP process.

   The proposed EDP complements the existing national EDP institutional framework. The National Smart Spe-
   cialization (KIS) document designed an institutional framework for management of smart specialization policy at the
   national level, including a country-level EDP framework. The proposed bottom-up approach contributes additional
   elements to the EDP system to further enhance its efficiency, quality, and sustainability (see Figure 2).

   The proposed EDP, although optional for the regions, can complement each region’s own EDP. The regions
   have taken various approaches to developing the EDP process, depending on the local endowments and decisions
   of stakeholders. They are also at various stages of development: some EDPs (as in the case of Wielkopolskie) have
   already been approved by the European Commission, while in other regions the EDPs are still being developed. Most




                                                                                                                                   xvii
        regional EDPs differ in terms of institutions, processes, and objectives. That said, such heterogeneity can be consid-
        ered a strength because—provided that there are strong impact and evaluation frameworks—it will allow for testing
        various approaches to entrepreneurial discovery, learning from one another, and creating optimal EDPs. Although the
        proposed EDP process is fully optional for the regions, which are autonomous in their decision making, it is meant to
        complement their efforts by providing alternative methods of conducting the EDP across all the proposed elements.

        The EDP provides a new mechanism for coordinating the national innovation policy and for collaboration
        between the national and regional levels. Poland is one of only a few EU countries that decided to develop both
        national and regional EDPs, meaning that aside from the national EDP, all 16 voivodships have also developed their
        own EDPs. As a result, there are now 20 national and 81 regional smart specializations. Given such a large number of
        smart specializations, their partly overlapping scope, and the diverse institutional setup at the national and regional
        levels, robust cooperation between the regional and national levels will be key, including thematic, institutional, and
        process cooperation.

        Thematic cooperation should aim at a number of objectives. It should help: (i) identify interregional smart special-
        izations (S3s), (ii) detect synergies between the national and regional S3s, and (iii) allow for modification of smart spe-
        cializations at the national and regional levels. As to the latter, some national S3s are the same as the regional ones. The
        proposed EDP will help verify and assess the potential of national S3s and might also provide data useful for regional
        EDPs. Given the large number of national S3s, it might be useful to consider merging some national specializations
        that have a similar scope. Finally, new national smart specializations could be identified based on input from regional
        EDPs and interregional collaboration.

        Institutional collaboration requires joint work between the main EDP counterparts. EDPs in Poland function in
        a diverse set of institutional frameworks on both the regional and the national levels. This means that similar EDP func-
        tions are fulfilled by different actors. Therefore, EDP coherence requires a good understanding of these differences
        and a robust information flow among all stakeholders. The national group for monitoring and evaluating RIS3s, which
        has already proven to be an effective mechanism of national–regional collaboration, could also become a key platform
        for EDP cooperation. Interactive and workshop-like group meetings can aim to: (i) efficiently share knowledge gath-
        ered through EDPs at the national and regional level, (ii) leverage insights delivered by the regional EDP consultants,
        and (iii) advise on areas of collaboration in selected smart specializations. This group should have access to data from
        the National Statistical Office (GUS), tax offices, the National Bank of Poland, the European Commission, academia, and
        the private sector.

        Cooperation related to the EDP process will be especially important. Given that each region has its own unique
        EDP process with a specific institutional arrangement, it will be important to be flexible in accommodating each EDP
        and to promote best practices across the country. The modular character of the EDP proposed in this report allows
        for the comparison of various EDPs in achieving the objectives of the smart specialization policy, enhancing synergies
        across regions, and exchanging information about the best functioning and most effective EDP solutions. One of the
        premises of EDP cooperation is that information gathered by national and regional EDPs should be publicly available
        to enhance knowledge sharing.

        Cooperation on EDPs should help regions reach a number of objectives. It should help them to: (i) access national
        databases for data tailored to their regional needs and share their own data with national authorities; (ii) access oth-
        erwise unavailable information on the potential to develop various business areas, including existing and emerging
        smart specializations; and (iii) in consultation with the MoED, direct the national EDP toward the areas of the largest
        regional relevance. Figure 3 shows the proposed interaction between the regional (orange) and national (purple and
        green) EDPs (discussed in more detail in Chapter 4).

From the national perspective, the suggested EDP cooperation process should: (i) help maintain dialogue with
the regions and share their EDP experience, (ii) share results of the national EDP, and (iii) learn from the bottom-up
EDPs conducted by the regions. The methodology for research and analysis, company interviews, Smart Labs, and
BTRs will serve as an instrument to achieve these objectives. Regional consultants could play a crucial role in national–
regional cooperation. Their role would be to conduct the national EDP process in close cooperation with each of the
regions (Figure 4).


Smart interviews

Firm-level interviews are at the core of the proposed EDP. Interviews aim to identify key drivers for and constraints
on SME innovation, identify the key attributes of companies that could benefit the most from public intervention, and
take stock of key business and technological trends, as perceived by the companies. The interviews are conducted
by seasoned experts with relevant professional experience. Unlike most surveys conducted by the national statisti-
cal office and international institutions, the interviews are conducted face to face with the company’s top manage-
ment and/or owners. They usually take about 2 to 2.5 hours and are based on a questionnaire with quantitative and

     qualitative questions. Each interview is summarized in a “one pager” by the interviewing expert. The experts separate
     the interviewed firms, based on their expert judgment and a number of key innovative attributes, into five catego-
     ries: “champions,” “emerging champions,” “sleeping beauties,” “steady state,” and “declining” (see the definitions in
     Box 22). At the end of each interview, the firm receives feedback from the expert. Data from each interview are aggre-
     gated and analyzed for policy insights.

     There are a number of benefits of firm-level interviews. The interviews help:

     •	 Identify differences between national smart specializations in terms of R&D intensity, companies’ needs, and firms’
        focus on innovation as the key driver of competitiveness

     •	 Provide early evidence for verifying/modifying smart specializations

     •	 Identify firms with the most innovation-based growth potential and the greatest need for public support (e.g.,
        “champions” and “sleeping beauties”)



xx
•	 Select priority firms for the Smart Lab part of the EDP and identify endogenous strengths in the economy

•	 Identify firms’ biggest barriers to growth and their most pressing needs, as well as recommend how to adjust the
   public support system accordingly

•	 Identify emerging business and technology trends that the public sector can act upon

•	 Assess the quality of the public support system

•	 Provide an indirect way of increasing the companies’ competitiveness, based on the experts’ feedback

•	 Enhance the proactive attitude of the public sector, give it access to firms that do not normally interact with the
   public sector and reduce the risks of innovation policy being driven by vested interests

The main findings from the firm-level interviews are the following:

•	 National smart specializations are different in terms of number of firms with high growth potential, R&D intensity,
   and company needs; the differences are more pronounced at the level of meta-specializations.

•	 Firms with the largest innovation-based growth potential (“champions”) are characterized by high revenue growth
   rates, investment in R&D, large export intensity, high proportion of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathe-
   matics) employees, strong growth mind-set of the company’s management, and extensive networking with clients,
   suppliers, and other partners.

•	 The main barriers for firms’ innovation-based development include access to financing, access to new markets, avail-
   ability of skilled R&D personnel, mental barriers among owners (focused on short-term profits), risk-averse custom-
   ers, management skills, a low level of networking, and weak support from the public sector.

•	 The interviews identified a large number of firms with high growth potential: “champions” and “sleeping beauties”
   that could benefit the most from public support. “Champions” have different needs than “sleeping beauties” and
   other types of firms. The public sector should adjust support instruments to their needs.

•	 Most firms are not sufficiently networked, especially internationally. Many firms lack up-to-date and comprehensive
   knowledge about key business and technology trends in their business area and rarely use the broad range of infor-
   mation available about the market and innovation.

•	 Most firms are skeptical about cooperation with the public sector. They generally do not cooperate with BSIs and
   RDIs and appear concerned with the quality of their services. They need more proactive approaches from public-
   sector stakeholders to build networks and trust.

•	 Firms are aware of the available public innovation support programs, but lack details on which support instruments
   to access and how. It would be useful to create a “one-stop shop” for all public support instruments.

•	 Firms generally share similar innovation drivers and constraints across all smart specializations, suggesting a need
   for horizontal support policies.

Going forward, interviews could be used in modified ways. Although the interviews provide a tested way to audit
companies, based on international good practice and a rigorous and replicable methodology, national and regional
authorities can adjust the interview process to their needs. The questionnaire could be shortened to, for instance,
focus only on the key barriers to innovation-based growth and require only about an hour-long interview, comple-
mented by additional modules (such as on the quality of management practices) or a deep dive into specific parts of
the company’s business. Moreover, the interviews could focus more on the strategic feedback from the experts to
increase firms’ capacity to conduct an innovation process.

The quality of the interviewing experts and the post interview analysis will be key. Interaction with the top
management of a company and the need to provide feedback require that the interviewing experts are credible
partners with substantial professional experience and a comprehensive understanding of the public innovation
support system. It is also critical to ensure that the information from the interviews is properly analyzed and used
in policy making.

       Smart Labs

       Smart Labs (SLs) are expert groups built around firms in a selected business area. Smart Labs in principle com-
       prise up to 10 “champion” companies selected during the interviews representing an economic area with a perceived
       endogenous strength (e.g., smart buildings, recycling, or computer numerical control [CNC] machines). SLs also include
       representatives of RDIs, universities and science entities, BSIs, and local authorities. The SLs have up to 20 participants
       and follow practices modeled on business focus groups. They are led by an experienced business expert (the World
       Bank experts led SLs in the initial stage; future SLs should be led by a regional consultant, possibly with help from local
       business angels and BSI experts) and usually last about four hours.

       Smart Labs are a key proposed element of the EDP and smart specialization policy. The main aim of Smart Labs is to
       help validate, specify in more detail, and/or modify existing smart specializations and identify emerging ones. Smart Labs
       are designed to quickly test the potential of a business area and prepare a midterm strategy for its development. This is
       achieved in several steps (see Figure 5). SLs may be organized through regional, interregional, or national initiatives. The
       whole process should, in principle, take no longer than six months and be repeated for all new areas of interest. At every
       stage the SL can result in a “by-product” in terms of individual or joint research and development and innovation (R&D&I)
       project applications to regional EU-funded operational programs (OPs), sectoral OPs (managed by NCBR), national OPs
       (managed by the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development [PARP]), and the EU-wide Horizon 2020 program.

The main benefits of Smart Labs:

•	 They are a fast, flexible, and efficient way to assess the R&D/innovation-based potential of a selected economic area
   and thus help validate, deepen, or modify existing smart specializations.

•	 Participation in SLs is driven by a bottom-up process of selecting companies with high growth potential, minimizing
   the power of vested interests. Thanks to the careful selection of participants, the quality of outputs tends to be high.

•	 SLs apply a mezzo perspective that concentrates on a business area and not on individual firms.

•	 The SL process is stage-driven and aims to work like a filter that selects the most promising areas. The process can
   be halted after each stage.

•	 SLs are not formally institutionalized to reduce the risk of bureaucratic inertia and mission creep.

•	 SLs are business-oriented and business-friendly to help sustain interest of the private sector.

•	 SLs help initiate collaboration between the private sector, public sector, and academia.

•	 SLs help identify emerging business and technology trends and thus give rise to new smart specializations.

•	 SLs help generate ideas for R&D and innovation projects to be submitted to regional, national, and international calls
   for proposals (Horizon 2020).

•	 SLs help reduce coordination failures among the participating companies, which are too small to promote ideas and
   technologies on their own.

•	 Through BTRs, SLs help align the private sector’s development vision and investment plans with smart specialization
   priorities.

•	 They help identify key growth bottlenecks and adjust public policy accordingly

Smart Labs can provide a useful format for industry-level value-chain analyses. SLs can help identify the ele-
ments of the value chain with the highest added value and ways of moving there. This approach was tested during
the project. For instance, the nanotechnology Smart Lab in the Slaskie region helped identify the main development
challenges for this young sector. Challenges include difficulties with the regulatory process (certification, registration,
and security confirmation) and a preponderance of companies that produce component parts rather than final prod-
ucts, where there is more added value. The Smart Lab concluded that there is a need to: (i) concentrate on connecting
the nanotechnology industry with other sectors that can use its products and bring them to the final stages of the
value chain, (ii) update the regulatory system in line with Western European good practices, and (iii) promote further
internationalization of the nanotechnology industry (see Chapter 4 for more details).

The case of Smart Labs on “CNC machines” has proven that a bottom-up EDP is possible. The Smart Lab process
was initiated after a number of interviews in the Dolnoslaskie region showed that the area of CNC material processing
has significant business and innovation potential. That finding was then discussed and deepened during two regional
Smart Labs, which were followed by preparation of a BTR together with a business leader who emerged during the SLs.
The subsequent national Smart Lab corroborated the findings of the BTR and the overall potential of the CNC area in
Poland, and the national smart specialization working group took over the process. In a final step, the findings of the
Smart Lab process helped verify the national smart specialization no. 17 on “automation and robotics of technology
processes” and shape its vision of development.

Smart Labs focused on CNC showed that the process can also help meet additional objectives. Aside from its
main focus on smart specializations, the Smart Lab process on CNC machines: (i) helped create a new network of firms,
scientists, BSIs, and public-sector officials focused on the development of the CNC area; (ii) generated new knowledge
among the stakeholders and firms in related industries (through the BTR and other SL results, including a strengths,




                                                                                                                              xxiii
       weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and key success factors, which will be made public); (iii) helped
       guide public and private technology and business development strategies; and (iv) is likely to generate new R&D&I
       projects to be submitted to regional, national, and international innovation programs.

       Business and technology roadmaps (BTRs) help verify the potential of selected business areas. A BTR is a short
       (about 50 pages) business-style document that can be delivered in around three months and at a relatively low cost.
       Its objective is to: (i) analyze the business and scientific potential of a specific economic activity (for instance “CNC
       machines,” as undertaken in the project) to verify/modify existing smart specializations or identify new ones; (ii) assess
       the main business and technology trends in a specific economic activity; (iii) describe the main market players in Poland,
       Europe, and worldwide; and (iv) provide a roadmap of R&D and innovation investment, with corresponding budgets,
       that could help create a critical mass of innovation-based development for the selected business area. The BTRs should
       be made public, in order to share knowledge among all Polish market players and guide their investment decisions,
       as well as to help firms align their development plans with smart specializations. BTRs should be prepared by external
       experts supported by selected firms and academia, with costs shared between the public and private sectors.

       Going forward, SLs can complement working groups at the regional and national levels. The added value of SLs
       lies in their flexible format, fast turnaround, quick results, and limited life span. As such, they could be a useful instru-
       ment to quickly assess the innovation-based development potential of a large number of existing and/or emerging
       regional and national business areas and provide timely input into the existing EDPs at the regional and national levels.
       Unlike the working groups, SLs are not meant to become permanent institutions, unless the participants decide to
       transform them into cooperation networks, clusters, or knowledge-sharing platforms.

       High-quality participants, experts, and immediate feedback are key. SLs are likely to be successful only if they
       feature participants (entrepreneurs and scientists) who rise high above the industry average. They should be moder-
       ated by experienced professionals who carry credibility among the private-sector participants. Finally, all participants,
       and especially the private sector, expect timely and productive feedback after each of the SLs, in the form of meeting
       summaries, clear action plans, and a vision of how the SL can provide added value going forward.


       Innovation maps

       There has been little effort so far to analyze data from the private sector’s R&D and innovation-oriented grant
       applications, both at the national and regional levels. Public-sector institutions at the national and regional levels
       have collected thousands of applications for R&D support from the private sector since the EU accession in 2004. Yet,
       even though such applications provide excellent bottom-up information about the new emerging business and tech-
       nology trends perceived by the private sector, there has been no systemic effort to leverage the data to inform public
       innovation policy and complement other analyses, including foresight exercises. Given that each grant application
       requires the applying firm to co-finance the project, the information in the applications is likely to be more credible
       than the firms’ official declarations (firms are “putting money where their mouth is”).

       Innovation maps help uncover critical bottom-up information embedded in firms’ R&D applications for public
       support. The idea of an innovation map is to collect and analyze data from thousands of grant applications submitted
       annually to national and regional innovation support institutions. For instance, NCBR accepts more than 1,500 grant appli-
       cations per year. From 2007 to 2013, as part of the “Innovative Economy Operational Program,” NCBR collected more than
       13,000 grant applications across all of its support programs. The objective of the data analysis is to create “innovation maps”
       built along a business/technology matrix, combining the business area of a grant application (Organisation for Economic
       Co-operation and Development [OECD] classification) with the technological classification (NABS 2007), to identify business
       and technology trends and new areas of competitive strengths based on the preferences revealed by the private sector.




xxiv
Innovation maps have the following benefits:

•	 They can complement the top-down foresight programs, macro and sectoral data, and innovation surveys with a
   bottom-up approach.

•	 They can help verify/modify/create smart specializations selected at the national and regional levels based on the
   revealed preferences of the private sector and thus help better prioritize public support for innovation and enhance
   its efficiency.

•	 They can help monitor business and technology trends in real time, based on an online, standardized, and auto-
   mated system of submission of enterprise grant applications.

•	 They can provide credible and granular information: grant submissions are based on the statistical code of a project, not
   of a firm (where there are many). The data can be analyzed with respect to the status of the applicant (private vs. public
   sector), whether it has been accepted or rejected, and show the regional distribution of applications around the country.

Innovation maps produced within the project helped identify key priorities for business innovation spend-
ing. NCBR, with the support of the Bank, has produced the first set of innovation maps (see Chapter 4) based on more
than 1,000 applications received so far within the new, open-ended, “fast track” innovation support program started
in April 2015. The innovation maps showed that “health & medicine” (NABS 7) is the key technology that the private
sector wants to invest in; “electronics and IT engineering” is in turn the key business area of declared investment
(OECD 2.2), followed by “mechanical engineering” and “material engineering.” The maps also showed that most appli-
cations were received from the Mazowieckie and Slaskie regions.

Going forward, innovation maps should become a default option for all innovation support institutions. Fol-
lowing the NCBR’s example, which has now decided to use innovation maps in all of its application processes, other
public support institutions at the national level, such as PARP or the Ministry of Economic Development, and at the
regional level (ROP/RIS3 units in each of the regions) could produce their own innovation maps to support policy
making. Innovation maps should ideally aggregate data from a number of support programs to reach a critical mass
of information. Given the small administrative and technical effort required, there are no obvious barriers preventing
innovation maps from being used universally around the country. The resulting innovation maps should also be avail-
able to the public (posted on the respective websites) to help guide the developmental visions of the private sector.
The Ministry of Economic Development could, for instance, aggregate standardized data from all support institutions
and produce a comprehensive national innovation map.


Crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing is a new platform to directly engage SMEs in innovation policy making. Crowdsourcing allows
authorities to reach out to a large number of SMEs that cannot be directly engaged through the limited number of
interviews and Smart Labs. It is modeled on international benchmarks, such as the U.S. Open Government initiative,
and a review of the literature, but adjusted to the specific conditions in Poland. Crowdsourcing is meant to be a cost-
effective, flexible, and fast way to establish a systematic dialogue between the private and the public sectors. It aims to
seek the private sector’s feedback on, for instance, priority areas for policy intervention, barriers to innovation-based
growth, emerging business and technological trends, or the efficiency of public support policy, on an ongoing basis.
Crowdsourcing can also be used to help identify firms that could later be interviewed within the EDP and invited to
Smart Labs. Crowdsourcing thus complements the other elements of the EDP process.

Analysis of data received through crowdsourcing is largely in line with the analysis produced through firm
interviews. More than 70 percent of the respondents in the Bank-administered firm survey believed that the application




                                                                                                                                xxv
       process for innovation public support was too long and too complicated, which is consistent with the information
       gained in the interviews. The quantitative data also seemed to match the data set collected during firm interviews. The
       most important constraints for SMEs included access to financing, legislation, and availability of hard and soft skills. The
       crowdsourced companies relied on internal company resources, customers, and the Internet to foster innovation.

       Going forward, proper incentives for firms to participate in crowdsourcing and commitment from the public
       sector will be key. So far, the public sector has used surveys to reach out to companies on an ad hoc basis; only a few
       companies have been exposed to the public sector’s surveys, if at all. As a result, both a low level of trust and a low
       level of dialogue have been established. To change this, it will be important for the public sector to start using online
       surveys on a regular basis and thus create a new cultural norm. To make it work, firms will need incentives to partici-
       pate in the surveys. These could include, for instance, information on how the participating companies compare with
       their industry peers or access to technology/business newsletters from the BSIs. Many firms did not fill out the survey
       because they believed it would not have any impact. Changing this perception is therefore crucial. Making crowd-
       sourcing successful will likely be a slow process, but it needs to start now.


       Conclusions and recommendations

       The proposed EDP, “made in Poland,” appears to meet the project’s main objectives:

       •	 It offers a new way to conduct innovation policy based on a bottom-up process of entrepreneurial discovery, which
          helps to monitor/validate/modify and/or eliminate existing smart specializations. The proposed EDP engages the
          whole set of stakeholders and puts companies at the very center of innovation policy.

       •	 It helps identify new smart specializations by collecting and analyzing firm-level data about emerging technological
          and business trends and areas with innovation-based growth potential.

       •	 It helps distinguish enterprises’ deeper needs and their innovation potential, and it proposes how to adjust public-
          sector support instruments accordingly.

       •	 It helps reinforce linkages between regional, interregional, and national smart specialization policies.

       •	 It helps ensure the sustainability of the EDP process going forward.

       •	 It is likely to be in line with the ex ante conditionality of the European Commission (subject to the independent deci-
          sion of the EC).

The EDP also tries to meet additional objectives. It helps:

•	 Identify the characteristics of firms with high innovation-based growth potential (for the purposes of the project,
   called “champions” and “sleeping beauties”; see the definitions in Box 18)

•	 Introduce a new scoring system to assist in identifying firms with high innovation-based growth potential

•	 Identify emerging business and technology trends

•	 Reduce coordination failures in the private sector, where small companies on their own are unable to develop their
   innovative ideas without cooperating with others

•	 Access new information from firms that up to now have not taken part in the smart specialization process and have
   not been leveraging public sector resources

•	 Generate new R&D&I project ideas from participating stakeholders

•	 Provide a new platform for enhanced dialogue with the business sector

•	 Provide a new way for firms to network

•	 Offer a direct way of increasing the participating firms’ innovation capacity by providing interview feedback and
   follow-up knowledge sharing and training with the BSIs

•	 Enhance knowledge and technology absorption by producing publicly available industry business and technology
   roadmaps

The proposed EDP can productively complement regional EDPs. The EDP is not mandatory for any of the regions,
which are autonomous in their decision making. There is also no “one-size-fits-all” model to carry out EDP. However,
every region is expected to develop a fully functioning EDP that meets the objective of the EC’s smart specializa-
tion policy. The proposed EDP can help regions achieve this objective by complementing the efforts of the regions
that have already developed EDPs and by contributing to the design of EDPs that are still being developed by other
regions. The modular framework of the proposed EDP elements should facilitate its adoption.

The EDP can help enhance the efficiency of public innovation policy. It can achieve this in a number of ways.
First, as one of the first systemic attempts in Poland to involve the private sector in the development of the country’s
innovation priorities, it can help find an optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up innovation policy mak-
ing. Second, it can help concentrate scarce resources, reach a critical mass of investment, and build trust between the
private and public sectors along the same vision of innovation-based development. Third, it promises to enhance
cooperation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing among all public-sector stakeholders and between the national
and regional levels of public administration. Finally, it provides a robust instrument for monitoring and evaluation of
the impact of public policies on enterprise innovation.

However, a number of conditions will need to be met for the EDP to function properly. First, a successful EDP
will require a significant increase in the capacity of innovation support units at the national and regional levels. Sec-
ond, it will be critical to improve the efficiency of BSIs, including by increasing their capacity, clarifying objectives, and
introducing strong incentives. Third, the EDP will need to be supported by a strong monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
system and systemic feedback from and to policy makers. Finally, it will also need an improved business environment,
enhanced quality of innovation, and entrepreneurship education, as well as strong leadership across all levels of public
administration and in the private sector. Table 1 summarizes the main recommendations.

1 Introduction
Despite spectacular economic performance since the beginning of transition in 1989, Poland is a regional lag-
gard in terms of innovation outputs. The levels of total and private R&D spending are below the European average
and regional peers. The innovation outputs are also underperforming. The economy’s exports are mostly based on
low-tech rather than high-tech industries. Poland continues to compete largely on price rather than on the quality of
its products and services.

Innovation will be key to help sustain fast growth and catch up with the West for the first time in Poland’s his-
tory. The question is not whether Poland will stop growing without innovation (it will likely not, at least not any time
soon) but whether the growth rate can be further enhanced owing to more innovation. While Poland moves closer to
the global technology frontier, the role of innovation and R&D is likely to increase gradually, in line with the experience
of more developed countries, where R&D spending and innovation outputs were a key driver of increasing incomes.
Expanded technology absorption and more robust frontier innovation could help increase Poland’s potential growth
rate to closer to 4 percent per year and help sustain rapid income and quality-of-life convergence with Western Europe.

The European Commission adopted a new “smart” innovation framework to maximize the contribution of
innovation to economic growth and social welfare. This shall be accomplished by prioritizing public support for
innovation to economic activities (defined as “smart specializations”) that promise to have the largest developmental
potential based on existing competitive advantages and endogenous strengths. Research and innovation strategies
for smart specialization (RIS3s) are the main elements of the new innovation framework, and their role is to help iden-
tify national and regional economic smart specializations. The European Commission has made the development of
RIS3s a key criterion for accessing EU Structural Funds during 2014–2020.1

The “entrepreneurial discovery process” (EDP) is a key element of the new smart specialization framework.
The aim of the EDP is to help countries and regions identify, validate, and modify smart specializations based on a
bottom-up approach involving the private sector, science, business support institutions, NGOs, public administration,
and society. The EDP should help maximize public–private entrepreneurial discoveries; provide for systematic obser-
vation, detection, and evaluation of new business and technological trends; and encourage firms to share their market
and technology knowledge with policy makers. It should also support the early growth of the selected activities, dis-
seminate knowledge to generate more discoveries, and build a critical mass of innovation. Lastly, the EDP should help
governments identify new business needs and opportunities and adjust public innovation policies and instruments
accordingly.

This report summarizes the results of the World Bank project requested by Poland’s Ministry of Economic
Development to design and test the EDP for Poland. The report presents the findings based on the project’s activi-
ties undertaken between June 2014 and December 2015, including more than 500 in-depth firm interviews conducted
by Bank experts (and an additional 130 conducted by regional consultants working under the Bank’s supervision),
20 Smart Lab meetings, four workshops with business support institutions, multiple training workshops for regional
consultants, and extensive consultations with the national and regional stakeholders.

        2  “WHY”—Why Poland Needs Innovation to Grow
        Poland is Europe’s growth champion since 1989. It has more than doubled its GDP per capita since the beginning of
FIGURE 6 (This text is FPO/for Identifying only)
        post-socialist transition, coming ahead of all other new EU member states and the EU-15 (Figure 6). It has also fared well
        relative to its global peers: since 1995, Poland has grown faster than all large economies at a similar level of develop-
        ment, as reflected in average growth in GDP per capita.2 Exports have increased more than 25-fold since the beginning
        of the transition and exceeded $250 billion in 2015. After 23 years of uninterrupted growth from 1992 to 2015, including
        during the 2008–2009 global financial crisis, when it was the only EU economy not to sink into a recession, Poland is
        close to beating the historical growth records of South Korea and Japan.

        As a result, income levels and quality of life have never been higher. In 2015, the level of income adjusted for
        purchasing power parity (PPP) per person exceeded $26,000 and reached 66 percent of the level of income in the euro
        zone, the highest absolute and relative level since 1500 A.D.3 The quality of life has increased in tandem, as reflected
        in international well-being ratings such as the OECD Better Life index, where Poland does better than what its income
        level alone would suggest. Poland seems to be on the cusp of a new Golden Age.

        Poland’s growth has largely been driven by labor productivity. Between 1997 and 2006, Poland’s labor produc-
        tivity increased at an average annual rate of 4.6 percent, above most regional peers, and more than twice as fast as in
        the United States (Figure 7). Between 2007 and 2012, rapid productivity growth continued, albeit at a slower pace of

        2.8 percent per year, largely because of the negative impact of the global crisis. Nonetheless, labor productivity still
        grew faster than among most peers, and much faster than in the EU-28 and the United States.4

        Note: countries sorted from the slowest to fastest productivity growth during 2007–2012.


        Growth in labor productivity has been led by increases in TFP. Total factor productivity (TFP) measures growth
        in labor productivity that cannot be accounted for by increases in capital intensity. It is thus a measure of “pure” pro-
        ductivity, which reflects changes in the quality of human capital, management practices, technological innovation,
        and other productivity enhancing factors. Since 1996, TFP growth represented almost two-thirds of total GDP growth,
        better than in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and southern Europe (Figure 8).

        Robust productivity growth does not seem to have been driven by R&D. In 2014, R&D spending amounted to only
        0.9 percent of GDP, placing Poland at the tail end of EU rankings.5 Business R&D spending (BERD) was particularly low,
        at only 0.3 percent of GDP and one-third of total R&D spending. These results put Poland behind all peer countries and
        far below the EU-28 average (Figure 9). A combination of the low level of innovation and high economic growth rate
        represents an interesting puzzle (Box 1).

        4
         	 Unlike in many emerging markets, Poland’s growth has not been driven by the sale of natural resources or financial leverage. Poland is a net
           energy importer: in 2012, energy imports represented 26 percent of energy use (World Bank’s World Development Indicators). Its public and
           private debt levels are below the European average: in 2014, general government debt amounted to around 50 percent of GDP, compared to
           the EU-28 average of almost 90 percent of GDP; private-sector debt amounted to 78 percent of GDP versus 113 percent in Hungary, 82 percent
           in the Czech Republic, and 110 percent in Germany (Eurostat).

    Poland is a regional laggard in terms of innovation output. The 2015 Innovation Union Scoreboard ranks Poland
    fifth from the bottom among EU countries and classifies it as a “moderate innovator.” The share of innovative enter-
    prises among all industrial enterprises is the second lowest in the EU (23 percent of the total), ahead of only Romania

                       Poland—A Growth Champion Despite Low Innovation                                                                    BOX 1

    The combination of Poland’s high growth and low innovation is a puzzle. There are a couple of possible
    explanations.
    First, Poland may belong to a small category of countries that can grow without innovation or R&D. This has been
    the case for Spain, Slovakia, and Ireland, which have achieved high incomes while investing only small amounts
    in R&D (Spain invested less than 1.2 percent of GDP in R&D during 2002–2012; Ireland invested 1.3 percent of GDP,
    and Slovakia only 0.6 percent). However, the vast majority of all other successful countries have invested substan-
    tial amounts in R&D.
    Second, at Poland’s level of development, technology absorption, especially facilitated by large FDI, can provide
    a productivity boost that is larger and more sustainable than what is usually assumed.
    Third, private sector’s R&D spending may simply be underreported. This is because many companies, especially
    small ones, (i) find it difficult to properly classify R&D spending among other types of investment, (ii) are worried
    about tax inspection questioning their R&D accounting, and (iii) believe that accounting for R&D spending may be
    unprofitable from a tax point of view—R&D investment needs to be capitalized and then gradually amortized as
    opposed to classifying it as other operational costs that can be written off against the tax base right way. Poland’s
    fiscal incentives for enterprise R&D have so far been among the least generous among OECD countries.
    Innovation may be similarly underreported. This is because the standard Oslo Manual definitions of what repre-
    sents a product, process, marketing, and organizational innovation may not be sufficiently clear to the surveyed
    companies, especially when unaided by clear examples and explanations (EBRD, 2014). Further research is needed
    to explain this puzzle.

    Polish enterprises seem to be particularly struggling with product and process innovation. Poland achieves
    poor results in innovation across both the manufacturing and service sectors, relative to peer countries such as Ger-
    many and the Czech Republic (Figure 11). In particular, only 8 percent of manufacturing firms introduced product or
    process innovations, versus 14 percent and 22 percent in the Czech Republic and Germany, respectively. Organiza-
    tional and marketing innovation also lags, although less so.

    Despite low R&D and innovation spending, Poland’s growth prospects remain surprisingly positive. According
    to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in 2016 and 2017, Poland is projected to grow at around 3.5 percent per year
    and be among the top three most dynamic EU economies.7 It is also projected to grow 2 percentage points faster than
    the euro zone. In the longer term, Poland’s GDP is projected to expand at 3.6 percent per year until 2020, above all
    regional peers and the euro zone average (Figure 12). As a result, Poland’s level of income per capita PPP would exceed
    70 percent of the euro zone level by 2020, the highest relative level on record.8

    Short- and medium-term growth is likely to continue to be driven by technology absorption and high price
    competitiveness. Poland’s productivity per hour amounts to less than half of that in Germany and only 40 percent
    of that in the United States.9 This suggests that there is still large scope for productivity growth based on technology
    absorption, FDI, and nontechnological improvements. Based on past trends, price competitiveness is also likely to
    remain high, as reflected in low real unit labor costs, which have been consistently falling since 1996 (Figure 13).

    But more innovation could help raise the growth rate in the medium term. Although detailed analyses are
    needed, more robust innovation could likely help increase the potential GDP growth rate, which the National Bank
    of Poland (NBP) estimates to amount to around 3.0 percent during 2015-16,10 to closer to 4 percent and thus help to
    further raise the pace of income convergence.

Innovation will be key to fully catch up with the West. As Poland moves closer to the technology frontier, the role
of innovation and R&D is likely to gradually increase. This would be in line with the experience of more developed
countries, where R&D spending and innovation increased together with incomes (Figure 14). In fact, there is hardly any
country that has ever managed to catch up with the West without large investment in R&D and a high level of innova-
tion, including Japan, Taiwan, and, more recently, South Korea. As an illustration, assuming average per capita income
growth at 3 percent for Poland and 1.5 percent for the euro zone, an additional half a percentage point of GDP growth
per year driven by innovation would allow Poland to catch up with the euro zone level of income per capita PPP in
2036, eight years earlier than in the baseline scenario. Without innovation, the full convergence might not be possible

    But higher innovation is not automatic and requires a fundamental change in business mind-sets. Polish enter-
    prises on the whole do not yet seem to consider innovation as the key element of competitiveness, as shown in the
    Bank’s enterprise survey discussed later in the text and as confirmed by other studies.12 This may be for a number of
    reasons. First, the lack of an innovation history may restrict the set of choices Polish firms face: in the same way that
    people like songs that they have already heard, Polish companies seem to prefer to stick to drivers of competitiveness
    that they already know and eschew R&D innovation, which they do not have much experience in. Second, there are
    not enough examples of companies that have become successful due to innovation. Third, given the large size of the
    domestic economy, competitive pressures may be weaker than in smaller countries, where SMEs have no choice but to
    innovate to be able to expand their markets and grow. Finally, the traditional educational system may not generate a
    sufficient number of graduates with entrepreneurial mind-sets.

    High price competitiveness may blunt incentives for enterprises to innovate. Polish companies benefit from very
    competitive labor costs relative to labor productivity, high-quality human capital, flexible labor markets, a competitive
    nominal exchange rate, an increasingly conducive business climate, and one of the lowest tax rates in Europe. In this
    kind of environment, firms do not innovate because they do not yet need innovation to survive.

    But high price competitiveness will not last forever. Labor productivity cannot increase endlessly without more
    R&D and innovation. Labor costs also cannot continue to grow slower than productivity, especially in the environment
    of an impending demographic decline and aging population. The exchange rate is not likely to remain weak, either.

Finally, Poland’s competitiveness in international markets will be increasingly challenged by emerging champions in
other parts of the world, including China in particular, whose exports are rapidly becoming more sophisticated.

The generous 2014–2020 EU budget is possibly the last chance to change Poland’s DNA and help companies
start innovating. Although Polish companies still have some time left to grow based on price competitiveness and
imports of foreign technology, they now have a unique opportunity to learn how to innovate before the EU funds run
out and price competitiveness declines. This chance should not be missed. Otherwise, Poland’s growth could stall, and
the country may never catch up with the West.

The public support system will need to fundamentally change to help Polish enterprises develop and be com-
petitive internationally. The existing public innovation support system does not seem to provide sufficient incen-
tives for companies to engage in R&D and innovation. This is due to risk aversion, suboptimal selection processes,
and weak impact and evaluation systems. In addition, public support institutions often do not have clear objectives,
robust incentive systems, and strong performance evaluation frameworks. The innovation system also struggles with
identifying companies and economic activities with the highest potential for innovation-based growth. Finally, there
has also been a disconnect between the objectives of public support programs and the results. For instance, funds
were spent on technology absorption rather than innovation, on large enterprises rather than SMEs, and on R&D in
low-tech rather than R&D in high-tech.13 As a result, the huge expenditures on innovation during the last EU budget
period (2007–2013) had a mixed impact. This needs to change.

     3  “HOW”—The Role of the Entrepreneurial Discovery
     Process in Enhancing Innovation
     3.1  The concept of smart specialization, RIS3, and EDP

     The European Commission adopted a new “smart” innovation framework for the 2014–2020 financial per-
     spective. The new framework is based on the concept of smart specialization (see Box 2) developed by Foray, van
     Ark, and others14 and based on earlier research by Rodrik and Hausmann.15 The smart specialization framework is a
     key instrument for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy (E2020) to promote “smart, sustainable and
     inclusive” growth.16

     The main objective of the new “smart” innovation framework is to maximize innovation’s contribution to eco-
     nomic growth and social welfare. This should be achieved by prioritizing public support for innovation on economic
     activities (smart specializations) that have the largest developmental potential based on existing comparative advan-
     tages and endogenous strengths. Smart specialization is not about selecting priorities from the top down, but about
     stimulating a dynamic, ongoing, and bottom-up entrepreneurial process of discovering new specialization areas that
     the public sector could support to accelerate economic growth. Smart specialization policy is not about “where to
     invest,” but about “how to help firms to discover where to invest and how to implement the policy according to what
     has been discovered.”17

                                              Definitions of smart specialization                                     BOX 2

          “Smart specialization is an innovative policy concept which emphasizes the principle of prioritization in a verti-
          cal logic (to favor some technologies, fields, population of firms) and defines a method to identify such desirable
          areas for innovation policy intervention.”
          Source: Foray and Goenaga (2013).

          “Smart specialization is a new form of industrial policy, which builds on the idea of economic specialization and
          the ability of a country/region to build a competitive advantage on unique, locally based expertise that can be
          applied in a new and innovative manner. Smart specialization is a dynamic process, where the national or regional
          specializations are selected from among many potential economic activities identified in an ongoing process of

     Research and innovation strategies for smart specialization (RIS3s) are the main element of the new innova-
     tion framework. The European Commission has made the development of RIS3s, innovation strategies based on the
     smart specialization concept, a key criterion for accessing EU Structural Funds during 2014–2020.18 RIS3s should help
     identify the national and regional economic smart specializations based on the existing strengths and capabilities that
     could be leveraged by innovation. It should help concentrate scarce resources, avoid fragmentation and duplication,
     and achieve a critical mass for an innovation-based economic change. An RIS3 should help trigger structural transfor-
     mation of a national or a regional economy by generating clusters of firms with enough spillover effects and econo-
     mies of agglomeration to transform the region from “periphery” to a “center.” Prioritization of business areas that are
     not identified as economic sectors in the traditional sense then becomes a core element of an RIS3.

RIS3s should actively engage key stakeholders, identify principal challenges, and provide an action plan. The
business community, academia, administration, and society at large should collaborate to develop an RIS3. The RIS3
should also indicate key challenges facing the region and its endogenous potential based on SWOT analysis. Each RIS3
should be accompanied by an action plan that (i) establishes governance structures and processes, (ii) develops robust
M&E systems to enable just-in-time decision making similar to the one applied in the private sector, (iii) focuses on
specific programs and projects to help achieve the desired outcomes, and (iv) outlines available budgetary resources
for R&D&I. Finally, the RIS3 should explain how it will help to ensure the socioeconomic transformation of each region
and of the country as a whole. Box 3 presents a definition of RIS3.

The “entrepreneurial discovery process” (EDP) is the basic element of the RIS3 and the smart specialization
framework. Within the EU innovation framework, an RIS3 should be focused on a process that systematically identi-
fies, validates, and modifies priorities for public policy rather than on a one-off choice of smart specializations per se.
The EDP allows for this continuity. Although there are many definitions of EDP (see Box 4), the main objective is to iden-
tify new areas of growth with the highest developmental potential that should become the priority for public support.
The EDP should help select smart specializations based on a bottom-up approach driven by market and technological
opportunities discovered by firms rather than the traditional top-down approach of the public sector.

The EDP should place business at the center of the innovation process. Through this process, the government
should “listen” to firms and design innovation support accurately adapted to firms’ growth potential. The choice of
policy priorities should “involve an interactive process, in which the private sector is discovering and producing infor-
mation about new activities and the government assesses potential and then empowers those actors most capable
of realizing the potential.”19 The EDP should also help (i) remove barriers for cooperation between public and private
sectors, (ii) identify firms that promise to benefit the most from public support, and (iii) adjust the public support
instruments to the needs of the priority firms.20

The EDP should promote smart specializations focused on new activities between sectors rather than spe-
cific industries. The idea is to identify new (undiscovered) business areas rather than whole sectors, as the latter
could transform smart specialization into an old-fashioned industrial policy. These new areas should be found at the
intersections of economic sectors, which should develop faster thanks to their novelty, diversity, and innovation that
creates new products and services as well as new marketing and organizational solutions. This could also involve
revamping traditional sectors by mixing them with new economic areas or focusing on their particular elements from
a new viewpoint. The new business areas should not be to too general in order not to become a horizontal policy, nor
too detailed, because they should have enough potential to impact a regional or national economy. (See Box 5 for
characteristics of EDP goals and processes.)

           “The entrepreneurial discovery process (EDP) aims to identify areas with the potential to achieve critical mass
           based on local (endogenous) resources, e.g. qualified labor, natural resources, clusters, R&D expertise, etc. Stake-
           holders representing the quadruple helix (business, R&D, society, administration) should be empowered and
           actively participate in the process of discovering viable potential areas. Smart specialization should not be mis-
           taken for the economic specialization or economic strength of a country/region. While the latter is an important
           element in the development of smart specialization, it is not sufficient or necessary. Smart specialization emerges
           where there is the potential to combine R&I and industry, where there is an ambition for excellence and where
           market niches are identified. Areas selected as smart should create exceptional added value (return on investment
           above the average growth path of a country/region) and later spill over to other sectors of the economy, thus
           enhancing overall performance and productivity.”

           “The entrepreneurial discovery process is a learning process to select research, development and innovation
           (R&D+I) as well as non-technological activities in which a region can hope to excel. . . . [I]t’s a vision about oppor-
           tunities in existing or emerging sectors. The concept suggests that entrepreneurs and public stakeholders are
           exploring, experimenting and learning what an industry or even better players in a market niche should do in
           the field of R&D+I and non-technological innovation to build unique competitive advantage. This concept can be
           applied in all regions. For instance, traditional regions can modernize their agro-food or tourism sectors by invest-
           ing in ICT, design, or new distribution channels, while industrial regions can stimulate cooperation on the frontiers
           of two sectors/clusters, such as health and ICT, design and furniture or support the diversification of SMEs. . . . This
           requires that regions collect and analyze data regarding markets, technologies, skills, knowledge transfer, capa-
           bilities, institutional agility, business models, global competition by sectors and by groups of regional enterprises
           and investing accordingly, instead of scattering their support.”

     Vertical, smart specialization policies need to be complemented by strong horizontal policies. Focus on spe-
     cific new business areas should not imply lack of emphasis on growth-enhancing horizontal policies, particularly those
     that promote firm entry and start-ups, access to financing, and fast and cheap exit. For entrepreneurial discovery to
     be efficient, much depends on the ease of market entry for new firms and opportunities for expansion of the existing
     firms. There is a strong link between government regulation and the strength of entrepreneurial discovery.21 Haus-
     mann and Rodrik (2003), for instance, recommend subsidizing the entry of firms into new markets, as the information
     about the new markets generated by first-movers is likely to spill over quickly to other firms and create large positive
     results. A conducive business environment is a basic condition for strong entrepreneurship and robust discovery. Hori-
     zontal policies are particularly important in the case of regions and countries with unclear specializations and where
     information on endogenous strengths is lacking.22

  Goals of the EDP process:
  1.	 Maximize public–private entrepreneurial discoveries;
  2.	 Provide operational facilities for continuous observation, detection, and evaluation;
  3.	 Encourage firms to share their market and technology knowledge with policy makers;
  4.	 Support early growth of the prioritized activities;
  5.	 Diffuse knowledge to generate more experiments and discoveries and build critical mass of innovation.
  Source: Foray and Rainoldi (2013).

  Examples of the EDP criteria to identify “new activities”:
  1.	 Aim at experimenting and discovering opportunities;
  2.	 Have the potential to generate learning spillovers;
  3.	 Are likely to generate desirable structural changes;
  4.	 Need public funding to emerge and grow (have scale and agglomeration economies, can fail because of coor-
      dination failures).
  For example, in the case of the pulp and paper industry, what needs to be prioritized is not the sector as such,
  but the activity of exploring the potential of nanotechnology to improve operational efficiency. In the case of the
  plastics industry, the process should not support the industry as such, but rather the exploration of how firms can
  diversify from the car industry to the medical sector.
  By focusing on “new activities,” the government (i) improves the general performance of a sector, (ii) builds capa-
  bilities, and (iii) looks for unexplored niches.

3.2  Smart specialization and EDP in Poland

Poland has developed separate RIS3s at the national and regional levels. The main objectives of the strategies
have been to (i) enhance the impact of public innovation support based on the lessons learned from the previous EU
2007–2013 financial perspective, (ii) prioritize public investments, and (iii) ensure access to EU funds. As of the end of
2015, all Polish regional governments had developed their own RIS3s. Some of them were voluntarily submitted for the
review of the European Commission as a part of a mandatory package related to the ROPs. The EC accepted all regional
and national operational programs in February 2015, which opened the door for EU support in the new budget per-
spective. However, the EC’s decision in many cases was conditional and required the regional and national authorities
to prepare action plans demonstrating how shortcomings identified by the EC, including incomplete EDPs, would be
eliminated by the end of 2016.

At the national level, the Ministry of Economic Development created the National Smart Specialization (KIS)
document. The KIS supplements the Enterprise Development Program, which in turn operationalizes Poland’s flag-
ship Innovation and Effectiveness Strategy: Dynamic Poland 2020 (SIEG2020). The KIS indicates 20 national smart spe-
cialization areas (see Box 14) and an institutional framework to develop them. That includes a separate working group
for each of the specializations, an Economic Observatory (EO), and several additional bodies. Smart specializations are
more specificially defined in an appendix to the KIS.

There are differences in the quality of RIS3 at the regional level. The process of preparation of the RIS3s began in
many regions on the basis of an old style top-down process, with little involvement from other stakeholders, especially




                                                                                                                             13
     from SMEs which are not the “usual suspects” and do not represent the incumbents. In a number of cases, the evi-
     dence supporting the choice of regional smart specializations left scope for improvement. In general, there is no single
     model of PPO in Poland, as shown in the selected regional EDPs below (Boxes 6-11). Other regions outside of Poland,
     such as Tuscany in Italy, have still different approaches (Box 12). In short, there is no “one size fits all” model of EDP.

                                                  EDP in Zachodniopomorskie                                                                                 BOX 6

       The Zachodniopomorskie region has started to experiment with its own entrepreneurial discovery process (EDP)
       based on a bottom-up selection of regional smart specializations (Figure 15). The innovation ecosystem is divided
       into three areas: (i) business; (ii) business environment, including RDIs; and (iii) the support system encompassing
       regional authorities, business support institutions (BSIs), clusters, and so forth. The private sector should have a
       leading role in deciding which areas of regional economy have the biggest potential and could become a smart
       specialization. Entrepreneurs can (i) submit business ideas about R&D projects in an open and ongoing call for
       proposals and indicate where they see the future of their business; (ii) participate in meetings with individual
       BSIs and RDIs to discuss possible synergies and identify areas where they could collaborate and develop future
       products and services; and (iii) participate in Smart Labs, based on the template tested by the World Bank, where
       entrepreneurs meet with other innovation stakeholders to verify information obtained from R&D project propos-
       als and meetings with BSIs/RDIs and to discuss the developmental potential of their activity. The EDP is also meant
       to help identify firms’ needs and growth barriers and to adjust the public support system.

The Slaskie region has been looking for its technological specializations since it developed its first innovation
strategy for the years 2003–2013, when it decided on its first areas of specialization and cooperation networks
started. This search was continued during a technological foresight process, the results of which were published
in 2006. There the main technological areas for the region were identified, on the basis of which a Technology
Development Program was developed for the years 2010–2020. During the implementation of the program, tech-
nology audits were initiated for companies in the region. Some 1,400 firms were audited in two stages. This pro-
cess led to the development of the Regional Innovation Strategy, in which the areas of specialization were further
discussed during conferences, workshops, and seminars with regional stakeholders. The main feature of Slaskie’s
approach is the concentration on technological, not economic, specialization areas. For each specialization area,
an observatory was established to lead and coordinate different initiatives and provide the analysis and research
needed to develop the specialization. These are complemented by regional competence centers and strategic
development visions with roadmaps for each specialization.

In 2015, the Dolnoslaskie region approved the strategic document Strategic Framework for Smart Specializations,
which elaborated on smart specializations preliminarily identified in the RIS3 strategy for the years 2012–2020. The
choice of the specializations was based on an analysis of key economic sectors, the most innovative sectors, and
fast-growing sectors. Additionally, the demand for innovation was checked on the basis of the company applica-
tions to the Regional Operational Program. The analysis helped identify economic potential for smart specializa-
tions. They were compared with the main science and technology areas chosen on the basis of their publication
intensity, patent activity, and participation in international research teams and industry consortia. The results of
the analyses of the economic and scientific potential were used to suggest key technology areas in the leading
sectors. They later underwent a public consultation process with various regional councils, clusters, and industry
representatives. When the areas of specialization were finally agreed upon, working groups for each specializa-
tion were established to develop a strategic vision for the development of each specialization.
Working groups (WGs) play a key role in the implementation of regional smart specialization policies. Each WG
comprises innovative entrepreneurs from the region, business support institutions, R&D units and universities
from Dolnoslaskie, and the regional government.
Working groups are expected to convene at least once every quarter. WGs aim to become platforms for exchange
of knowledge, experience, and opinion in economic and technological areas. They also aim to discuss new and
emerging growth opportunities in the region and propose directions of public intervention in innovation support.
The EDP is complemented by individual meetings with entrepreneurs and R&D units to identify scientific and
technology areas with high business potential.
The operation of working groups will be monitored through progress indicators to help achieve the goals stated
in the strategy as well as help identify emerging areas that might turn into new regional smart specializations.
All key stakeholder groups—business, science, BSIs, and the regional government—have a role to play in the
monitoring system. A special role falls to the regional government, which initiates, coordinates, and finances
activities of other actors in this context. It is also ultimately responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the
effects of the intervention.

     The selection of regional smart specializations through the EDP in the Swietokrzyskie region was based on a
     review of the existing economic and scientific data and potential (including existing R&D infrastructure), analyses
     of the financed R&D projects, granted patents, and interviews and workshops with stakeholders of the innovation
     system. The process resulted in the selection of four main smart specializations in the region and three supporting
     specializations, which are now being developed by individual consortia. Each consortium is made of key regional
     innovation players, including business associations, business support institutions, and universities. Members of
     the consortia are appointed by the Marshal Office on the basis of a candidate’s application—usually there are
     about 10 members in each consortium. A business support institution heads each consortium. The consortia are
     responsible for the development of a vision for each smart specialization: its operationalization, monitoring and
     evaluation, and stimulation of collaboration between enterprises and science.

     •	 A statistical analysis of the general level of innovation and competitiveness of the region, also in the interna-
        tional context
     •	 An analysis of economic concentrations in the region based on location quotients and shift-share analyses

        (RIM+) report by Technopolis, a consulting firm, and took part in research on smart specialization performed by
        Fraunhofer ISI for the European Commission.
     The results of this comprehensive research were supported by a panel discussion that included innovation policy
     experts with the knowledge of the regional economy. In addition, qualitative interviews led by experts were con-
     ducted with innovative companies and scientists representing the preliminary areas of specialization to better
     understand the real economic sectors behind the statistics. The interviews also helped identify members of work-
     ing groups whose task was to verify and diagnose each specialization and develop a strategic vision for its develop-
     ment. The working groups defined each new specialization and recommended directions for future development
     based on innovation, R&D, and new technologies. They also identified developmental milestones for each special-
     ization and areas of inter-sectorial innovation that could create synergies between the selected specializations.
     Finally, the specializations were tested in a pilot smart specialization competition for R&D vouchers.
     The Regional Innovation Strategy for Wielkopolskie combines specialization-specific and horizontal activities in
     six strategic programs. It was accepted by the regional parliament and the European Commission as fulfilling the
     ex ante conditionality. The development of the strategy also included an institutional learning process based
     on an interdepartmental team, which included departments responsible for the implementation of the regional
     development strategy and of the operational program.
     The implementation of the regional RIS3 and the Regional Operational Program as well as the results of each
     smart specialization process will be monitored by Wielkopolskie Smart Specialization Forum, whose membership
     includes a wide range of regional stakeholders from the public and private sectors and academia.

                                               EDP in Pomorskie                                               BOX 11

The Pomorskie region has developed its own bottom-up EDP model based on an open competition for proposals
from the private sector for smart specializations. The ideas for smart specializations are assessed by a board of
independent experts, who provide their recommendations to the regional authorities.
The Pomorskie EDP began in late 2013 with a consultation process to encourage innovation stakeholders to form
informal partnerships. At the same time, the authorities conducted an analysis to better describe the economic
profile of the region. In May 2014, the regional authorities announced an open competition for the region’s smart
specializations. During the two-month period, applications could be submitted by informal partnerships of com-
panies, research organizations, NGOs, and so forth. The applications had to include a description of the envisaged
smart specialization and its potential, a strategy for its development, as well as a standardized description of
envisaged R&D activity and large-scale (flagship) projects. In this first phase of the competition, 30 applications
were submitted, out of which 28 passed a formal and substantive assessment. There was an element of dialogue
during the phase of the substantive assessment—partnerships had a chance to improve their applications after
obtaining initial comments from the experts. Partnerships were encouraged to look for synergies, merge and
prepare a smaller number of more detailed ideas, and submit applications to the second phase of the application
process. In the second phase of the process, seven applications passed the assessment by the board of indepen-
dent experts. The winning partnerships did not have to formalize their status. Their sizes varied from 20 to 100
participants. Finally, in the last stage of the process, held in March 2015, four regional smart specializations were
selected by the regional authorities. These were the following:
•	 Technologies for offshore and harbor logistics
•	 Interactive technologies in the information-rich environment
•	 Eco-effective technologies for production, transmission, distribution, and consumption of energy and fuels
•	 Medical technologies for civilizational and aging diseases
Each specialization is supported by at least one partnership, and further negotiations will take place between
partnerships and the authorities to more specifically define the scope of specializations and public support
instruments.
The smart specialization selection process should be repeated regularly, offering an opportunity for other poten-
tial specializations to be assessed. A monitoring and evaluation system has also been put in place to verify prog-
ress of the selected specializations.

                                          The EDP in Tuscany, Italy                                           BOX 12

Entrepreneurial discovery in Tuscany consists of five phases:
1.	 Opportunity scanning: This phase (taking up to six months) analyzes available information about the region’s
    strengths and identifies opportunities where the region could develop based on a series of workshops with
    the local stakeholders. The goal of this stage is to prepare roadmaps to set goals for development in a given
    area and agree on milestones to achieve them.
2.	 Analysis and evaluation by a team of independent experts (three months): The roadmaps are evaluated by
    a group of independent (non-Tuscany) experts, including on the synergies among roadmaps for a number of
    new activities.
                                                                                                                   )

          3.	 Thematic workshops: Two plenary and eight thematic workshops are organized (within two months) to dis-
              cuss the roadmaps with a broader audience. The workshop proceedings are webcasted, and the results are
              posted online. The eight themes identified during the ongoing process were:
             •	 “Made in Italy”                       •	 Human capital
             •	 Smart cities                          •	 Green economy
             •	 Agribusiness                          •	 Tourism
             •	 Emerging clusters                     •	 Intensive sectors of the capital
          4.	 Rationalization and drafting of the preliminary version: The input from the previous stages is gathered
              and analyzed (three months) and a preliminary version of the Tuscany RIS3 is presented.
          5.	 Final version: The final version of the RIS3 is prepared. During this stage, two additional workshops are held
              to discuss the governance framework of the RIS3 process.

     Regional RIS3s could benefit from more sophisticated analysis to identify regional competitive advantages.
     Many analyses miss key economic output indicators, starting from productivity levels and growth rates or sectoral
     information on export patters and growth rates (see Box 13 for an example of a national-level productivity analysis).
     Regional RIS3s also tend to use rudimentary and sometimes outdated data from the National Statistics Office (GUS).
     Moreover, many strategies are generic on the action plans and implementation mechanisms. Finally, there is little
     emphasis on rigorous monitoring and evaluation frameworks and avoidance of conflicts of interest in evaluation.23

     As part of the RIS3 process, the central government identified a list of 20 national smart specializations. The
     MoED, the lead ministry in the RIS3 process, selected smart specializations based on a set of methods, including indus-
     trial foresight; political, economic, social, and technological factors (known as PEST analysis); statistical analysis; and
     public consultations (see KIS for details). The selected smart specializations include, for instance, “healthy food,” “medi-
     cal engineering,” and “intelligent creative technologies” (see Box 14 for the full list). The public support system will
     allocate extra points in the grant application process for projects that fit into smart specializations and reserve public
     innovation funds for smart specialization projects only.

          A pioneering analysis of the F01 enterprise data set made available to the National Bank of Poland by the National
          Statistics Office (GUS) shows patterns of total factor productivity (TFP) growth, a key measure of “pure productiv-
          ity,” across industries during 2006–2013 (Figure 16). The data show that the industries that boosted their overall TFP
          the most included “computers, electronics, optical equipment,” “other transport,” and “wearing apparel.” “Electri-
          cal equipment,” “other transport,” and “computers, electronics, optical equipment” were the leading industries
          in terms of internal productivity growth (as opposed to productivity growth based on changes in the structure
          of the industry, i.e., faster growth of more productive firms than of less productive firms). Because TFP growth is
          a strong measure of an industry’s productivity potential, policy makers should frequently use such analyses to
          select and then monitor smart specializations.

Size of employment is also key. In an ideal world, policy makers should want to promote industries that increase
productivity and have high employment at the same time. The F01 data set shows that the “food” sector had the
largest employment, but reported only an average increase in productivity growth (Figure 17). “Fabricated metal”,
“motor vehicles” and “furniture” where the three industries that combined high employment and fast productiv-
ity growth simultaneously.

     However, the KIS needs to further strengthen its entrepreneurial discovery process. This is an element of the
     national Action Plan that Poland submitted to the European Commission with a view to completing all requirements
     needed to ensure access to the EU funding for innovation during the 2014–2020 financial perspective. Poland indi-
     cated that it would develop the full concept of the EDP by the end of 2015 and share it with the European Commission
     in early 2016.


     3.3  Proposed entrepreneurial discovery process for Poland

     The Ministry of Economic Development has requested that the World Bank help design and test EDP “made in
     Poland.” The EDP process should be aligned with Poland’s key strategic documents on smart specializations, including




20
KIS in particular. The proposed EDP should: (i) involve socioeconomic partners, especially enterprises; (ii) integrate top-
down and bottom-up initiatives in the field of research and development; (iii) support evidence-based policy; and (iv)
help shift the innovation support system from being supply to demand driven. In response to the MoED’s request, the
World Bank committed to help design the new elements of the EDP and pilot them in four regions in Poland to assist in
identification, monitoring, and modification of smart specializations through direct interactions with enterprises. The
Bank also agreed to transfer the project’s know-how to local and national authorities to help ensure the sustainability
of the proposed EDP after 2015 (Box 15).

                      Objectives of the World Bank EDP project requested                                          BOX 15
                           by the Ministry of Economic Development
  The main objective of the project is to help design and test the entrepreneurial discovery process (EDP) “made in
  Poland,” a key element of the EC “smart” innovation framework and regional/national strategies for smart special-
  ization (RIS3) in the 2014–2020 financial perspective.
  The three main goals of the EDP project are to:
  •	 Assess the needs of enterprises for innovation and their development potential on the basis of in-depth
     interviews with a selected group of enterprises that fit into 10 (out of 20) national smart specializations selected
     by the MoED. These should then be linked with public intervention strategies to efficiently use the available
     funds to support Polish companies’ innovation in the 2014–2020 EU budget perspective.
  •	 Help fulfill the EC’s ex ante conditionalities related to the EDP. The project aims to:
    •	 actively engage the private sector to support innovation efforts and RIS3 policies at the national level
    •	 contribute to the development of evidence-based policy in respect to identification and development of
       smart specializations
    •	 design elements of a system that (i) are complementary to the national M&E system, (ii) deepen the under-
       standing of the current smart specializations, and (iii) support identification of new and emerging business
       and innovation areas based on technological, sectoral, and business trends
  •	 Strengthen the capacity of public administration and selected BSIs to ensure EDP continuity. Methodol-
     ogies and toolkits developed within the project will be shared with stakeholders. The Bank will also train domes-
     tic consultants and selected stakeholders in how to implement the proposed EDP. As a result, the capacity of
     the support system should be strengthened to enable independent continuation of the project and extension
     of the pilot on a national scale with coverage of the full range of national smart specializations. When relevant,
     the project will analyze good practices from other regions in Poland, Europe, and elsewhere and suggest how
     these could be used in the optimal way. The results of the projects will also be disseminated to the remaining
     12 regions that do not participate directly in the pilot project.

The EDP project helps complement ongoing EDP-related activities of public administration. As such, the World
Bank project supports the efforts made by the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Science and Higher
Education (MoSHE), the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development (PARP), the National Center for Research and Devel-
opment (NCBR), the National Centre for Science (NCN), and the EDP work conducted at the regional level.

The proposed EDP “made in Poland” comprises several components. They follow the principles of smart spe-
cialization strategies and the EDP process, are based on the European good practice, and borrow from successful
examples of innovation policies around the world. The proposed EDP system for Poland, likely one of the first of its
kind in Europe, includes (i) face-to-face firm-level interviews, (ii) Smart Labs, (iii) innovation policy crowdsourcing, and
(iv) innovation maps (see Figure 18). Each of the elements of the proposed EDP is described in detail below and main
findings and lessons learned are presented in Chapter 4.

     Smart interviews
     The Bank conducted more than 500 face-to-face interviews with firms. In-depth interviews, mostly with SMEs,
     took place in four regions of Poland: Dolnoslaskie, Zachodniopomorskie, Swietokrzyskie, and Slaskie (an additional
     30  interviews were conducted in Lubuskie, but are not analyzed here). The interviews were conducted by experienced
     international experts with at least 20 years of relevant experience, who—unlike in traditional online, paper-based, or
     telephone-based surveys—interviewed companies’ top management (chief executive officers [CEOs], chief financial
     officers [CFOs], owners). Each individual interview took about two to three hours. The interviews were guided by a
     questionnaire, comprised of a total of 100 quantitative and qualitative questions. 24 The questionnaire was modeled
     on a good international practice of enterprise and innovation surveys (such as the Eurostat’s Community Innovation
     Survey [CIS] or the EBRD’s and World Bank’s Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey [BEEPS]), but
     was extended to focus on more qualitative, contextual, and open-ended “why” questions. 25 Box 16 summarizes the
     interviews’ key features.

     The firm interviews had a number of main objectives. The main objective was to identify the private sector’s inno-
     vation and growth constraints, drivers, and needs to inform the public policy and adjust public support accordingly.
     Table 2 shows the full list of the main and secondary objectives of the interviews




      	 An initial version of the questionnaire included more than 150 questions, but was streamlined during the subsequent stages of the project.
     24

      	 All the analysis presented here is based on a nonrandom sample of interviewed firms, which were chosen from within 10 smart specializa-
     25

        tions selected by the MoED. As a result, the project’s sample of firms is not a statistically representative sample of the population of firms.
        Further research is needed to confirm the results on statistically representative samples.

  Key features:
  1.	 Semi-structured interviews are conducted by seasoned experts, who fill out the questionnaire during the
      interview and prepare a postinterview summary assessment
  2.	 Interviews last approximately 2 to 2.5 hours and are conducted with a CEO/owner of a company.
  3.	 The interview questionnaire comprises 100 questions (80 quantitative and 20 qualitative questions) based on
      a conceptual model of firm innovativeness
  4.	 The interviewed companies are selected based on a number of criteria, including size (mostly SMEs), age, geo-
      graphical distribution, and likelihood of being involved in innovation.
  5.	 Firms are classified postinterview into a number of categories: “champions,” “sleeping beauties,” “steady state,”
      and “declining” (see definitions in Box 18).
  Key statistics:
  1.	 More than 500 interviews were completed in four regions by 11 World Bank experts.
  2.	 An additional 138 interviews were conducted by 20 regional consultants trained by the Bank.
  3.	 More than 40 regional consultants were trained to conduct interviews at a later stage.
  A full description of the activities undertaken, as well as a detailed description of the methodology, can be found
  in Annex 1 and Annex 2 on the project’s website.

     Smart Labs
     A Smart Lab (SL) is a key element of the EDP that identifies and assesses the innovation potential of an eco-
     nomic activity. SLs offer a fast and effective way to validate, deepen, modify, or identify a smart specialization. They
     also have a number of other objectives (Table 4). There are about 20 participants in each SL, including representatives
     of the best companies (“champions”) identified during interviews, representatives of the scientific community, BSIs
     and administration, and an experienced moderator (Box 17). SLs provide space for informal discussion and exchange
     of opinions. The results of each SL are summarized in a short summary. The Smart Lab process applies a stage gate
     approach, where each next SL depends on the success of the previous one.

  •	 Smart Labs (SLs) are a series of meetings that take place every month to month and a half; each following meet-
     ing can happen only if the participants are willing to participate.
  •	 They include 15 to 20 participants: 8 to 10 entrepreneurs, 3 scientists, 3 BSIs, the MO, and the NCBR/PARP/MoED/
     ARP; entrepreneurs are chosen from a pool of “champion” companies identified in the interview process—par-
     ticipation via invitation only; scientists are selected among those with sufficient experience in working with
     business.
  •	 SLs aim to define the economic activity, prepare a SWOT analysis, identify the key success factors (KSFs), analyze
     the value chains, and assess the scientific potential of the economic activity.
  •	 They last up to four hours and are moderated by a a regional consultant (and/or a business angel)
  •	 Each SLs is followed by a summary with proposals for next steps, surveys among the participants with ideas for
     cooperation in R&D, and the participants’ evaluation of the meeting. The meeting summaries are to be pub-
     lished online to share knowledge outside the SL’s participants.
  •	 Successful SLs help produce a Business and Technology Roadmap (BTR) to validate the potential of the eco-
     nomic activity and propose a roadmap for an innovation-based growth.

The Smart Lab process is designed to quickly test the potential of a business area. It is achieved in the following
steps (Figure 19):

•	 The first SL aims to help the SL members to get to know one another, define the SL’s business area, prepare a SWOT
   and/or a value-chain analysis (VCA), and identify key success factors. After the first SL, participating companies are
   asked to indicate their R&D needs and perceived market trends. The answers inform the content of the second SL.

•	 The second SL showcases the scientific potential of regional RDIs/universities within a given business area in the
   context of R&D needs and market trends identified by companies participating in the initial SL. The second SL can
   also be used to further define the scope of the SL (if this was not achieved during the first meeting). The SL should
   conclude with a joint vision of development of the business area.

•	 Depending on the results of the second SL, a business-technology roadmap (BTR) is subsequently prepared
   by an external expert(s) in collaboration with a SL business leader. The BTR analyzes market and technology trends
   for the business area and proposes a roadmap for development based on R&D and innovation.

•	 The third Smart Lab is organized by the national smart specialization working group to verify the BTR’s proposed
   development vision for the business area. Additional national Smart Labs are organized, if needed.

•	 The WG incorporates the bottom-up results of the SL process into the development vision of the selected
   national S3. The WG’s development vision is then reviewed by the national Economic Observatory and the Consul-
   tative Group and submitted to the Steering Committee to modify/deepen national smart specializations and adjust
   public innovation policy.

           Each Smart Lab can evolve in a number of ways. SLs can help verify existing S3s, identify potential new smart
           specializations, and initiate R&D&I projects, as tested during the project’s 20 Smart Labs (Table 5). The possible SL
           scenarios are the following:

            i.	 Potential regional smart specialization—A Smart Lab can help test whether a selected business area in the
                region has a strong business and scientific potential. SLs can also test whether there is a critical mass of stakehold-
                ers that are willing to collaborate and pursue a joint vision of development for their business area. Finally, SLs can
                also inform regional policy makers about the potential of a selected business area for the regional economy. The
                SL process in the end can help select a new smart specialization.

            ii.	 Potential national smart specialization—A regional SL identifies an international market niche in a given busi-
                 ness area that requires top-notch scientific research and business expertise. To fully tap the potential, regional
                 resources need to be supplemented with business and scientific skills present elsewhere (for instance, “CNC
                 machines”). When the BTR confirms these findings and provides a market and technology analysis, a national
                 Smart Lab is organized to further assess the potential of the niche and the country’s capacity to address it. The
                 results of the national SL can then be incorporated into the national S3.

           iii.	 R&D&I projects—Smart Labs help start and deepen collaboration between participants that can result in prepar-
                 ing individual R&D&I projects. Smart Labs can be a suitable venue for networking and starting new joint undertak-
                 ings among companies, universities, and R&D institutes.

   26
iv.	 Too little potential—The SL can conclude that a business area is not yet ready to become a smart specialization.
     This can be caused by various factors, such as a lack of potential in terms of “champion” companies, lack of scien-
     tific capacity, stakeholders’ unwillingness to collaborate, or inability to find a common definition of the business
     area to concentrate resources.

Smart Labs support synergies between the national and regional levels. Smart Labs are designed to be an
open platform for dialogue and cooperation between regional and national actors. This is particularly important to
strengthen vertical synergies between the national and regional levels, and horizontal synergies among the regions.
The cooperation can be enhanced by (i) presenting the results of regional SLs to the national working groups; (ii)
inviting the regional consultants (who organize Smart Labs financed by the MoED) to join activities carried out within
regional EDPs, for instance, region-initiated SLs/focus groups/consortia/partnerships; (iii) merging similar regional
SLs into national SLs; and (iv) inviting national innovation support bodies (MoED, NCBR, PARP, etc.) to participate in
regional SLs. (see Box 18 for a case study of CNC);

                     From a single SME to a National Smart Lab—The case                                        BOX 18
                           of a Smart Lab Process on CNC machines
  The Smart Lab process in the Dolnoslaskie region revealed a new business area that had the potential to become
  a part of the national smart specialization on “automation and robotics of technology processes.”
  An initial SL (SL1) was organized under the theme of advanced metal processing (AMP). This topic emerged from
  firm interviews in Dolnoslaskie, which helped discover a number of “champion” companies operating in the busi-
  ness area of second-generation of CNC machines. Researchers operating in this field were identified and included
  in the process. The first SL meeting included seven entrepreneurs, two scientists, two representatives of BSIs, rep-
  resentatives of the Marshal Office, representatives from the national level (MoED, NCBR, MID), the WB moderator,
  and the WB team. The goal was to verify the proposed theme, elaborate a SWOT analysis, and identify key success
  factors. The SL also aimed to encourage participants to get to know one another and build trust. The initial SL was
  region-centric and concentrated on defining its focus. The participants considered broadening the focus of the SL
  to advanced materials processing, which was to be further discussed during the second SL.

       The second SL (SL2) took place two weeks later. Before it was held, participating companies completed “home-
       work” assignments on their R&D plans and perceived technological trends. Almost all of the participants from
       SL1 came to the second meeting, ensuring continuity and confirming the added value of the process. During the
       second SL, the R&D sector presented its offer tailored to the SL theme. This was followed by a discussion on what
       the firms expected would be the “next big thing” in the market. The moderated discussion concluded that three
       main technologies were important for the area of advanced metal processing: CNC, laser microprocessing, and 3D
       printing. Following further discussions, it emerged that the second generation of CNC machines had the largest
       potential for growth. A business leader and a co-leader from the science world emerged to take the lead on the
       process.
       Between SL1 and SL2, new interviews were organized in other regions to confirm the potential of the CNC area.
       It has been decided to prepare a BTR to analyze the potential of the CNC industry in more depth and propose a
       roadmap for innovation-based development.
       A business and technology roadmap (BTR) was then prepared by an external consultant in collaboration with
       the SL business leader. The BTR analyzed the market potential and technology and business trends, and it identi-
       fied key players in the Polish and global market. It also proposed a midterm development roadmap of the area.
       The national Smart Lab: On the basis of the previous work, a national SL was co-organized with the national
       working group (WG). It featured the best Polish CNC companies and top scientists, who confirmed the relevance
       of the BTR analysis and expressed interest in continuing work on the topic under the auspices of the national WG.
       At the end of the process, the results of the national SL translated into the development vision for the national
                              Case study: „CNC machines”
       smart specialization No. 17 on “automation and robotics of technology processes” (see Figure 20 for the timeline
       of the process).

     Crowdsourcing
     Crowdsourcing is a new platform to directly engage SMEs in innovation policy making. The main objective of
     crowdsourcing is to reach out to a large number of SMEs that cannot be directly engaged through the limited number




28
of interviews and Smart Labs. It is modeled on international benchmarks, such as the U.S. Open Government initia-
tive, but adjusted to the specific conditions in Poland.26 The crowdsourcing is meant to be a cost-effective, flexible,
and fast way to establish a systematic dialogue between the private and the public sectors to seek feedback on, for
instance, priority areas for policy intervention, barriers to innovation-based growth, emerging business and techno-
logical trends, or the efficiency of public support policy on an ongoing basis. In addition, crowdsourcing can also be
used to help identify firms that could be interviewed later within the EDP process and invited to Smart Labs (Box 19).

Innovation maps
The idea of an innovation map is to collect and analyze data from grant applications to inform innovation
policy. All types of grant applications submitted to national and regional innovation support institutions constitute
an excellent source of crucial and otherwise inaccessible information about companies’ perception of ongoing and
emerging business and technology trends. Given that each approved grant requires the applying companies to share
the cost of the R&D investment, information included in the applications is likely to be more credible than formal dec-
larations in official forums, working groups, and surveys (companies are “putting their money where their mouth is”).27

The objective of the data analysis is to create innovation maps built along a business/technology matrix. Inno-
vation maps combine the business area of the grant application based on the OECD classification with the technologi-
cal classification based on the NABS 200728 classification to identify business and technology trends and new areas of
competitive strengths based on revealed preferences of the private sector (see Box 20 for the methodology).

  	 See, for instance, http://www.whitehouse.gov/open; and Sharma (2010).

  	 Most grant programs financed by the EU required firms to co-finance R&D projects on a 50-50 basis (in some specific cases, 20-80).

     There has been little effort so far to analyze data from private-sector R&D and innovation-oriented grant
     applications. Since EU accession in 2004, dozens of institutions around the country, including the flagship institu-
     tions such as NCBR and PARP, have accumulated large data sets of thousands of grant applications from the private
     sector and academia for different types of public support instruments. Since it was established in 2007, the NCBR
     alone has received more than 13,000 grant applications across all of its support programs included in the national
     “Smart Economy Operational Program.” Yet, in addition, none of the other support institutions have analyzed the
     grant applications.


     3.4  Cooperation model for the EDP in Poland

     The EDP requires a cooperation mechanism focused on the quality of the process, not its uniformity. Currently
     there are 17 different EDP schemes (1 national and 16 regional), 81 regional smart specializations, and 20 national
     smart specializations. These specializations and individual EDPs partly overlap, and there is scope for joint action that
     would benefit engaged parties. Moreover, the EC’s RIS3 Guide and ex ante conditionalities indicate that authorities
     have to select a limited set of investment priorities (smart specializations), which, thanks to concentrated financing,
     will be able to bring real economic effects and allow companies to compete on the international markets. In the Polish
     context there is scope for EDP collaboration in three dimensions:

     •	 Thematic cooperation

     •	 Process cooperation

     •	 Institutional cooperation

     Cooperation will be key to a higher quality of EDP results and improved planning and implementation of the
     innovation policy. Collaboration facilitates information exchange, mutual learning, and joint actions between stake-
     holders, and helps divide roles and lines of responsibility. This increases the efficiency and robustness of the process,
     allowing for better-informed decisions.

     The proposed model for EDP cooperation focuses on the national level, but it can also support the regional
     EDPs. One of the main assumptions of the collaboration mechanism is that national and regional stakeholders are
     committed to cooperating with one another, willing to learn from each other and share information stemming from
     their individual EDPs. Such information and knowledge exchange can benefit both levels: it can provide new and
     critical data for carrying out an effective innovation policy, help avoid duplication of efforts, and save costs. Table 6
     summarizes the key benefits of EDP coordination; Box 21 proposes the basic principles of the cooperation model and
     makes recommendations for the future design of the cooperation mechanism for the EDP.

                 Key features of the Proposed cooperation mechanism                                            BOX 21
                        between National and Regional Levels
 1.	 Voluntary: The proposed EDP model is not mandatory and does not impose solutions on regional governments.
2.	 Single coordinator: The central point of the collaboration mechanism is the KIS Coordinator located at the
    MoED, responsible for management of the national EDP.
3.	 Regional consultants: The proposed model of EDP “made in Poland” is based on regional consultants (RCs)
    financed from the funds that are at the disposal of the MoED. The RCs conduct interviews, lead crowdsourcing,
    organize SLs, and publish information about the results of their work on a dedicated website (www.smart.gov
    .pl). RCs can also participate in the work of the regional and national working groups and support the prepara-
    tion of BTRs.
4.	 Cooperation with Marshal Offices (MOs): The areas to conduct interviews with entrepreneurs are identified
    in consultation with MOs; topics for SLs are identified by RCs and PARP in consultation with the MoED and MOs.
5.	 PARP: PARP coordinates the work of RCs and also helps them improve the quality and efficiency of their work.
    It also analyzes the data and information collected during interviews and Smart Labs. The results of the analy-
    sis inform the S3 monitoring system coordinated by the MoED.
6.	 Self-coordination: The RCs collaborate with one another in organizing joint projects and exchanging infor-
    mation. This can be done, for example, by (i) maintaining a common online calendar of interviews with entre-
    preneurs and a database of interviews, (ii) collaboration in organizing Smart Labs (for instance, help in SL topic
    identification), and (iii) organizing crowdsourcing. The MoED, PARP, and MOs have access to the calendar of
    interviews and information about planned events.
 7.	 Competences: The MoED, in cooperation with PARP, supports RCs in developing their professional compe-
     tences, especially in the area of enterprise innovation, by organizing regular national and regional trainings.
     The interactive trainings will also be a useful platform for exchange of experiences and information among
     the RCs.
8.	 Funding: In the national resources intended for the EDP, it is recommended that a financial envelope be
    reserved for which the RCs may apply with various bottom-up initiatives, for instance, to invite external
    experts/speakers to SLs and Champions Clubs, organize training trips for SL participants, or access various
    other sources of information. Such initiatives, subject to a short competitive process, could be financed
    through, for instance, a 50-50 matching grant.
                                                                                                                    )
                                                                                                          (continued

       9.	 Public good: the results of each SL, Champions Club, BTR, and others should be published online in a stan-
           dardized form (for instance, each event should be summarized in a two-pager). This information constitutes a
           public good and builds knowledge in a specific business area.
      10.	 Cross-fertilization: RCs may also be involved in regional EDPs by participating in regional working groups,
           subject to the agreement of the Marshal Office.
      11.	 Communication: At the national level, the website www.smart.gov.pl will collect information regarding the
           national EDP. The website will describe cooperation between the national and regional EDPs. It will also feature
           links to the regional EDPs/RIS3s and will contain results of the SLs, BTRs, and other items related to the EDP.

     Thematic cooperation (smart specializations)
     Thematic cooperation of the EDP should help verify and/or modify national and regional smart specializa-
     tions (S3s). It should aim to identify (i) potential interregional smart specialization areas, (ii) synergies between the
     national and regional levels, and (iii) areas with comparative advantages that distinguish Poland in the European/
     international context.

     There is potential for streamlining the number of national smart specializations. There are currently 20 smart
     specializations at the national level, which are divided into five broader thematic “groups.” For instance, the “healthy
     society” group consists of three S3s. The individual S3s in each group seem to partially overlap with each other. It
     would be useful to consider limiting the number of national S3s by combining some of them under existing groups to
     enhance clarity.

     Data from firm interviews can help modify existing national S3s. Interviews conducted during the project indi-
     cate that entrepreneurs cannot easily differentiate between national S3s and cannot ascribe themselves to a single
     specialization at the national level. Entrepreneurs often indicate that they belong to several adjacent specializations
     within a given group. Analysis of the interview data shows that a majority of observed differences at the level of indi-
     vidual national specializations is not statistically significant and becomes significant only at the group level. In cases
     where statistical differences are not significant, it might be reasonable to merge individual specializations.

     A number of national specializations are strongly embedded in regional specializations. For illustrative pur-
     poses, Table 7 shows a potential matching of national S3s with corresponding regional S3s. It suggests that a majority
     of national S3s connect to more than one regional specialization. Such strong national–regional matches represent
     a natural direction for thematic EDP collaboration. They could be the basis for the selection of areas that should be
     deepened, expounded, and clarified in the process of entrepreneurial discovery. They can also point toward areas with
     interregional significance that require national-level intervention.

     Some national specializations are not matched by regional specializations. This suggests that companies in
     these fields are geographically dispersed and are too small in each of the regions to have been selected as a smart
     specialization. Such S3s could be subject to further analyses and interviews to verify their national potential. For the
     regional level, information from these analyses can provide added value by suggesting potential new regional special-
     izations or areas for interregional collaboration.

Process cooperation
Poland features a variety of diverse approaches to EDP at the national and regional level. The authorities at the
national and regional level designed 17 distinct EDPs that have diverse organizational structures (involvement of the
various actors) and process arrangements (EDP composed of various elements and not all are present in each EDP).
Such diversity could be helpful to test different EDP models, experiment with different solutions, and leverage good
practices. Nonetheless, despite significant differences, each EDP includes three universal parts (stages): (i) analysis of
existing data, (ii) dialogue with entrepreneurs, and (iii) translation of the EDP into the innovation policy (Figure 21).

The proposed model for EDP cooperation is schematic and modular. This implies that the presented model does
not precisely reflect the organizational structures that are operating in individual regions, but schematically shows
the links between existing and proposed modules (e.g., data analysis, interviews, Smart Labs, BTR, and so on). The
modules can already function within various EDPs under different names or may be absent. Figure 22, Figure 23, and
Table 8 show the national EDP scheme and a proposed collaboration mechanism and interdependence between the
national and regional dimensions. The model is not a “take-it-or-leave-it” solution and can be customized to local
circumstances.

Modular structure of the cooperation framework facilitates linkages across various EDPs and promotes flex-
ibility. The modular division was introduced to simplify and generalize the description of the process and facilitate
comparisons and linkages between modules already present in the 17 EDPs. The modules focus on processes rather
than on institutions, because the latter will vary across the regional and national EDP operational structures. The
modular approach to cooperation also facilitates comparison of experiences and exchange of knowledge related to
individual EDPs and can help avoid duplicating solutions. Some modules are present only at the regional or national
level (interviews only in regions, national Smart Labs at the national level); some exist at both (data analysis, informa-
tion sharing). Some modules take place almost continuously (information exchange, interviews), some have a limited
time span (SLs, BTRs), and some are linked to one another (SLs can be organized only after “champion” companies are
identified during the interviews).

The collaboration mechanism matches the iterative and continuous character of the EDP. The EDP does not
end after the completion of one cycle, starting from data analysis, through interviews and SLs, to influencing the
innovation policy instruments and priorities. The EDP should be regularly repeated, and the continuity of the dialogue
constitutes one of its key advantages.

     The collaboration model allows for an area of analysis to be narrowed gradually. As in a funnel approach, the
     EDP starts with a broad, sweeping input (extensive quantitative analysis of available data), then gradually limits the
     scope of the search by focusing on the most promising areas, where companies are ready, willing, and able to absorb
     public financing (interviews, SL, etc.), and finally results in a narrow output (identification of well-defined areas within
     the BTR and national SL). The results then contribute to the decision making of the national working groups, Economic
     Observatory for KIS, the Consultative Group for KIS, and the Steering Committee for KIS and have an impact on verifica-
     tion and/or modification of the national S3s.

     Institutional cooperation
     Polish innovation policy could benefit from enhanced institutional collaboration within the EDPs. Current
     institutional diversity at the national and regional levels creates a complex network of stakeholders, which may not
     be fully clear for external “users” such as entrepreneurs, who should be the core beneficiaries of the EDPs. The smooth
     functioning of the EDPs requires a clear division of responsibilities among stakeholders, clear lines of accountability,
     efficient information flow, and simplicity of use from the viewpoint of companies.

     Institutional cooperation does not impose a single institutional structure on existing EDPs. Such an attempt
     would be particularly futile at the regional level, where EDPs reflect an institutional framework particular for each




38
region. On the contrary, the model builds upon the existing institutional structure and takes into account already-
created entities. Because every model is a simplification of the reality, the model more strongly reflects the national
institutional context, whereas the regional dimension, due to its diversity, is treated more schematically. The func-
tion of each stakeholder, for example, Marshal Offices, working groups, PARP, regional consultants, and the Economic
Observatory, are presented in Figure 22, Figure 23, and Table 8.

The KIS Coordinator in the Ministry of Economic Development is the focal point of the EDP cooperation mech-
anism. The KIS Coordinator is a unit responsible for management of the smart specialization agenda at the national
level. It supervises the national EDP process, initiates changes to the S3 areas, manages other stakeholders at the
national level (PARP, national working groups, the Economic Observatory, the Consultative Group, etc.), and collabo-
rates with the actors from the regional level. The KIS Coordinator delegates tasks, gathers data and analyses related
to the national S3s, and finances and monitors the activities within the EDP. This implies close collaboration with the
implementing units responsible for managing European structural funds and other entities (Figure 24). Besides the
central role of the KIS Coordinator, other stakeholders must also be closely connected, exchange information, and col-
laborate with one another.

     The KIS Coordinator should have sufficient resources to manage the smart specialization agenda. Cooperation
     of national and regional EDPs seems crucial for the success of Poland’s innovation policy, which during the 2014–2020
     period is receiving 10 billion euro in financing support. The creation and maintenance of cooperation is an important
     and time-consuming task. Adequate resources should be allocated for this purpose.

     PARP would be well positioned to coordinate the regional consultants (RCs). PARP, in collaboration with the KIS
     Coordinator and in consultation with the MOs, could be responsible for selecting the regional consultants as well as for
     coordinating and ensuring high quality of their work. PARP might also help develop the RCs’ professional skills related
     to their EDP functions by organizing regular skill-development trainings on hard and soft skills. The trainings would
     not only develop the capacity of regional consultants, but also make it easier for them to exchange knowledge and
     build networks.

     Regional consultants play a pivotal role in the coordinated EDP system. Their tasks would include (i) carrying
     out interviews with companies in selected areas, (ii) leading and documenting Smart Labs (two-pagers after each SL),
     (iii) recommending areas for BTR preparation, (iv) transferring gathered information to the national level, and (v) col-
     laborating with Marshal Offices and business support institutions. Regional consultants could also work with mentors,
     experienced businesspeople who could assist RCs in carrying out interviews and moderating SLs. The RCs can also
     perform other tasks and come up with new ideas to support the EDP process and the participating companies. The RCs
     should be able to apply for additional funding to the MoED/PARP to finance these additional efforts.

National working groups may propose modifications to the national S3s on the basis of EDP results. Each
national S3 has a respective working group (WG) responsible for preparing a development vision for the specialization
and for recommending modifications to the scope of the S3. The national WGs are well placed to receive, discuss, and
analyze information flowing from firm interviews and Smart Labs to verify their respective smart specializations. For
each new BTR prepared for a given business area, the WGs could organize national Smart Labs during which the BTR
could be discussed to inform the S3 policy. National WGs may then recommend a given business area to be considered
by the KIS Steering Committee as a new potential S3. The Economic Observatory and the Consultative Group should
also be included in such a decision.

The national Economic Observatory works as a “wisdom council” and provides checks and balances for the
WGs. Due to its expert character, the Economic Observatory (EO) can check actions and recommendations issued by
the national WG regarding individual specializations. The EO should play an important role in assessing the quality of
BTRs and the results of the national Smart Labs, which constitute the basis for recommendations to the Steering Com-
mittee regarding modification of S3s.

Institutional collaboration should be based on regular formal and informal interactions. Although a clear for-
mal line of responsibility needs to be clarified among all the EDP stakeholders, informal forms of communication will
be important to keep the system running. A good example of such informal cooperation is the regular meetings of
representatives of national and regional authorities in the smart specializations’ M&E framework. A similar informal
formula for EDP-related topics could be considered to facilitate an exchange of information and experiences and pro-
mote mutual learning among regions and between regions and the national level. This could also serve as a platform
for initiating joint activities.

     4  “WHAT”—Main Findings from the Project
     This chapter analyzes findings from the firm interviews, Smart Labs, innovation maps, and crowdsourcing.
     The main conclusion is that the proposed EDP helped identify high-growth-potential firms, differentiate smart special-
     izations in terms of their economic and innovation-based potential, and provide recommendations on how to adjust
     the public support system, in line with the objectives of the project.

     4.1  Firm interviews

     Mature SMEs represent the majority of interviewed companies. In line with the objectives of the EDP project
     and the smart specialization policy, SMEs represent about 93 percent of the sample. Large companies represent the
     remaining 7 percent of the sample and are treated as a de facto control group (Figure 25). Start-ups, defined as com-
     panies less than five years old, represent about one-fourth of the sample.

     Note: “Large” is defined as companies with more than 250 employees, “medium” as 50 to 249 employees, “small” as
     10 to 49 employees, and “micro” as those with fewer than 10 employees.


     Each interviewed firm is assigned to a specific typology. The typology includes “champions,” “emerging champi-
     ons,” “sleeping beauties,” “steady state,” and “declining” (see Box 22 for definitions). The classification of each company
     is based on the firm’s quantitative and qualitative characteristics and experts’ judgment. Each interviewed company
     can belong to only one category.

       Champion—a top-class company that has strong leadership, an innovation-focused mind-set, and a clear vision
       of its development. It actively monitors business, market, and technology trends; systematically seeks knowledge
       domestically and internationally; constantly looks for new market opportunities (adopts a preemptive or proac-
       tive market behaviors); follows good management practices; and is strongly connected with a network, including
       within its value chain (customers, suppliers).
       Emerging champion—a very good company that demonstrates many features of a “champion,” but it has not
       yet demonstrated that it can scale up its growth path and expand on its innovation track record.

     Sleeping beauty—a company that exhibits several behaviors of “champions”; it is doing well and has potential
     to develop quickly, but it lacks exposure or has not yet capitalized on opportunities that could make it grow faster.
     Such firms usually do not realize what they need to accelerate their growth or do not have access to the neces-
     sary services or skills. They typically underappreciate opportunities inherent in foreign expansion, they tend to be
     understaffed in the marketing and R&D areas, and they display fewer networking behaviors.
     Steady state —a company that is reasonably successful, but is conservatively managed, with a low level of ambi-
     tion, distrustful of outsourcing, lower networking scores, small overseas presence, and not much visionary ability.
     Management is risk averse, is comfortable with the status quo, and passively reacts to market trends. It has limited
     track record of innovation.
     Declining—a company that typically scores low on dimensions of clarity of vision, growth, and ambition; it is usu-
     ally locked in stagnant and/or declining markets, is incapable of foreign expansion/presence, has poor network-
     ing behavior, has weak access to knowledge, and has no track record of innovation.

likely to be most efficient when it reaches companies that are ready, willing, and able to spearhead their development
through innovation and R&D. Given the complex nature of innovation, selecting companies based only on quantita-
tive, hard data is not likely to be sufficient. For instance, fast-growing companies (“gazelles”) do not necessarily need
to be innovative, and vice versa—innovative companies do not necessarily need to grow fast.29 Hence, the choice of
companies worthy of public support needs to be based not only on quantitative characteristics, but also on qualitative,
soft characteristics, including such key attributes of innovative firms as the company’s vision, management’s mind-set,
quality of management practices or strength of networking skills. Data analysis suggests that, in principle, it is possible
to identify “champions” and other companies based on a number of key qualitative and quantitative attributes (Box 23).

     Using the data from the firm interviews, it is possible to construct an econometric model that attempts to identify
     different types of companies—“champions,” “emerging champions,” “sleeping beauties,” and others—based on
     statistically significant attributes. There are two models that can be used to predict if a firm is a “champion” or not,
     briefly described here.
     i. “Champion”/“non-champion” model based on soft data
     The preliminary analysis suggests that “champions” can be identified by the following attributes:

                                        Variables/reference category                                            Significance
                  Expert’s assessment: Willingness to grow                                                             +++
                  Expert’s assessment: Visionary ability                                                               +++
                  Expert’s assessment: Potential to internationalize                                                   +++

                                       +++ = the strength, significance level < 0.01; ++ = significance level < 0.05

     These attributes allow for a “champion” to be identified with a high probability (87 percent for the project’s sam-
     ple of firms). The analysis also suggests that identifying a “champion” and/or a “sleeping beauty” is largely based
     on qualitative attributes. This suggests that the public support systems might need to be adjusted to allow for

                                                                                                                               (continued

          more qualitative assessment of companies for support. Professional investment committees and a face-to-face
          contact with an entrepreneur are likely to be critical for effective public support of innovation.
          ii. “Champion”/“non-champion” model using hard data
          It is also possible to predict the type of company based on more quantitative data. The key preliminary attributes
          are the following:

                                        Variables/Reference category                                            Significance
                       Number of process innovations introduced in the last three years                                +++
                       R&D expenditures in the last three years                                                        +++
                       Average revenue growth in the last three years                                                  +++
                       Percent of employees with higher technical education (STEM)                                     ++
                       Export share as percent of the turnover                                                         ++

                                       +++ = the strength, significance level < 0.01; ++ = significance level < 0.05

          Such analyses could help create a specific scoring model to filter companies based on data collected during face-
          to-face interviews and online crowdsourcing. This could be one of the elements of the process of identifying high-
          growth-potential firms to be supported by the public sector.

     “Champions” and “emerging champions” represent the likely preferred target group. 30 There is a growing
     body of literature on the special characteristics of “high-growth-potential firms,” which seem to be responsible for
     the bulk of reported growth in productivity, employment, and social welfare and are increasingly the subject of
     focused governmental support around the world (Box 24). In our data set, “champions” are companies that rise above
     their regional and national peers. They have strong management teams that can articulate a clear vision of the com-
     pany’s growth and that perceive innovation as one of the key sources of competitiveness. They also have a good
     assessment of their companies’ strengths and weaknesses. They implement innovation most frequently among the
     interviewed companies (Figure 26). Public support could help them leverage existing competitive advantages to
     become larger players in the national, European, and global markets and provide above-average rates of return on
     public investment. 31

     “Sleeping beauties” could provide substantial economic impact by becoming “champions.” “Sleeping beau-
     ties” are companies with a significant, but not fully tapped potential, which could become “champions” with the right
     dose of incentives to innovate, “sticks and carrots.” In many ways, as also argued by the EBRD (2014) Transition Report
     and the UK 2014 Innovation Survey,32 given the low starting base in terms of innovation intensity, payoffs from waking
     up “sleeping beauties” to become innovative “champions” could be substantial.

     The remaining types of companies—“steady state” and “declining”—may not be the priority for public inno-
     vation policy. This is because they tend not to have the inherent innovation abilities to productively use public sup-
     port. That said, they should still be supported, primarily through horizontal policies focused on improving the business

        	 In the following discussion, most analysis and recommendations for “champions” also apply to “emerging champions,” unless noted
          otherwise.

       	 The specific impact should be evidenced by rigorous follow-up evaluation studies, based on randomization techniques.

especially aimed at increasing the companies’ seemingly low level of ambition through, for instance, programs help-
ing to expand access to knowledge about technologies and market opportunities.

“Champions” represent a substantial proportion of the interviewed companies. They make up 40 percent of all

interviewed firms within the sample, which is more than in other studies, such as the UK 2014 Innovation Survey, which
is based on the results of Eurostat’s Community Innovation Survey 2006–2012 (Eurostat, 2012). The UK Innovation Sur-
vey shows that the distribution of “champions” (defined as “highly innovative firms,” or HIFs) is highly skewed—only 20
percent of companies were HIFs. The higher proportion of “champions” in the project sample can be explained by the
specific focus of the project on innovative companies rather than on a random sample of all companies.

  There is a growing body of literature that documents a substantial heterogeneity in productivity levels among
  firms. For instance, in the United States, the top 10 percent of the most productive firms in each industry are twice
  as productive as the bottom 10 percent of firms; in China the ratio amounts to 3:1; and in India, even 5:1. High-
  productivity firms are persistent: they tend to sustain high productivity levels over time. The top 10 percent of
  firms seem to be responsible for the bulk of increase in productivity, employment, and social welfare.
  There is large heterogeneity among countries in the distribution of high-growth-potential firms and their level
  of productivity. The stylized picture of the heterogeneity is reflected in Figure 27: The United States is likely
  to be considered “country A,” with a normal distribution of firms around a high average productivity; Poland
  could be “country B,” with the same distribution, but with a lower average of productivity; India could represent
  “country C,” with a wide distribution of outcomes, where many poorly performing firms survive because of weak
  competitive pressures, pulling down overall productivity and constraining resources available for the most pro-
  ductive firms.

“Champions” and “sleeping beauties” tend to be unevenly distributed among smart specializations. Although
there is innovative potential in each of the smart specializations, there are relatively large differences among the pro-
portion of “champions” and “sleeping beauties” in each of the national smart specializations (Figure 29): among com-
panies belonging to “automation and robotics,” almost half were classified as “champions”; in turn, biotech had only
28 percent of such companies. Similarly, large differences were found among “sleeping beauties.” Although one can-
not draw statistically viable conclusions from the interviews, they nonetheless provide a useful snapshot of the likely
innovation-based growth potential within each smart specialization.

Drivers of innovation
There are many drivers of company innovation. A large body of economic literature33 suggests a whole list of
macro-level, middle-level, and firm-level innovation drivers. On the macro level, these usually include access to financ-
ing, rule of law, openness to trade, availability of skills, exports, and technological changes. On the firm level, innova-
tion is largely driven by age, size, export intensity, and ownership status. The EBRD 2014 Transition Report found, for
instance, that on the macro level, innovation among firms in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region was driven by
openness to international trade, trade regulations, and availability of a skilled workforce. Access to financing and ICT
infrastructure were also important. As to the firm level, larger, older, export-oriented, and foreign-owned firms were
more likely to be innovative than the average.

The project’s interviews focused mostly on firm-level innovation drivers. This focus was dictated by (i) the objec-
tives of the EDP, which emphasize that firms are key to robust entrepreneurial discovery; (ii) the need to understand
the “soft” drivers of innovation, such as management’s ability to provide a vision of growth based on innovation; and
(iii) the need to provide added value going beyond the existing studies.

The management’s mind-set, new market opportunities, and the need to improve product quality are the
key innovation drivers for the interviewed companies. In the sample, these drivers averaged almost 4 points on
a 0-to-5 scale. The role of management as the driver of innovation was particularly important, suggesting that efforts
to increase the understanding of the importance of innovation among top management could provide substantial
benefits. This could be achieved through, for instance, innovation outreach and business networks and trainings

     (see Box 26 later in this section on the importance of management practices for innovation and productivity). New
     market opportunities were another important driver of innovation, suggesting that enterprise innovation could
     be spurred by further opening of product markets to more competition, in Poland and abroad. Finally, the need to
     enhance the quality of products was another source of innovation, implying that innovation is rightly seen as critical to
     upgrading production toward more value-added products. The three main drivers were followed by market develop-
     ments, technological changes, and the need to listen to customers (Figure 30).

     Open-ended, qualitative questions showed that external factors had a big impact on innovation. Interviewed
     firms identified customer demand, new product trends, and management vision as the top three drivers of innova-
     tion.34 “Champions” tend to enumerate a broader range of drivers than other types of companies; however, for every
     type of firm, the company’s customers are the most important driver of innovation. This suggests that enterprise inno-
     vation is sensitive to clients’ overall level of innovativeness and risk appetite. Unfortunately, many customers do not
     seem to have a high risk appetite, which is in line with the overall image that there is little appreciation of innovation as
     a key source of competitiveness. However, foreign-owned customers (and suppliers) were a more significant driver of
     innovation than Polish-owned customers. This suggests an important role of FDI and global value chains for technol-
     ogy absorption and innovation among Polish SMEs.

     Intellectual property rights (IPR), suppliers and providers of funding seemed to be the least important driv-
     ers of firm innovation. Less than 15 percent of companies across the sample considered IPR as an important driver
     of innovation (Figure 31). This finding confirms the anecdotal evidence that Polish companies do not fully appreciate
     the value of protecting IPR. This seems to be the result of a low level of awareness about IPR rights and distrust of a

patent’s ability to provide effective IPR protection. Even firms that do appreciate IPR often do not try to protect their
intellectual rights because they are concerned about the low quality of IPR court enforcement, the high costs of poten-
tial litigation, and the often insufficient quality of patent attorneys. Debt financiers such as banks (not to be confused
with access to financing, discussed in other studies) do not seem to put much pressure on firms to innovate. That said,
the few SMEs in the sample that were co-owned by business angels and/or VC funds reported much higher pressure
from shareholders to innovate. This suggests that it would be useful for the public sector to further promote VC funds/
business angels, through co-investment, conducive horizontal polices, and activities to raise awareness.KFK (National
Capital Fund) and NCBR financed VCs and seed funds and PARP financed business angel networks are a step in the
right direction, but such policies could be developed further.

Among innovation drivers, the management’s mind-set is a key attribute of “champion” companies. Top man-
agers in “champion” companies consider innovation as a vital element of their competitive advantage and growth, as
opposed to, for instance, low labor costs. The management’s innovation mind-sets in “steady state” and “declining”
companies are significantly less pronounced (Figure 32). Although it is not fully clear what drives the emergence of
such innovation mind-sets (see Box 25 for characteristics of founders of high-growth companies), innate abilities and
education are likely to play a role. This is an important area for further research.

          A recent international study surveyed 549 company founders in a group of high-growth industries, including
          aerospace and defense, computer and electronics, health care and services (computer services, engineering con-
          sultants, software and programming). Founders were asked detailed questions about their backgrounds, moti-
          vations and experiences in launching companies. The findings show that entrepreneurs typically come from a
          middle-class or upper-lower-class background, are well-educated, middle-aged, married and have at least one
          child (60 percent of the sample). They pointed to “prior work experience, learning from previous successes and
          failures, a strong management team, and good fortune” as the key success factors in entrepreneuship. The respon-
          dents identified risk aversion as the key barrier to entrepreneurial success.

     Management of “champion” companies also score highly on visionary ability. Although assessing the ability
     of members of top management to formulate visions of their companies’ development is by definition difficult and
     subject to perception bias, “champion” companies seem to stand out among other types of companies by the ability
     of members of top management to delineate where they want their companies to go. They understand that, to para-
     phrase Alice in Wonderland, “if you do not know where you are going, any road will take you there.” The road followed
     by most “steady-state” and “declining” companies focuses mostly on day-to-day survival rather than further develop-
     ment (Figure 33).

     The quality of management practices is also important for innovation. Data collected during interviews sug-
     gest that there is a strong correlation between the quality of company’s management practices, as reflected in per-
     formance measurement, management structures, and human resource practices, and the innovation intensity of a
     company. This is in line with the research by Bloom, Sadun, and van Reenen,35 which shows—based on a large sample
     of enterprises in more than 10 countries—that management practices explain much of the divergence in productivity
     among firms and are also correlated with innovation. Similarly, the EBRD 2014 Transition Report argues that higher
     quality of management practices enhances labor productivity. Somewhat in contrast to the results of the Bloom et al.,
     which show that Poland’s quality of management practices is in line with its level of development, the EBRD finds that
     the management practices in Poland are below the average in the Europe and Central Asia region (Figure 34).36 This

      	 The difference may be driven by a different sample of interviewed companies; the EBRD focused on smaller enterprises with 20+ employees,
     36

        whereas Bloom, Sadun and Van Rennen (2012) included firms with 100 to 5,000 employees, with a median size of 270 employees. A low score
        in the EBRD survey suggests a large scope for improvement in the quality of management practices among Polish SMEs.

suggests an important area for public policy intervention, especially because many managers do not seem to be able
to correctly self-assess the quality of their own management practices (Box 26 ).

  The quality of management practices is critical to productivity and innovation. Although the quality of management
  in Polish companies seems to be largely in line with the country’s level of development, there is much heterogene-
  ity in the quality of management practices among the surveyed enterprises (Bloom, Sadun and Van Rennen, 2012).
    FIGURE 32 (This text is FPO/for Identifying only)
  Interestingly, it seems that many firms are not aware of the quality of their management practices: their self-
  assessments suggest that many CEOs do not know that management practices in their firms may be below par;
  Figure 35 shows that CEOs even in the least productive firms consider their management practices to be better
  than the assessment of these skills by external experts.

       Such findings are broadly in line with the conclusions from the firm interviews conducted within the project. The
       companies’ managements often did not acknowledge that the quality of management itself might be the main
       constraint to innovation. For instance, managements in “champions” gave themselves an average score of only
       1.8 on a 0-5 scale of “constraints to innovation”. “Declining” companies had a score of 2.3, suggesting that they did
       not perceive their managements’ skills as a constraint to innovation.
       The findings of both projects suggest that there is a need to inspire companies to benchmark their management
       skills and improve them when necessary. Given that better management practices could explain almost half of the
       difference between productivity levels among firms (Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen 2013), such public outreach
       programs could have a substantial impact on growth, productivity and innovation, especially among SMEs.

     R&D is another vital driver of innovation. Although R&D is not always necessary to develop innovation, it is none-
     theless one of its key drivers, especially in regard to technological innovation. Our sample confirms this finding: “cham-
     pion” companies are most R&D intensive among all interviewed companies (Figure 36). What is more, R&D expenditures
     are one of the key predictors of being a “champion” (see Box 23). “Sleeping beauties” spent less on R&D, suggesting
     that this might be one of the barriers to them becoming “champions.” The other two types of firms spent little on R&D.

     R&D spending is positively correlated with company growth. Data from our sample show a positive correlation
     between R&D intensity and three-year average revenue growth. Although correlation is not causality, and further
     research is needed, it seems likely that R&D is among key growth drivers. This is in line with results from other research
     on companies in Poland, including the EBRD (2014) and the most recent NBP analysis, which found a positive correla-
     tion between R&D spending and productivity in Poland (see Box 27).

       R&D spending is positively correlated with firm productivity. A new study by Jan Hagemejer from the National
       Bank of Poland, based on a financial data set from more than 40,000 firms employing 10 or more employees,
       found that during 2006–2013, companies with non-zero R&D spending (defined as “cost of completed R&D proj-
       ects”) had 23.7 percent higher productivity and 43.9 percent higher total factor productivity (TFP) than firms with
       no reported R&D expenditure. Companies that spent on R&D also had much higher capital intensity (89.5 percent)
       and employment (107.2 percent).

  R&D spending does not seem to affect productivity among Polish exporters, but it is correlated with higher pro-
  ductivity in the group of nonexporting domestic firms. The impact is substantial: a decision to initiate R&D activity
  can bring at least half of the productivity premium usually attributed to foreign ownership and exporting.

R&D investment is a strong predictor of willingness to grow and innovate. Firms that invest in R&D seem to
have significantly higher willingness to grow and are more likely to implement new, innovative solutions (Figure 37).
Although the direction of causality is likely to go both ways, the importance of R&D in driving firm growth and innova-
tion underlines the importance of public support for enterprise R&D.

     However, for most firms, R&D investment is not a priority. Qualitative questions revealed that when firms were
     asked during the interview to hypothesize how they would invest a windfall of 1 million dollars, 42 percent said they
     wanted to invest in development of new products and services. One-third of companies said they wanted to invest in
     enlarging their production capacity; 8 percent considered strengthening marketing. Only 5 percent of the interviewed
     companies wanted to invest in R&D. “Champions” were much more likely to want to invest in R&D (more than 20 per-
     cent of the total), “sleeping beauties” less so (15 percent of the total), and the remaining companies were largely not
     interested in investing in R&D. See Box 28 for the main conclusions of the qualitative analyses.

       Including qualitative research questions into the firm interviews allowed for a more nuanced understanding of
       enterprise innovation. Key conclusions from the qualitative analysis based on more than 200 firm interviews were
       the following:
       •	 According to about 40 percent of the respondents, quality of the product, ability to adapt to market needs and
          customer expectations, and the ability to implement innovations determine a company’s success.
       •	 “Champions” introduce more innovations and higher-quality innovations than other firms. “Champions” imple-
          ment the most world-class innovations, “sleeping beauties” implement innovations new to the country, and
          “steady-state” and “declining” firms implement innovations that are mostly new to the firm. The most frequent
          improvements are changes to products—“champions” do this most often; “steady-state” and “declining” com-
          panies do this least often. Only “champions” and “sleeping beauties” invest in new technologies.
       •	 “Champions” and “sleeping beauties” use different practices for managing employees than other firms. “Steady-
          state” and “declining” companies do not use specific practices to manage the performance of their employees,
          whereas “champions” and “sleeping beauties” use quantitative and qualitative indicators to monitor their work-
          ers’ efficiency. These indicators include financial targets, product quality, and project outcomes, but only 5 per-
          cent of firms have performance indicators based on the quality of output.
       •	 Firms seem to overestimate the importance of external innovation constraints and underestimate internal con-
          straints in their companies, such as the quality of management skills. Firms find it difficult to self-evaluate,
          which underlines the importance of using experienced consultants as the interviewers.
       •	 Qualitative and quantitative analyses are compatible. The results of the qualitative research complement the
          quantitative results and help better identify innovation drivers, innovation constraints, and companies’ needs.
          Qualitative analysis of firm innovation performance should be a standard feature of the EDP process.

Innovation strategies
Product innovation happens most frequently. Two-fifths of companies in the sample indicated that they introduce
product innovation often or very often (see Box 29 for definitions). Process innovation is introduced only half as fre-
quently. Marketing and organizational innovations are the least frequent (Figure 38). This may suggest that companies
seem not to appreciate the full productivity potential of improving business processes, upgrading marketing skills,
and enhancing organizational practices. Another possibility is that firms may implicitly underreport process innova-
tion because it is less tangible than product innovation.

    Definitions of product, process, marketing, and organizational innovation                                BOX 29

  Product innovation: technologically new or improved products. A technologically new product is a product
  whose technological characteristics or intended uses differ significantly from those of previously produced prod-
  ucts. Such innovations can involve radically new technologies, can be based on combining existing technologies
  in new uses, or can be derived from the use of new knowledge. A technologically improved product is an existing
  product whose performance has been significantly enhanced or upgraded. A simple product may be improved
  (in terms of better performance or lower cost) through use of higher-performance components or materials.
  A complex product that consists of a number of integrated technical sub-systems may be improved by partial
  changes to one of the subsystems.
  Process innovation: adoption of technologically new or significantly improved production methods, including
  methods of product delivery. These methods may involve changes in equipment and/or production organiza-
  tion and may be derived from the use of new knowledge. They can be intended to create technologically new or
  improved products that conventional methods cannot produce. They can also be used to increase the production
  or delivery efficiency of existing products.
  Marketing innovation: implementation of a new marketing method involving significant changes in product
  design or packaging, product placement, product promotion, or pricing. Marketing innovations are aimed at bet-
  ter addressing customer needs, opening up new markets, or newly positioning a firm’s product in the market,
  with the objective of increasing the firm’s sales. The distinguishing feature of a marketing innovation compared
  with other changes in a firm’s marketing instruments is the implementation of a marketing method not previously
  used by the firm. It must be part of a new marketing concept or strategy that represents a significant departure
  from the firm’s existing marketing methods. The new marketing method can either be developed by the innovat-
  ing firm or adopted from other firms or organizations. New marketing methods can be implemented for both new
  and existing products.

          Organizational innovation: implementation of a new organizational method in the firm’s business practices,
          workplace organization, or external relations. Innovations in workplace organization involve the implementation
          of new methods for divvying up responsibilities among employees and between firm activities (and organiza-
          tional units). They also include new concepts for structuring activities, such as the integration of different business
          activities. An example of innovation in workplace organization is the initial implementation of a model that gives
          the firm’s employees greater autonomy in decision making and encourages them to contribute their ideas.

     The project’s findings on the types of enterprise innovation are broadly in line with other data. GUS, the
     National Statistics Office, provides data on all types of innovation among Polish companies during 2011–2013. The
     data show that 28 percent and 32 percent of companies are involved in product and process innovation, respectively,
     whereas only 19 percent and 21 percent are involved in marketing and organizational innovation, respectively.37 This
     pattern of innovation is similar for less developed EU member states. In EU-15 countries and Israel, product innovations
     are much more frequent than process and organizational innovation, likely because business processes and manage-
     ment practices are already well developed.38

     Polish SMEs seem to be much less innovative than regional peers. According to the OECD, Poland achieves poor
     results in innovation across both the manufacturing and service sectors, relative to peer countries such as Germany
     and the Czech Republic (Figure 39). In particular, only 8 percent of manufacturing firms introduced product or process
     innovations, versus 14 percent and 22 percent in the Czech Republic and Germany, respectively. Likewise, organiza-
     tional innovation and marketing innovation also lag behind. Given the concerns about the quality of data obtained
     through national innovation surveys, it is not clear to what extent these results fully reflect the level of innovativeness
     of Polish SMEs.

Companies have different attitudes toward markets and innovation. Companies can be preemptive, proactive,
and reactive. Preemptive companies try to create new markets (e.g., Apple’s iPhone), and by doing so they can capture
a large share of potential clients. Proactive companies anticipate the needs of clients and adjust their growth strate-
gies accordingly (e.g., Samsung’s smartphones); they follow closely behind preemptive firms but also adjust already
existing products and services. Reactive companies simply react to what is happening in the markets and to what cus-
tomers tell them; they are forced to change by the market—otherwise they would be likely to lose clients. Preemptive
and proactive attitudes are key drivers of innovation. “Champions” tend to be much more preemptive than “sleeping
beauties” and “steady-state” companies. “Steady-state” firms are predominantly reactive to market trends and are less
likely to innovate.

Interviewed companies identified a number of new business trends. The most apparent new business trend is
a new approach to business models, such as moving to business-to-business (B2B) business models more often than
business-to-consumer (B2C). “Green development,” focused on reducing emissions, is another emerging trend. Com-
panies also emphasize the shift from desktop computers to mobile phones in enterprise operations, from standard
applications to mobile applications, and from a PC-based to a mobile-based customer market.

There are also a number of emerging technological trends. The interviewed companies most often mentioned the
increasing influence of ICT, falling costs of hardware and appliances, convergence of e-commerce and social media,
and increased use of applications with mobile access. There are also new product trends in a number of business areas:
new polyamide coating, microelectronics and sensors, ICT hardware, meat substitutes for vegetarians, 3D printers and
modified printing materials. The top technological trends linked to broad smart specialization areas (meta-specializa-
tions) are presented in Table 9.

Sources of information about innovation and markets
“Champions” use many sources of information about market and technology trends. They actively reach out to
clients and suppliers, participate in exhibitions and seminars, and follow industry literature (Figure 41). They tend to
understand that accessing knowledge from a wide range of sources is important to stay up-to-date with technology
and to maintain and develop a network of potential business partners. In contrast, “steady-state” companies are much
less active in searching for new information: they lag behind the “champions” in all dimensions (Figure 42). Overall,
there is scope to support all types of companies in further developing their interest in and access to knowledge about
markets and technology trends. This could be achieved by upgrading the public sector’s offer on sharing industry-
specific knowledge, through, for instance, industry newsletters distributed by selected BSIs and open lectures for the
private sector at public universities.

RDIs and universities are not a frequently used source of information. Less than one-sixth of all firms contact RDIs
frequently (Figure 43). Universities are used slightly more often, but still only by a minority of firms (Figure 44). The vast
majority of SMEs count on internal resources to develop new ideas. More than 25 percent of “champions” frequently
reach out to RDIs and universities to access knowledge. Although the Smart Labs showed that even the best compa-
nies do not know the scientific potential of their region well, “sleeping beauties” and “steady-state” companies consult
RDIs and science organizations much more sporadically. This likely reflects low awareness and low appreciation for the
added value that the science sector could provide, as well as public institutions’ mistrust and lack of interest for busi-
ness cooperation. These findings are in line with most studies, including those of PARP (2013) and Eurostat’s CIS (2012),
which found that only 9 percent of innovative Polish companies cooperate with RDIs.

     Only a small proportion of firms consider suppliers as a source of innovative ideas. This stands in contrast with more
     developed economies, where companies in the supply chain are a frequent source of information on new technologies.
     Suppliers are not mobilized to detect promising new technologies or processes. Staff in charge of procurement rarely
     consider it a part of their duties to deal with “intelligent supply”; they mostly focus on ensuring the lowest possible price.

     Relatively few companies perceive customers as a useful source of information about innovation. Market intel-
     ligence based on existing and future customer needs is not high on the agenda. This is not in line with global trends,
     where consumers’ feedback is increasingly shaping products and services. Customers might be a valuable source of
     information about possible future development of the market, especially because most firms are unable to provide
     concrete examples of ongoing market trends, which could help them develop new markets.

     Polish firms use various sources of information with less intensity than foreign peers. Customers, for instance,
     are rarely used as a source of information: in manufacturing only 10 percent of Polish enterprises attached high impor-
     tance to this source of information, compared with nearly 40 percent in Germany or Hungary (Figure 45). The ICT ser-
     vice sector is even less networked with customers, although this seems to be more universal across countries. These
     findings corroborate the results of firm-level interviews and suggest a large scope for public intervention in enhancing
     Polish SMEs’ access to information.

Polish firms are also less likely to collaborate with science. Polish SMEs are less likely to reach out to science than
their peers in the Czech Republic and Germany (Figure 46). Large firms cooperate much more frequently. The public
sector should attempt to reduce this gap and help SMEs access knowledge developed at universities and research
institutions in Poland and abroad, including by upgrading the existing matching grant programs for business–science
collaboration and reforming incentives for higher educational institutions to reach out to business.

Growth constraints
Growth among firms seems to be constrained by multiple factors. The EBRD (2014) reports that quality of tax
administration, access to financing, and availability of skills are the main constraints for innovative and noninnova-
tive firms in Central and Eastern Europe. In Poland specifically, the main obstacles were tax administration, access to
financing, and labor regulations.39 In turn, managers surveyed for the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitive-
ness Report 2013–2014 considered tax regulations as the top constraint for doing business, followed by labor regula-
tions and weak administration (Figure 47). The World Bank Doing Business 2016 emphasizes paying taxes and dealing
with construction permits as one of the weakest elements of the business climate in Poland.

     Interview data suggest that access to financing is the top constraint for SME innovation. The interviewed firms
     graded access to financing as a significant constraint, at 3.2 on a scale of 0 to 5. Given that the Polish banking sec-
     tor is well capitalized, profitable, and liquid, and competition in the sector is quite robust, it is not clear what exactly
     constrains access to financing, although the likely culprits might include the availability of suitable collateral, as well
     as banks’ lower interest and weaker skills in financing SMEs. Further research would be needed. Aside from access to
     financing, barriers to entry to new markets and availability of hard skills were the other top two constraints (Figure 48).
     These conclusions are in line with other studies, such as that by PARP (2013).

     Different company types have broadly similar growth constraints. The “champion” companies consider access to
     financing and availability of hard skills as the key constraints to growth. For “sleeping beauties,” access to financing is
     the key constraint. On the whole, though, the growth constraints among the priority group of companies, “champions”
     and “sleeping beauties,” do not seem overwhelming (average constraints range between 2 and 3 on the 0-to-5 scale).
     This may reflect the improving business climate—in the World Bank Doing Business ranking, Poland improved from
     78th place in 2008 to 25th in 2015—and/or that the priority firms are less growth-constrained than average companies.
     Both interpretations would bode well for the prospects of enhancing innovation in Poland. Perceptions of growth con-
     straints across various types of firms suggest that firms diagnose constraints in a similar way, but differ in their ability
     to mitigate these constraints and thus develop at a different pace.              s

     However, start-ups face more constraints to growth than older and larger companies. Entering new markets
     seems to be the biggest growth constraint for start-ups, and financing is the second most important one. This may
     suggest that young companies lack information about markets and skills to expand their business. Public support that
     would help start-ups access information about markets (for instance, by preparing business and technology roadmaps
     [BTRs], see Annex 3 for details) could be useful. Given that a large proportion of young high-growth companies are in
     manufacturing (Box 30) and the government’s intention to “re-industrialize” the country, the public support programs
     could specifically focus on promoting growth in manufacturing startups.

                                          Polish “Gazelles”                                                   BOX 30

In 2015, a group of Polish academics prepared the first ranking of Polish business “gazelles.” It comprised about
3,600 of the most dynamic enterprises, mostly SMEs. In 2014, total sales of this group amounted to almost 200 bil-
lion PLN, and employment exceeded 340,000 people.
How dynamic are the “gazelles”?
In the group, there is a roughly even distribution of firms that are growing fast (on average above 20 percent per
year), growing (between 10 and 20 percent), and growing moderately (up to 10 percent). Between 2011 and 2013,
the share of fast-growing companies in the whole “gazelle” population fell from 45 percent to 32 percent.
What is the industrial structure?
More than 35 percent of Polish “gazelles” are in manufacturing. This is unusual globally and augurs well for the
domestic economy, given that manufacturing seems to provide a larger scope for productivity improvements
than other sectors (Rodrik, 2013). These manufacturing firms operate primarily in traditional sectors; about one-
fourth of them are from the high- and medium-high technology industries. This is in line with global trends:
65 percent of American and 75 percent of European high-growth companies operate in traditional industries
(“Inc. 5000” ranking), showing that innovation is equally possible in traditional areas.
What makes gazelles different?
In Poland and the United States, what differentiates “gazelles” from other companies is a particularly strong role of
the company’s CEO in the company’s management, high-quality management skills, and an openness to search-
ing for new solutions. In high-growth companies, the quality and skills of management are at least as important
as the quality of products or services (Wisniewska, 2015).

     Innovation constraints
     Access to financing is a key innovation constraint. Similar to growth constraints, access to financing is the most
     important barrier to innovating (3.2 on the 0-to-5 scale). Firms complain about poor access to financing from banks as
     well as complex and difficult access to public innovation funding. Difficulty with recruitment of staff with specific skills
     and education is another major constraint, suggesting that access to qualified labor could be a key area of public sup-
     port (Figure 51). Qualitative data also corroborate these results. When asked which innovation constraints (up to three)
     hamper the innovation processes the most, lack of capital and lack of good employees were the two outliers that rep-
     resented more than half the answers. These findings are in line with the constraints to R&D development documented
     in a 2013 report by PARP (Box 31).

Low customer interest in innovative products is also a constraint. Firms assert that customers are a constraint to
innovation because they are often risk averse and wary of trying new and innovative products and services. This shows
that innovation needs to be driven by both supply and demand: innovative firms need innovative customers. The solu-
tion could be to help innovative companies by making public procurement more open to new ideas and technologies
(e.g., pre-commercial procurement). In addition, if innovative firms cannot find innovative customers in Poland, the
public sector could help them internationalize and find access to customers abroad with a bigger appetite for new
products and services.

      According to a 2013 report by PARP, the main barriers to the development of internal R&D activities were the
      following:
      •	 Poor access to financing, particularly for SMEs; a weak capacity of financial institutions to finance R&D
      •	 Difficult access to public support
      •	 Weak human resources and organizational know-how
      •	 Limited access to external consulting services
      •	 Lack of own R&D infrastructure
      •	 Complicated accounting for R&D expenses
      •	 Difficult cooperation with RDIs: low interest in commercial research, excessive academic focus, failure to meet
         deadlines, complicated relationship with the scientific staff and administration in RDIs
      •	 Uncertain demand for new products resulting from R&D
      •	 Deficiencies in innovative entrepreneurship education and imperfect information flows
      •	 Insufficiently developed telecommunications infrastructure

Access to scientific knowledge and technical constraints seem not to hamper innovation. However, this finding,
based on the data from the firm interviews, is not fully in line with the fact that the interviewed firms in the eyes of the
experts often do not seem to follow technological trends and do not cooperate with scientific institutions, as discussed
later in this chapter. This dichotomy suggests that firms may “not know what they do not know.” One possible solution
would be to raise firms’ awareness of technology trends through free dissemination of specialized knowledge. This
could be done through business support institutions, social media, online innovation platforms, networking with RDIs,
and access to reports funded by business associations.40

International surveys show a slightly different picture of the main constraints to innovation. According to Euro-
stat innovation surveys, which are based on a different methodology than the one employed in this report, key inno-
vation constraints among Polish innovators are price competition, competition on product quality, lack of demand,
and access to new markets (Figure 52). Similar trends are observed in Hungary, in which these obstacles are cited even
more frequently. Somewhat surprisingly, lack of financing and of qualified personnel are challenges faced only by a
minority of innovators in both manufacturing and ICT services.

Firms perceive growth constraints as more important than innovation constraints. The average intensity of
innovation constraints is about 1.9 on a 0-to-5 scale, and that of growth constraints amounts to 2.4. Given the over-
all low innovation intensity of Polish companies, this finding seems counterintuitive: one would expect innovation
constraints to be more stifling than growth constraints. One possible explanation is that firms’ growth is perceived as
more important than innovation, so the growth constraints are deemed to be more of a challenge. The other possible
explanation is that many firms in the sample may simply not innovate beyond technology absorption and imitation
and therefore have no practical experience of challenges related to innovation.

     “Champions” seem to face lower innovation barriers than “sleeping beauties.” The latter perceive higher con-
     straints in practically all areas, except for technical constraints. Financial and other barriers to innovation do not seem
     to prevent the “champions,” which are committed discoverers and innovators, from pursuing their goals and imple-
     menting R&D projects. This finding stands in contrast to the results of the EBRD (2014) enterprise survey, which argued
     that companies with a higher intensity of product innovations, likely to be “champions,” were more sensitive to the
     external environment than firms that did not introduce product innovations.

     Start-ups face more barriers to innovation than older companies. As expected, the firm interviews suggest
     that Polish start-ups are more constrained by access to financing and availability of hard and soft skills than older
     companies. The continued focus of the public support system on financing start-ups is thus warranted and could be

from VCs and business angels.

Firms indicated that barriers to innovation are low, but this contrasts with weak innovation outcomes. The
EBRD/World Bank 2013 BEEPS enterprise survey (EBRD/World Bank, 2014) of companies in Europe and Central Asia found
that only 5 percent of surveyed Polish companies introduced product innovation. This result placed Poland close to the
bottom among peer countries (Figure 55). There were more companies that introduced process innovation—7 percent
of surveyed companies—but still low relative to most peers. The fact that noninnovating companies do not perceive
barriers to innovation might result from their lack of practical experience with innovation.

     Polish companies absorb technology developed abroad rather than develop new products for the world. The
     EBRD/World Bank (2014) enterprise survey shows that 9 percent of companies in Poland introduced products and
     services new to the firm or the country, less than in most peer countries (Figure 56). However, fewer than 1 percent
     of Polish firms introduced products and services new to the world, as opposed to more than 5 percent of firms in the
     technologically leading Israel (Figure 57). These findings are in line with the results of the firm interviews and imply the
     need for even stronger efforts to support enterprise innovation to close the gap with regional peers and some part of
     the gap with the global leaders.

Assessment of public support
Most firms report a relatively low level of knowledge and satisfaction with the existing public support system.
On a scale of 0 to 5, companies gave an average score of 2.9 when asked about their knowledge of public support mecha-
nisms at the national and regional levels. However, almost half of all companies had hardly any awareness of public sup-
port at all (1 to 2 on the 0-to-5 scale). Even among the more aware companies, the level of knowledge tended to be rather
general; most of firms were not able to pinpoint any specific public support instruments on the regional or national level.
This suggests an important area for policy action and need for a more proactive company outreach. As to the satisfaction
with the quality of public institutions, companies tended to be dissatisfied with RDIs (2.0 on the 0-to-5 scale).

The overall level of awareness and satisfaction with the quality of BSI support is also low. Firms have little
knowledge about the type of support that could be provided by BSIs. Firms that could mention a few BSIs nonetheless
ranked them rather low, likely due to the lack of trust in BSIs’ capacity to provide high-quality services. Firms assert
that potential support is not adequately adjusted to their specific needs. Companies complain that BSIs almost never
contact them directly to offer services or to provide support. The general perception is that the vast majority of BSIs
are not sufficiently equipped to deliver hands-on, tailor-made services.

“Champions” make use of public innovation support more frequently than others. This reflects their proactive
attitude, large appetite for risk, commitment to R&D, and innovation-oriented investment. Other types of companies
are less active and less aware of the availability of public support, although the differences are not substantial.

     Analysis of smart specializations
     Firms across all smart specializations tend to differ in size. Specialization “smart natural resources” clearly stands
     out, with companies reporting more than 50 million PLN in annual revenue (Figure 60). Companies in most other spe-
     cializations are clustered within the range of 20 to 30 million PLN in annual revenue, firmly placing them in the SME
     category. The smallest SMEs were most frequently found in “diagnostics and medicine” and “automation and robot-
     ics,” which could suggest that these specializations tend to be relatively young and small and/or that markets are more
     fragmented.

     Smart specializations have different R&D intensity. Firms in biotech are much more R&D intensive than other
     smart specializations, spending on average 6.2 percent of their revenue on R&D, a high proportion. “Healthy food” is
     the least R&D intensive (Figure 61). Although more information is needed on the R&D intensity of each smart special-
     ization, the results suggest potential directions of public support for enterprise R&D investment going forward.

     Firms across all smart specializations tend to perceive similar constraints to growth and innovation. Growth
     is constrained by access to financing, barriers to entry, and availability of hard skills, whereas innovation is restrained
     by financing, availability of soft skills, and a low level of customer interest in innovative products and services (Fig-
     ure 62, Figure 63). This suggests that all smart specializations could be supported by a similar set of policies directed at
     mitigating the biggest constraints. Smart Labs could provide additional information needed so that policies could be
     tailor-made to specific industry constraints.

     Drivers of innovation are also similar across all smart specializations. Management’s innovation mind-set and
     the quality of management practices are the key sources of innovation. Innovation efforts are also driven by new
     market opportunities. Finally, the need to develop new products and services also helps companies start to innovate
     (Figure 64).

Meta-smart specializations differ in terms of innovation constraints. The results of factor analysis (see Box 32 for
a definition) show that innovation in firms operating in the “energy industries” meta-specialization face more substan-
tial financial constraints than those in other meta-specializations (Figure 65). However, firms in “natural resources” and
“healthy society” face challenges in sourcing sufficient hard and soft skills from the market. These findings suggest an
important area for public intervention.

   “Factor analysis is a way to take a mass of data and shrinking it to a smaller data set that is more manageable and
   more understandable. It’s a way to find hidden patterns, show how those patterns overlap and show what char-
   acteristics are seen in multiple patterns. It is also used to create a set of variables for similar items in the set (these
   sets of variables are called dimensions). It can be a very useful tool for complex sets of data involving psychologi-
   cal studies, socioeconomic status and other involved concepts. A ‘factor’ is a set of observed variables that have
   similar response patterns because they are associated with a variable that isn’t directly measured. Factors are
   listed according to factor loadings, or how much variation in the data they can explain.”

     Regional analysis
     Firms differ among regions in their growth potential. There are differences in the typology of interviewed firms in
     each region (Figure 67). Slaskie has the largest proportion of “champions” and the lowest proportion of “steady-state”
     companies, an important finding confirming the large growth potential of the region. Dolnoslaskie has the lowest
     proportion of “champions,” but the largest proportion of “sleeping beauties,” which could become “champions” with
     sufficient public support. Swietokrzyskie reported the largest number of “steady-state” firms, which do not seem to
     have a large growth potential.

     Regions differ in innovation constraints faced by firms. Factor analysis shows that firms in Swietokrzyskie perceive
     access to financing as a much bigger barrier to innovation than in other regions. In turn, availability of hard and soft
     skills is a major challenge for companies in Dolnoslaskie (Figure 68). This suggests a possible scope of focus for policy
     action (access to financing in Swietokrzyskie, availability of skills in Dolnoslaskie).

Additional analyses on the regional level could provide valuable information. Given the rich data set gathered during
the interviews, it would be possible to position all regions across all the drivers and constraints of innovation analyzed in the
questionnaire. The same applies to all other elements in the data set, including growth constraints, strength of networking,
and the ability to follow business and technological trends. The data set could thus provide an important source of bottom-
up information about firms in the regions and help adjust public support instruments accordingly. The data from future firm
interviews should be made public (in an anonymized form) to allow stakeholders to produce their own analyses.41

Many interviewed companies were not aware of the smart specialization policy. Less than one-third of the inter-
viewed firms had heard about national or regional smart specializations. They were also rarely aware of the details
of the new smart specialization policy and the impact it is supposed to have on the national and regional innovation
support system and support instruments. This relatively low level of awareness suggests that further efforts to make
firms familiar with the goals of smart specialization policy would be useful.

     Business needs analysis—summary
     Public interventions in the new EU budgetary perspective should be developed based on the real needs of
     enterprises. These can be identified as a result of in-depth outreach to enterprises rather than, for instance, standard
     paper-based and impersonal surveys. Face-to-face interviews should be a critical part of the EDP and become a key
     input for smart specialization policies and the RIS3. Business needs analysis should focus on real barriers to innovation-
     based growth rather than on standard calls for easier access to capital, streamlined procedures, curtailed bureaucracy,
     or reduced taxes.

     Business needs analysis is a key element of the EDP. By assessing enterprises’ needs, public sector innovation sup-
     port services can be targeted more precisely. Business needs analysis can also help the public sector focus on those
     areas in which development can increase innovation and improve the Polish economy’s competitiveness. This is fully
     in line with the smart specialization policy and the RIS3, which aim to provide an integrated, place-based economic
     transformation agenda that focuses policy support and investments on key national/regional priorities, challenges,
     and needs for knowledge-based development. The RIS3 should set priorities to build competitive advantages by
     developing and matching research and innovation with business needs.42

     Needs correlated to growth
     Overall, the interviewed companies expressed needs relevant for almost all areas of business development.
     The most prevailing elements include access to financing, human capital, management skills, and market intelligence.
     These findings apply across most specializations and most innovation and growth drivers. In addition, however, many
     firms noted the importance of stronger networking, internationalization, and easy-to-understand regulations.

     As for access to financing, the awareness of different types of public funding is relatively high. However, this
     is balanced by a rather weak understanding of how to access public funding instruments, concerns about the need to
     deal with substantial red tape in the application process, and confusion as to the objectives of many EU-funded pro-
     grams, at both the national and regional level. Firms tend to rely on private consulting firms that specialize in prepar-
     ing grant applications to help them navigate complex bureaucratic systems. Firms do this because the grant selections
     systems are largely paper-based, where there is no need for entrepreneurs to present their ideas in person. As a result,
     such selection processes transform grant competitions into “beauty contests,” where style overshadows substance.
     This undermines the ability of the public sector to choose projects and firms with the highest potential return.

     Firms also have trouble accessing private funding. Firms have difficulty in understanding how to mobilize external
     financing from banks, business angels (BAs), and venture capital (VC) firms. Within the start-up community, a specific
     need is to access “smart financing,” which bundles financing and counseling, including mentoring, coaching, and
     strategic advising. Although the level of awareness and knowledge about BAs and VCs is relatively low, entrepreneurs
     generally tend to distrust such investors and do not see them as potential opportunities. BSIs are often not sufficiently
     skilled to assist SMEs in dealing with external equity investors.

     In terms of human capital, firms find it difficult to upgrade the quality of their workforce. This is partly due
     to the low awareness of the support instruments that would help train staff to deal with new machines/processes/
     knowledge as well as improve soft skills, including project management and teamwork. In addition, firms find it
     difficult to attract well-trained staff (both from universities and from the labor market). This lack of match between
     needs and supply could be addressed by public policy reforms and tailored trainings that deliver quality knowledge
     and create added value for firms.

     Firms often struggle to properly incentivize their staff. Most firms do not seem to appreciate the need to intro-
     duce clear, strong incentive systems for staff, including incentives focused on innovation efforts. They also seem not
     to follow basic management practices on staff performance assessment, including clear objectives and proper moni-
     toring mechanisms. This suggests that there is a need for public support to help expose firms’ management to best
     management practices, including on human resources.

Market intelligence tends to be weak. Managers often struggle to take actions that would allow them to collect and
analyze information related to new market opportunities, market trends, and competitors. This includes the ability
to make decisions related to new product development, product quality, or better understanding of suppliers. Weak
market intelligence leads to serious constraints—firms state that entry barriers to new markets is a major challenge.
They do not know how to access the relevant information and have difficulties determining which actions would help
them find proper instruments to overcome these barriers. Firms admit that market intelligence is crucial for them, but
the majority of firms are not aware that BSIs could provide such knowledge. The few firms that know about this pos-
sibility do not trust the BSIs’ capacity to deliver high-quality services.

Needs correlated to innovation
The majority of firms do not seem to recognize the need for innovation to improve growth and competitive-
ness. This often reflects low awareness of global challenges and an absence of exposure to international practices. It
also likely reflects the fact that most companies do not need to innovate to survive: they prefer to stick to what they
know, that is, the traditional sources of competitiveness based on low labor costs, high-quality human capital, flex-
ibility, and responsiveness.

Access to financing and human resources are high on the firm growth agenda. This is in line with general find-
ings across Europe. However, it seems that financial support is either not optimally calibrated or not used well. In
many cases the amount of funding is inadequate, partly because many public support programs are spread too thinly
among many beneficiaries. There are also the usual complaints about red tape and excessive reporting requirements.

Firms face constraints in following technology trends. They find it difficult to determine what type of innova-
tions they could undertake to boost their competitiveness and/or enter new markets. Only one-fifth of firms mobilize
resources to understand in which areas future innovations will happen and how to use this information. This highlights
a need for strengthened access to information on domestic, European, and global technology trends. Public policy
should develop a system that would help companies stay on top of technological trends and new business opportuni-
ties. This should be done in cooperation with BSIs and RDIs.

Firms are also not used to collaborating to develop innovation. Firms tend not to collaborate with competitors,
suppliers, or providers of capital to develop R&D&I. When they innovate, they take the whole risk of innovation on
themselves. Sharing the risk with other stakeholders, such as within a research consortium or a cluster, would increase
firms’ risk appetite and lower the costs of potential failures.

The legislative environment is a constraint to innovate. A large majority of firms in the sample believe that
national regulations thwart their ability to develop and implement innovations (across all drivers). Firms that are well
acquainted with international markets think that EU regulations are more favorable than domestic regulations.

Firms report that customers rarely seek innovative solutions. In general, companies believe that customers are
not willing to pay more for an improved product or service, which undermines the motivation of would-be innovators.
This finding tends to be in line with the overall relatively low innovativeness of the Polish economy. Customers are not
different than the average. However, “champions” working on the technological frontier have no doubt that innovat-
ing is a must and higher costs are acceptable if they bring productivity enhancement or higher quality.

Needs are well correlated with the company typology. “Champions” have more sophisticated needs than other
types of firms. They require more help in managing IPR and innovation, human resources, and R&D than other types of
companies in the sample. “Sleeping beauties” in turn need more basic support, especially on how to access knowledge
domestically and abroad, how to network better, and how to build basic skills for conducting R&D and innovation. They
also need basic business development advice on how to scale up their business and market their products and services.

Identifying the needs of specific firm types should help in adjusting public policy. The variety of needs and the
variation of the intensity among interviewed companies should enable policy makers and support agencies to deliver
well-defined “smart support” directly adapted to their target groups. The tailor-made approach is likely to be much
more efficient in terms of take-up and impact compared to generic support programs that deliver grants on a hori-
zontal basis. Table 11. Examples of support programs for firms with high growth potential: New Zealand and Denmark

Innovation strategies, sources of information, and growth constraints
Firms need to be exposed to the entire spectrum of possible innovations. Experience from other countries indi-
cates that firms that are most successful tend to embrace innovation in all dimensions, including products, services,
processes, marketing, and organization. There are often synergies and positive feedback loops among these different
types of innovation. In the project’s sample, “champions” tended to have the most comprehensive approach to inno-
vation strategies.

Access to RDIs is sporadic and is based on personal networks. The existing science base (mainly local) and the
access to information provided by RDIs is not considered a major constraint, partly because only a few companies have
experience working with them. Systemic information about the quality and availability of research is not available, and
companies often do not know how to approach researchers. They often perceive procedures at public universities as
burdensome and unfriendly to business. There is also a tradeoff between business secrecy and scientists’ interest in
publishing articles.

Managers do not feel that they face major constraints on access to information. This is the case for all firms
except those that are trying to enter foreign markets. However, many managers have a limited knowledge of domestic
and global trends. This highlights both a limited appetite for accessing this knowledge and an insufficiently robust
system of business information provided by trade associations and public organizations. Future reforms in this area
could be based on best practices found in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, Germany, or France.

Firms are interested in mentoring and coaching. Most firms would welcome critical and impartial reviews of their
competitive advantages, including a market audit of their products and services, organization, and marketing. Com-
panies are interested in reaching out to external professional experts who could provide an outsider’s view of the
company and indicate areas for improvement. Executive coaching is very much in demand.

Innovation constraints and drivers
Polish companies do not seem to perceive significant constraints to innovation. This is counterintuitive, given
the low level of innovation in the country. The likely explanation is that most firms do not innovate much in practice
and thus do not experience the real constraints. Discussion about barriers to innovation for the vast majority of com-
panies is still largely academic and theoretical. The interviewed firms are rarely exposed to competition and best prac-
tices, are weak in technology-market intelligence, and tend to think locally rather than globally.

Weak networking is also a constraint. Firms that are most successful in developing new products and services tend
to be well connected to their local and external environment through a web of private and public systems (clusters,
strong associations, international connections, proactive public RDIs and BSIs). This is not the case for most of the inter-
viewed companies. The Smart Labs’ findings confirmed this—most participants did not know one another, despite
working in the same market niche, technology area, and region.

Many firms were surprised by the range of potential innovation drivers discussed during the interview. Firms
would be better off if they could prepare innovation and growth strategies that mobilize more internal and external
drivers. The lack of focus on leveraging suppliers, customers, or RDIs as sources of innovation reflects both a lack of
awareness and a lack of trust.

Connecting business needs with public intervention
Identifying firms’ deeper needs can help adjust public support systems. The analysis of the companies’ needs
shows that there is a need for both horizontal and vertical innovation policy instruments. Both types of instruments
could be discussed in more detail with the participating companies during Smart Labs or within working groups at the
national or regional level.

Specific support instruments should respond to different needs of each smart specialization. The support
instruments should include not only help in R&D investment and hard technical innovation infrastructure (such as
laboratories), but also answer the strategic problems facing a given specialization. They can include some specialized,

                                                                                                                               83
     sectoral services, but also other challenges identified during Smart Labs and strategic analyses. Companies in a num-
     ber of specializations, especially in emerging sectors, find it difficult to deal with regulatory issues (such as in the case
     of the nanotechnology industry in Slaskie). Others need to improve their position in the value chain (for instance, sub-
     contractors for the automotive sector), and yet others (such as those in the CNC machines sector) should invest in new
     products and technologies. For example, while introducing new products, young nanotechnology companies have to
     freeze their R&D money for a few years because the registration procedures are unclear. This discourages them from
     innovative activities and can make other innovation policy instruments inefficient.

     Although the general company needs can be identified on the basis of various analyses, specific needs can
     only be identified through the EDP. The proposed EDP helps identify firm needs that are otherwise difficult to
     detect through the more traditional channels of public- and private-sector interaction. It is therefore important to
     keep the process ongoing and the stakeholders involved. This can be achieved by keeping the promises, implement-
     ing the instruments, and conducting the activities that were agreed to be of crucial importance. It is also necessary
     that all stakeholders communicate regularly about the achieved results, promote success stories, and share the lessons
     learned.

     Differences among national smart specializations are statistically significant only when grouped as five meta-
     specializations. A factor analysis of each of the 10 selected smart specializations did not show sufficient differen-
     tiation. Tangible differences are only visible among meta-specializations, which combine a number of underlying
     individual smart specializations. In addition, the interviewed companies had significant difficulty in associating them-
     selves with only one of the 10 national specializations that were selected for the project. It could be useful to consider
     reducing the number of specializations, by, for instance, merging some of them together. This would simplify the EDP
     process, reduce the number of working groups, improve information flow, and lighten the administrative load. The dif-
     ferences in needs of companies in more closely defined smart specializations would help design and implement more
     specialization-specific actions (as described in Table 12).

     Interviews offer a good opportunity to identify the target group for various policy instruments. Absorption
     is still a dominant feature of the innovative performance of Polish companies. It could therefore be useful to sup-
     port companies first in the development and implementation of successful, innovative adaptation of the absorbed
     products and technologies, and only later in more frontier innovations. At the same time, the few highly innovative
     companies should be able to use more specialized support to scale up and internationalize; their growth could inspire
     more companies to change their more traditional business models. This means that the support should be tailored to
     the type of company.

     “Champions” and “sleeping beauties” require different support instruments. “Champions” in particular need
     to be cherished. These are companies that, unlike the vast majority of Polish SMEs, already have the right mind-set,
     focusing on innovation as the key source of competitiveness. These companies need to be identified through an ongo-
     ing EDP and given a priority, especially because “champion” companies are still rather rare (according to GUS, there
     are not more than 1,000 companies in Poland that record any R&D spending, equivalent to about 60 companies on
     average per region). The “champion” companies require sophisticated, just-in-time, professional support, which today
     is largely unavailable because it goes far beyond the capacity of existing BSIs and RDIs. One of the possible solutions
     would be for the public sector to hire experienced consultants, such as retired successful businesspeople, to provide
     one-on-one information and coaching services to the “champion” companies. These services could be subsidized for a
     specific period and then become self-financed by the participating companies (thus providing a useful feedback loop
     on the quality of experts).

     “Sleeping beauties” need carrots and sticks. “Sleeping beauties,” as the name suggests, need an incentive to “wake
     up.” These are companies with substantial hidden potential that has not been leveraged yet due to weak access to
     external knowledge, insufficient ability to identify changing market and technology trends, poor networking, and not-
     always-optimal management practices. These companies are also often missing R&D as a key factor that could help
     them improve. As for “carrots,” the public sector would be well advised to provide a variety of substantial financial and
     nonfinancial incentives, including matching R&D grants, pre-commercial procurement, and executive and innovation
     coaching of enterprise management and staff. When it comes to “sticks,” public authorities could use a high-quality


84
selection processes with involvement of investment committees to encourage “sleeping beauties” to increase their
level of ambition, access new knowledge, and follow new markets; or they could help “sleeping beauties” by making it
mandatory for firms to use online public services or adjusting public procurement services to promote innovativeness.

“Sleeping beauties” would benefit from improving their innovative and management skills. For a company
to be successful, its management has to recognize the need to improve its practices and be able to implement the
required changes. Highly professional trainings and courses should be provided, including on strategic management
of innovation, access to information sources, and expansion in international markets. The training could also include
design thinking, in which the participants have to experiment with a shortened innovation process. Such a training,
especially if organized for companies from similar specializations, could be used to generate ideas for new innovative
projects. It could be led by business angels or VCs to increase added value, ensure high quality, and initiate potential
collaboration between entrepreneurs and sources of “smart money.”

Matching the different company type needs with proper support instruments is key for effective support.
Table 12 offers an example of how the different needs identified through the firm-level interviews could be linked
to the type of company, possible instruments of support, and recommended providers of support. The targeting of
the instruments to the type of company could be achieved by adjusting the selection criteria in the general call for
proposals. Most of the proposed instruments were already used in the Polish innovation policy, but their impact, due
to insufficient targeting or quality and imprecise design, has not always been satisfactory.43 Some services, such as
mentoring, access to financing, and innovation management, will cut across all types of companies, although their
intensity will differ. BSIs should be able to provide services at a higher level of sophistication to be useful to enterprise.
Whereas more generic services could be financed to a larger extent by the public sector, high-quality services that
require expert knowledge could be more substantially financed by the receiving companies.

To address the needs, the public-sector approach will need to be modernized. It will be critical for the public sec-
tor to be able to (i) address more sophisticated needs, such as mentoring or dealing with investors; (ii) become more
entrepreneurial, open, and proactive; (iii) focus public support on priority groups; (iv) closely monitor performance
and evaluate impact; and (v) improve institutional capacity and staff skills.

Specialized pro-innovative services need to be a part of the efficient national innovation system. One of the
barriers to the development of an efficient national innovation system can be the way pro-innovative services are
financed; in many European countries or regions, BSIs are contracted or even fully financed to perform a certain type of
service that the public sector deems necessary. In such a financing system, BSIs’ effectiveness can be strictly assessed
and continuously improved. In Poland, BSIs compete for public financing, often freely interpreting the conditions of
different calls for proposals. Sometimes there is not a clear link between a company’s real needs and the services
offered by BSIs. Also, the assessment of the quality of services is mostly based on project indicators and not thorough
evaluations leading to noticeable improvements. It is therefore recommended to design and implement a new model
in which BSIs would be paid for specified and well-justified services to enterprise, identified through a close public–
private dialogue. Public financing should also be available to private consulting companies.

The low level of awareness of public support and smart specializations needs to be addressed. Polish SMEs
often do not understand the intricacies of different support policies and find them difficult to access. Even though in
all regions, and also at the national level, there are information points and portals concerning European funds, they
seem to operate on the principle of “come if you find me” and do not actively look for customers. Even if they try to find
clients, it happens by rather traditional means of communication, such as conferences, seminars, or webpages, which
provide general information that can be difficult to understand. More personalized information, adjusted to the needs
of different target groups, could be much more efficient—distinguishing between company types or specializations
and focusing on issues most important for the customer, not the provider. The effectiveness of communication should
be evaluated on an on-going basis.

     Summary and recommendations
     The firm-level interviews demonstrated the following benefits (Box 33):

     •	 They help identify differences between national smart specializations and provide early evidence for verifying/mod-
        ifying smart specializations.

     •	 They help identify firms with the largest innovation-based growth potential and the greatest need for public sup-
        port (“champions” and “sleeping beauties”), detect the determinants of firms’ innovativeness, and adjust the public
        support accordingly.

     •	 They help select priority firms for the Smart Lab portion of the EDP and identify areas of endogenous strengths.

     •	 They identify firms’ main barriers to growth and most pressing needs for each smart specialization.

     •	 They help identify emerging business and technology trends.

     •	 They help assess the quality of the public support system.

     •	 They provide a direct way for companies to increase competitiveness, based on the experts’ feedback.

     •	 They help the public sector become more proactive, access firms that do not normally interact with the public sec-
        tor, and reduce the risks of the innovation policy being driven by vested interests.

                      Smart interviews—benefits for the participating company                                      BOX 33

       The firm interviews may provide a number of benefits to the participating firms:
       •	 The expert feedback delivered at the end of each interview can help increase companies’ competitiveness by
          addressing the perceived shortcomings, emphasizing the strengths of the company and its strategy, and shar-
          ing information on the available support instruments.
       •	 A questionnaire-based structured discussion on topics that are strategically relevant for firm’s growth can help
          tackle subjects that sometimes have never been adequately considered by management (for instance, employ-
          ees’ incentives to innovate).
       •	 The interview questionnaire shared with the firm after the interview can be used by a firm for follow-up analy-
          ses and self-assessments.
       •	 The data from the interview can help a company benchmark itself against its industry and regional peers (sub-
          ject to availability of data).
       •	 Participation in an interview can help a company to be included in newsletters and mailing lists provided by
          public administration with information on public support/financing sources.
       •	 Each interviewed firm receives a certificate confirming the firm’s participation in the EDP.
       Source: The World Bank.



     The main findings from the firm-level interviews are the following:

     •	 National smart specializations are different in terms of the number of firms with high growth potential, R&D inten-
        sity, and company needs. Public-sector support should be adjusted accordingly.

     •	 Firms with the largest innovation-based growth potential (“champions”) are characterized by high revenue growth
        rates; spending on R&D; a high proportion of export sales; a high proportion of science, technology, engineering,
        and mathematics (STEM) employees; and a growth mind-set among the company’s management.

•	 The main barriers for firms’ development include access to financing, access to new markets, lack of skilled person-
   nel, insufficient soft skills, mental barriers among customers (afraid to try innovative products), insufficient manage-
   ment skills, a low level of networking, and passive support from the public sector.

•	 The interviews identified a large number of firms with high growth potential that could benefit the most from public
   support. “Champions” have different needs than “sleeping beauties” and other types of firms.

•	 Most firms are not sufficiently networked, especially internationally. Many firms lack up-to-date and comprehensive
   knowledge about key business and technology trends in their business area.

•	 Most firms are skeptical about cooperation with the public sector. They generally do not know BSIs and RDIs and do
   not cooperate with them, and if firms are aware of the existence of support institutions, they appear concerned with
   the quality of their services. Firms need more proactive outreach from public-sector stakeholders to build networks
   and trust.

•	 Firms are aware of the available public innovation support programs, but lack details on which support instruments
   to access and how.

•	 Firms generally share similar innovation drivers and constraints across all smart specializations, suggesting a need
   for horizontal support policies, which can differ in knowledge intensity depending on the type of a company.

Going forward, national and regional authorities can adjust the interview process to their needs. Depending
on the specific circumstances and needs of each of the regions, the questionnaire can be modified accordingly. For
instance, the interviews could (i) focus only on selected barriers to innovation-based growth, such as the quality of
management practices; (ii) be extended to cover specific topics, such as protection of intellectual rights; and (iii) con-
centrate on providing innovation-oriented feedback and coaching from the interviewing experts.

The quality of the interviewing experts and the postinterview analysis will be key. Interaction with the com-
pany’s top management and the need to provide feedback requires that the interviewing experts should be credible
partners, with substantial professional experience and a comprehensive understanding of innovation management
and the public innovation support system. Regional consultants that will be hired by the MoED need to be properly
selected, trained, mentored by experienced professionals, and tested on the quality of their work (see Box 34). It will
also be critical to ensure that the wealth of information gathered during the interviews is properly analyzed and used
in policy making. PARP is likely to be the best partner to analyze the data at the national level. Table 13 summarizes the
main recommendations.

       Regional consultants selected to conduct the EDP need to be able to communicate with the interviewed compa-
       nies’ top management. They should be able to assess the business and innovation performance of the companies
       to ensure that the interview is not only a survey. To ensure that the consultants are of high quality, it would be
       useful to ensure the following:
       •	 High professional standards: consultants should have relevant economic and/or business education, exten-
          sive professional experience, and proven knowledge of the innovation system.
       •	 Intensive training: consultants should be trained in interview methodology and innovation management, and
          they should have knowledge of good international practices for supporting innovative companies from the
          leading countries, such as Finland or Israel.
       •	 Mentoring: consultants should be mentored/coached by experienced business experts who can also partici-
          pate in firm interviews.
       •	 Monitoring and evaluation: the performance of each consultant should be assessed through postinterview
          quality checks and surveys of the companies served.

     4.2  Smart Labs

     General conclusions
     The results of Smart Labs suggest that the process adds value. Smart Labs go a step beyond the firm-level inter-
     views: they stimulate a discussion of a broader set of actors and concentrate at the level of a business area rather than
     an individual firm. The SLs’ interactive character helps verify and deepen insights from firm interviews, promotes joint
     creative thinking about how to develop the business area, and builds mutual understanding among the stakeholders.

     Smart Labs help overcome a coordination failure. Stakeholders in the innovation system rarely communicate or
     cooperate, even though their activities can be complementary and collaboration would benefit them all. SLs pave the
     way for direct communication among entrepreneurs, scientists, BSIs, and public administration. This enhances the
     understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses and highlights areas for potential joint action that go beyond
     an individual firm. The SLs help generate farsighted, innovative ideas with strong development potential that could
     not be realized by an individual entity and most probably would have not been developed outside the SL process.

     Smart Labs are well suited to help verify the economic potential of a given business area. Direct communication
     between innovation stakeholders, moderated by an experienced professional, makes defining the thematic scope of
     the SL easier. Elaboration of a SWOT analysis and key success factors helps prove the growth potential of the business
     area. In situations when the first SL offers an ambiguous answer about the potential, the second SL meeting is devoted
     to probing other possible economic activities/business areas, with a modified list of participants, whenever needed.
     The first two Smart Labs can be organized within one to two months, and afterward it should be clear whether a busi-
     ness area looks promising enough to invest further resources. The willingness of business participants to engage in
     further analytical work, including by taking the lead on preparing a BTR, is also a good indicator of the area’s business
     potential and for the commitment of business partners.

     Smart Labs also help identify new potential smart specializations. The Smart Lab discussions among the private
     sector, science, public administration, and civil society can produce information about emerging technologies and
     areas of economic potential related to the topic of the Smart Lab. For instance, during the SL process on “smart build-
     ing” in the Dolnoslaskie region, it emerged that “assisted living” for elder people could be a promising new area of
     growth and a subject of a separate SL process. Such bottom-up-driven findings are at the core of the entrepreneurial
     discovery process.

Entrepreneurs seem willing to engage in the SL process and play a leading role. A majority of enterprises that
were invited to the SL were interested in this collaboration format, accepted the invitation, and joined the initiative.
The entrepreneurs expressed interest in taking on individual joint projects, as well as influencing regional and national
innovation policy. This suggests that the interviews work well as a tool for reconnaissance and spotting willing entre-
preneurs. It also suggests that entrepreneurs are eager to devote their time and effort if they see added value in the
SL process.

SLs help identify business leaders. Leading entrepreneurs and scientists can be identified during SL meetings. These
are individuals who usually have a vision of development of a given business area and can convince other SL partici-
pants to embark on a proposed undertaking. Emergence of a business leader during the SL is an important indicator
of whether this business area can develop further and whether it should receive support from the public sector. The
leader should participate in BTR preparation by providing insights about the market, technologies, and key players.

Smart Labs promote business networking. Smart Labs provide a useful platform for a dialogue among innovation
stakeholders. Smart Labs organized during the project revealed that many participating companies, despite operat-
ing in small market niches and in the same regional markets, often did not know one another. They were also not fully
aware of the academic potential that existed in the region. The SWOT analyses conducted during SLs suggested that
the companies also had low exposure to sources of information and knowledge. The entrepreneurs usually knew their
narrow market niche well, but were unable to refer to a broader (domestic and international) context. Smart Labs help
connect innovation stakeholders, raise awareness, and build trust.

They can also help analyze industry-level value chains. Smart Labs can be used as a platform to pull together the
participants’ knowledge to describe their specific industry’s value chain and identify the highest-added-value ele-
ments of the production chain that they could aspire to join. The value-chain analysis reduces the information gap
among many participating firms and provides directions for strategic planning. The value-chain approach was tested
in the project and yielded positive results (see Box 35 for an example of an SL based on a value-chain analysis).

                          nanotechnology Smart Lab in Slaskie
  Two Smart Labs took place in the Slaskie region during September and October 2015. They featured more than
  20 companies, research institutes and universities, BSIs, and public administration. The main takeaways were the
  following:
  •	 There is still only a small group of companies and research institutions working on nanotechnology.
  •	 There are significant difficulties with certification, registration, and security confirmation for nanotechnology
     products, which force young companies to freeze money for product development for long periods of time.
  •	 Most companies participating in the SL represented the initial and middle parts of the value chain, where most
     value is generated in final products.
  The main recommendations going forward were the following:
  •	 There is a need to connect the nanotechnology industry with potential users in other sectors, such as energy,
     construction, or chemical products, and concentrate on the development of products positioned in the higher-
     valued-added segment of the production chain.
  •	 Poland should adopt regulations from other countries, such as Germany or France, and learn from their good
     practices to help support further growth of the industry.
  •	 There is a need to concentrate public support on components and products that are already or can be manu-
     factured in Poland (for some nano-components the market is already dominated by the international players).
     Such product and components include nano-cables, nano–glass covers, batteries, heating elements, nano-
     disinfectants, and nano-catalyzers.

                                                                                                           (continued

       •	 The Asian and American markets hold the best potential for internationalization because they are not as highly
          regulated as the European one.
       •	 Because nanotechnology research sometimes produces materials and components that can lead to completely
          new products in sectors different than originally planned, there should be some pilot support instruments for
          experimental nanotechnology processes. Such an approach also fits the EU guidelines on smart specialization.
       •	 The local leader, the Nanotechnology Cluster, will implement the main findings from the Smart Lab in its strat-
          egy to become a national key cluster in the cooperation with the Nanotechnology Observatory in the Slaskie
          region.
       The identification of relevant global value chains (GVCs) and mapping exercise (Figure 70) with the entrepreneurs
       should be accompanied by addressing the following questions:
       •	 Do the presented value chains correspond to the specifics of the sector in the region/country?
       •	 Which value chains are present in the region/country? Who are the key players?
       •	 Where in the value chain would it be easiest to increase value through innovation?
       •	 Does the value chain have bottlenecks?
       •	 What are the challenges facing the industry in the near future?

     Scientists are willing to collaborate and exchange information with entrepreneurs. University academics and
     representatives of RDIs welcomed the opportunity to present their research and offer ideas to potential business part-
     ners. SLs also provide an opportunity for companies to enhance their knowledge about how they can develop col-
     laboration with science, something that most of them have not dared to try before. The more commercially oriented
     RDIs are ready to grasp an opportunity offered by the SL to reach out to companies.

     The SL process seems to offer benefits for all participants. Entrepreneurs invited to the SLs seemed to appreciate
     the chance to deepen their knowledge about their business peers, technological trends, market opportunities, and
     funding sources for their innovation activities (see Box 36). Scientists seemed to benefit from interactions with real
     business and robust feedback about which technologies could be commercially promising. BSIs were able to build


92
their knowledge base and offer tailor-made services to the participating companies and to the business area that they
represented. Finally, public administration met its objectives of involving all stakeholders in co-creating innovation
policy and selecting priorities for funding.

Business and technology roadmaps (BTRs) can help verify the potential of selected business areas. A BTR is a
short document that aims to (i) analyze the business and scientific potential of a specific business area to verify/modify
existing smart specializations or identify new ones; (ii) assess the main business and technology trends; (iii) describe
the main market players; and (iv) provide a roadmap of R&D and innovation investment and the corresponding bud-
gets. The BTRs should be made public to help guide private sector’s investment decisions, spur public-private coordi-
nation, and enhance access to market intelligence. BTRs should be prepared by external experts and financed by both
the public and private sectors.

                     Smart Labs—benefits for the participating companies                                         BOX 36

  The Smart Lab process is a swift, flexible, and informal way to engage companies. It is designed to stimulate joint
  creative thinking about the area of specialization and build participants’ mutual understating. The participating
  firms receive the following benefits:
  •	 The possibility to impact national and regional innovation policy and spending patterns. Entrepre-
     neurs often complain about the quality and direction of public policy, and many of them are willing to provide
     constructive feedback. However, they rarely engage in more formal and resource-intensive forms of dialogue
     (industry associations, advisory bodies, councils, etc.). Smart Labs give them a legitimate forum to address pub-
     lic policy actors without spending much time and effort.
  •	 Access to knowledge and market intelligence. The structured and professionally moderated discussion pro-
     vides the participants with a diagnosis of the sector through SWOT or GVC analysis. It also allows the firms to
     learn more about the technology trends and relevant activity of the research institutes (technology supply
     side). The Smart Lab process is also designed to provide key input to a business and technology roadmap (BTR).
  •	 The opportunity to network with science and business peers. It often turns out that regional actors do not
     know one another, and if they do, they have never held a structured discussion about the sector. Smart Labs are
     designed to address this coordination failure.
  •	 The opportunity to create science–business consortia. Smart Labs stimulate direct communication among
     entrepreneurs, scientists, and BSIs. At the meetings, companies can enhance their knowledge about how they
     can develop collaboration with other innovation stakeholders. This provides a good context to discuss joint
     activities that go beyond an individual firm and generate new R&D&I projects for various innovation programs.

Methodological conclusions
The quality of participants is the most important key success factor for the SLs. The success of the Smart Labs
depends on the quality of participants and their willingness to collaborate. The interviews help identify entrepre-
neurs who have the potential and willingness to cooperate with other stakeholders. Other participants also have to be
selected on the basis of their merit and ability to contribute to the discussion. The interviews can help identify suitable
scientists, BSIs, and RDIs; however, additional research is often needed to select them and invite them to the SL.

The SL process needs to be swift, flexible, informal, and based on trust. The themes of SLs that are proposed after
the interviews are likely to evolve during the first two SL sessions. Hence, the SL should remain flexible to define the
business area in line with participants’ suggestions and the identified potential. The composition of the SLs must also
be flexible; subsequent meetings can benefit by modifying the list of participants depending on the main theme. The
nature of the SL also requires a sufficient level of trust among the participants for the SL process to become productive
and possibly also self-sustaining. Business-type informality is essential. A one-size-fits-all approach to the SL process
is likely to be ineffective.

BSIs are an important element of the SL process. Involvement of professional BSIs strengthens the SL process.
BSIs are often the most knowledgeable actors in terms of available support and services offered to the enterprises.
                                                                                                                              93
     Proactive BSIs tend to have a good understanding of how the commercialization process works and how an individual
     enterprise can approach RDIs to gain knowledge about new technologies. BSIs could fulfill the role of a SL moderator
     and perform some back-office activities within the SL process, as long as they can provide high-quality staff who are
     dedicated to the process, manage the flow of communication, and keep up the participants’ engagement.

     The efficiency of each SL depends on the strengths of the moderator, business leader, and facilitator. Each
     function requires different qualities, skills, and time engagement. Specifically:

     •	 An impartial moderator steers the discussion and provides independent opinion. This role should be per-
        formed by an experienced and trustworthy (neutral) professional. To gain the trust of the SL participants and identify
        key aspects of the business area, an experienced moderator is needed, preferably with a track record in running her
        or his own successful business, advising companies, and/or being an investor in innovative companies. Former busi-
        ness managers, business consultants, business angels, and venture capitalists could be suitable to be the moderator.
        Importantly, there should be no conflict of interest between the moderator and participants, because this would
        undermine trust.

     •	 A business leader ensures market relevance and intelligence. A business leader is an entrepreneur who is rec-
        ognized by SL participants as a knowledgeable professional, has a deep understanding of market and technology
        trends, and has a track record of implementing innovation. The leader is also the external face of the SL who presents
        it at external meetings. She or he successfully runs her or his own business and is willing to invest time to better
        understand the business area, including by contributing to the BTR.

     •	 A facilitator ensures the SL process runs smoothly and stimulates the flow of information. This role requires
        good communication and administrative skills and concentrates on back-office activities. An animator is a secretary
        of the SL, organizes meetings, circulates information, and ensures that every participant is engaged in the process.
        This role does not have to be performed by a single person, but can be shared among several people. BSIs such as
        clusters or business associations as well as public authorities are suitable for this role.

     Active support from the administration is important for the success of the SL process. Participating companies
     and researchers are open to dialogue with the authorities because they see decision makers and innovation program
     managers as important counterparts and sources of financial and nonfinancial support. The role of public administra-
     tion participating in the SL is to show that the results of the discussions will have a tangible impact on policy making
     and on adjusting the public support system. It is also useful for public administration to inform the participants of all
     the various support mechanisms.

     Conclusions for the EDP
     SLs can complement or substitute national and regional working groups. Owing to their temporary, informal,
     and fast-paced character, SLs add value to the EDP and can help verify selected smart specializations and engage
     stakeholders. Usually it takes two SL meetings to assess whether a business area has enough potential to continue the
     SL process. SLs usually have a narrower scope than working groups (WGs) at the regional and national level and can
     thus provide additional and more granular knowledge.

     SLs can reinforce already-existing business groups (clusters) and lead to new ones. The project’s Smart Labs
     showed that the SL process can deepen cooperation between already functioning groups or networks, as was the
     case in the project for the automotive sector in Slaskie or the packaging industry in Zachodniopomorskie. SLs can also
     help identify new promising areas of growth unconnected to the SL meetings’ initial themes, which could be a starting
     point for separate Smart Lab process, the core of the specialization discovery process.

     Smart Labs can become a springboard for applications to international programs. Because the Smart Lab par-
     ticipants are often the leading firms and scientists in the specific business and technology area, they could form con-
     sortia to, and reach out for resources from, international programs such as Horizon 2020. Tailor-made information and
     coaching would be useful in this respect. This should be available to a broader group of companies and scientists than
     only those participating in the SLs.



94
Smart Labs can facilitate M&E of smart specializations by creating roadmaps with milestones. Monitoring and
evaluating S3s is a challenge, due to their sometimes generic definition. The Smart Labs aim to prepare not only a
development vision but also a development roadmap for a given business area. The vision and roadmap should also
provide milestones that would constitute reference points for future M&E. Results of R&D projects are difficult to fore-
see, which is why it will be difficult for roadmaps to provide specific outcomes. However, input and action from the
private sector can be easily monitored.

The SL process requires a strong coordinating institution. There needs to be an institution that actively coordi-
nates the Smart Labs around the country, analyzes the results, and uses them to inform the policy. Given its experi-
ence, regional outreach, and strong capacity, the coordinating role could be productively played by, for instance, PARP.

4.3 Crowdsourcing

Analysis of data received through crowdsourcing is largely in line with the interview analysis. More than
40 companies that responded to the survey believed that the process of applying for public innovation support was
too long and complicated, which is consistent with the information obtained in the interviews. Access to financing,
legislation, and availability of skills were perceived as the most important constraints for business. Innovation drivers
included internal company resources, customers, and the Internet. Polish companies operating in Silicon Valley were
using networking with other firms and with customers more extensively than companies in Poland. There is a wealth
of other data gathered during the surveys that could be used going forward.44

     Crowdsourcing can also be used to collect panel data. Crowdsourcing can be used to track companies’ perfor-
     mance over time through periodic surveys. The results would help inform public policy and adjust public support
     instruments. Specifically, crowdsourcing could track the awareness of and perceived usefulness of specific public sup-
     port instruments, such as innovation vouchers, and help align them with the needs of the private sector on a system-
     atic basis.

     The survey should be short, simple, and user-friendly. The main idea behind crowdsourcing is for it to be quick,
     efficient and simple. Hence, the time needed to respond to the survey should not exceed 10 to 15 minutes. The ques-
     tions should be user-friendly, clear, and intuitive. They also need to be accompanied by clear information about the
     objectives of the survey and how the results will be used. Crowdsourcing could use the existing survey platforms,
     many of which are free of charge.

     Coordination within the public sector is crucial to increase the response rate. There are already a number of
     ongoing public-sector initiatives that survey the private sector. It would be useful to coordinate these initiatives and
     avoid duplication, especially among the key institutions—PARP, NCBR, and BSIs—to not overburden the private sec-
     tor and to collect the most important data for all the participating institutions. One large survey with a significant
     response rate would be more productive than a set of specific surveys with limited firm participation. Finally, the
     source data from all the surveys should be easily accessible online and be provided in an appropriate format for down-
     loading, in line with the “open data” initiative.

     Incentives for firms to participate in crowdsourcing are important. So far, the public sector has rarely used
     surveys to reach out to a wide group of companies; the companies have also rarely been exposed to the public
     sector’s surveys, if at all. As a result, both a low level of trust and a low level of dialogue have been established. To
     change this and establish an efficient tool to crowdsource private-sector opinions and information into innovation
     policy making, it will be important for the public sector to start using online surveys on a regular basis and thus
     create a new cultural norm. To make this work, it will be important to provide incentives for the firms to participate
     in the surveys. These could include, for instance, information on how the participating company compares with




96
peers in the region or access to technology/business newsletters from the BSIs. Many firms did not fill out the
survey because they did not believe it would have any impact. Showing them the impact will therefore be critical.
Making crowdsourcing successful will likely be a slow process, but it needs to start now. Table 15 summarizes the
section’s main recommendations.

4.4 Innovation maps

With the support of the Bank, NCBR has produced the first set of innovation maps. These were based on data
from almost 1,000 applications received within the new open-ended, “fast track” innovation support program started
in April 2015. Each of the submitted applications contained detailed information about a given project, including
a business area (OECD) and technology (NABS code). On that basis, emerging areas of business and technological
strengths can be determined in a consistent way. The OECD and NABS classification hierarchy is broken up into levels
on which every application can be classified.

Innovation maps have the following benefits:

•	 They can complement the top-down foresight programs, macro and sectoral data, or innovation surveys with a
   bottom-up approach based on the private sector’s real demand for innovation and thus help verify/modify/elimi-
   nate smart specializations selected at the national and regional levels.

•	 They can help monitor business and technology trends in real time, based on an online, standardized, and auto-
   mated system of submission of grant applications.

•	 They can provide detailed information on the applying firms’ characteristics, which can be further analyzed in con-
   nection with other sources of firm-level data, including from the national statistics.

Innovation maps helped identify key priorities for business innovation spending. The analysis of all the grant
applications for “fast track” revealed that “health and medicine” is the dominant technology among the applying
firms, and “electronics and IT engineering” is the key business area of declared R&D and innovation investment (Fig-
ure 72). In addition, electrical and electronic engineering, robotics and automatic control, automation and control
systems, communication engineering and systems, telecommunications, and computer hardware and architecture
were also important. These business and technology areas make up one-fifth of all applications.




                                                                                                                         97

     innovation maps can also help identify regional strengths. So far, most applications have been submitted by
     firms in Mazowieckie (166) and Slaskie (117). opolskie, Zachodniopomorskie, and Lubuskie had the lowest number
     of applications. This suggests some scope for adjusting regional innovation policies, including by expanding efforts
     to help companies in the lagging regions submit applications. Innovation maps also allow for zooming in on each of
     the regions. In Dolnoslaskie, for instance, firms see the largest technology potential in the “health” sector (20), which
     accounts for one-fifth of the 85 total applications. Information from the innovation map could be juxtaposed against
     the results of the ongoing process of selecting smart specializations in Dolnoslaskie (Figure 73).

NoTE: The size of each bubble corresponds to the number of submitted applications.


innovation maps can also use data from past support programs. During 2007–2013, as part of the Smart Economy
operational Program, NCBR collected almost 13,000 grant applications across all of its support programs. The innova-
tion map based on data from these grant applications suggests that applicants declare “industrial technology” as the
dominant technology of investment: these were included in 7,855 applications (Figure 74). In terms of the business
area, most applications were submitted within “electronics and IT engineering,” “mechanical engineering,” and “mate-
rial engineering.” These findings could be compared with the results of the national technological foresights, bench-
marked against the national smart specializations, and analyzed within national working groups.




                                                                                                                        99

      innovation maps could be replicated by other innovation support institutions. Based on the successful example
      of NCBR, it would be useful for all other public support institutions to generate similar innovation maps. This would
      require that they adjust the existing grant application systems to collect data from enterprises based on the pro-
      posed NABS and oECD classifications. A standardized approach to data would help create a national innovation map
      based on information from all relevant public support instruments, specifically including flagship matching-grants
      programs. In the spirit of an “open government” initiative, all data should be posted online for wide public distribution.

4.5 Champions Club

During the project, the Bank experimented with a new platform for networking and capacity building among
firms. The resulting “Champions Club” (ChC) is an unofficial workshop-style meeting lasting up to four hours that
gathers “champion” companies selected through firm interviews. The main objective of the ChC is to facilitate net-
working, enhance social capital, and provide additional training.

Champions Clubs should be a community-driven activity. Regional consultants could help initiate, coordinate, and
moderate ChC meetings. The cost could be initially borne by the public sector. However, any subsequent meetings
need to be financed by the private-sector participants to ensure buy-in and align incentives.

Quality is key for the sustainability of Champions Clubs. This implies hiring experienced speakers and consultants
to deliver content for which companies would like to pay. Experience from Dolnoslaskie, where the Bank organized an
experimental Champions Club followed by a second meeting organized by the local business association, showed that
firms need networking opportunities and were interested in participating in such activities.

Firms expect quick wins and direct benefits from the meetings. Long-term benefits and networking seem less
appealing to entrepreneurs. That is why high-quality trainings or a knowledge component of the ChC, which provide
tangible added value, are crucial. Without these, the networking objective can be difficult to achieve because firms
may not be willing to participate. Table 17 summarizes the main recommendations.

      4.6  Business support institutions: diagnosis and recommendations for reform

      Business support institutions (BSIs) can play a key role in the EDP process. BSIs support enterprise develop-
      ment, offer services to the private sector on innovation and technology transfer, and provide training programs to
      private-sector firms (Box 37). Given their proximity to enterprises, experience in working with the private sector, and
      accumulated skills, BSIs are well positioned to be the key elements of EDPs on the national and regional levels. Several
      BSIs have been present on the market for many years, which has helped them become familiar with the public support
      system and reach out to entrepreneurs. They have also trained a number of committed and capable professionals who
      are respected for their skills in the local markets.

      However, BSIs struggle to meet the needs of enterprises. Interviews, Smart Labs, and workshops organized for
      BSI management in all four regions identified significant gaps between company needs and the type and quality of
      services provided by BSIs. This section diagnoses challenges facing BSIs and offers recommendations for improvement
      in their functioning in the context of the EDP and the overall efficiency of the public innovation support system.45

      BSIs can benefit from conducting the EDP in several ways. Participation in the EDP can help BSIs build staff com-
      petences, better position themselves in the regional innovation ecosystem, and access another source of financing. In
      addition, it should help them broaden their portfolio of potential customers, acquire specific knowledge about firms’
      needs, and adjust their services accordingly.

                                     A snapshot of business support institutions                                          BOX 37

           BSIs include:
           •	 National-level institutions, such as PARP, NCBR, and NCN
           •	 Local government entities and their auxiliaries, such as employment offices, social support entities, FDI services,
              and managing authorities for structural funds focused on SME support
           •	 Agencies for regional and local development
           •	 Business organizations, such as the Business Centre Club (BCC) and trade unions
           •	 Chambers of industry, commerce, producers’ cooperatives, and so forth.
           •	 Training, consulting, and advisory services and nonpublic labor market institutions
           •	 Entities supporting entrepreneurship, such as incubators, accelerators, industrial parks, technology parks, aca-
              demic business incubators, and so forth
           •	 Networks supporting entrepreneurship and innovation, such as technology platforms, clusters, National Ser-
              vices System (EEN, and technology transfer offices (TTOs)
           •	 Financial institutions, such as local loan funds, guarantee funds, and investment funds
           •	 Research and development institutes (RDIs)—including public and private universities, the Polish Academy of
              Sciences, excellence centers, and auxiliary entities supporting science
           In 2014, there were almost 780 BSIs in Poland, including over 180 RDIs. Additionally, some 450 universities and insti-
           tutions of higher education were functioning. In 2014, they employed 120,000 people, out of which 80,000 were
           employed by universities and higher education institutions. The geographical distribution of BSIs varied significantly.
           Individual regions hosted the following number of BSIs: Mazowieckie, 84; Slaskie, 81; Wielkopolskie, 69; Malopolskie,
           59; Dolnoslaskie, 54; Podkarpackie, 43; Pomorskie, 40; Zachodniopomorskie, 40; Lodzkie, 39; Warminsko-Mazurskie,
           33; Kujawsko-Pomorskie, 32; Lubelskie, 31; Swietokrzyskie, 23; Podlaskie, 22; Lubuskie, 20; Opolskie, 11.
           Commercial code entities represent almost half of all BSIs. The key feature of these entities is that the financial
           surplus they generate is devoted to realization of statutory goals. Limited liability is predominant in guarantee
           funds, seed funds, technology parks, and incubators. Often shareholders of those institutions are public (regional)
           authorities and universities (for example, regional authorities hold stakes in 80 percent of companies that run
           technology parks).



       	 Unless noted otherwise, analysis of BSIs also applies to RDIs.

      Revenue structure varies among different types of BSIs (Table 18). The two most popular funding sources are EU
      grants and projects and owner subsidies. Services usually constitute a small part of revenues. For business incuba-
      tors and technology incubators, revenue from office space rental is the biggest part of the budget.

Diagnosis
BSIs face many challenges. 46 Table 19 presents the assessment of the main constraints to BSI development. The
findings are in line with other studies that diagnosed similar deficiencies.47 One of the main challenges is that most
entrepreneurs were not well informed about how they could be supported by BSIs and have never collaborated with
BSIs. Firms that worked with BSIs had mixed opinions about the quality of services provided and tended to be skeptical
about the level of BSIs’ skills and competencies.

   	 This section is based on the literature review and the results of four dedicated workshops for BSIs organized by the World Bank together with the
     Polish Business and Innovation Centers Association (SOOIPP). The main objective of these workshops was to discuss how to ensure BSIs’ participa-
     tion in the EDP process and to find solutions to improve the overall performance of BSIs and their focus on firms’ needs identified during the EDP.
47
  	 See, for instance, Bakowski and Mazewska (2015).
                                                                                                                                                           103
      BSIs rarely cooperate with one another. Lack of cooperation often results in duplication of efforts in some areas,
      such as in generic market services, and gaps in other areas, such as sophisticated, high-value services. The fragmenta-
      tion of BSIs, despite their often limited capacities, seems to fuel competition in the lower end of innovation services. At
      the same time, this does not incentivize BSIs to work together in providing more sophisticated services, which would
      require BSIs to specialize in a particular range of services. Although competition among BSIs for public support and
      private sector “clients” is welcome, it would also be useful for BSIs, given their often limited capacity, to join forces
      whenever needed to provide a more comprehensive and more attractive package of services.

      BSIs have not always been able to make use of newly built infrastructure. In recent years, extensive EU-funded
      infrastructure to support innovation has been built in Poland. However, owing to unclear goals, weak incentives, and
      poor monitoring and evaluation systems, the new infrastructure is not used inefficiently. Often, brand new R&D equip-
      ment cannot be used commercially because EU state aid rules do not allow it. However, there are RDIs in Poland
      that made different funding choices and can capitalize on investments in such equipment. Their examples should be
      followed.

      BSIs need to be part of a comprehensive regional innovation ecosystem. The EDP will maximize its effectiveness
      only when a comprehensive innovation ecosystem is in place, in which BSIs and RDIs collaborate with and support one
      another and public authorities and other stakeholders are also included. The communication among the stakeholders
      seems, however, insufficient, because it is mostly conducted in a formal manner at official fora and is often missing
      at the operational level. The lack of stable, adequate financing for BSIs is an important constraint. Often, financing
      sources are dispersed between national- and regional-level institutions that are trying to achieve different goals. This
      can make it difficult for BSIs to achieve synergies and fulfill their missions. Also, significant changes in the innovation
      policy and in funding schemes available to BSIs from one financial framework (2007–2013) to another (2014–2020),
      especially the decreased subsidies for operational work, made it more difficult for BSIs to adjust properly. The pro-
      posed change in funding mechanisms aims to channel resources to the best BSIs because money will follow “custom-
      ers” (firms). That said, the transition period can be difficult for many BSIs.

      Lack of clear goals and targets undermines the BSI’s mission. Although BSIs and RDIs usually possess a general
      vision and mission, these often do not translate into clear goals and targets that these institutions are expected to
      achieve. Lack of a strong strategic direction that steers the BSIs and RDIs makes them more vulnerable to influence
      from funding sources and causes instability in how they function and provide services to companies. Unclear goals
      discourage performance management and weaken accountability.

      Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems concentrate on inputs rather than the impacts. Current M&E sys-
      tems across BSIs are diverse and tend to focus on inputs, which does not allow their performance to be measured.
      In addition, the diverse array of M&E systems and the lack of a common methodology for assessing results make it
      hard to compare institutions, even of the same type, such as incubators. This, in turn, makes it difficult for potential
      “customers” of BSIs to compare between them and choose the best ones to collaborate with. Public authorities also
      lack information as to which institutions are the most effective and efficient, and which need support to improve their
      performance.

      The problem seems to be with the quality of the services BSIs offer, not their availability. Data from the inter-
      views indicate that companies sometimes do not know what they do not know—that is, they do not know what kind
      of support they need or could use if available. However, in cases where they used support from the BSIs or RDIs, the
      companies thought that the support offered was too generic and not tuned to their individual needs.

      BSIs’ responsiveness to business needs has significant scope for improvement. Companies participating in
      Smart Labs signaled that they were not actively approached by support institutions. This seems to be a major obstacle
      to developing relationships between companies and BSIs. Companies often do not know BSIs exist, or they don’t know
      how to approach them or use their services. Apart from the awareness-building activities, there are other ways to initi-
      ate collaboration between business and BSIs/RDIs, which could be modeled on successful examples of business–sci-
      ence collaboration in the United Kingdom and Belgium (Box 38).

University of Brighton—Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs)
Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs) are considered the gold standard for university/industry collaboration
in the United Kingdom. The KTPs, a UK-wide program helping businesses to improve their competitiveness and
productivity through the better use of knowledge, technology, and skills, utilize a three-way partnership model
with a graduate appointed to transfer knowledge from the university to meet a core strategic need within a com-
pany, and knowledge transferred from the company to the university enhancing teaching and the relevance of
research. The government provides grants of up to 67 percent for innovative projects that can demonstrate the
need for knowledge transfer and that can propose a sound business case.
Target groups and stakeholders
Target groups and stakeholders are primarily SMEs, although large companies, third-sector companies, and some
public organizations are also eligible; academics and students with the potential to be “business leaders of tomor-
row” are also included.
Quantitative data
There are currently almost 1,000 KTPs in the United Kingdom. Around 100 institutions are active. Projects last
between 6 and 36 months, with two years being the average duration. The budget for a typical two-year program
is around £120,000, so the current value of the whole national program is in the region of £7.2 million. A single KTP
program results in an average increase of over £240,000 in annual profits before tax for the company partner and
the creation of three new jobs.

Belgium’s “Baekeland mandates” program
Objective. The purpose of the Baekeland mandates is to support research directed toward achieving a doctorate
(PhD) diploma to build up scientific or technological knowledge as a basis for economic applications.
Who? The Baekeland mandates are projects that are assigned to a “consortium” involving a Flemish company and
a Flemish university. Other types of knowledge centers (or research institutes, strategic research centers, higher
education institutions/university colleges, etc.) can also act as host organizations insofar as they cooperate with
an academic promoter affiliated with a Flemish university.
How? At least five partners are involved in a Baekeland mandate: IWT (the innovation agency) which grants the
mandate; a company with activities in Flanders that acts as the main applicant and is responsible for co-financing
(the company appoints an industrial mentor); the mandate holder; the knowledge center with which the man-
date holder is affiliated (a university, research center, higher education institution/university college); and the
academic promoter, responsible for the doctoral supervision and who is affiliated with a Flemish university.
Funding. The mandate holder can be an employee of the company or an employee of a university or research
center. The program is open to all candidates who are admitted into a PhD program by a Flemish university. The
funding program is open to all nationalities and to all academic disciplines. The duration of a Baekeland mandate
is four years. A Baekeland mandate provides funding for payroll, operating costs, equipment costs, and fixed costs
in relation to one specific employee (the mandate holder). The sum of the nonpayroll costs is maximum €40,000
per year in full-time staffing (or €160,000 for the whole project period). The funding granted by IWT depends on
the size of the company. The project can get 10 percent extra support if there is a well-balanced collaboration
between several independent companies and at least one partner is an SME. IWT pays the subsidy to the company
responsible for the full reimbursement of its partners.

      Recommendations
      System-level and institution-level action is needed to improve BSIs. The innovation support process is like a
      chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. The success of R&D, commercialization, and innovation depends on
      many stakeholders: (i) innovators (entrepreneurs who translate research into new products and services), (ii) RDIs that
      invent new solutions (researchers and institutions), (iii) BSIs that support the innovation process, (iv) dedicated fund-
      ing sources that are willing to finance risky endeavors, and (v) policy makers who create a favorable legal framework.

      BSIs need to improve their organizational management. Various managerial approaches are applied across the
      world that facilitate BSI operations; one of them is the EFQM presented in Box 39. Polish support institutions could
      learn from these models about how to better organize their institutions, streamline procedures, structure their work,
      better understand their strong and weak sides, and encourage cooperation.

                                             EFQM excellence model                                                             BOX 39
                                       an organizational management tool
        The EFQM Framework for Innovation Agencies (Figure 75) has been developed to provide governmental and
        regional agencies supporting innovation within businesses and academia with a holistic and universal approach
        toward excellence in managing their strategies. It focuses on nine aspects of the how BSIs function: leadership;
        strategy; people; partnership and resources; processes, products, and services; customer results; people results;
        society results; and business results. The EFQM excellence model helps people understand the cause-and-effect
        relationships between what their organization does, the enabling factors, and the results it achieves.
        Advantages:
        •	 Comprehensive, pragmatic management tool used by over 30,000 organizations in Europe
        •	 Provides a framework that encourages cooperation, collaboration, and innovation
        •	 Enables an organization to gain a holistic overview of its current level of excellence and prioritize its improve-
           ment efforts to maximize its impact
        •	 Can be used for individual agencies, or a group of agencies, forming a learning platform or user group
        •	 Recommended by the leading innovation agencies in Europe,1 which recognized the EFQM to be an effective
           method to introduce operational learning and to constantly improve operations
        Objectives:
        •	 Promote the use of the model in order to improve agency operations
        •	 Identify and assess good operational practices at organizations providing innovation support services

Robust monitoring and evaluation requires tools and indicators. Emphasis on M&E has to be balanced between
inputs and results. Having only one type of indicator does not allow a full assessment of the performance and does not
help in managing the institution. Box 40 offers examples of possible metrics that could apply to BSIs and RDIs, based
on the example of monitoring the performance of a technology transfer office. The participatory character of indicator
design and target setting is crucial to ensure inclusion in, commitment to, and understanding of the system.

                   Possible Metrics for a Technology Transfer Office (TTO)                                     BOX 40

  Metrics used for R&D collaboration, contract research, and scientific and technological services include:
  •	 Number of, and income generated by, collaborative research projects, contract research projects, and scientific/
     technological service projects, broken down by funding partners: national and EU subsidies; local, national, and
     international businesses (if possible, broken down by line of business and location)
  Metrics for commercialization of R&D results by patenting and licensing include:
  •	 Number of invention disclosures for university employees
  •	 Number of patents filed for application (the number of new patent applications filed in a given period depends
     both on the quantity and quality of inventions disclosures and on patent budget available to the university or
     knowledge technology transfer, or KTT, office)
  •	 Number of patents granted, at both the national and international levels
  •	 Number of license deals, number of patents transferred
  •	 Revenues from licensing/intellectual property royalty income (may include licenses and lump-sum payments,
     but also full-cost overhead, including IPR transfer share)
  Metrics for entrepreneurship:
  These are mostly applicable to incubator units (unless specified differently), which are usually not integrated into
  the KTT offices.
  •	 Number of start-ups accepted
  •	 Number and amount of pre-seed loans granted to start-ups
  •	 Amount of seed and venture capital attracted by start-ups
  •	 Growth of start-ups (FTE, turnover, profits)
  •	 Number of spin-off companies related to IP
  •	 Amount of income and return on investment (ROI) when exit from spin-off companies
  •	 For the university: number of students and researchers participating in entrepreneurship education
  •	 For the university: R&D projects’ income from their start-ups
  KTT office performance indicators:
  •	 Number of consultancy meetings with researchers and/or businesses (pre-project phase, funding opportunities)
  •	 Number of invention disclosures handled
  •	 Number of and expected income from (publicly funded) projects assisted in the application phase
  •	 Self-financing

The M&E system should allow comparison of various BSIs. There is a need for a standardized approach to assess
the quality of services provided by these institutions that could constitute the basis for ranking BSIs. This could be
similar to the World Bank’s Doing Business study. The assessment could focus on particular services but also on the
overall performance of an institution. Such a comparison could assist both entrepreneurs and decision makers in their
selection of potential collaboration partners.

Performance-based agreements could help improve the results of BSIs’ work. Performance measurement is an
integral part of modern public policy. It stands behind the creation of targets, contracts, and agreements that con-
trol service delivery and promote accountability for public resources. Performance agreements/contracts have been

                                                                                                                         107
      applied in a number of countries, including Finland, the United Kingdom, and Canada, to enhance the effectiveness of
      public policies. Such an approach could be incorporated between specific BSIs and RDIs and their public stakeholders.
      There are also a number of reform options specific for RDIs, including introducing new management performance
      systems, increasing the role of the private sector in their operation, and shifting to results-based funding.48 Box 41
      presents details on performance agreement applied in developed economies.

                                        PErformance contracts                                                               BOX 41
               an effective tool for enhancing the quality and results of public policies
            Performance contracts (PCs) are a management tool used to promote savings, effectiveness, and responsiveness.
            Objectives: PCs are used to define responsibilities and expectations between parties to achieve mutually agreed
            results. They are often used to enhance performance and accountability in public-sector agencies, including tech-
            nology development institutes, research centers, and universities. These key objectives are expressed in perfor-
            mance expectations linked to budget (inputs), service (outputs), impacts (outcomes), and management (corporate
            capacity). The focus of different objectives affects the type and design of applied agreements. Specifically, they
            (a) give a strategic focus to the capabilities created, consistent with the institution’s mission; (b) prevent confusion
            resulting from multiple objectives; and (c) generate the financing necessary to carry out basic functions.
            Parties: PCs are a signed between a principal (a superior entity in the government hierarchy responsible for public
            policy) and an agent (a subordinate entity in the same hierarchy, responsible for implementation of public policies).
            Types of PCs: framework agreements, budget contracts and resource agreements, organizational performance
            agreements, chief executive performance agreements, purchaser provider agreements, intergovernmental per-
            formance contracts and partnership agreements, customer service agreements
            Global application: PCs are increasingly being used in the national and subnational governments of OECD coun-
            tries. PCs have been used and integrated into the public management and accountability systems in Denmark,
            Finland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom. PCs are also used in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France,
            Spain, and the United States.
            Legal status: Typically, PCs are implemented by administrative or managerial discretion rather than on a statu-
            tory or legal basis. They are negotiated between agencies or individuals within the bureaucracy.
            Costs: Costs related to PCs may include transaction and compliance costs, such as negotiating and monitoring
            contracts, assessing and managing risk, and contract enforcement.
            Evaluation: PC evaluation includes (a) ongoing dialogue between the parties about performance relative to the
            targets; (b) annual reporting of results, as part of major evaluations of programs or services; (c) periodic reviews by
            the principal; and (d) external verification.
            Lessons for productive PCs:
            •	 The PC document should be freely negotiated. Otherwise, it will be accepted overtly but resisted covertly.
            •	 There must be a third party to ensure that PCs have been negotiated freely and that they are “fair” to both par-
               ties (as well as the nation).
            •	 The evaluation of the PC should be done by a third party to ensure fairness—clearly one party to the contract
               cannot be the judge of the contract.
            •	 The PC document must clearly specify success indicators and their relative priority. The meaning of success
               should be clear from the beginning. Otherwise, there will be unnecessary controversy later.
            •	 Adherence to PC commitments should matter. There should be consequences for “good” and “bad” perfor-
               mance. Otherwise, PCs will simply remain paper tigers. There must be an explicit incentive system to motivate
               people to take PCs seriously.
            •	 The method and modality for collecting and reporting information should be agreed upon before the PC is
               signed. Ideally, it should be part of the PC.

Collectively negotiated growth agreements could support coordination of the innovation system. Sweden is
an example of an area where growth agreements have been implemented and contributed to enhanced collabora-
tion among various stakeholders (Box 42). Growth agreements emphasize clear goals and a division of roles that are
worked out in a dialogue between a wide range of stakeholders.

  Strengthening the regional authority’s role and capacity for coordination of regional business
  support organizations: Västra Götaland (Sweden)
  Background
  The Regional Growth Agreement (RGA) aimed to provide a strategy and lead in the coordination of the region’s
  economic development strategy and institutions. The RGA was a three-year development contract that provided
  a strategic analysis of regional development, set the goals, and established regional priorities through stakeholder
  dialogue and consensus. The RGA was driven by several principles: inclusive and broad partnership, a systematic
  and process-based approach, specific regional growth potentials, and sustainable development. The RGA was
  delivered by Region Västra Götaland, which has evolved from the County Council and taken over responsibility
  for regional development from the state bodies at the regional level.
  Evaluations
  The national evaluations concluded that the RGAs have been moderately successful nationally. Specifically,
  RGAs have raised awareness of growth issues at the regional level, the importance of the regional context to
  firm competitiveness, and the importance of mobilizing nongovernmental regional and local actors, especially
  with municipalities becoming more active and cooperating to enhance regional and local competitiveness both
  domestically and internationally; they have also enhanced opportunities for knowledge sharing and learning and
  improved the awareness and coordination of regional development resources.
  Assessments of Västra Götaland’s RGA conclude that it has been an important tool for coordination and coop-
  eration between regional and local actors and contributed, along with favorable global economic factors, to the
  region’s recent economic change, supporting its transition toward a more knowledge-intensive economy.
  Evaluations highlighted the need for improved and increased vertical and horizontal cooperation, as well as coor-
  dination between actors involved in regional development at the center and in the region. This was addressed in
  subsequent programs.
  Considerations for application in Poland:
  •	 The RGA provides a governance framework for horizontal coordination at the regional level, with the regional

      4.7  Lessons learned and challenges ahead

      The proposed EDP has evolved during the course of this pilot. This section presents the main modifications that
      have been introduced since the commencement of the project. The modifications have been implemented to better
      suit the Polish context, reflect feedback received from stakeholders, and streamline the proposed model to increase
      efficiency and avoid duplications. The lessons learned will be important to ensure optimal effectiveness and sustain-
      ability of the EDP. They can also serve as a useful reference point for other EDP models in Poland and in the EU.

      Firm interviews needed to be streamlined and fine-tuned. Based on the feedback from the interviewed firms and
      project stakeholders, as well as an analysis of the statistical significance of questions posed, the interview question-
      naire was shortened from almost 180 questions to 100 questions. As a result, the length of the interview was reduced
      from around four hours to around two hours, increasing its appeal to the interviewed firms. The questionnaire was

110
also modified to better match the reality of Polish SMEs and better reflect an innovation model suitable to the Pol-
ish environment. Questionnaire modifications had to be carefully introduced to allow retrospective analysis of newly
introduced aspects; sometimes the already-interviewed companies had to be called back to obtain data that were not
in the initial form.

Interviews increasingly focused on qualitative, contextual questions. Standard paper-based innovation surveys
conducted by GUS and international institutions rarely allow for open-ended qualitative information about compa-
nies’ innovation drivers. To fill this gap, the questionnaire has been modified to include 20 qualitative, open-ended,
and “why” questions to better understand the behavioral drivers of innovation. In addition, each interview has been
summarized by the interviewing expert in a “one-pager”: a standardized summary note of the meeting with critical
contextual and qualitative information about the interviewed company. The “one-pager” includes a description of the
technology and business trends perceived by the company (“the next big thing”), business and innovation needs, and
potential instruments of public- and private-sector support. The responses to qualitative questions and the content
of “one-pagers” were codified to allow for drawing policy-oriented conclusions (for methodology, please refer to the
interview manual in Annex 1).

Scheduling interviews with companies proved to be a challenge. Identification of firms that would meet the
project’s criteria and setting up interviews turned out to be a resource-intensive process. The calendar of meetings
changed at a rapid pace and required a lot of flexibility on the side of the Bank’s experts and regional consultants. It
was also difficult to gather sufficient prior information about each company to ensure that the interview would meet
the project’s objective. The Bank used multiple sources of information to schedule interviews, including databases
from BSIs, Marshal Offices, and a proprietary firm dataset. These sources were helpful, although they had a limited
number of firms that matched the project criteria and the 10 specializations selected for the project. For that reason,
referrals from the interviewed companies for follow-up meetings with firms in the same value chain (customers, com-
petitors, and suppliers) proved productive and are likely to be one of the main sources of information about potential
candidates for interviews.

The quality of the experts’ feedback was important. Almost 75 percent of interviewees were satisfied with the
interview, based on the postinterview telephone quality check. This is a high success rate, given that questionnaire-
based interviews are rarely considered productive by interviewed firms. To sustain high interest in the interviews and
receive a large number of interview referrals to other firms, the script increasingly focused on providing the firms with
postinterview business and innovation feedback from Bank experts (which were highly ranked in 90 percent of inter-
views). Uniquely among firm surveys, which are designed to receive rather than to give information, the interviews
proved to be a promising method of directly influencing the interviewees’ innovation and business strategies. This
focus of the interviews should be continued.

Supporting experts’ judgment with a scoring mechanism helped select “champions.” Experts’ qualitative judg-
ment was critical to giving the interviewed companies a specific designation (“champions,” “sleeping beauties,” and
others). Quantitative data on their own are not sufficient to tease out the characteristics of companies, such as innova-
tion mind-set, willingness to take risks, and open-minded attitude, which are key determinants of a company’s innova-
tion-based growth potential. To further improve the selection system, a logit regression analysis of the data set helped
identify the key characteristics of “champions.” Based on these characteristics, a scoring system has been developed
to predict which companies could be considered “champions.” This can help regional consultants classify companies
and provide later support.

Regional consultants required coaching, incentives, and close coordination to participate actively in the proj-
ect. Initially, it proved difficult to engage consultants working at BSIs to conduct interviews and support the EDP proj-
ect. First, they often did not feel fully prepared to conduct interviews and engage in a dialogue with company CEOs.
They voiced concerns about insufficient skills and knowledge to deliver high-quality feedback to the interviewed com-
panies. Second, even though firm interviews provided BSIs with an opportunity to reach new potential “customers,”
learn new skills, and fulfill the core mission of their institutions, RCs needed additional financial incentives to conduct
interviews. They were not convinced that there would be funding available for the EDP from the national and regional
authorities. Third, many RCs in general seemed to be skeptical of the usefulness of RIS3 and the EDP. In response to


                                                                                                                              111
      these concerns, the Bank organized a number of workshops for RCs to explain the objectives of the project, the proj-
      ect’s requirements, the likely sources of financing, and benefits to the RCs and BSIs. In the end, the Bank selected a
      small group of five to seven RCs in each of the regions based on their commitment, skills, and willingness to join the
      project. The Bank also hired an RC coordinator in each of the regions to conduct interviews and to coordinate other
      RCs. As a result, 20 RCs conducted firm interviews on their own, for a total of almost 140 interviews in the four regions,
      above the project’s expectations.

      Going forward, interviews could be used in modified ways. Although the interviews provide a tested way to audit
      companies, based on international good practice and a rigorous and replicable methodology, national and regional
      authorities can adjust the interview process to their needs. For instance, the questionnaire could be shortened to focus
      only on the key barriers to innovation-based growth and require only about an hour-long interview, complemented
      by additional modules (on the quality of management practices, for instance) or focused on specific parts of the com-
      pany’s business. Moreover, the interview could emphasize more the strategic feedback from the experts aimed at
      increasing firms’ capacity to conduct an innovation process on their own.

      The quality of the interviewing experts and the postinterview analysis will be key. Interaction with the top
      management of a company and the need to provide feedback require that the interviewing experts are credible part-
      ners with substantial professional experience and a comprehensive understanding of the public innovation support
      system. It will also be critical to ensure that the information from the interviews is properly analyzed and used in policy
      making.

      Smart Labs proved to be a key element of EDP. Smart Labs designed and tested during the project provided a fast,
      flexible, and efficient way to assess the R&D/innovation-based potential of a selected economic activity and thus help
      validate, deepen, or modify existing smart specializations. Participation in SLs was driven by a bottom-up process
      of selecting companies with high growth potential, minimizing the power of vested interests. Thanks to the careful
      selection of participants, the quality of the information gained from them tended to be high, ensuring that the process
      delivered quick results. “Champion” companies welcomed the invitation to join the SLs (there was almost a 100 per-
      cent success rate among the companies invited to the SLs) and took an active role in discussions.

      Smart Labs also helped meet additional objectives. Aside from its main focus on smart specializations, the Smart
      Lab process on CNC machines also (i) helped create a new network of firms, scientists, BSIs, and public-sector officials,
      focused on the development of the CNC area; (ii) generated new knowledge among stakeholders and the business
      community through, for instance, the BTR, SWOT analysis, and discussion of industry-specific key success factors; (iii)
      helped guide public and private technology and business development strategies; and (iv) is likely to generate new
      R&D&I projects that will be submitted to regional, national, and international innovation programs.

      Smart Labs can help set directions for business development. Value-chain analyses (VCAs) conducted during
      Smart Labs proved to be a promising tool to analyze the directions for development of a business area. VCAs can help
      identify the elements of the value chain with the highest added value and discuss the roadmap for moving up the
      value chain. This approach was successfully tested during the project during a series of Smart Labs on nanotechnology
      in Slaskie, which helped identify the main development challenges for this young sector and offer policy recommen-
      dations on how to develop it further.

      Business and technology roadmaps provide added value. BTRs promise to become a new public good in Poland,
      providing much-needed knowledge on the technology and business trends in selected industries. The BTR elicited
      substantial interest among the participants of the national Smart Lab on CNC, for which the BTR was prepared. The
      participants emphasized the usefulness of the BTR in expanding their knowledge about the industry and wider tech-
      nology and business trends. The national smart specialization working group No. 17 on “automation and robotics”
      decided to use the BTR as a key element of the development vision for this national smart specialization. Following
      the preparation of the first blueprint BTR on CNC, the participants of the Smart Lab on the “foundry industry” in Swi-
      etokrzyskie are now interested in preparing a follow-up BTR for their own sector. Going forward, it will be important to
      ensure that BTRs are published online to share knowledge among all market players, guide their investment decisions,
      help coordinate with other firms, and align their strategic development plans with smart specializations.

Going forward, SLs can complement working groups at the regional and national levels. The added value of SLs
lies in their flexible format, fast turnaround, quick results, and limited life span. As such, they could be a useful instru-
ment to quickly assess the innovation-based development potential of a large number of existing and/or emerging
regional and national business areas and provide timely inputs into the existing EDPs at the regional and national
levels. Unlike the working groups, SLs are not meant to become permanent institutions, unless the participants decide
to transform them into cooperation networks (such as clusters) and knowledge-sharing platforms.

High quality of participants and experts and immediate feedback are key. SLs are likely to be successful only
if they feature participants (entrepreneurs and scientists) that rise high above the industry average. They should be
moderated by experienced professionals who carry credibility among the private-sector participants. Finally, all par-
ticipants, and especially the private sector, expect timely and productive feedback after each of the SLs, in the form of
meeting summaries, clear action plans, and a vision of how the SL can provide added value going forward.

The project corroborated the critical importance of national- and regional-level cooperation. The smart spe-
cialization agenda and the EDP concept are still new to Poland and relatively weakly mapped out, which encour-
ages experimentation with different solutions. Regional and national authorities are still looking for optimal ways to
improve the EDP and increase its impact. The regions emphasize a voluntary character of the collaboration mechanism
that does not impose a single EDP mechanism on them, does not compromise their own selection of regional smart
specializations, and does not burden them with additional tasks and costs. Hence, the cooperation mechanism pro-
posed in the project stresses an information exchange between national and regional stakeholders and is financed
and conducted by the national level (the KIS Coordinator in the Ministry of Development) through regional consul-
tants. An informal information flow should be ensured through regular meetings of units responsible for managing
EDPs at the national and regional levels. Finally, the cooperation mechanism should provide open access to EDP-
related results so any interested party can use it.

Stronger emphasis on the role of BSIs in the innovation system is required. Interviews and Smart Labs pointed
to BSIs’ shortcomings in the delivery of innovation and business-related services. To address this issue, the Bank—
together with SOIPPP, the association of innovation-oriented BSIs—organized a series of four workshops (one in each
region) targeted at BSIs to better diagnose the current situation and enhance the efficiency of BSIs. The main take-
aways from the workshops were that there is a large scope for improvement in setting clear goals for BSIs, enhancing
the incentive framework, and strengthening monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation, based on results-
based performance management, will be particularly important going forward.

Crowdsourcing tested within the project faced challenges. The Bank sent out more than 1,000 invitations to
respond to an online survey built around a shortened and streamlined version of the interview’s questionnaire (22
questions out of 100; 10 minutes estimated response time). The overall response ratio was low, around 1 to 3 percent,
although it was higher for firms that had been previously exposed to the Bank (the success ratio among the previously
interviewed firms reached 15 percent, and for Polish firms in Silicon Valley that were first contacted by phone, the
success rate was close to 30 percent). The Bank also experimented with various incentives to entice firms to respond
(for instance, it promised the participating firms a free coaching session with Bank experts), but the impact was small.
Follow-up phone conversations revealed that most firms were not used to interacting with the public sector and
responding to surveys; they were also skeptical as to the impact of their responses on policies.

Going forward, proper incentives for firms to participate in crowdsourcing will be vital. Online surveys have
so far not been widely used by the administration in Poland to interact with the private sector, especially to provide
feedback. As a result, both a low level of trust and a low level of dialogue have been established. To change this, it will
be important for the public sector to start using online surveys on a regular basis. Incentives for firms to participate
in the surveys will be key. These could include, for instance, information on how the participating company compares
with peers or access to industry-specific reports. Above all, however, it will be critical to show the impact: many firms
did not fill out the survey because they did not believe it would have any use for policy making.

Innovation maps produced within the project helped identify key priorities for business innovation spending.
NCBR, with the support of the Bank, has produced the first set of innovation maps based on more than 1,000 applica-
tions received so far within the new open-ended, “fast track” innovation support program started in April 2015. They

                                                                                                                                113
      showed that “health and medicine” (NABS 7) is the key technology that the private sector wants to invest in; “elec-
      tronics and IT engineering” is in turn the key business area of declared investment (OECD 2.2), followed by “mechani-
      cal engineering” and “material engineering.” The maps also showed that most applications were received from the
      Mazowieckie and Slaskie regions.

      Going forward, innovation maps should become a default option for all innovation support institutions. Fol-
      lowing the NCBR’s example, which has now decided to use innovation maps in all of its application processes, other
      public support institutions at the national level (PARP) and the regional level (ROP/RIS units in each of the regions)
      can produce their own innovation maps to support policy making. Given the small administrative and technical effort
      required, innovation maps can be used universally around the country. The resulting innovation maps should also
      be available to the public (posted on the respective websites) to help guide the developmental visions of the private
      sector.

      Champions Clubs provide useful networking for knowledge-sharing and training. Interviews and Smart Labs
      showed that companies were not strongly networked, and often the best companies did not know one another.
      Champions Clubs aim to fill this gap. The challenge is to bring together the best entrepreneurs, who are usually busy.
      It is then necessary to provide them with an attractive offer that encourages them to participate. Training sessions and
      lectures by successful entrepreneurs are good magnets; however, they should not be supply driven and financed by
      the public administration (except the initial meetings that would serve as an example to the business community).
      Entrepreneurs should take on the financing of the Champions Clubs and should manage the quality and suitability of
      the trainings and lectures.

“SO WHAT?”—Conclusions and Recommendations
The proposed EDP “made in Poland” seems to meet the objectives of the smart specialization policy. It offers
a new way to conduct innovation policy based on a bottom-up process of entrepreneurial discovery, which helps
select, validate, modify, and eliminate smart specializations. It also helps identify new smart specializations by analyz-
ing business and technological trends, as well as innovation potential perceived by companies participating in EDP.
The proposed EDP engages the whole set of stakeholders, the quadruple helix, and puts companies at the center of
innovation policy. It also helps synchronize regional, cross-regional, and national smart specialization policies. Finally,
based on the assessment of business needs, it helps the public sector adjust its support instruments accordingly.
The case of CNC technology has provided a successful example of a national smart specialization that was identified
through a bottom-up process.

The EDP can help enhance the quality of public innovation policy. It is one of the first systemic attempts in the
European Union to involve the private sector in the development of a country’s innovation priorities, smart special-
izations. It can help find an optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up innovation policy making. Both are
needed, but the bottom-up, private-sector-based approach to innovation policy needs improvement. If properly
implemented, the new approach promises to increase the impact of public support on enterprise innovation, acceler-
ate productivity growth, and increase social welfare.

It will be critical to ensure that the smart specializations fully translate into implementation. In the previous EU
budget perspective (2007–2013), as documented in World Bank reports, there was sometimes a disconnect between
the government’s policy objectives and the final results. Due to the inherent risk aversion, insufficient capacity, and
often suboptimal selection processes, the beneficiaries of public support were on the whole less risky, less innova-
tive, and less in need of support than what the support programs envisaged. Going forward, it will be important for
the regional- and national-level support instruments, especially the flagship matching grants, to be fully aligned with
the smart specialization policy. The results of the support need to be constantly monitored through rigorous impact
evaluation systems.

The EDP has to be adjusted to the local needs and the institutional and cultural environment. There is no one-
size-fits-all solution, and any EDP needs to reflect the differences in traditions and endowments of each region, as
reflected in various approaches to EDP within Poland and the EU. However, although the approaches to EDP can be
different, the final objective has to be the same: to unlock the growth potential of a region based on entrepreneurial
discovery and efficient support for new, innovation-based economic activities.

There is as much value in the EDP process itself as in the results. The main objective of the EDP is to help identify
priorities for the national and regional innovation policy. That said, there is also a lot of value in the process itself: it
helps align the public and private sector along the same vision of development, centered on the selected smart spe-
cializations and corresponding business and technological opportunities. It thus helps to concentrate scarce resources
and reach a critical mass of investment. It also helps create networks, knowledge, and added value that might not be
generated if the private and public sectors were not to cooperate so closely.

The quality of the grant-selection process is especially important. Analysis of selected support programs in the
previous EU budget perspective (2007–2013) suggested that the quality of the selection process was critical to ensure
that results of public intervention were in line with the objectives. It is thus strongly recommended that in the current
EU budget perspective all innovation support institutions move away from the paper-based system of grant applica-
tions from enterprises, which puts a premium on the form rather than on the substance of applications, which are
often prepared by external consultants focused on gaming the system. The system should move to a professional
investment panel-based system, where the panel members from both the private and public sectors would directly
interact with the entrepreneurs, without intermediaries. The MoED, PARP, and NCBR have proven that such a system
can work and is likely to provide much better results in selecting the most innovative and commercially promising
projects. Their example should be emulated.




                                                                                                                                115
      The overall business environment will be critical to entrepreneurial discovery. The World Bank’s national and
      subnational Doing Business rankings provide an easily accessible tool for monitoring the quality of the business envi-
      ronment around the country. As reflected in the Subnational Doing Business 2015 ranking, there are substantial dif-
      ferences in the business environment in the regions (Bydgoszcz is ranked number 1, Gdansk is 18). A high-quality
      business environment, especially in terms of ease of firm entry, start-up, and exit, is a necessary (if not sufficient) condi-
      tion for the emergence of a robust pipeline of innovative ideas.

      EDP-specific conclusions and recommendations
      Firm interviews are an integral part of the EDP. Direct contact with entrepreneurs ensures access to information
      that is otherwise unavailable. An interview conducted by an experienced expert with a CEO/owner of a company pro-
      vides invaluable quantitative and qualitative information and allows for better assessment of a company. Impersonal
      surveys (paper-, computer-, or phone-based) do not always fully reflect the reality of the innovation system due to
      their impersonal character, which does not allow follow-up questions and does not encourage firms’ top management
      to fill in the survey. Without interviews, the EDP will be less likely to deliver quality information and meet its objectives.

      The main recommendations from the firm interviews include the need to (i) hire top-quality consultants to
      conduct interviews, (ii) designate a key institution responsible for managing the interview process and ana-
      lyze the data, and (iii) introduce innovation and management practices training programs for innovative
      SMEs. In the medium term, it would be recommended to adjust public support instruments to the specific needs of
      enterprises identified through the interviews and introduce a tailored and sophisticated support program for “cham-
      pions” and “sleeping beauties.” Finally, it would be critical for public administration to continue to use firm interviews
      as a key tool to proactively reach out to business.

      Smart Labs are a key proposed element of the EDP and smart specialization policy. The main aim of Smart Labs
      is to help validate, specify in more detail, and/or modify existing smart specializations, as well as identify emerging
      ones. Smart Labs are designed to quickly test the potential of a business area and prepare a midterm strategy for its
      development. This is achieved in several steps. SLs start at the regional level but, if needed, may be transformed into
      interregional or national initiatives. The whole process should take no more than six months and be repeated for all
      new areas of interest. At every stage the SL can result in a “by-product” in terms of individual or joint R&D&I project
      applications to regional operational programs, NCBR, and Horizon 2020.

      Smart Labs benefit from an informal, flexible, open, and transparent process. Formalizing the SL process by
      introducing internal regulations or creating a one-size-fits-all process should be avoided. SLs depend on their par-
      ticipants; some groups of firms are already more networked and organized, whereas some are not at all organized.
      This diversity requires flexible management of the SL process and adjusting it to the needs of individual groups. For
      instance, an SL moderator should be able to access public financing on a competitive basis to invite or hire external
      experts with specific expertise needed by the SL participants. SL participants appreciate the informal character of SLs;
      they prefer to focus on outcomes and not on the process.

      The key recommendations from the Smart Labs include the need to (i) focus on the quality of participants in
      the Smart Lab sessions, (ii) clearly communicate the next steps of the SL process and expected results to man-
      age participants’ expectations, and (iii) publish the summarized results of each SL online to generate public
      knowledge and reduce the coordination failure among the sector’s stakeholders. In the medium term, it would
      be important to (i) build a pool of consultants able of moderating SL sessions around the country, (ii) generate trust in
      the SL process by acting upon SL results, and (iii) expand the use of BTRs and disseminate them online.

      Innovation maps help obtain valuable information from enterprise applications for public support. This is a
      new way to analyze thousands of grant applications sent by firms from all over the country, which contain valuable
      information about areas with large innovation and business potential. Key recommendations for the future include
      introducing innovation maps as the default option in most public support programs at the national and regional
      levels, increasing the level of detail of innovation maps by gathering more detailed information regarding OECD and
      NABS classifications, and developing a synchronized database of applications for funding from all support institutions,
      including PARP and NCBR.

Crowdsourcing is a new way to develop public–private dialogue. Online surveys are a simple, cheap, and effective
method of reaching enterprises that usually do not engage in dialogue with the public sector. Information obtained
through crowdsourcing can be useful for quick modification of support instruments, gathering information about the
quality of public services, and identifying companies with innovative potential. The results of the pilot project suggest
the need for public administration to systematically use crowdsourcing to build a new platform for dialogue, provide
incentives for companies participating in the survey, and cooperate on crowdsourcing with the private sector, includ-
ing consulting firms, to reach a large number of businesses.

The proposed EDP can be replicated fully or partially, on a voluntary basis, by the regions. The EDP model
designed and tested at the request of the Ministry of Economic Development is not mandatory for any of the regions
because the latter are autonomous in their decision making, and there are many ways to carry out EDPs. Every region,
though, is expected to develop a well-functioning EDP as part of the ex ante conditionality of the EC for the thematic
objective No. 1. The proposed EDP is modular and can be replicated by the regions in its entirety or in individual ele-
ments only. Regions that have already developed EDPs and do not intend to utilize the proposed EDP could share their
experience on how they have managed to meet the same objectives. Exchange of such knowledge could help further
enhance the efficiency of EDPs around the country and strengthen their impact.

Efficient cooperation between the national and regional levels will be key. Successful EDPs will require strong
cooperation, collaboration, and commitment among all public-sector stakeholders. The proposed EDP, in line with the
spirit and the letter of smart specialization policies, assumes that all stakeholders have the same mission—to promote
the economic development of their regions and of Poland as a whole—and are ready, willing, and able to closely coop-
erate to fulfill this mission, regardless of institutional, legal, and resource bottlenecks.

The EDP process will be as efficient as the quality of the institutions and people who operate it. The success
of the smart specialization and of the underlying EDP process, which is a new form of sophisticated industrial policy,
will require leadership, top-notch skills, and capacity to be able to work directly with firms, identify emerging smart
specializations and “champions,” and support their development along the way. There is thus a need to increase the
capacity of innovation support units at every level and in each institution. Given the specific, high-risk nature of inno-
vation support, the people involved cannot be run-of-the-mill civil servants, but must be carefully selected people
with the appropriate skills, risk appetite, and openness to working closely with the business sector. Once selected, suf-
ficient funds should be available to provide high-quality training, based on successful international blueprints.

There is a need to fundamentally reform business support institutions (BSIs). The lessons learned from the EDP
project suggests that, with notable exceptions, BSIs on the whole do not seem to function efficiently, provide sophisti-
cated services needed by innovative companies, or have sufficient incentives to work with companies. Going forward,
it would be critical to enhance the efficiency of BSIs (as well as RDIs) by: (i) increasing the capacity of their employees,
(ii) clarifying objectives, (iii) introducing strong incentives, and (iv) adopting robust and transparent monitoring and
evaluation mechanisms. Adoption of performance-based agreements should be encouraged, following the example
of, for instance, Finland, the United Kingdom, and Canada. In addition, governance systems need to be restructured
to ensure that BSIs are managed by experienced professionals with strong leadership skills and backgrounds in busi-
ness. Finally, BSIs could benefit from a capacity-building program, including by creating strategic partnerships with
international peers, training of staff by reputable experts, and organizing knowledge-sharing events on best practices.

Robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks will be key for continuous improvement of the EDPs. No institu-
tion is likely to succeed without knowing what it does well and what it does badly. The same applies to the smart spe-
cialization policy and the EDP process. Key elements of the new system, and especially smart specializations, require
a systematic monitoring, evaluation, and reporting processes followed by a robust feedback loop from the evaluation
results to policy changes. This will help enhance the quality of information provided to policy makers as to which pro-
grams work well and which do not and thus should be terminated. It will also improve the overall transparency of the
public support system and help involve a larger number of stakeholders.

Finally, the public administration should lead by example. The EDP provides an opportunity for the Polish admin-
istration to learn new ways to understand and act upon business needs and potential. The approach promises to
fundamentally improve how innovation policy functions and enhance the efficiency of innovation investment. But for

                                                                                                                               117
      the EDP to become sustainable, bottom-up entrepreneurial discovery needs to be embedded in the administration’s
      culture. The best way is to start leading by example: there is no reason why the administration could not be more
      technologically savvy, up-to-date, and committed to innovation than large swaths of the private sector. Table 22 sum-
      marizes the main recommendations.
