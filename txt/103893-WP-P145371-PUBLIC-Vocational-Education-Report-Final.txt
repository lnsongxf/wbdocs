2      Secondary Vocational Education: International Experience
  What is Embedded Learning?
  Embedded learning combines the development of basic skills with vocational or other skills, by integrating basic skills within
  another learning programme. This is achieved by teaching those specific elements of literacy and numeracy that directly
  support the development of vocational skills at the most appropriate time to deliver the maximum benefit. Embedded
  programmes have dual learning goals: in both basic skills and in the ‘host subject’. Embedding should be distinguished from
  contextualised approaches. The latter uses the context directly relevant to the interests and needs of learners as vehicles
  to teach literacy, language and numeracy……… the primary learning in contextualised learning is improving basic skills.
  Embedded provision should not be seen as basic skills learning ‘by stealth’.

A   s a means of informing the reforms to vocational secondary education now taking place under the umbrella of
    RMSA, 7 administrations have been chosen across 3 continents. They have been chosen to demonstrate different
responses to similar challenges and aspirations. Something which all have in common is that their responses have
developed from each administration’s existing traditions of vocational education and the reforms are part of that
continuum. Therefore, while the GoI may learn from these comparisons, they are not offered as a ‘solution’ to India’s
challenges but rather to prompt debate and aid decision-making.

An overview of each administration’s secondary vocational education provision is given below under sub-headings
suggested by the Terms of Reference (ToR) for this study. The information was gathered through a review of available
literature. This varied from administration to administration both in terms of its coverage and of its quality. As a result,
the information on each administration is somewhat diverse. This is particularly the case for objective evaluations of
administrations’ systems. For example, the systems of UK and Germany are generally well-documented and have been
subject to critical analysis – often by academics or other independent agencies. On the other hand, the Brazilian
system and, to some extent, those of China and Malaysia are less well-documented with in-depth, critical assessment
more difficult to source.

Enhance the employability of youth through demand-driven, competency-
based, modular vocational courses
Country                                                     Relevant Features
England       yy It is legally binding on all young people under 18 to participate in education or training to enhance their
                 employability.
              yy Both academic and vocational qualifications are included in the National Framework, the latter being
                 designed by sector skills councils comprised of employers.
              yy Qualifications are broken down into smaller competency-based modules to allow individuals to learn and
                 accumulate credits over time.
              yy Funding for education is devolved to local authorities, schools have a high level of managerial autonomy;
                 responsibility for teaching methods and materials is devolved to schools and teachers.
              yy Education and training programmes are designed by independent awarding bodies responsible for external
                 moderation and certification and are widely recognised.
              yy Vocational qualifications are in theory given parity with academic qualifications.
              yy Concern that unless achievement in vocational qualifications counts towards schools’ performance
                 measures, vocational qualifications will be associated only with lower ability and their value and quality
                 will be undermined.

 Country                                                    Relevant Features
              yy The drive to introduce vocational education into schools can result in poor quality qualifications being
                 offered which have little value either in the labour market or as a means of progression to further study.
              yy Teachers of vocational subjects are required to hold the same level of qualifications as their general
                 education counterparts.
              yy Vocational qualifications are continually under threat of being crowded-out by academic education.
 Germany      yy Responsibility for education is devolved to Länder which then collaborate to achieve policy uniformity and
                 comparability.
              yy The design of vocational programmes is heavily influenced by employers.
              yy A proportion of the curriculum at full-time vocational schools is reserved for general education subjects
                 and, in response to the globalisation of the labour market, the development of competence in languages
                 takes place throughout secondary schooling. Within the dual system language competence relevant to the
                 professional field is stressed.
              yy At full-time vocational schools, VET teachers must be either skilled workers or qualified craftsmen.
                 In-service training is provided.
              yy Costs of vocational education are increasing with the changes in skill needs.
 Poland       yy All teachers, whether of academic or vocational subjects, require to have both subject and pedagogical
                 qualifications. At the same time, there is a need to attract more highly-qualified specialists to work in
                 vocational schools.
              yy The school curriculum is not yet entirely based on learning outcomes.
              yy There is the intention to make exams lead to uniform vocational qualifications.
              yy The impact of a significant general education content in training programmes for 16-20 year-olds may be
                 at odds with industry-based learning outcomes and lead to high drop-out rates.
 Scotland     yy Breadth of subject range is emphasised, rather than specialisation, particularly up to age 17.
              yy There is no streaming of academic and vocational students either between or within institutions. Neither
                 employers nor educationalists are in favour of separate streams at school age.
              yy Schools are largely funded by local authorities. FE colleges, which cater for 16+ aged students are funded
                 against student performance criteria.
              yy Secondary school teachers, regardless of the subject they teach, must hold a first degree and a post-
                 graduate teaching qualification.
              yy Pathways leading to vocational qualifications and apprenticeships could be strengthened in senior
                 secondary, in partnership with colleges. Progress in vocational education should be measured and used as
                 one of the school performance indicators.
 China        yy Curricula are often out-of-date and are neither modular nor competency-based.
              yy Low-skilled teachers struggle to fulfil the needs of advance knowledge training in a changing
                 environment. This is despite the fact that all teachers are required to have a teaching qualification and
                 spend time in industry each year.
              yy There are few clear minimum standards for equipment and teachers, and some national guidelines cannot
                 be applied in poor districts with few resources.
              yy There are few quality standards for workplace training and few regional, sectoral or national bodies to
                 engage employers and link them to the VET system.
 Malaysia     yy A combined curriculum is being introduced which comprises 70% vocational skills training and 30%
                 academic education.
              yy Some vocational upper secondary schools will become vocational colleges with diploma-level accreditation
                 recognised in the national qualifications framework and including a work placement.
              yy Specific industries have been identified to be targeted and electives in the technical education pathway
                 will be restricted to 3 broad options.
              yy On-going reforms have a major impact on the number and quality of teachers required, which was already
                 a cause for concern. They are expected to have a level 3 Skills Certificate and a Bachelor of Vocational
                 Education. There are proposals to replace the current tenured contracts with ones based on performance
                 and to require industrial work experience.

Country                                                    Relevant Features
           yy Concerns over quality are linked to an over-rapid expansion of the vocational education system.
Brazil     yy (Upper) secondary vocational schools offer technician courses in the areas of services, industry and
              agriculture, each with a specified number of hours for general and vocational education and for practical
              training. These allow access to HE as well as to post-secondary vocational courses.
           yy Distance learning technical education is being piloted.
           yy The qualifications of teachers are being upgraded and all will be expected to have a university degree. The
              quality of teachers remains a major priority.
           yy An excessively large compulsory curriculum stifles vocational education, squeezing it out.


Maintain their competitiveness through provisions of multi-entry, multi-
exit, learning opportunities and vertical mobility/inter-changeability in
qualifications
Country                                                   Relevant Features
England    yy A national qualifications framework is already in existence and referenced against the EQF.
           yy Vocational education and general education routes are not distinct and students can move between them.
           yy At age 14-16 students are expected to follow a broad-based curriculum with vocational subjects
              comprising no more than 20%.
           yy There is a lack of continuity between vocational education for 14-16 year olds and the options post-16.
           yy The labour market offers very poor returns to low-level vocational qualification holders, but good returns
              at the higher levels.
Germany    yy at age 16 students choose between an academic school, a vocational school and an apprenticeship.
              Choosing vocational education does not prevent students from subsequently progressing to academic
              education.
           yy A national qualifications framework is being set up, to reference against the EQF, to include informal and
              non-formal learning.
           yy The Chamber exam which students take at the end of their apprenticeship does not include the school-
              based element of the programme. As a result students may not take their schooling seriously and limit
              their chances of accessing HE in the future.
Poland     yy   The increasing interest in vocational education is linked to the opening up of overseas labour markets.
           yy   A national qualifications framework is being developed which will be referenced against the EQF.
           yy   The Government is considering extending vocational schools to include provision for adults.
           yy   The need for more flexibility in integrating vocational and general education is recognised, in particular
                to enhance general education in the basic vocational school curriculum.
Scotland   yy A national qualifications framework brings together all qualifications from Access to Doctorate levels, both
              academic and vocational. It is referenced against the EQF.
           yy The importance of articulation between pre-16 and post-16 education is recognised in recent reviews.
           yy There need to be more comprehensive standards for careers guidance which cover guidance pre- age 15;
              CPD for teachers re the world of work; and school/industry partnerships.
China      yy China has no plans to develop a national qualifications framework.
           yy Vocational secondary schools offer limited general education and, until now, their graduates have been
              unlikely to access tertiary education. Reforms are under way to address this and allow talented students
              from the vocational stream to enter HE.
           yy The public has a negative perception of vocational education for a variety of reasons including the lack of
              a pathway to HE and the weak link between vocational and general education.




                                                                                                     CHAPTER 4: Summary      41

     Malaysia      yy A national qualifications framework is being introduced but it focuses on post-secondary qualifications.
                   yy General education continues as a significant component of vocational education both in lower and upper
                      secondary.
     Brazil        yy No national qualification framework has been established.

     Country                                                       Relevant Features
     England       yy Employer-led bodies advise on vocational education and influence the development of qualifications and
                      training programmes. They may also advise on core subjects.
                   yy School-based vocational education may be in partnership with universities, colleges and businesses to
                      match national curriculum requirements to local needs.
                   yy Education/business partnerships may include work experience for both pupils and teachers.
     Germany       yy   An introduction to the world of work is included in the curriculum for students still in compulsory education.
                   yy   Employers are strongly represented on all statutory and consultative bodies for vocational education.
                   yy   The Chambers administer exams and certificate trainees.
                   yy   The service sector is much less likely to offer apprenticeships than the manufacturing sector which leads
                        to a shortage of training places for young people.
     Poland        yy Employers need to be engaged to a greater extent in curriculum development and assessment.
                   yy The Government plans to set a minimum number of hours for practical training for certain types of
                      vocational schools.
     Scotland      yy A post-16 transition planning model has been introduced to support students to progress within and
                      beyond senior secondary schooling.
                   yy A standard is required against which to measure and evaluate the content of work experience, with
                      accompanying guidelines for employers.
                   yy Recent reforms have included more skill-for-work options for school pupils and greater emphasis on
                      entrepreneurship.
                   yy The employer-led bodies mentioned under England (above) also have a remit in Scotland.
     China         yy Although work experience or ‘apprenticeships’ are often offered in the final year of vocational schooling,
                      the quality of these varies widely and may even be unrelated to the student’s field of study.
     Malaysia      yy Formal partnerships between government and industry and between schools and industry are being
                      established based on MoUs.
                   yy Apprehension by employers on taking unskilled, 14+ aged students into the workplace is hindering the
                      successful implementation of the new traineeship programmes for upper vocational secondary school
                      students. Better guidance for employers is required. Employers are being offered an inducement of 100%
                      of training-related expenditure.
     Brazil        yy Vocational schools are expected to form partnerships with industry so that students can develop practical
                      skills in the workplace as part of their training.

 England      yy Some work-related, vocational courses have been introduced for 14-16 year-olds and for 16-19 year olds still
                 at school.
              yy 16-18 year-olds may attend college for full-time study or as part of an apprenticeship.
 Germany      yy At age 16 students have the choice of full-time, occupationally-based, vocational education which includes
                 work experience, or part-time linked to an apprenticeship.
              yy Careers guidance can be very variable between Länder with no single agency responsible for providing

 Poland       yy At age 14-16, 15% of the curriculum is devoted to vocational education.
              yy Those who decide to continue their education beyond age 16 must choose between general upper secondary,
                 technical upper secondary, basic vocational schools or an apprenticeship.
              yy The rate of dis-continuation from secondary schools has been increasing. This may be the result of lengthy
                 vocational programmes with weak links to the labour market.
 Scotland     yy Vocational options are available in secondary schools from age 14.
              yy At age 16 students may continue their education at school, transfer to an FE college or begin an apprenticeship.
              yy All state secondary schools are comprehensive and students may continue their education, academic or
                 vocational, within the same institution. From 14 years old, students choose the mix of subjects which best
                 suits their needs.
              yy There need to be more comprehensive standards for careers guidance which cover guidance pre- age 15; CPD
                 for teachers re the world of work; and school/industry partnerships.
 China        yy Students may specialise as early as 12 years of age, by transferring to a vocational junior secondary school.
                 There are also vocational high schools.

 Brazil       yy At age 14 students can opt for either general education or vocational education.

       Summary of Policy Changes related to
                VET in England, 1996-2011


 Policy changes                                                                      Impact
 The Education Act 1996                    Defined the scope of secondary education
 The School Standards and Framework        Enabled further education institutions to provide secondary education for pupils aged
 Act 1998                                  14 to 16 in collaboration with local authorities (LAs)
 The Learning and Skills Act 2000          The planning and funding for all post-compulsory learning below higher education
                                           was integrated into one overarching sector, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC)
 The Education Act 2002                    Created a legislative distinction between key stages 1 to 3 (5- to 14-year-olds) and
                                           key stage 4 (14- to 16-year-olds) of compulsory education, which allowed flexibility
                                           to tailor education to individual needs for pupils in key stage 4. For example, the
                                           number of compulsory subjects was reduced, and a statutory requirement for all
                                           students in key stage 4 in maintained schools to be offered some work-related
                                           learning was introduced.
 The Education and Inspection Act          Developed new diplomas for 14- to 19-year-olds, which combine general and
 2006                                      vocational learning.
 The Education and Skills Act 2008         Raised the compulsory age of participation in education or training to 18 from 2015.
                                           Young people between 16-18 years old must follow one of the following options;
                                           a) full-time education, b) an apprenticeship, or c) part-time education and training if
                                           they are employed, self-employed or volunteering full-time (defined as 20 hours per
                                           week)322
 The Apprenticeships, Skills, Children     Transferred the responsibility for funding education and training for young people
 and Learning Act 2009                     over compulsory school age (but under 19) from LSC (as defined in The Learning and
                                           Skills Act 2000) to LAs.
                                           Established the Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (Ofqual) as a
                                           new independent regulator of qualifications and assessments.
                                           Introduced the National Apprenticeship Service which provides a single point of
                                           contact for employers who want to offer apprenticeships, and for prospective
                                           apprentices.
                                           Gave all employees the right to request
                                           time for training from their employer
 The Youth Contract announced in           Offering a range of opportunities to unemployed 18-24 year-olds and additional
 2011                                      support for disengaged and vulnerable 16 and 17 year-olds323.
