         Key Water and Sanitation Sector Challenges

         X   Ensuring the affordability of water tariffs in the future. Tariffs are expected to increase in the
             coming years, since €290 million of annual investments are planned until 2022. With potential
             water and sanitation expenditure representing more than 3% of the average income of the bottom
             40% of the population (Authors’ elaboration), the affordability of water tariffs will have to be
             carefully monitored in the future.
         X   Improving the availability of structured, reliable, and comprehensive data about the sector’s
             situation. In the absence of a regulator-sanctioned data collection, there are presently no
             structured and comprehensive information giving a clear picture of the sector. As a result, utility
             managers cannot assess whether their operation is at par with good practices. Addressing this
             challenge would help the sector move ahead.
         X   Improving the cost recovery level of services. Tariffs cover operation and maintenance costs
             but not capital expenditure. Within the context of important investment needs, improving the cost
             recovery level may be required, since EU cohesion funds and national subsidies may not cover all
             capital funding needs through 2022.

Economy. Since the establishment of the Slovak Republic in January 1993, the country has undergone a transition
from a centrally planned economy to a free market economy. The Slovak Republic is considered a high-income
country. It has been an EU Member State since 2004, and adopted the euro currency at the beginning of 2009. The
country has 5.4 million inhabitants according to the 2011 census, 54% of whom live in urban settings. The country is
densely populated, with 110 inhabitants/km2. Economic growth is 2.5%, but the unemployment rate is relatively high
(around 13%), and around 14% of the population lives below the poverty line (with 0.67% living on $2.50/day). The
Roma population is generally considered a vulnerable minority, but the official estimate (2% according to the 2011
census) remains far below their real number (which is as high as 8%) (World Bank 2015).

Governance. The Slovak Republic is a unitary state with a presidential, parliamentary, and governmental system.
The country is divided into 8 regions, 79 districts, and 2,883 municipalities. Regions are the highest administrative
units and are self-governing. Municipalities are the lowest territorial units (one or several villages). The self-governing
municipalities are responsible for provision of water and sanitation services. (MinV 2015)

Water resources. The Slovak Republic is a landlocked country, a particularity of which is that almost all its
water flows out of its territory toward neighboring countries. About 96% of the water flow via the Danube and
its tributaries to the Black Sea and 4% via the Wisla River over Poland to the Baltic Sea. Renewable water sources
depend entirely on precipitation. According to the water balance, on average over the last 4 years, 340.47 Mm3 of
groundwater and 275.46 Mm3 of surface water have been abstracted each year. The average volume of renewable
water resources (internal river flows and groundwater from rainfall) is 9,199 m3/capita/year (FAO Aquastat 2015). The
government has approved an adaptation strategy to tackle the adverse impacts of climate change, and has developed
indicators of drought and water scarcity, risk maps, and drought management plans. Moreover, the entire country is
declared a “sensitive area” in the sense of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) (MINZP 2014b).

Water supply sources. Water for drinking purposes comes predominantly from groundwater sources (83%) (ICPDR
2015). Watercourse and water resources management is based on hydrologic basins. Water resources management
is fully in compliance with the global trend as to Integrated Water Resources Management. Principles of water
management are contained in the “Water Plan,” which integrates plans for the Wisla and the Danube basins. Any
surface water or groundwater abstractor must obtain a permit from the water authorities. Payments and charges

for surface water extraction, including the payment mechanism, are determined by law. Any entity discharging
wastewater into surface water or groundwater must obtain a permit from the water authorities. Compliance with
permit conditions is monitored by the river basin manager or the water authority that issued the relevant permit under
the supervision of the Slovak Environmental Inspectorate. These institutions are entitled to impose sanctions in case
of noncompliance.

service providers are regulated and controlled by three national-level actors with a clear line ministry:

    management. It is specifically in charge of water resources management, river basin management, flood
    protection, water quality and quantity preservation, and water supply and sanitation.
X   The Ministry of Health (through the Public Health Authority), which, in cooperation with MoE, is responsible for
    drinking water quality control.

Capacity and training. Water and wastewater utilities implement continuous staff training programs. Utilities organize
staff capacity building as an integral part of human resource management and policies. International groups (Veolia,
Suez) involved in the Slovak water sector also play an important role in developing staff training for all levels of managers
through well-established human resources principles. Some utilities cooperate with universities on studies and pilot
projects. The Association of Water Companies (AVS), created in 2004, provides technical and economic advisory
services to its members, as well as knowledge exchange activities (workshops, conferences, journal). It also organizes
training targeted at water sector professionals. Slovak utilities are generally considered stable employers, and technical
staff turnover is relatively low. Municipal political cycles sometimes influence top-level manager turnover.

Ongoing or planned reforms. The water and sanitation sector is a stable and mature sector for which no major
legislative change is expected. The sector should, however, be indirectly affected by the transposition into
Slovak law of the new EU legislation (the new Procurement Directives) and implementation of the Operational
Program for Environment.

Service coverage. The Slovak Republic enjoys full access to water and sanitation services. According to national
statistics, 87% of the population is connected to public water systems. The rest of the population uses their own
wells. Around 62% of the population is connected to public sewerage systems (MINZP 2014b).

Equity of access to services. All populations have access to water regardless of their social or ethnic status.
Indeed, 100% of the poorest share of the population (living on less than $2.50/day) has access to a piped water
supply. However, only 66% has access access to flush toilets (Figure 3). In some regions of the Slovak Republic,
segregated Roma communities have access to public water and sanitation facilities.

Service infrastructure. Technical and operational conditions of assets are considered satisfactory with regard
to the reliability and quality of service provided by utilities. There are 255 WWTPs for municipalities over 2,000
population equivalent (PE), and 241 of these facilities comply with EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive
requirements (MINZP 2014a). All 95 large water supply zones (above 5,000 inhabitants or more than 1,000m3/day)
and the associated water treatment plants meet the EU Drinking Water Directive. The reliability of water pipelines
is high in terms of continuity of supplies. However, long-term efforts should generally be put into renewal of
infrastructure to achieve sustainability of services together with full cost recovery.

Quality of service. The quality of water and wastewater services in the Slovak Republic is generally very high.
Water supply is continuous 24/7, with necessary water pressure, and collection of sewage is also continuous (IBNet
2015). Drinking-water quality is fully in compliance with national and European standards, and only 0.65% of samples
exceeded maximal limit values (MINZP 2014b). No EU derogation has been granted. The quality of wastewater
discharged is monitored and independently measured by authorities, and penalties are levied whenever effluent limits
are not met. In some cases when operation management contracts have been concluded, a set of performance
indicators, including quality monitoring, have to be reported on by the operator. However, customers are not publicly
informed about those indicators, nor are they displayed on the utility website.

Customer satisfaction. The satisfaction of the population with the service provided in their city (as per a Gallup
Poll) is correspondingly high at 82% (Gallup 2013). This number is significantly higher than in most countries of the
region. Customer satisfaction surveys are not carried out at the national level, but regional and large municipal water
companies do use customer satisfaction surveys and publish the results on their websites. Websites viewed for this
note showed overall customer satisfaction and a proactive customer approach.

 Overall efficiency. Overall efficiency of Slovak utilities is relatively high, but some remaining issues need to be
 addressed. The volume of nonrevenue water is still high (32%) compared to the situation in Central Europe (MINZP 2013).
 This can be explained by an improvement in the accuracy of measurement and/or by a significant number of illegal
 connections. Utilities tend to reach higher levels of commercial and financial performance compared to technical and
 operational performance, since the latter are directly linked to the infrastructure state. It also seems that indicators related
 to status of infrastructure are a bit worse than the usual commercial and financial performance indicators of utilities. Staff
 productivity per 1,000 connections (7.7) is above international best practice (IBNet 2015).

 Recent trends. IBNet has shown both positive and negative efficiency trends in recent years. The collection ratio shows
 a steady increase during 2005-2012, rising to 116% in 2012. Slovak utilities faced negative factors that pushed them to
 be more efficient. For instance, average water consumption dropped over the last 10 years from 115 l/capita/day to 81
 l/capita/day at the national level, with lowest consumptions reaching 70 l/cap/day (MINZP 2013). This consumption
 decrease is mainly due to a tariff increase within a context of full metering (Figure 4).

Investments. The infrastructure investment rate is relatively high. Around €42 per person has been invested every
year (Author’ elaboration). The main objective of the investments is to meet European/Slovak standards mainly for
wastewater collection systems and wastewater treatment plants (about 58% from total investment value) (Authors’
elaboration). Tariffs are the basic funding source for investments, supplemented by the EU Cohesion Fund and
international loans. Subsidies from the Slovak Environmental Fund are minor compared to EU funds. Infrastructure
owners co-finance projects using traditional commercial loans, but only in justified cases in order to optimize available
means and investment priorities. The rate of investment over previous years has remained relatively stable, except in
2010, when EU subsidies dipped to one-quarter of the 2009 level (Figure 7).

Cost recovery. According to regulations in force in the water sector, all operational expenditure shall be covered
by tariff revenues, and no national or subnational transfers are recorded. The Slovak Republic is making efforts to
move toward full cost recovery for water supply and sanitation, as required by Article 9 of the WFD. Since 2008, all
water consumers pay a unique water tariff, and there are no longer cross-subsidies between domestic and industrial
consumers.

Tariffs. The average residential tariff is €2.29/m3, which is among the highest in the region. Tariffs are increased by
decision of the Regulatory Office based on proposals submitted by utilities. Between 2004 and 2012, tariffs increased
by 168% (average yearly inflation of 3%), and the national average residential tariff is €2.29/m3, including the VAT
(Figure 8). Regional differences exist, and dispersion of tariffs are statistically as high as €1/m3. The VAT rate of 20%,
which is applied for water and sanitation services, is among the highest in Europe. Tariffs are still expected to increase
in the coming years, since efforts will have to be made to fulfil Slovak commitments toward EU requirements, and to
ensure water and sanitation facilities renewal.

Affordability. The potential affordability of water services remained within an acceptable range of 2.3% of family
income in 2012. Moreover, households in the bottom 40% potentially spend more than 3.5% of their income on water
and sanitation expenditure (Authors’ elaboration). The economic regulatory framework in force in the water sector
does not define any formal subsidy scheme to address affordability issues.

Water Sector Sustainability
and Main Challenges
In order to evaluate and reflect the sustainability of services in the region, an overall sector sustainability assessment
was done, taking into account four main dimensions: access to services, quality of services, efficiency of services, and
financing of services. Each of these dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators. For each
indicator, best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the region, and countries closest to
those best performers are deemed to have a more mature sector. A more complete description of the methodology to
assess sector sustainability is included in the Annex of the State of the Sector Regional Report from the Danube Water
Program. The outcomes of this assessment for the Slovak Republic water sector are displayed in Figure 9, which also

shows average and best practices in the Danube region. The country sector sustainability score is 82, which is far above
the Danube average sustainability score of 64, and among the best practices in the region. The assessment shows
that, on average, the country performs well in terms of continuity of service, access to piped water and flush toilets,
wastewater compliance, staffing level, nonrevenue water, and collection ratio. The main deficiencies of the Slovak water
sector identified through the sector sustainability assessment are the level of investment, the operating cost ratio and
the wastewater treatment coverage. The main sector challenges are:

X   Ensuring the affordability of water tariffs in the future. Tariffs are expected to increase in the coming years,
    since efforts will have to be made to fulfil Slovak commitments toward EU requirements, and to ensure water and
    sanitation facilities renewal. The investments planned until 2022 amount to €290 million per year. With water and
    sanitation expenditure representing more than 3% of the average income of the bottom 40% of the population, the
    affordability of water tariffs will have to be carefully monitored in the future.

X   Improving the availability of structured, reliable and comprehensive data about the sector’s situation. In the
    absence of regulator-sanctioned data collection, there are presently no structured and comprehensive information
    giving a clear picture of the sector. As a result, utility managers cannot assess whether their operation is at
    par with good practices. Without reliable sector financing information, policy makers lack a key instrument to
    promote sustainable services, and sector planners, in the absence of consistent data about access to services,
    cannot ensure that limited public funds go to the most cost-efficient and cost-beneficial projects. Addressing this
    challenge would help the sector move ahead.

X   Improving the cost recovery level of services. Tariffs cover operation and maintenance costs but not capital
    expenditure. Within a context of important investment needs, improving the cost recovery level may be required
    since EU Cohesion Funds and national subsidies may not cover all capital funding needs through 2022.
