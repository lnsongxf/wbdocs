THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

       To register a Pty Ltd company, the applicant must complete and submit
       an ASIC Form 201 (""Application for Registration as an Australian
       Company"") and pay the prescribed fee of AUD 457.

       Any person to be appointed as a director or secretary of the company
       must have consented in writing to that appointment. Similarly, each
       shareholder of the company must have consented to become a
       shareholder.
       At least 1 director (and, if the company has appointed secretaries, at
       least 1 secretary) must ordinarily reside in Australia. The registered
       office of the company must be an address in Australia.                       1 day            AUD 457

       The company may adopt its own constitution or rely upon the
       Replaceable Rules in the Corporations Act 2001.

       Prior to lodging the application for registration, the applicant should
       confirm the availability of the proposed company name. If no name is
       specified, the company will simply be referred to by its Australian
       Company Number (""ACN"").

       Upon incorporation, ASIC will issue to the company a certificate of

      Register for ABN with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)

      This procedure is required under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
      and a new tax system (Goods and Services Tax) act of 1999.

      Depending on the company circumstances and location, it must comply
      with different taxation requirements:

      - If the annual company turnover is AUD$75,000 or more, the company
      must register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) by obtaining an 11-digit
      Australian Business Number (ABN). The annual company turnover
      represents its gross business income (not its profit). Companies with
      lower annual turnover may also choose to register for the Goods and
      Services Tax.

      - The application to ABN can be submitted electronically at the Business
      Entry Point, www.abr.business.gov.au. Otherwise, the application may
      be submitted by hard copy to the ATO. If the electronic submission is
      successful, the applicant will be provided with an ABN at the end of the
      Internet session. The ATO will also mail the ABN within 28 days of
      receipt of the application.
                                                                                   Less than one day

      -The company must deduct tax from employee pay, provide payment              (online procedure)
      summaries, contribute to employee superannuation and report and
      issue payments to the ATO. Companies may also register for Pay As
      You Go (PAYG) at www.abr.gov.au. Otherwise, they may register with
      the ATO by postal mail or phone or through a tax agent. State and
      territory taxes (e.g., stamp duty, payroll tax, and land tax) may also be
      imposed, with requirements differing according to company location.

      - Companies with annual turnover of AUD$75,000 or more must
      register for an ABN. Failure to do so will result in GST being levied on
      all company sales since the required date of registration even if the sale
      price of any goods or services has not been grossed up to include the
      tax. Furthermore, the company may incur penalties and interest charges
      for any overdue payments.

      - Further information in connection with ABN, GST and PAYG
      registration may be found on the ATO website (www.ato.gov.au).

        Verify if a development application is required

        It is the responsibility of the applicant to contact a planner at the
        nearest Council Location before preparing a Development Application
        (DA), to check:
        * whether the proposed development is permissible;
        * whether a DA is required; and
        * how the City's planning instruments - plans, codes and policies -
        affect the proposed development.

        BuildCo should ensure that the relevant planning controls have been
        identified and satisfied.

        There are a range of planning instruments that apply to various types
        of development and locations within Sydney.

        Most environmental and planning law in Australia varies from one
   1    Australian state to another. In Sydney, in the state of New South Wales,      1 day           no charge
        development will generally be assessed under one of the regimes in the
        Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (Planning Act).

        The warehouse to be constructed by BuildCo is most likely to fall under
        Part 4 of the Planning Act and will most likely require development
        consent from the relevant local council. The Planning Act provides that,
        for certain types of development, the concurrence of an authority other
        than the consent authority must be obtained. The conditions for
        approval of development assessed under Part 4 may also require the
        developer to obtain further certificates or approvals. These will add cost
        and time.

        The council's local environment plan (LEP) usually identifies whether
        development consent is required. The LEP categorizes development as
        requiring consent, not requiring consent, or prohibited. In most cases,
        the zoning of the site determines the types of development permitted
        on the land. Note that the construction of a warehouse is a type of

      development that almost always requires consent. If the development
      requires development consent, the local council will usually be the
      consent authority. However, in some cases, another authority (such as a
      State minister) may be the consent authority.

      File development application with consent authority

      It is a legal requirement to submit digital copies of plans and
      supporting documentation.

      A minimum of six sets of drawings of the proposed development, plus
      one A4 set and a digital copy, should be submitted. These must include:
      • A site plan showing the location of the development within a building
      or within the locality. The site plan should also identify the site, streets,
      and adjoining properties, and include a north point.
      • Floor plans of the proposed buildings showing the layout,
      partitioning, room sizes and intended uses of each part of the building.
      Existing floor plans would also be useful.
      • Elevations and sections showing proposed external finishes and
      heights (not required where there is no new work proposed).
      • Drawings must be to scale, normally at 1:100.
      • Drawings are to be suitably numbered and dated.
      • Sign applications require plan and elevation details of the location,
      size and width of the sign, height above ground, materials, coloring,
      text including size of lettering, graphics and logo, and illumination.
      Council’s Signage and Advertising Structures DCP 2005 contains details
      of the requirements for the design and location of signs.
      • Drawings are to be folded to A4 size with the title block to the front.       60 days      AUD 6,905

      • Digital copies of plans and supporting documentation must be
      submitted with every application in Portable Document Format (PDF)
      files no more than 1 MB size.

      The consent authority reviews the environmental impact assessment for
      this proposed work and considers the following:
      • Relevant planning controls
      • Likely environmental impacts
      • Suitability of the site for development
      • Submissions received
      • Other prescribed matters
      • The public interest

      If the assessment is satisfactory, the consent authority will grant
      BuildCo development consent, which may be subject to conditions. The
      Development Application will be advertised for approximately 21 days
      to give the surrounding neighbors the opportunity to contest the
      planned development in that area. Once the advertising period is over,
      it will typically take 6 weeks for the development certificate to be
      issued.

      The fee for a Development Application is governed under the
      Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000.
Doing Business 2015                      Australia                                                                 28

      For a development with a cost over AUD 1,000,000 the Development
      Application fee will be calculated as follows:
      - Base fee = AUD 1,975
      -PlanFirst fee = AUD 640
      - Additional AUD 1.44 per AUD 1000.00 (or part thereof) by which the
      estimated cost exceeds AUD 1,000,000.00
      - Advertising fee = AUD 1,105

      Agency: Local Council



      Apply for a construction certificate

      After a Development Consent has been issued by the Local Council and
      before any building work is carried out, the owner must apply for a
      Construction Certificate. This certificate shows that the proposed
      development satisfies the Environmental Planning and Assessment
      Regulation 2000.

      This includes:
      • The construction plans and specifications must comply with the
      relevant standards (ie Building Code of Australia).
      • The construction plans and specifications are consistent with the
      development consent; and
      • All conditions of the development consent requiring compliance prior
      to the issuance of a construction certificate are finalized (i.e., payment
      of the long service levy has been made, the fire protection and
      structural capacity of the development is adequate, etc.).

      The Principal Certifying Authority (PCA) can be a Council or a private
      accredited building surveyor. If BuildCo chooses the Council as the PCA,
      an appointment form must be completed after the Construction
      Certificate is obtained. BuildCo must confirm with the PCA what work           21 days      AUD 5,802

      will be done, the fee, and any other requirements.

      When the City of Sydney is the PCA, the developer submits a Notice of
      Commencement of Work 2 days before work begins (Under Sections 81
      A(2)(b)(i),(c), or (4)(b)(i),(c), 86(1)and (2) and 109E of the Environmental
      Planning and Assessment Act 1979).

      The PCA will also provide a list of mandatory inspections that need to
      be carried.

      Some councils may charge a standard fee for appointment as the PCA.
      Otherwise, the fee for obtaining a construction certificate for a
      development such as a new warehouse will vary by council, for
      example:

      For a warehouse with a construction cost above AUD 1,000,000.00, the
      Sydney City Council will charge:

      Fee = AUD 3,219 (including 10% of GST)
      Additional charge = AUD 1.43 for every AUD 1,000.00 for cost over
      AUD 1,000,000.00

      Additionally, some councils, such as the Hills Shire Council, offer
      combined fees for a development application and construction
      certificate, which can help streamline the process and potentially
      reduce time and cost.

      Agency: Sydney City Council



      Apply for approval of building/development plans by Sydney
      Water Quick Check Agent

      Before any construction work can be done, BuildCo must have the
      approved construction certificate plans assessed and stamped by a
      Sydney Water Quick Check Agent to verify that the proposed building
      work will not affect a Sydney Water asset (water supply pipe and/or
      drainage pipe).

      A copy of the stamped plans must be provided to the principal
      certifying authority before work commences.

      The documents that must be provided are:                                     1 day         AUD 17

      and the relationship of the proposed building works to the full site (the
      location on the lot where the building works will take place must be
      clearly identified)

      the PCA) that will be required during construction of the building. The
      builder needs to be aware of these inspections as they need to be
      carried out at the appropriate time. It is the responsibility of the builder
      to contact the PCA at least 48 hours before an inspection is required.

      Inspections during construction ensure that the construction is
      consistent with what has been approved in the development consent
      and construction certificate, and that the building will meet acceptable
      standards of health, safety and amenity.

      Mandatory critical stage inspections are set according to the building
      class. For the case study of Doing Business, the warehouse is a class 7
      building.

      In the case of a class 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 building, the building work on the
      development site must be inspected:
      • At the commencement of building work
      • Prior to covering any storm water drainage connections
      • After the building work has been completed and prior to any
      occupation certificate can be issued in relation to the building

      The cost of inspection when Sydney City Council is the PCA is AUD
      309.00 per inspection including 10% GST. However, Doing Business
      does not include GST in its calculation.

      Request and receive connection to water and sewage services

      To receive a connection to water and sewage services, BuildCo must
      first select a water-servicing coordinator. The coordinator requests a
      Section 73 Compliance Certificate (for water and sewerage
      infrastructure) from Sydney Water on BuildCo’s behalf. Sydney Water
      issues a notice of requirements to the coordinator within 10 days of
8     application receipt (or longer if the development is complex). The             10 days      AUD 1,347
      notice specifies charges to be paid and the project to be built. If
      construction is required, certification will depend on the time required
      for the project to be built and taken over by Sydney Water. BuildCo
      pays the fees, builds the project, and receives the certificate.

      Request the occupation certificate

      The authority that has approved the development may monitor the
      finished development to ensure compliance with laws and local
      planning policies. If the development does not comply with the
      development consent, the applicant can be fined (with a penalty
      notice), ordered to make changes to the development, or taken to the
      Land and Environment Court of New South Wales. The court may issue
      orders to remedy or restrain breaches of the development consent (e.g.
      orders to carry out works, cease certain uses of the premises, or remove
      the development). In addition, breaches of planning laws may be
      criminal offences.

      New South Wales planning legislation allows any person to bring an
      action to remedy or restrain a breach of development consent. Thus, in
      theory, any person may commence proceedings to enforce compliance
      with the law (a) if a relevant approval (such as a development consent
      or construction certificate) has not been obtained where required; or
      (b) if there has been non-compliance with the conditions of a relevant

      Receive final inspection by PCA and obtain the Final Occupation
      Certificate (OC)

      An occupation certificate is issued by the appointed Principal Certifying
      Authority (PCA) under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act
      1979 allowing a building to be used and occupied.

      This certificate verifies that the PCA is satisfied that the building is
      suitable to be occupied and used according to the requirements of the
      Building Code of Australia (BCA). That Code sets required standards for
      the design and construction of various classes of building to protect
      health, safety and amenity.

        Number, the utility will notify customer that a Site Establishment fee
        applies (in our case, a site establishment fee will apply, because it is a
        new installation and will require a National Metering Identifier (NMI)).
        The utility also augments its network as the connection is 150 meters
        (this time estimate for augmenting network ranges from 30 to 50 days).

local courts. Following the step-by-step evolution of       Time for trial and obtaining judgment
a standardized case study, it collects data relating to
                                                            Time to enforce the judgment

a commercial lawsuit. The ranking on the ease of          Cost required to complete procedures (% of
enforcing contracts is the simple average of the          claim)

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a
sales contract between 2 domestic businesses. The           Enforcement costs
case study assumes that the court hears an expert on
the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to
