EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
     The Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) provides its members with
     overviews of the potential solutions to recover and monetize the flared and/or associated
     gas. This study analyses two options that could be used for this monetization of small
     volumes (1 -15 MMscf/d): the LNG and CNG chain concepts.
     Technologies are available for both concepts, with different maturity level from the
     gained experiences and for different transportation conditions (quantities, distances). The
     available technologies allow a choice of implementation options to suit the volume of gas
     to be transported and the distance from field to consumer.
     The cost of the chain depends upon the parameters governing the gas recovery, its
     transportation and its delivery. Among these parameters the most important are the gas
     volume and the transportation distance.
     As examples, two gas volumes (3 & 10 MMscf/d) and two ranges of distance to
     markets/consumers, have been evaluated for a projects with 15 year durations:

It should be noted that CNG is considered to be less suitable for larger gas volumes and
longer distances due to the large CNG transport requirements (ships, barges or trucks)
resulting from its lower volumetric efficiency; even with the best CNG container option,
CNG requires at least twice the LNG chain transportation fleet for the same gas volume.
The large scale of the CNG loading facilities also required for large gas volumes
reinforces this conclusion.
From the comparison:
             1. Gas treatment is similar for both options, although CNG may need slightly less
                treatment when the gas is relatively clean
             2. LNG liquefaction is more complex than CNG compression, and requires more
                capital investment
             3. CNG is perceived as being of a higher safety risk, due to the high operating
                pressure, in the range of 150 – 250 barg
             4. The volumetric efficiency (reduction of the gas volume relative to atmospheric
                conditions) is 150 to 300:1 for CNG, compared to LNG at approximately 600:1
             5. The higher capital costs of an LNG chain give CNG a cost advantage for smaller
                volumes and shorter distances. At higher volumes and longer distances, higher
                CNG chain operating costs reverse this advantage.
             6. As noted above, CNG is considered to be less suitable for larger gas volumes and
                longer distances due to the large CNG transportation requirement (ships, barges
                or trucks). The large scale of the CNG loading facilities also required for large
                gas volumes reinforces this conclusion.
             7. It is recommended that CNG should be limited to 5 MMscf/d and to 800 km in
                the case of road transportation for cost and operational complexity reasons,
                whilst CNG marine transportation is typically for large volumes and should be
                limited to less than 2,000 Nautical Miles




                                                               5
Experience in USA, China and Pakistan shows that the gas transportation solutions have
been more developed when there is a gap in the traditional gas infrastructure (pipeline).
The solutions are more oriented to LNG chains for higher quantities and longer distances
whilst they are more developed for CNG as fuel for vehicles. It is also apparent that
attractive gas prices are often the result of strategic public policies, with laws promoting
reduction in emissions or incentives via differential taxation.
Finally the implementation of the solutions to recover and monetize the flared and/or
associated gas needs to gather the conditions that make the project viable:
     The market demands
     The gas price attractiveness
     The existence of transportation infrastructure (road, river, etc.) to ensure a safe and
      reliable gas delivery.

      The market currently offers some attractive niche opportunities:
     The gas to power, for electricity generation up to 50 MW
     CNG as fuel for vehicles
     LNG as fuel for large vehicles (trucks, locomotives, buses, etc.)
     LNG bunkering for ships, barges, ferries, etc.

The technologies and demand are there. The opportunities must be created.

1.             INTRODUCTION
               The purpose of this report is to compare the LNG and CNG chain concepts that could be
               used to monetise small volumes (1-15MMscf/d) of associated gas and avoid or reduce the
               current gas flaring.
               Both LNG and CNG concepts have been developed for over 50 years in similar though
               not exactly the same ways, and have gained some maturity as a result of the gas market
               expansion.
               The CNG and LNG reports1 analysed the available technologies and the development of
               the respective chains in specific countries for a better understanding of the mechanism of
               their evolution and for possible application in other emerging countries.
               This report will compare both CNG and LNG chain concepts for small volumes
               monetisation and will identify the drivers that could increase their implementation to
               reduce gas flaring and its consequential emissions.

3.     BACKGROUND
        The Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) is a public-private partnership,
        hosted by the World Bank, which brings together a wide range of countries and companies
        to work together to reduce gas flaring and utilize gas, currently flared, in economically
        beneficial ways.
        The GGFR Partnership was initiated in 2002 and has been active since in providing advice
        and guidance to GGFR Partners on a wide variety of flaring related issues including
        regulation, measurement, reporting, and utilisation technologies.
        The GGFR intends to provide its partners with an overview of these potential solutions
        to monetise the associated gas in order to decrease the global associated gas flaring.




4.     LNG/CNG COMPARISON

4.1.    General
        The comparison will address the respective chain concepts, the available technologies
        and their potential for development.



                                         10
       This comparison is based upon the reports that have been produced as part of this flared
       gas recovery and monetisation study, respectively:
         Mini/Micro LNG report referenced WB_GGFR_4NT_0349855_000_00
        CNG report referenced WB_GGFR_4NT_0353148_000_00
       The recovery of flared gas (or associated gas) can be based on both LNG and CNG chains
       and technologies.
       The chains are similar, even if using different technologies, and are composed of the same
       functions:
         Associated gas treatment
        Gas processing (liquefaction or compression)
        LNG or CNG loading for transportation
        LNG or CNG transportation
        LNG or CNG unloading
        LNG or CNG utilisation / distribution
       However the chains have their own specific requirements and the suppliers have
       developed the necessary technologies to undertake the above functions.



4.2.   Chain operation
       In the chain development, the operational approaches are different for each option.
       Whilst the LNG chain is based on high volume gas storage at either end with the use of
       large volume shuttle-type transportation in between, the CNG chain is considered as more
       of a continuous flow without intermediate high volume buffer gas storage.
       Typically in the LNG chain, the LNG shuttles are loading and unloading their cargo at a
       high rate to reduce the ship demurrage costs. These (un)loading rates are significantly
       different from the LNG production or consumption rates. Therefore LNG buffer tanks are
       installed at both ends of the chain to absorb these flow differences.
       The CNG industry is currently working on the basis of loading and unloading of the
       marine or land transportation container at respectively the CNG source and the gas
       consumers without buffer storage.
       These different approaches have a direct impact on the operating costs, mainly for the
       transportation and the required transport fleet mobilisation (number of respective trucks).
       With the growth of mini and micro chains, it is possible that these approaches could be
       revisited in both options to optimise the investment and operating costs.

5.       TECHNICAL COMPARISON OF THE LNG/CNG
         CHAINS

5.1.      General
          The following section will review the technical components and their characteristics. The
          technical comparison will address the available technologies for the required functions as
          listed in section 4 and will include a specific overview of the safety aspects.



5.2.      Feed gas treatment

5.2.1.    General
          The gas processing in both options required prior gas treatment.
          Generally the pressure in an oil reservoir decreases over time as the oil is produced. The
          crude oil production rate is typically kept constant during a given duration (plateau) and
          then gradually decreases as the reservoir pressure declines. On the surface the wellhead
          pressure also decreases, leading to the requirement to reduce the oil/gas pressure
          accordingly. As a consequence the associated gas will be produced at a flow rate, pressure
          and quality varying with time over the life of the oil reservoir.
          As reservoirs are mostly made of water saturated rocks, the hydrocarbons produced from
          a well are generally water saturated. Gas produced from oil reservoirs can also contain
          impurities such as CO2, H2S, Mercury, Nitrogen and its nature is such that heavy
          hydrocarbon components are typically at higher concentrations than in gas reservoirs. The
          composition of the gas will vary over time, as with the other parameters. The gas
          treatment capacity should therefore be flexible to re-adjust its performance to match the
          actual gas composition and impurities.
          Typical compositions of associated gas are given as an example in Table 1 while each
          field and sometimes even each well has its own production characteristics.

5.2.2.   LNG
         The gas treatment facilities must be designed to match the requirements of the
         liquefaction process and of the end users.




                                   Figure 1: Gas treatment block flow diagram



         The gas pre-treatment will depend on the feed gas composition and on the requirements
         of the liquefaction process, but basically it consists of:
          Acid gas removal unit: to remove acid gases (CO2 and H2S) to prevent freezing out,
           blockage and corrosion in the downstream liquefaction unit.
          Dehydration: to remove water to prevent ice and hydrate formation in the liquefaction
           unit.

                                           13
          Mercury removal: to reduce the mercury level in the feed gas to prevent corrosion in
           the (aluminium) heat exchanger.
          NGL (condensate) extraction: to remove heavy hydrocarbons to prevent freezing in
           the cryogenic sections and/or to meet the required LNG specification (i.e. GHV or
           Wobbe Index).
         Typically the feed gas composition after treatment should comply with following
           requirements (impurities are by weight):

            Water - less that 0.1 ppm.
            Sulphur - less than 3 ppm (this could be H2S or mercaptans).
            Benzene – less than 4 – 6 ppm (depending on ethane content in LNG)
            Toluene – less than 50 – 100 ppm
            Carbon Dioxide – less than 60 – 100 ppm
            Mercury – less than 0.1 ng/Nm3



5.2.3.   CNG
         In the case of CNG, specific treatment criteria are not very well defined by technology
         providers as they are more focused on CNG transportation options than the gas processing
         (the compression).
         The gas conditioning that typically is required for CNG includes:
          Removal of heavy hydrocarbons to avoid condensation
          Removal of contaminants
          Dehydration



5.2.4.   Gas treatment conclusion
         The gas conditioning is mainly required to ensure that the quality of the associated gas is
         aligned to the end user gas specification rather than to suit the actual processing system.
         The gas conditioning for CNG is therefore similar to that required for liquefaction, though
         it actually requires slightly less treatment.



5.3.     Gas processing

5.3.1.   LNG
         In the LNG chain, the gas processing consists in liquefaction and then storage at cryogenic
         temperatures.




                                           14
               The liquefaction process is a mature technology. The mini-liquefaction is a relatively
               recent development, but is supported by 50 years of experience in LNG export terminals
               or peakshaving2 facilities.
               The LNG composition will be determined by the consumers' requirements with regard to
               gas composition or GHV.
               There are several processes available to liquefy natural gas, developed by different
               companies under licences. The most commonly used mini and micro liquefaction
               processes are based upon one of the following technologies:
               The following figures illustrate the main small-scale liquefaction technology types; the
               figures are from Black & Veach, but the basic processes are similar for other technology
               providers.

gas demand is low, natural gas is liquefied and stored. The stored LNG may then be vaporised for short periods, when gas
demand is high.

         local conditions and cost.


5.3.2.   CNG
         CNG transportation aims to maximize the ratio of the weight of the transported gas to the
         weight of the containment hence, ideally, transport is under high pressures and low
         temperature conditions.
         The carriage pressure usually ranges between 100 and 250 barg giving a volumetric
         efficiency (reduction of the gas volume at atmospheric conditions) of 150 to 300:1
         (compared to LNG at approximately 600:1).
         For both onshore and offshore fields, the amount of gas that can be loaded, the equipment
         needed and the operating procedures depend on:
          the gas composition,
          the pressure and temperature conditions at the field,
          the production rate of associated gas and thus the filling rate of the marine or land
           transport container,
                                             17
  the type of CNG container,
 the gas storage conditions (pressure and temperature).
At the point of delivery, the equipment needed and operating procedures depend on:
   the pressure and temperature conditions for CNG offloading,
 the possible limitation of the offloading rate,
 the required quality specification for the received gas.
In the CNG chain, the gas processing consists in gas compression.




                                   Figure 5: CNG chain



The gas compression is a mature technology and there are no specific requirements. for
the compression of gas to CNG, other than managing the pressure/temperature parameters
For the marine CNG chain however, where volumes are large, compression for loading
multiple containers on the vessels is more complex and requires more careful procedures.
The main CNG concepts for process and marine transportation currently proposed are
from the following suppliers (mainly transportation companies):
   Compressed Energy Technology AS (CETech),
   EnerSea-VOTRANS
   Sea NG Corporation - Coselle
   Trans Canada CNG technologies
   Knutsen
   Transocean
Of these, only EnerSea (VOTRANS) is disclosing a fit for purpose compression/loading
methodology..
EnerSea (VOTRANSTM) has a patented loading and offloading methodology which uses
pressurised ethylene glycol/water solution, with a containment system consisting of
several sets of storage cylinders configured into multiple tanks and tiers (two or more
tanks configured to load and offload together).


                                 18
                   Figure 6: VOTRANS CNG Tank Module (Courtesy EnerSea)



After compression and chilling, the gas flows into the ship’s containment system against
a pressurized ethylene glycol/water solution. Gas loading proceeds progressively from
the first set of cylinder modules to the following one so cascading the glycol/water
solution ahead of it. When all the modules are filled with gas, the glycol solution is stored
in an insulated dedicated tank onboard the ship. The required inventory for ethylene
glycol/water solution is 8-10% of the total containment system capacity.
For unloading, method is reversed, pushing the gas out using the ethylene glycol/water
solution. The VOTRANSTM system has several advantages:
   the gas handling is performed at constant conditions avoiding transient situations that
    require careful gas conditioning and close control during operations. The gas can be
    maintained in a dense phase throughout loading and unloading;
   according to EnerSea, by maintaining a constant gas dense phase the VOTRANSTM
    system can accommodate a wide range of gas composition, including rich and
    associated gas;
   gas offloading rate is easily controlled by the glycol/water pumps that may deliver
    high, constant, rates if required;
   the fluid displacement fluid prevents gas auto-cooling in the cylinders during
    offloading, again allowing high offloading rates;
   liquid pumping is lower cost compared to the scavenging gas compression system
    needed for the blowdown method.

5.4.     Loading and unloading

5.4.1.   LNG
         LNG loading into ships, barges or trucks is performed using proven technology with
         either articulated arms or flexible cryogenic hoses.

5.4.2.   CNG
         CNG loading can use high pressure flexible hoses.
         CNG truck filling is common practice, but has still to be established for large quantities
         transferred to barges or ships.

5.5.     Storage

5.5.1.   LNG
         LNG storage at exporting plants provides a buffer volume to balance the gas production
         and transportation rates. Similarly, storage at the receiving end buffers between
         transportation and consumption rates.
         Up to volumes of 15-20,000 m³, the LNG can be stored in pressurised vessels (bullets).
         The maximum individual bullet capacity is currently limited to 1,000 m³ for road
         transportation purposes.

         For volumes above 15-20,000 m³, the LNG is normally stored in vertical cylindrical/flat
         bottom tanks with internal pressure lower than 0.5 barg.

5.5.2.   CNG
         CNG is directly loaded into ship, barge or trucks and distributed to consumers; at the
         required flow rates.
         CNG transportation aims to maximize the ratio of the weight of the transported gas to the
         weight of the containment, hence ideally at high pressures and low temperatures. CNG is
         stored at high pressure (between 100 and 250 barg) in the ships, barges or trucks, and in
         some transport designs at temperatures down to - 30° C. At this temperature normal (i.e.
         non-cryogenic) materials can still be used while the gas density is significantly higher
         than at ambient temperature.
         Depending on the specific design, CNG containers during transport comprise pipes,
         cylinders, racks of cylinders, cassettes or carousels with individual capacities of a few
         MMscf. The total storage capacity can reach up to around 1,000 MMscf through the
         consolidation of the individual components.

5.6.         Marine transportation

5.6.1.       LNG
             LNG has been transported by sea for over 50 years.
             After a trend of increasing ship sizes – up to 265,000 m3 - over the past couple of decades,
             the new market development is promoting small ships (a few thousands thru 30,000 m³).
             These small ships are using either membrane technology or type C vessels to contain the
             LNG.
             The membrane technology uses sandwich panels, comprising of insulation and a stainless
             steel skin, supported by the ship hull.




                                                           24

         The type C ship uses insulated pressurized vessels to store the LNG.

5.6.2.   CNG
         The key issue is the cargo/container weight ratio. Varying from 0.12 thru 1.5, this ratio
         gives the ability to transport gas quantities in a defined ship size. The higher the ratio, the
         smaller the ship to transport a given gas volume.
                                            25
Theoretically a CNG ship could be sized to fit the gas capacity to be marketed. In practice,
CNG transportation companies are often converting existing ships by adding their storage
containers to provide a low-cost transport option.
The companies currently with concepts for CNG marine transportation are:
   Compressed Energy Technology AS (CETech),
   EnerSea-VOTRANS
   Sea NG Corporation - Coselle
   Trans Canada CNG technologies
   Knutsen
   Transocean

5.7.     River transportation

5.7.1.   LNG
         For river transportation, LNG transportation is by either barge or shallow-draught ship.
         The barges could be either self-propelled or an articulated tug-barge. The main
         technology used will be membrane or type C vessels.

5.7.2.   CNG
         CNG transportation on rivers is also by barge or shallow-draught ship, barges being either
         self-propelled or articulated tug-barges.
         The available technologies are the same as for sea transportation but with a smaller
         number of individual storage containers (refer to section 5.5.2)

5.8.     Truck transportation

5.8.1.   LNG
         LNG transport by truck is a well established method.
         The trucks typically transport up to 40 feet long ISO-containers, corresponding to 20 T
         of LNG. The ISO-containers are pressurised vessels with perlite-vacuum insulation
         allowing LNG storage for up to 3 weeks without gas venting.




                                             29
                                Figure 24: ISO container truck



The number of trucks and (un)loading bays that are required for LNG transportation are
governed to the following parameters:
   The maximum allowed truck weight in the country, and thus the transported LNG
    capacity
   The maximum allowed speed of the truck
   The distance from the source to the consumer
   The loading & unloading conditions (number of loading/unloading bays,
    loading/unloading rates)
   The LNG or gas consumption rate
   The working time on both sides of the chain (number of hours per day and number of
    days per week)

The impact of traffic regulations (maximum driving periods and imposed rest time) is not
included in this analysis as it affects the number of drivers, and thus the operating costs,
rather than truck numbers.

The following table shows the number of LNG trucks required for a given set of transport
parameters.

                      The number of bays that are required to achieve such transportation is related to the
                      number of working hours and days per week. As an example, 1 bay is sufficient in the
                      case of 24 hours per day and 7 days per week whilst 2 bays are required in the case of 8
                      hours per day and 5 days per week.


        5.8.2.        CNG
                      CNG is transported in cylinders assembled on trailers, or in fit-for-purpose containers
                      (e.g. MAT® gas storage modules from Galileo).


                                                                           31
The transport capacity is limited by the truck size and road weight limitations. The
maximum capacity can be up to 500,000 scf at a pressure of between 200 and 250 barg.

In the CNG chain, the number of trucks depends on the transportation technology utilised.
The following table shows the impact of the chosen technology.
The number of trucks and (un)loading bays required are governed by the same parameters
as those for LNG (refer to section 5.8.1)
The following table shows the sensitivity of the number of CNG trucks from a given set
of parameters. For ease of analysis only the 15 MMscf/d (300 tpd) supply will be
considered.

                               The number of trucks becomes important when the distance exceeds 800km. The required
                               truck fleet and the number of loading bays will limit the realistic distance within which
                               CNG could be dispatched.

5.9.      Utilisation of LNG and CNG

5.9.1.    General
          The utilisation of the LNG or CNG will depend upon the consumer requirements. The
          LNG chain delivers either LNG and/or gas to consumers, whilst the CNG chain can
          deliver either CNG or gas to consumers


5.9.2.    LNG utilisation
          The LNG will be either vaporised for use in gaseous form at the required pressure, or
          used as LNG for bunkering or fuelling.
          For bunkering and fuelling stations, the LNG will be transferred either to buffer drums or
          directly to the LNG dispensers.
          In case of consumption in gaseous form, the utilisation process will use a typical LNG
          terminal process.

                                             34
                             Figure 29: Vaporisation block diagram



For LNG conversion to gas there are four main types of vaporizers:
 An Open rack vaporizer (ORV) which uses sea/river water as the heat source is
  composed of panel-shaped heat transfer tubes. LNG flows upward inside the finned
  heat transfer tubes, while water flows down along the outer surface of the tubes.
 A Submerged combustion vaporizer (SCV) is a fired heat source LNG vaporizer using
  low pressure fuel gas coming from the boil-off gas system. The SCV uses a heat
  transfer coil installed in a water bath, with the liquid LNG flowing inside the coil. The
  conventional vaporizer is equipped with submerged gas combustion burners firing into
  the water bath.
 A Shell and Tube vaporizer (STV) or Intermediate Fluid Vaporiser (IFV) uses a liquid
  as the heating medium to vaporise the LNG. The LNG flows through multiple tubes
  and the heating fluid enters in the shell surrounding the tubes. If an open loop system
  is used, sea/river water is used as the heating fluid. If a closed loop system is used, a
  variety of fluids can be used: glycol, water, propane, etc.

5.9.3.          CNG utilisation
                CNG will be either used as fuel for vehicles, or depressurized for industrial or private
                consumption.
                When depressurising, special attention must be given to the gas temperature as it could
                drop by up to 40°C during expansion (refer to section 5.3.2).



5.10.           Safety

5.10.1. General
               The gas industry has always promoted and maintained a high level of safety in order to
               reduce the risk of incidents and to allow better integration with the environment.

               This policy has allowed the gas industry to maintain a good accident record, and to limit
               the impact where accidents have occurred. This low record of accidents is the result of
               compliance with strict rules and procedures by the gas industry, users and regulators.

               The main safety principles adhered to, regardless of plant size and function are:
                 Prevention (using passive protection3 and strict procedures)
                 Monitoring (leak and fire detection among others)
                 Mitigation (active protection)



5.10.2. LNG
                Since its first deployment in the 1960's, the LNG industry has implemented ever stricter
                rules to minimize the incidence of accidents, and reduce the impact severity when
                accidents do occur.

                                                          39
               These rules are defined by standardization committees, the most important of which are
               NFPA (NFPA 59A4) and EN (EN 14735). From design through construction to operation,
               specific conditions and constraints are imposed and strictly applied.
               Since the emergence of the mini and micro LNG chains, mainly being used for fuelling
               and more recently ship bunkering, new rules are being set up that take account of the size
               and the operating conditions of these types of facility. It should be noted that the
               standardization committees are often following and reacting to market developments
               rather than leading the way.


5.10.3. CNG
               Transporting large quantities of gas under high pressure (100 up to 250 barg) raises three
               major safety issues:
                Integrity of the containment system: the stored energy of compressed gas is very high
                 and can reach the equivalent of hundreds of mega joules (MJ). The escaping highly
                 pressurised gas could propel flying fragments over a long distance.
                Integrity of the carrier’s hull: the tremendous weight of the containment system results
                 in the transference of high loads from the CNG containment system to the ship’s
                 structure. The containment system must also be able to sustain loads from the ship in
                 difficult sea conditions, or truck movement in collisions.
                Risk of explosion: The nature of the containment system, which often consists in side-
                 by-side assemblies of cylinders, may create a confined space in the ship’s hold in
                 which a gas leakage (from the cylinders, but more likely from the manifolds) may
                 create an explosive atmosphere. (N.B. DNV’s rules require the hold space to be inerted
                 with nitrogen or with other suitable non-corrosive, non-flammable medium).


               The CNG industry complies with the general rules for the transport etc of gas, with
               specific standards for fuelling stations. The CNG chain is, up to now, not covered by
               specific industrial standards giving some freedom to the designers of the chain, within the
               limits of the chain component requirements.



5.11.          Technical comparison of the elements in LNG &
               CNG chains
               The technical comparison of the elements in LNG and CNG chains is summarised in the
               following table.

5.12.   Suitability for associated gas recovery
        The technologies are available, with different levels of maturity from the experience
        gained to date and for different transportation conditions (quantities, distances), for the
        implementation of both LNG and CNG chains.

                                            41
        The technologies allow a choice of implementation options to suit the volume of
        associated gas to be transported and the distance from field to consumer.
        Gas pre-treatment to condition the gas is a well-known process in the gas industry and is
        not an obstacle to implementation of either LNG or CNG chains.




6.     COSTS

6.1.    General
        For cost comparison, the main parameter is the cost of delivered energy (MMBTU).
        The cost of the delivered energy is the sum of the costs for:
                 The gas purchased from the producer (recovered from the field flared gas)
                 The gas pre-treatment (refer to section 6.2)
                 The gas processing (either liquefaction or compression)
                 The gas transportation (either by ship or on road)
                 The gas delivery to consumers
        These individual costs are all directly impacted by local conditions, regulations and gas
        characteristics.
        As costs are very dependent on specific conditions, only orders of magnitude can be
        provided in the following summary.
        Moreover, the cost analysis comparison is covering high CAPEX and lower OPEX on the
        LNG side, whilst low CAPEX and higher OPEX on the CNG side. Typically these higher
        CAPEX in the LNG chain should be balanced against higher CNG chain operating costs
        (especially transportation), and the higher transported energy density in the case of LNG.
        A full life cycle cost analysis should thus be applied. As the experience and data are too
        limited or, even, not existing in the case of CNG, the comparison is using all-inclusive
        rates estimated in literature and previous studies.



6.2.    Gas treatment costs
        The gas treatment costs for both LNG and CNG pre-processing can be estimated from
        following graph:

6.3.   LNG chain costs
       The order of magnitude unit LNG chain costs per MMBTU are a function of a number of
       parameters, the most important of which is gas volume.

                                                                                              43
                  Gas liquefaction6:                            3.0 - 5.0 USD/MMBTU7
                  LNG transportation8:
                             Marine:                            1.5 - 3.0 USD/MMBTU
                             Road:                              1.0 - 2. USD/MMBTU
                    Gas delivery
                               LNG:                             0.2 USD/MMBTU
                               Gas:                             0.5 - 1.5 USD/MMBTU
                 LNG in liquid form could therefore be delivered to a customer at a cost around
                 5.5USD/MMBTU for 15 MMscf/d, while at around 8 USD/MMBTU for 1MMscf/d.,
                 excluding the gas molecule cost and including gas treatment.
                 The re-gasified gas could be delivered for a cost around 6 USD/MMBTU for 15 MMscf/d
                 whilst around 9.5 USD/MMBTU for 1 MMscf/d, excluding the gas molecule cost and
                 including gas treatment.
                 Generally the unit cost of the liquefaction process, transportation and delivery all increase
                 as the plant size decreases. The above shown cost estimate figures are low cost/larger
                 volumes, high cost/smaller volumes related.



6.4.             CNG chain costs

6.4.1.           CNG transportation costs

6.4.1.1.         GENERAL
                 The main cost element in the CNG chain is transportation.
                 The available cost estimation are covering both gas compression and transportation.

6.4.1.2.         MARINE TRANSPORTATION
                 For marine and river transportation, the CNG chain has not yet been fully developed and
                 there are therefore no reliable cost benchmarks.
                 A number of marine technology suppliers have published some data (Sea NG, Votrans
                 and Knutsen) and this has been used to estimate marine transportation costs.




   6   Gas liquefaction cost includes gas treatment and storage.
   7   Higher is the capacity, lower is the cost per unit
   8   Higher is the quantity of energy, lower is the transportation cost. However the distance will have an opposite impact

Each CNG chain supplier has its own view on the transportation viability and
attractiveness of its CNG technology. These supplier opinions are noted as follows:


                                                                   45
            For CETech, in the range of between 18,000 and 100,000 MMscf on a sea journey of
             between on 300 and 2,000NaMi
            For VOTRANS, in the range of between 54,000 and 255,000 MMscf on a sea journey
             of between 250 and 300 NaMi
            For Sea NG, in the range of between 20,000 and 120,000 MMscf on a sea journey of
             between 250 and 1,500 NaMi
            For Trans Canada-CNG, if less than 200,000 MMscf and on a sea journey of less than
             500 NaMi

6.4.1.3.   LAND TRANSPORTATION
           For onshore CNG chain, for relatively low volumes of gas, it is economically viable to
           utilize high capacity CNG trailers to transport natural gas to areas without pipeline supply.
           CNG transportation by truck pushes its limit when the volumes of associated gas to be
           exported exceed 5 MMscf/d due to the required loading facilities. In simple terms,
           contrary to the comment made about the sizes of CNG ships, the trucks are too small.
           For volumes lower than 5 MMscf/d, the total unit cost per MMBTU would range between
           5.13 to 5.2 USD.
           The CNG transportation costs are illustrated by following figures for the defined distance
           ranges

6.4.2.                CNG price at delivery point
                      The order of magnitude CNG chain costs (capital plus operating) per MMBTU are a
                      function of a number of parameters, the most important of which is gas volume:
                                   Gas processing Is included in the transportation costs
                                   Gas transportation:
                                      UTILISATION
                                      Marine on short distances up to 1,000 km:           2.5 – 5 USD/MMBTU
                                      Marine on longer distances:                         5.5 – 8.5 USD/MMBTU
                                      Road:                                               5.2       USD/MMBTU
                                       Gas delivery:                                                 0.2           USD/MMBTU
                      CNG could therefore be delivered to a customer at a cost around 3 – 11 USD/MMBTU,
                      excluding the gas molecule cost but including the gas treatment.

7.       POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT

7.1.      General
          The gas market is developing and gaining flexibility through its increasing diversification.
          This diversification is illustrated in the following figure 34 for a LNG chain and that could
          be extended to the CNG chain.




                                               Figure 42: NG Chain

          In this example of a potential gas market, CNG can complement the LNG to develop the
          business and bring gas to a wide range of potential consumers. At any point in the gas
          chain, CNG stations could be installed to bring gas to isolated small consumers or to CNG
          fuelling stations.



7.2.      Experience

7.2.1.    USA
          Since the mid-1950s, in the USA the domestic consumption of energy has exceeded
          domestic production. The gap increased over time, reaching a maximum in 2005.
          Since then, new technologies and that emergence of shale gas has allowed a rapid increase
          in gas and oil production, and the USA has become the largest global oil and gas producer.
          Historically, natural gas imports to the USA were mainly through pipelines from Canada
          and Mexico. The LNG was then used to “peak shave” the supply/demands. Sixty eight
          peak-shaving plants were built across the USA to liquefy the excess of imported gas
          during the summer period, and to re-inject the stored gas back into the grid during the
          winter season when demand exceeded the available supplies.



                                             50
         Since the 1970s, the USA has imported LNG via re-gasification plants to supplement the
         pipeline gas imports, but during the last few years indigenous production has exceeded
         demand and the USA is now turning to LNG export (foreseen by 2017).
         The USA initiated the use of LNG as fuel for heavy-duty vehicles. The 1992 Energy
         Policy Act, which sought to increase clean energy use and to improve overall energy
         efficiency, marked the first governmental incentive for traditional fuelled vehicle users to
         switch to alternative fuelled vehicles. Specific liquefaction plants were built in 1994 and
         14 such plants are currently exclusively dedicated to the production of LNG for fueling.
         There are 63 public LNG dispensing stations through USA whilst 38 private stations serve
         only own fleet. As such, LNG vehicles currently in operation are limited in range by the
         distribution/availability of stations. However as the infrastructure continues to quickly
         develop, broader opportunities for the LNG vehicle market will emerge.
         Several projects have come on line since 2006 to promote the LNG use as fuel
         (Prometheus, Bakken, Shell, North Dakota LNG LLC, etc).
         Recently, the USA initiated LNG delivery to islands (Hawaii and Caribbean) by ISO-
         containers (40 feet long, about 20 t of LNG) taking the benefit of Ro-Ro logistic
         experience.
         In parallel since the early 1990s, CNG fueling infrastructure experienced a rapid
         development in the USA. Further to the Energy Policy Act, in 1995, the Natural Gas
         Vehicle (NGV) Industry Strategy, issued by the National Gas Vehicle Coalition, Gas
         Research Institute and American Gas Association, was developed to set a unified vision
         of the market industry and to boost the use of natural gas in transportation.
         As part of the industry approach, local NG distribution companies, which also became
         involved in marketing to secure a bigger share in the marketplace, got closer to the main
         manufacturing associations in order to promote more evolved NGV equipment.
         While CNG has remained cheaper than diesel or gasoline, until recently the gap between
         them was not sufficient to justify the investment of vehicle conversion.
         NGV supply infrastructure expanded until 1997, then reflecting the preference for flex-
         fuelled ethanol vehicles, declined to a low of 721 stations in 2007. Investments then began
         to increase again, at a moderate pace until 2011 (47 new stations per year on average),
         then more aggressively (177 new stations per year on average). This recent expansion
         (2008-2014) is explained by the gas availability from unconventional fields and a severe
         excise duty increase on ethanol in 2011.
         CNG and LNG uses would not have a significant impact in the flaring reduction in USA.
         The Commission estimated only 0.1% of the current flared gas in the field could be
         reduced by these technologies. However, several experiences addressed to diminish
         flaring have been raised.


7.2.2.   China
         This section offers a review of the uses and main drivers of mini/micro LNG liquefaction
         and CNG in China, focusing on those suitable to small volumes (1-15 MMscf/d) of
         associated gas.
         A series of factors sustain the growth of the small gas industry.


                                           51
              First of all, the demand-supply gas balance in China is very tight, while the pipeline grid
              is limited. Since China’s natural gas pipeline infrastructure density is only 30% compared
              to developed countries such as the US, most communities lie outside the reach of
              pipelines, making LNG/CNG storage and trailers necessary to transport gas to those
              regions.
              In eastern and southern China, many industrial and urban users9 still have a limited supply
              of natural gas, especially for peak-shaving purposes during winter. However, gas use in
              those areas is likely to increase, boosted by the expansion of urban gas distribution
              networks, and tightening even more daily and seasonal peaks supply in the coming years.
              Therefore, it is very important to develop LNG storage capacity.
              Secondly, in regions far from the main transmission pipeline, where it is not economically
              viable to build pipeline connections, mini-LNG could be a viable alternative solution for
              gas supply. In addition, natural gas serves as an alternative fuel in the transport sector.
              Finally, from the producer's perspective, LNG is also a solution to unlock the potential of
              stranded gas fields.
              Over these geographical constraints, China´s concerns about environmental issues and
              securing energy requirements in the future have triggered an official policy to pursue a
              rapid rise in natural gas use. The 2010 five-year development plan called to boost to 8%
              the share of natural gas in the total primary energy matrix by 2015 (from 5% in 2011).
              At the end of the 1980s, the first CNG filling stations came online in China, specially
              addressed to serve taxis and light commercial vehicles. But the most populous country in
              the world made a significant deployment of CNG five years ago, when cities, such as
              Beijing, Chengdu and Hong Kong, converted buses and taxis to CNG technology in an
              effort to reduce notorious toxic urban air pollution. Currently, it is estimated that there
              are almost 3 million NGV fuelled vehicles on the road, six times as many as just five
              years ago, when deployment of NGVs took off.
              In meantime the national government has strongly encouraged the deployment of natural
              gas fueling infrastructure, especially for LNG stations. In 2013, there were 3,350 CNG
              stations, and more notably, 1,844 LNG stations. The 12th Five Year Plan (2011-2015)
              includes a target of 5,000 LNG stations.
              The gas deployment is led by the three major Chinese oil and gas state-owned enterprises:
              China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC, which do business as PetroChina and via
              its subsidiary Kunlun Energy), China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec),
              and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Some private energy
              companies, such as ENN Energy Holdings, Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Investment
              Group, and Hanas New Energy Group based in Ningxia and Shandong, are also doing
              business in the area.
              China is also beginning to pay attention to the development of LNG as a vessel fuel,
              which should achieve coastal and inland shipping "green environmental protection”.
              Vessel power changing to LNG would become the development trend.

                                                       52
                Currently, the main experience carried out in China is “changing diesel to LNG” for
                vessel fuel. In 2009, usage of vessel power for the diesel-LNG hybrid technology project
                in Suqian City, Jiangsu Province was officially launched. In 2010, "Su-Su goods 1260"
                freighter in the Northern section of the Grand Canal began real ship trials. Afterwards, a
                hybrid diesel-LNG ship, carrying 3,000 tons of sand, sailed from Suqian City into Huai'an
                City. Currently, some Chinese companies, such as Hubei Xilan, Beijing Youlu, Guilin
                Xin’ao, Xinjiang Guanghui, Fujian Zhongmin, are in the process of changing some
                vessels of their fleet from oil to gas.


7.2.3.          Pakistan
                In the 1990s, Pakistan started promoting the use of CNG as fuel for vehicles as an
                alternative to gasoline. Over the following 20 years, the CNG market increased rapidly
                making Pakistan the second largest country in CNG vehicles fleet in the World, only after
                Iran, with approximately 2.8 million vehicles. According to the Natural and Bio Gas
                Vehicle Association (NGVA), 80% of the Pakistani cars are currently running with CNG.
                The energy crisis the country is suffering includes natural gas shortages (due to gas
                reserves decrease) which are affecting some key sectors of the Pakistani economy such
                as power generation and industry (fertilizers, cement, textile, etc.). Due to this the
                Pakistan government has introduced some restrictions in natural gas consumption.
                Pakistan is currently looking at several alternatives to solve natural gas shortage such as
                to import LNG. There are two LNG projects underway: Floating Regasification and
                Storage Unit (FSRU) at Port Qasim which is due to be commissioned in Q2, 2015 and a
                second FSRU near Karachi which is at the study stage.
                With the arrival of LNG in the country, the Pakistan government expects to reduce the
                petrol consumption by almost two billion litres per annum and recover the industry and
                CNG as fuel which has suffered from natural gas restrictions over the last 4 years.


7.2.4.          Other experiences
                Besides the analyzed experiences, there are other countries which have been developing
                interesting and successful projects with CNG technology. Some of these practices should
                be taken into account in future CNG developments in order to capitalize on the already
                acquired knowledge related to the field. In this regard, a study of Yeh (2007) has
                underlined the following policies10:
                 demand side market creation programs: mandatory conversion of government fleets
                  and urban buses procurement,
                 supply side market creation programs: governmental investments in refueling stations,
                  pipelines and conversion kits,
                 financial incentive programs offered to consumers and equipment suppliers: subsidies
                  and tax breaks to reduce prices of natural gas specifically for transportation, rebates
                  and loans to lower or eliminate consumers’ vehicle conversion costs, exemptions from
                  import duties and the lowering or elimination of import tariffs on machinery,
                  equipment, and kits, and exemption from sales taxes for the construction and operation

7.3.   Lessons from analyzed experiences
       Based on the described experiences in USA, China and Pakistan, several lessons on the
       development of small volumes of gas, either LNG or CNG, can be learned.
       First of all, the technology is available. More mature for high quantity transportation in
       the LNG side and more developed for vehicle fuel on the CNG side.
       Secondly, small scale solutions for gas transportation have been more developed, using
       mainly LNG chain, when the following conditions exist:
        Restrictions in infrastructure:
         - In the USA, peak shaving was used to solve pipeline network restrictions or
             deficient storage capacity.
         - In China, domestic gas demand had a boom which could not be matched by the
             required infrastructure development (gas transportation and transmission). LNG
             virtual chain provided a transitional solution to solve the gap.
        Demand does not reach the minimum volume required to invest in traditional gas
         infrastructure transportation (mainly for isolated areas).

       Thirdly, more competitive natural gas prices in the transportation sector against other
       hydrocarbon fuels. This natural price attractiveness is brought by strategic public policies
       through laws to reduce emissions or through incentives by differential taxation.

       However, several barriers for the development of the gas chain, either LNG or CNG have
       been found, such as: the “coordination problem” for investment decisions (for
       infrastructure development and the consumer market availability), the minimum scale
       (demand / supply) required to assure economic viability and the prices that the demand is
       willing to pay for the new facilities.
       Considering the experiences of the USA and China on ways to economically seize small
       LNG volumes and the main identified drivers, the lessons learned could help to outline
       some recommendations towards the development of this kind of market in less developed
       economies with smaller infrastructure, such as Nigeria, Iraq and Indonesia.




                                         54
               It is important to notice there is a main difference between the USA and China cases that
               could be considered as a basic lesson regarding the implementation in less developed
               countries. In China, small scale LNG developments are mostly supported and carried out
               by State-owned companies as part of a National development policy. On the contrary, in
               the USA, development seems to be linked to decentralized market decisions (although
               peak shaving operations are framed in a regulatory scheme). Each alternative implies
               significant challenges and risks, especially in low and middle income economies.
               However, experiences from China and the USA were directed to supply residential,
               industrial and transport demand. Two characteristics of this technology worth
               highlighting are the “fast-track” implementation and the relatively reduced investment
               (compared to pipelines or large scale facilities), making possible the rapid settlement of
               industries with high positive impact on a country’s economic growth.
               For example, small LNG chains may enable the installation of fertilizer companies,
               boosting the food industry, or the installation / expansion of construction industry, a very
               dynamic sector of the economy of any country. Small scale LNG can replace other fuels,
               like LPG, in industries looking for clean combustion (food industry) or heat control
               (ceramic industry).
               Regarding the transportation sector, the experiences in China and the USA show natural
               gas as a competitive fuel against diesel and gasoline. The LNG, presenting less volume
               than CNG, is recommended in large vehicles, running long distance and, therefore,
               needing longer range. Giving the size of these countries’ economies and the extension of
               their lands and routes, this kind of vehicle is a growing trend.
               In the market-type solution, a first issue to deal with is the coordination problem,
               frequently posed by economists at a theoretical level: the development of an efficient and
               sustainable scale means supply11 and demand12 decisions should be almost simultaneously
               taken. The problem is when no one is willing to make the first move. In China’s case, the
               coordination problem is “solved” by the State, who acts as a “market-maker” enabling
               the existence of demand and/or supply until the industry reaches a sustainable scale.
               Regardless of environmental benefits and even lower operative costs in some cases, the
               differential in cost of capital to be afforded by the introduction of the new technology is
               another arising problem. As in any LNG development - no matter what the scale -,
               investment represents an important share on LNG final price. Every asset is fully
               committed to the project and loses its value if any link of the chain breaks. For example,
               an LNG-fueled truck would lose practically its total resale value, when its purchase cost
               would have been 40% higher. Once more, in China’s case the Government is able to
               finance and assume risks, becoming effective in developing the market - regardless of the
               efficient or inefficient use of public resources -. Considering the Chinese economy and
               its high demand of energy required for growth and development, LNG projects proved to
               be the right bet.
               However, state-based market creation solutions do not always take into account the
               frequently diminished institutional capabilities present in developing countries, usually
               represented in the failure - or at least ineffectiveness - in the development and
               implementation of public policies, in this particular case, energy policies.

              Furthermore, some experiences show that Foreign Direct Investment, usually performed
              by private companies, represents a way of transferring know-how, technology and
              financing for the implementation of a policy that the developing country could hardly
              achieve13. At the same time, some economists have argued that FDI contributes to
              economic growth only when a sufficient absorptive capability of the advanced
              technologies is available in the host economy14.




8.        CONCLUSIONS

8.1.          Findings
              From the comparison it appears that:
                   1. The gas treatment is similar for both options even if CNG actually requires
                      slightly less treatment
                   2. The liquefaction is more complex than the CNG compression and requires more
                      capital investment
                   3. CNG is perceived as being of a higher safety risk, due to the high operating
                      pressure, in the range of 150 – 250 barg
                   4. The volumetric efficiency (reduction of the gas volume at atmospheric
                      conditions) is 150 to 300:1 for CNG, compared to LNG at approximately 600:1
                   5. CNG is considered to be less suitable for larger gas volumes and longer distances
                      due to the large CNG transportation requirement (ships, barges or trucks)
                      resulting from its lower volumetric efficiency; even with the best CNG container
                      option, CNG requires at least twice the LNG chain transportation fleet for the
                      same gas volume. The large scale of the CNG loading facilities also required for
                      large gas volumes reinforces this conclusion. It is recommended that CNG should
                      be limited to 5 MMscf/d and to 800 km in the case of road transportation for cost
                      and operational complexity reasons, whilst CNG marine transportation should be
                      limited to less than 2,000 Na Mi (refer to section 6.4.1)
                   6. The higher investment/capital costs in an LNG chain should be balanced by the
                      higher CNG chain operating costs.
              The estimated costs for delivered gas, excluding the gas molecule cost, are detailed in
              section 6.
              As a summary:

                  (capital plus operating) of around 5.5USD/MMBTU for 15 MMscf/d, while at around
                  8 USD/MMBTU for 1MMscf/d, excluding the gas purchase cost.

           around 6 USD/MMBTU for 15 MMscf/d whilst around 9.5 USD/MMBTU for 1
           MMscf/d, excluding the gas purchase cost.

           2. For the CNG chain
                   CNG could therefore be delivered to a customer at a cost (capital plus
           operating) of around 3 – 11 USD/MMBTU, excluding the gas purchase cost.




8.2.   Conclusions
       The considered gas capacities, from 1 to 15MMscf/d, are suitable for delivery to small
       consumers, for industrial processes or mini power generation (up to 50 MW) or as fuel,
       either as CNG or as LNG.
       The associated gas recovery will mainly depend upon the market demand and the
       attractiveness of the gas price versus other fuels.
       The technology is available, at different levels and for different transportation conditions
       (quantities, distances) for the implementation of the both LNG and CNG chains.
       Both options give opportunities to monetise the associated gas and to bring LNG or gas
       in remote areas or to specific markets.
       The development of the chains will have to combine:
          the availability of the associated gas in marketable conditions
        the gas demands or as a minimum a potential for gas demand (conversion from other
           fuels)
        the attractiveness of the gas price , versus other fuels
       It must be pointed out that Nigeria and Iraq show very important flaring levels (ranked
       second and third, respectively in the world’s flaring ranking list), in absolute as well as
       relative terms related to their natural gas production. Indonesia, on the other hand,
       presents lower volume, but yet perfectly suitable for small-scale LNG projects. This
       feature, in addition to the country’s insular geography, makes Indonesia’s case - and the
       strategy to be defined for it - quite different from the other two countries.
       However, uncertainty arises when trying to assess the existence of a critical mass to make
       LNG a viable fuel for large vehicles in countries such as Nigeria, Iraq and Indonesia. In
       these cases, CNG for vehicles (NGV) would have more chance for success as it is more
       suitable for light and mid-size vehicles, with more easily developed loading stations in
       urban areas.
       Nevertheless, LNG could be part of a transport supply chain if, considering distance from
       gas fields and demand size, the technology results in the most convenient method to
       supply NGV stations.
       Regarding LNG road transportation, conditions of road infrastructure and security must
       be considered, especially in Nigeria and Iraq. Difficult access or temporary floods, for
       example, result in higher supply costs because of stock shortage or redundant storage and
       transport infrastructure.

                                         57
In terms of security, LNG chains - like any other fuel - are vulnerable to piracy and
terrorism, worsened by the fact of being a flammable fuel. But LNG is not a fungible
asset i.e. it can only consumed in proper facilities; therefore it would have practically no
resale value for illegal markets. Nevertheless, the validation of this assumption would
need a deeper study on the subject.
Several projects could be economically viable in power generation, considering the
countries present power supply problems, and in some cases due to fuel supply shortages.
In Indonesia, potential demand seems to be limited to power generation in some of the
islands, especially considering existing plans for generation decentralization policies.
When launching a program for flared gas recovery, the preparation work will be important
to optimize the chain.
More particularly, the preparation should include the following steps:
 identification of the strategic facilities to assess vent and flare gas,
 definition of the flare/vent gas rates and compositions,
 development of a mitigation plan, covering the selection of the optimum chain or
  combination of both options,
 preliminary economic evaluations.
