    Note on this document
    This document summarizes the approach that the GPO will take in its work with countries to help
    improve the health of the oceans and reduce coastal poverty. It is the product of close to two
    years of consultations and feedback from governments, partners and a wide range of interested
    stakeholders around the world, and has been guided by a working group of over 20 partners
    as well as the recommendations of an independent blue ribbon panel of 21 global experts and
    thought leaders.

WHY A GLOBAL
PARTNERSHIP
FOR OCEANS?
Restoring the health of the world’s ocean
is a global challenge that can and must be
solved. Leaders in business, government
and civil society increasingly recognize this,
and are building mechanisms and capacity
for making this happen. Increasingly,
inadequate policies, lack of political will,
and institutional weaknesses are being
overcome through new partnerships,
coalitions and investments that have
a high likelihood of helping reverse the
decline of the ocean. Central to the success
of these innovative strategies are global
partnerships and networks that will enable
the international community to tackle the
problems at scale.

                    e the Participants in the Global Partnership for Oceans, commit to develop and help implement this Partnership, in recognition of
                    humankind’s dependence on healthy oceans to feed the planet’s growing population, support millions of livelihoods, contribute hundreds
                    of billions of dollars annually to the global economy, and to provide essential environmental services, including climate regulation.

 Despite global commitments made to date as well as the efforts of many organizations, governments, enterprises and individuals, the oceans remain
 under severe threat from pollution, unsustainable harvesting of ocean resources, habitat destruction, ocean acidification and climate change.

 Building upon and better coordinating existing efforts and programs, including in support of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,
 our Global Partnership will convene stakeholders to mobilize significant human, financial and institutional resources for effective public and private
 investments in priority ocean areas. These investments will improve capacity and aim to close the gap in implementing global, regional and national
 commitments for healthy and productive oceans.

 The Partnership Will Work toward Meeting the Following Interrelated Objectives by 2022

 Sustainable seafood and livelihoods from capture fisheries and aquaculture
 In line with previous internationally agreed commitments* and taking into consideration growing impacts of climate change:
 •     Significantly increase global food fish production from both sustainable aquaculture and sustainable fisheries by adopting best practices and
       reducing environmental and disease risk to stimulate investment;
 •     Reduce the open access nature of fisheries by creating responsible tenure arrangements, including secure access rights for fishers and incentives for
       them to hold a stake in the health of the fisheries; and
 •     Enable the world’s overfished stocks to be rebuilt and increase the annual net benefits of capture fisheries by at least $20 billion, including through
       reducing subsidies that promote overfishing.

 Critical coastal and ocean habitats and biodiversity
 In line with previous internationally agreed targets and to address the growing impacts of climate change:
 •     Halve the current rate of natural habitat loss and reduce habitat degradation and fragmentation, by applying ecosystem-based approaches to
       management;
 •     Increase marine managed and protected areas, and other effective area-based conservation measures, to include at least 10% of coastal and marine
       areas; and
 •     Conserve and restore natural coastal habitats to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to climate change impacts.

 Pollution reduction
 In line with previous internationally agreed commitments and taking into consideration the growing impacts of climate change:
 •     Reduce pollution to levels not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity; and
 •     Support implementation of the Global Program of Action to reduce pollution, particularly from marine litter, waste water and excess nutrients,
       and further develop consensus for achievable goals to reduce these pollutants.

 The Global Partnership for Oceans is an inclusive partnership of Governments, civil society organizations, private sector companies and
 associations, research institutions, UN agencies, multi-lateral banks and foundations whose membership will grow over time. We will contribute
 resources according to our respective comparative advantages which may include capability for implementation, knowledge, and/or monetary support
 towards investment on behalf of healthier oceans in a number of priority ocean areas.

 A Global Partnership for Oceans Fund will be established and governed by a committee representative of the diversity of the membership and
 stakeholders of the Global Partnership for Oceans, and with an advisory process that will ensure that investment choices are evidence-based. Within
 the next six months, the partners will seek to finalize the governance and working arrangements for the Partnership.
 *Note: The previously agreed international commitments and targets referenced in this Declaration include those made in Rio in 1992 in Agenda 21, and subsequently at Johannesburg in 2002 and in the Aichi Biodi-
 versity Targets in Nagoya in 2010.

Consistent with the FAO Technical Consultation on International Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries (FAO 2013), the term
“tenure right” is used in accordance with the contents of the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and
Forests in the Context of National Food Security, and hence the notion that tenure determines who can use which natural resources, for how long,
and under what conditions. It hence encompasses other commonly used terms, such as “access right,” “use right,” and “management right.”

     Mitigation and Adaptation Efforts, to
     Inform GPO Implementation

     Without a strong linkage between activ-
     ities and global strategies to mitigate and
     adapt to climate change, there is great risk
     that funds invested will be wasted as the phys-
     ical, chemical, and biological nature of the ocean
     changes when climate change and acidification
     overwhelm attempts to restore ocean health. The
     GPO recognizes the importance for incorporating the
     influence of climate change and ocean acidification                                government must take ulti-
