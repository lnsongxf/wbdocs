The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) is grateful to the numerous
representatives of the OECS governments and regional organizations, private sector
and civil society organizations, and development partners who provided valuable
insights into the Bank Group’s program in OECS. IEG would like particularly to
thank the Project Coordination Unit/Bank Group focal point heads and staff in each
of the OECS countries for their assistance and support to the evaluation team’s
country missions. Finally, IEG extends its appreciation and gratitude to the Bank
Group management and country team members, including both previous and
current staff working on the OECS, who provided valuable time, information, and
feedback to the evaluation team.

Overview
Highlights
The six independent members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States
(OECS)—Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia,
and St. Vincent and the Grenadines—face major development challenges and
vulnerabilities. Their small size entails diseconomies of small scale in
infrastructure, institutions, and markets. They are highly vulnerable to natural
disasters, especially hurricanes, and to climate change. Their open but
undiversified economies expose them to shocks. Tourism, now the dominant
activity, faces eroding competitiveness and a loss of market share. A vicious circle
has prevailed of low growth, high debt levels from weak public finances, and
frequent shocks.
During the FY06–14 evaluation period, the World Bank Group engaged with the
OECS on two pillars of development: strengthening resilience and improving
competitiveness. Program design was relevant and had laudable attributes, such
as a good instrument mix in several cases, support for regional solutions with a
strong economic rationale, flexibility to address risk, effective use of partnerships,
and provision to confront capacity constraints. Bank Group program objectives
however, were broad-ranging, involving many sectors and numerous activities.
Greater selectivity would have allowed greater consistency and continuity of Bank
support in priority areas, likely bringing better results.
This evaluation rates the program’s progress toward achieving its objectives
during FY06–14 as moderately satisfactory. Bank Group support helped
strengthen areas such as fiscal and debt management, disaster risk management,
social resilience, and the financial sector in the wake of the 2008–09 global crisis. A
particularly important contribution drew on the Bank’s comparative advantage to
help overcome a market failure through the establishment of a self-supporting,
sustainable insurance mechanism against disaster events, the Caribbean
Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility.
Looking ahead, it will be necessary to ensure selectivity and specificity in the
objectives of new Bank lending, and simplicity and flexibility in its design, with
appropriate provision for the institutional capacity that it requires. The Bank
Group should also continue supporting OECS-wide development solutions, but
only where the economic rationale and support among country stakeholders are
strong. It should also continue consolidating its portfolio of activities, ensuring
complementarity within clusters of lending and nonlending products, and seek to
strengthen and showcase collaboration by the World Bank and the International
Finance Corporation.

1. Introduction and OECS Country Context
This report assesses World Bank Group support to the six independent members of
the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS): Antigua and Barbuda,
Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines.1 This regional program evaluation (RPE) is one of two such reports—
the other covering Pacific Island countries—that make up the cluster country
program evaluation on small states carried out by the Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG). The RPE covers support provided over the period FY06–14,2 during
which two Bank Group strategies--each adjusted by a progress report during
implementation and both OECS-wide-- framed the engagement. In broad terms, the
Bank Group program sought to help strengthen the countries’ economic, physical,
and social resilience and enhance their competitiveness.

The RPE follows the standard IEG methodology. It evaluates the outcome of the
Bank Group program, seeking to answer: “To what extent did Bank Group support
to the countries meet its relevant objectives?” While the outcomes in the strategy
document results frameworks provide a useful reference, the assessment goes
beyond a discussion and tally of whether these outcomes were achieved as a result
of Bank Group support. In addition to a review of documentation, the evaluation
was informed by semi-structured interviews with country and regional officials and
other stakeholders as well as Bank Group staff and managers involved with the
program.

The report contains five chapters. Chapter 1 provides background on the OECS
countries, emphasizing their small-state characteristics and summarizing the
economic and social context as well as key developments during the evaluation
period (appendix A offers more details). Chapter 2 sets out the objectives of Bank
Group support during the period, reviews the support delivered in relation to plans,
and assesses key attributes of the Bank Group strategy and program. Chapters 3 and
4 review specific Bank Group objectives or “results areas,” under two strategic goals:
strengthening resilience and enhancing competitiveness. The chapters review the
relevance of the strategic objectives and results areas given the OECS countries’
context, how the Bank Group endeavored to help meet them, and the results.
Chapter 5 summarizes the key findings. It also rates the Bank Group program as a
whole—the extent to which Bank Group support met its objectives—building on the
ratings for each of the results areas reviewed. Finally, it distills lessons and
recommendations that may help increase the relevance and effectiveness of program

delivery during and beyond the current Bank Group partnership strategy for the
OECS.


OECS Country Context
The OECS countries are characterized by an evolving political and economic union
and political stability, but costly civil services. The OECS was established by the
1981 Treaty of Basseterre, revised in 2011 to establish the OECS Economic Union.
The 10 members comprise four overseas territories and six sovereign states. Eight of
the members, including all six independent countries, share a common currency (the
Eastern Caribbean dollar), a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central
Bank), and constitute the Eastern Caribbean Economic and Currency Union
(Schipke, Cebotari, and Thacker 2013). The Eastern Caribbean (EC) dollar has been
pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of EC$2.70 to US$1 since 1976. The six OECS
countries are stable, parliamentary democracies founded on constitutions that
guarantee fundamental rights and freedoms that are enforceable through the high
court. Public administrations are characterized by well-established organizational
structures, respect for the rule of law, and a high degree of judicial independence.
Existing government systems have resulted in civil services that are large,
bureaucratic, and burdensome to their small economies.

As quintessential small states, the OECS countries face major challenges and
vulnerabilities, and some are eligible for financing from the International
Development Association (IDA). With a total landmass of about 2,364 square
kilometers and a combined population of little more than 600,000, this group of
islands are small in both geographic area and in population. They are similar in
culture, climate, topography, history, and language. Their economies are also similar
in their proximity to the United States (their largest trading partner) and natural
endowments that make them prime tourist destinations.3 The countries share some
structural characteristics. First, owing to their small size, they face diseconomies of
scale, especially in infrastructure, institutions (including government), and markets.
Second, their location makes them vulnerable to climate change phenomena such as
rising sea levels and temperatures as well as to frequent natural disasters, especially
hurricanes (IMF 2014).4 Third, while they enjoy the benefits of open economies, they
are also vulnerable to external events and shocks, including the dismantling in the
early 2000s of traditional agricultural trade preferences and the ongoing impact of
the 2008–09 global financial crisis. Fourth, while they have all achieved at least
middle-income status, many face challenges with youth unemployment, crime, and
public security, as well as weak institutions and economic management that have
contributed to high public debt levels and a difficult business environment. Four

                                                 INTRODUCTION AND OECS COUNTRY CONTEXT
OECS members—Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines—are IDA and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) blend countries; the other two are high-income countries and IBRD-only.

The countries are particularly vulnerable to climate-related shocks, and have
delicate natural environments. The OECS island states lie directly in the path of
Atlantic hurricanes, which in recent years have increased in frequency and intensity.
The countries are also at risk of storm surges, strong winds, heavy rains, drought,
and volcanic eruptions. Existing threats to the region’s ecosystems include
overexploitation of their resource base, loss of natural habitats, changes in water
quality and quantity, and climate change. The catastrophic nature of the subregion’s
natural disasters has typically resulted in the diversion of resources away from other
development priorities to the financing of post-disaster recovery. Between 1993 and
2012, average OECS annual losses from natural disasters were 4.3 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), although individual instances have far exceeded the
average—a staggering fiftyfold in the case of Grenada from Hurricane Ivan in 2004.

Weak and declining growth since the 1990s has been mainly due to negative external
shocks and structural weaknesses in the OECS economies. Real GDP growth in the
OECS region declined from an annual average of about 6 percent during 1980–89 to
3 percent during 1990–99 and to 2 percent during 2000–10. The slowdown that began
in the early 1990s was brought on by a combination of recessions in advanced
economies, structural weaknesses of the OECS economies, and negative external
shocks (IMF 2013). Tourism is now the primary driver of growth and contributes
more than 50 percent of export earnings, at least 30 percent of GDP, and 30 percent
of total employment. Despite its significance to the region, the OECS share of global
tourism, measured by both tourism receipts and number of visitor arrivals, has
declined over the past decade, indicating a loss in external competitiveness.

Public finances have been under strain, especially since the global economic crisis,
and debt levels are high. Expansionary fiscal policy in response to external economic
shocks led to growing fiscal imbalances and an unsustainably large debt burden
(table 1.1). The OECS fiscal deficit, which stood at 6.6 percent of subregional GDP in
2000, had grown to 10.5 percent by 2002. It averaged about 6.5 percent of GDP over
2000–07, subsequently declining to about 3.7 percent during 2008–14 because of
measures to enhance revenue and reduce expenditure. Consequently, public debt
grew from about 70 percent of GDP in 2000, peaking at 95 percent of GDP in 2004. In
2014, it stood at about 87 percent of GDP.

The erosion of competitiveness in OECS economies is a bottleneck to growth. Firms
operating in the region experience cost disadvantages that are both structural and


                                                                                     3

policy-driven. Labor costs are high and have grown faster than productivity,
electricity costs are among the highest in the world, and the cost of credit is very
high, while access is limited. There is also some evidence of over-valuation of the EC
dollar. Despite these disadvantages, the countries rank well on the Doing Business
indicators in comparison with other small islands and Caribbean countries. The
average rankings of OECS countries for getting electricity (but not the cost of its
use), contract enforcement, ease of getting construction permits, and protection of
investors bode well for a growth-supporting institutional framework. However,
payment of taxes, access to credit, labor market rigidities, and property registration
remain weak.

The OECS countries have made good progress on many social indicators, but
poverty and unemployment remain high. The countries rank between 61 and 97
among the 187 states on the United Nations Development Programme’s 2013
Human Development Index. Life expectancy averages 75 years, higher than the
average for middle-income countries. The primary school completion rate is close to
100 percent and both infant and maternal mortality rates are low.

These successes notwithstanding, poverty rates in the OECS range from 18 to 38
percent (using each country’s national poverty line), and threaten to undermine the
sustainability of development gains. Inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient
is moderate (ranging from 36.6 in 2008 in Grenada to 48 in 2006 in Antigua and
Barbuda) compared to the average of 52.9 in 2009 for the Latin America and the
Caribbean Region (World Bank 2014). Unemployment—especially among youth—
remains a major concern. Unemployment rates range from 6.3 percent in St. Kitts
and Nevis to 25 percent in Grenada (IMF 2013). Among youth, unemployment rates
are as high as 34 percent in St. Lucia and 42 percent in Grenada. Gender-based
issues in the OECS are complex and both men and women face challenges that
shape their individual and household-level vulnerability and risk. They include
higher rates of unemployment, fewer job options, and lower wages for women,

2. Assessment of Overall World Bank Group
Support
Bank Group Strategy and Program
World Bank Group support to the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)
countries over the evaluation period was framed by two Regional Partnership
Strategies (RPSs) bearing similar headings, each adjusted by a RPS Progress Report
(RPSPR). Use of an OECS-wide strategy continued a practice initiated well before
the start of the evaluation period. Over the initial part of the period, a September
2005 RPS1 covering FY06–09—complemented by a June 2008 RPSPR—featured two
pillars: (i) supporting growth and competitiveness; and (ii) reducing vulnerability
(for details, see appendix B). Following the 2008–09 global financial crisis, a May
2010 RPS covering FY10–14—adjusted through an April 2012 RPSPR—had two
pillars: (i) building resilience; and (ii) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating
sustainable medium-term growth. Hence, despite minor differences in wording and
ordering, the development pillars remained essentially unchanged over the
evaluation period. The FY06–09 RPS foresaw Bank Group-wide activity, including
base-case, International Development Association (IDA) financing of almost $13
million a year, reduced slightly in the RPSPR; the FY10–14 RPS planned for Bank and
International Finance Corporation (IFC) activity, including IDA financing averaging
almost $15 million per year. Details are provided in appendix B.

Results areas targeted by the Bank Group program, mostly stable over the
evaluation period, were broad ranging in their thematic coverage. The consolidated
FY06–09 and FY10–14 RPS strategic objectives or results areas can be set out under
the two pillars of strengthening resilience and enhancing competitiveness (table 2.1).
In some cases, the strategic objectives applied to only part of the period. For
example, during the FY06–09 RPS period, results in debt or the financial sector were
not explicitly targeted, whereas both were featured prominently in the FY10–14 RPS.
There is also some arbitrariness as to the pillar under which a particular results area
appears. Improving fiscal sustainability contributes to strengthening resilience, but
equally helps enhance competitiveness and encourage growth. Thus in the FY06–09
RPS, this results area came under the enhancing competitiveness pillar, but in the
FY10–14 RPS, it came under the strengthening resilience pillar. Subject to these
provisos, table 2.1 depicts the main headings under which the Bank Group sought to
engage its OECS clients. The pillar structure has been largely maintained, although
it has undergone some changes in the October 2014 FY15–19 RPS.

THE BANK’S PROGRAM
Deliveries of Bank support combined loans, grants, and analytic and advisory
activities (AAA) that did not differ radically from plans, although IDA funding was
larger than expected. New Bank lending commitments during the evaluation period
amounted to almost $259 million under 24 operations, all but $18.5 million of it on
IDA terms. Beyond the IDA/IBRD financing, $67 million in trust fund grant
financing was committed to the countries under 26 projects. Commitments of
IDA/IBRD financing were predominantly for investment operations, which
accounted for 86 percent of the value and 87 percent of the number of
commitments.2 The sector composition of operations was concentrated in disaster
risk management including catastrophic insurance and post-disaster recovery and
reconstruction, with commitments classified under urban development accounting
for almost half of total lending. Nonlending technical assistance (NLTA) dominated
AAA, comprising 62 percent of the number delivered. In general, the AAA had
broad thematic coverage and was either inter-OECS or Caribbean-wide. Bank
support during the evaluation period is reviewed in detail in appendix B, and
appendixes C and D provide a pillar-by-pillar list of operational products delivered
or active during the evaluation period.

Portfolio quality was good overall, and the existing portfolio had favorable
outcomes. New commitments of IDA/IBRD financing during the period added to a
significant inherited portfolio of $128 million under 20 projects. The portfolio
consolidated over the period. From a peak of 25 projects in FY08, nine active projects
remained in FY15, but riskiness increased. During the FY06–10, at-risk projects in the
portfolio compared favorably with those in both the Latin America and the
Caribbean Region and overall Bank portfolios. However, since FY12, portfolio
riskiness has increased and is now slightly higher than both the Region and World
Bank averages. Regarding exiting project outcomes, a total of 33 operations with net
commitments of $180 million closed during the period. IEG rated the outcomes of 26
of these projects—79 percent of projects, representing 83 percent of commitments—
as moderately satisfactory or better. This was somewhat better than the World Bank
average of 72 percent of the projects and 82 percent of commitments.

ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT
THE IFC PROGRAM
Advisory services operations dominated IFC interventions. These operations were
concentrated in access to finance, public-private partnership (PPP) transactions, and
business climate. Access to finance operations included technical assistance to the
Bank of St. Lucia in designing and implementing a strategy for small and medium
enterprise (SME) financing. PPP-related operations typically provided support for
structuring transactions, such as the divestment of the state insurance company in
Antigua and Barbuda, private participation in St. Lucia’s water utility, development
and operation of a hospital in Grenada, and private sector participation in the
operation of St. Lucia’s Hewanorra International Airport. Direct investments in
OECS-based institutions were limited to a $20 million operation with the Bank of St.
Lucia in FY08, which IFC also provided with $15.5 million through its Global Trade
Finance Program in FY08, and a $30 million investment in the American University
of Antigua and Barbuda in FY10. IFC also invested at least $120 million in
companies domiciled outside the OECS but with operations or investments in OECS
countries.


Overall Assessment of Bank Group Engagement
By any measure, the objectives underlying the Bank Group program were relevant.
The two pillars, generically well-suited to the development challenges of small
states, were a good fit for the OECS countries. Beyond this, the more detailed
strategic objectives (results areas) also suited the OECS countries’ specific
circumstances.3 For example, the fiscal, debt, and public sector performance issues
prominent in the RPSs and RPSPRs would not have been equally relevant in many
other small states. Similarly, prevention and control of the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) assumed top
relevance in the first RPS in light of its high prevalence in the Caribbean in the late
1990s and early 2000s. Once the institutional structures for addressing HIV/AIDS
had been built up, the Bank appropriately sought to deepen knowledge and
encourage a call to action regarding the emerging threat of noncommunicable
diseases. Just as important, all indications are that solid country- and OECS-wide
demand and ownership underlay Bank Group support in the various areas. RPS
content underwent wide-ranging stakeholder consultations and reflected priorities
expressed in country and OECS-wide strategy or policy documents that were in
force or under preparation at the time.4

The range of objectives and results areas pursued was very wide, raising the
question of whether greater selectivity could have been exercised. More selectivity
would have allowed greater consistency and continuity of Bank support for priority

areas, likely bringing better results.5 A smaller number of projects could also have
lowered the associated transactions costs. In this respect, the consolidation of the
active portfolio observed in recent years as well as relatively selective lending
proposals in the FY15–19 RPS (box 2.1) represent steps in the right direction. At the
same time, the wide range of objectives and results areas covered by the program
reflected efforts to be responsive to client demand. In addition, in several areas—
such as where the way forward needed clarification through analytic work or the
extent of client commitment was not clear—Bank Group engagement was
appropriately modest and mainly involved AAA and trust fund support.


 Box 2.1. The FY15–19 OECS RPS
 The FY15–19 RPS maintains the two pillars of strengthening resilience and enhancing
 competitiveness, but makes public sector modernization a separate pillar. The three pillars support
 a goal of helping to lay the foundation for sustainable and inclusive growth. Under the three
 pillars, results targeted by the strategy are organized under nine outcomes. These range from an
 improved investment climate (under the competitiveness pillar) to improved budget management
 and transparency (under public sector modernization) and increased capacity to manage natural
 hazards (under resilience). World Bank Group contributions to many of these outcomes are
 premised on a wide array of support areas. Contributions to an improved investment climate, for
 instance, encompass proposed support for addressing weaknesses in the business environment; a
 comprehensive financial sector strategy ensuring the continued and improving health of the
 banking sector and its ability to support private sector-led growth; greater adoption of information
 and communications technology, innovation, and creative industries growth; and lower, more
 predictable energy prices. The results framework specifies indicators that are largely relevant for
 gauging progress toward the outcomes specified.
 Although the reach of strategic objectives and results areas remains wide, the RPS foresees many
 of them being addressed through trust fund financing and nonlending work. Proposed IDA/IBRD
 lending—supported by indicative IDA allocations to the four blend countries over FY15–17
 totaling some 22 percent more than over FY12–14—spans four areas: competitiveness, renewable
 energy, social resilience and human development, and the financial sector. The latter is
 conditioned specifically on “adequate progress in developing a comprehensive financial sector
 strategy … and under a suitable policy and regulatory environment.” It is difficult to guess how
 many distinct new operations this will mean in practice. Given that “implementation of regional
 programs has proven difficult,” the RPS proposes that lending should support country programs
 under regional frameworks, offering “a menu of options under a regional operation framework,
 allowing countries to select the mix that best suits their needs.” Nevertheless, at least in them atic
 coverage, this is consistent with a move toward greater selectivity in lending. While few specifics
 are provided on prospective nonlending work, the RPS signals a general intent to move to a
 reimbursable advisory services model in the high-income countries (Antigua and Barbuda and St.
 Kitts and Nevis).
 There can be little doubt concerning the relevance of the strategy, including adequate tailoring to
 the small-state context and alignment with the regional and country context and priorities. It also
 offers potential for synergistic Bank-IFC work in competitiveness and public-private partnerships.
 However, for some aspects, caution is warranted. Concerning prospective lending, particularly
 under headings such as competitiveness which has since been partially narrowed to focus on
 tourism followed by agriculture, there is a need to guard against multipurpose operations, which

 often bring complexity and implementation problems. Under certain headings, such as public
 sector modernization, the RPS calls for a more focused program going forward (with emphasis
 notably on program budgeting). In so doing, however, it largely breaks Bank Group involvement
 in important, if admittedly difficult and frequently unsuccessful, areas such as managing and
 rationalizing government human resources. It also raises questions regarding the relevance of
 program budgeting as a top priority (and point of focus in the RPS results framework) in the area
 of fiscal management.

Despite some deficiencies, the quality of RPS results frameworks was passable. RPS
results frameworks provided for the inherited portfolio as well as new approvals
and were generally well constructed, although some RPS outcomes were entirely
process-related. The FY06–09 RPS results framework did not specify baseline or
target values for many indicators (World Bank 2005 p.33),6 although most of these
were later provided in the FY06–09 RPSPR. In some cases, unrealistic assumptions
were made about the pace at which Bank Group-supported outputs would
materialize and influence targeted outcomes. For example, the FY10–14 RPS
framework expected that functional reviews and staff audits of government
departments would be completed, internalized, translated into action, and lead to a
reduction in the wage bill as a ratio of GDP, all within the RPS period. This proved
overly rosy. Similarly, the notion in the same RPS results framework that Bank AAA
for strengthening debt management could help reduce the countries’ debt ratios by
an average of 15 percentage points of GDP significantly overestimated its effects, as
was later recognized in the FY10–14 RPSPR. Regarding feedback, while efforts were
made to monitor the status of results during preparation of an RPSPR or new RPS,
little indicates the results of such monitoring influenced forward-looking decisions
regarding the size or composition of Bank Group support.

Although its strategies did not develop detailed contingency plans, for the most part
the Bank Group dealt adequately with risks. The FY06–09 RPS appropriately
identified the two main exogenous sources of risk to Bank Group program results—
natural disasters and external economic shocks—as well as the endogenous risk of
policy slippage.7 Other than the triggers associated with the base- and high-case
lending scenarios, which would have captured policy slippages, no specific actions
were taken to mitigate risks or concrete contingent plans developed to alter the
program in the event of risks materializing.8 Nevertheless, the RPS argued—with
considerable justification—that the focus on vulnerability reduction would help
reduce risks.9 The characterization of risks in the FY10–14 RPS was similar and
pointed additionally to the risk of weak implementation capacity diluting the
effectiveness of Bank Group support. Again, the RPS did not seek to develop
contingent responses, arguing that the planned Bank Group program would help

                                         ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT
mitigate risks, and in particular that capacity-building initiatives would help
mitigate the risks associated with weak institutional capacity. In the event, the Bank
was able to respond effectively to St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines
following Hurricane Tomas in October 2010. Finally, while the operational program
generally anticipated political economy risks, there are several instances where the
Bank or IFC might have better investigated and made allowances for political
economy obstacles to planned reforms or potential changes in priorities following
government turnover. They included support for a new public management model in
Grenada, for private participation in St. Lucia’s water utility, and for the
establishment of an OECS-wide energy regulator.

The Bank Group’s blend of regional and single-country support was largely
appropriate to the circumstances. The Bank Group’s determination to “go regional”
in planning and delivering many of its operational products during the evaluation
period was justified by the limitations of small states and a push for OECS
integration.10 Consequently, 29 percent of the number of IDA/IBRD-financed
operations and 45 percent of the volume of financing delivered during the period
had a multi-country structure, in some cases going beyond OECS clients.11 For
projects with client-executed grant financing from trust funds, a very large
proportion was committed under multi-country initiatives (94 percent of the volume
of financing, representing 73 percent of the number of projects). In addition, most of
the Bank’s AAA was aimed at multiple countries. However, given the many
practical restraints on the pace of OECS integration and on configuring associated
Bank Group support, the use of multicountry products was probably close to (in
some cases, perhaps even in excess of) the limits of its effectiveness. Concerns
ranged from forfeiture of national sovereignty and the cost of supra-national
institutions to the asymmetry in IDA eligibility across the countries as well as
inevitable country-specific needs and circumstances. As it turned out, despite the
Bank Group’s caution (World Bank 2010, p. 27),12 not all the regional operations
approved during the evaluation period have been implemented smoothly. For
instance, a Bank project with the original intent of establishing electricity regulation
at the OECS level is now having to be scaled back in light of reservations by the
countries (even the two that have already joined the project) concerning the wisdom,
or at least the pace, of transition from national to regional regulation. Partly because
of the difficulties encountered in certain regional projects, the FY15–19 RPS proposes
greater use of country-specific projects under “regional frameworks” rather than
regional projects per se (box 2.1).

The mix of lending instruments was also broadly appropriate. While investment
lending predominated during the evaluation period, the Bank did provide some
budget support following the global crisis. It is difficult to fault this choice, which


                                                                                          11

indicates responsiveness to country financing needs and requests. However, it is
conceivable that the June 2010 development policy operations in Grenada and St.
Lucia would have yielded better results in supporting a relatively long-term reform
agenda had they been structured as a programmatic series rather than freestanding
operations, similar to what has been in use in Grenada since June 2014. In addition,
in certain cases (St. Lucia in 2010 and Grenada in 2014) more consistent coupling of
development policy lending with technical assistance for reform implementation
would likely have increased the former’s effectiveness. An open question remains as
to whether the Bank could have made greater use of development policy lending. In
its investment lending, the Bank used a mix of instruments—including specific
investment loans, emergency recovery loans, adaptable program lending (APL), and
technical assistance loans—that were appropriate in light of the countries’
circumstances and demand. In particular, use of emergency recovery operations in
St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines gave the Bank flexibility to help cope
with the impact of Hurricane Tomas. Use of the APL instrument—structured
horizontally—for projects covering multiple countries blended the synergies
inherent in a common project framework with the flexibility to match project
approval and implementation timeframes to the differing levels of readiness among
the country clients. This helped limit transactions costs for the Bank.

AAA addressed key development constraints and informed Bank Group support, but
in a few cases, greater dissemination could have enhanced knowledge transfer and
impact. Thematically, there was no obvious strategic master plan for AAA
deployment other than the pillar structure of the strategies, and the reason for picking
the subjects covered by AAA was not always clear. In some cases, such as the Bank’s
work on debt and on the financial sector, the choice of subject reflected events and
client demand. In others, such as IFC’s work on the business climate and other work
to unlock growth, it reflected long-standing constraints to development. Invariably,
however, the subjects covered were important and were relevant to the countries’
development. The AAA program had some very original and innovative elements,
such as the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF), a Caribbean-wide process for identifying
and addressing constraints to growth at the country level using participatory,
accountability-enhancing mechanisms.13 The program also offered examples of how
the Bank Group, often in collaboration with regional institutions and other
development partners, was able to leverage its own relatively modest resources and
staff time to help build technical capacity to the OECS countries’ benefit.14 In the latter
part of the evaluation period, the shift in composition—away from formal reports
toward NLTA in specific areas—emerges as a very clear and deliberate tendency to
use AAA to address institutional capacity constraints. In terms of engaging

stakeholders around the findings and implications of its analytic work, some
stakeholders indicated lack of familiarity with economic and sector work products.

The Bank Group program invested significantly in building client capacity. In the
OECS, as in other small states, weaknesses in institutional capacity are an inherent
challenge (box 2.2). Three tendencies in the Bank Group program during the
evaluation period point to its heightened attention to institutional capacity
development. First, several IDA/IBRD-funded projects approved during the period
supported capacity building—funding expertise, training, and sometimes
equipment aimed at enhancing institutional capacity. Five projects were formally
designated as technical assistance loans, but there were also substantial institutional
capacity building components in a number of other Bank-funded investment
projects (e.g., the 2013 Antigua and Barbuda Public and Social Sector
Transformation project). Second, the program included grant financing
commitments for several capacity development initiatives—26 distinct projects. This
grant financing came from several trust fund sources, including the Institutional
Development Fund (IDF), the Rapid Social Response trust fund, and the MECOVI
program.15 Third, over the evaluation period, the Bank shifted its AAA program
toward NLTA in a bid to strengthen institutional capacity. Some of the formal
reports, such as the Debt Management Performance Assessments (DeMPAs) or the
CGF, are better seen as byproducts of processes that aimed to build know-how,
including social capital. Going forward, the FY15–19 RPS signals a well-placed
intent to “mainstream the building of capacity and institutions” into Bank Group
program activities.


 Box 2.2. Institutional Capacity Challenge in the OECS
 Institutional capacity limitations in small states, and in the OECS in particular, are critical but often
 very subtle. On the face of it, the OECS appears to fare well relative to non-small state comparators
 on cross-country indicators of government effectiveness (notably the World Governance Indicators
 “index of indices” of this dimension of governance). Nevertheless, as Brown (2010) has argued,
 certain fundamental characteristics of the OECS and other commonwealth Caribbean small states
 have acted to constrain the development of strong public institutions and their absorptive capacity
 (notably of resources from development partners)—as well as the effectiveness of institutional
 capacity strengthening initiatives. These characteristics include pervasive and costly government
 (including high government wage bills relative to the size of the economy), the high per capita cost
 of public administration and social and economic infrastructure, and the limited pool of skilled
 human resources, with a lack of depth in specialization to perform vital public service roles.

Although Bank Group initiatives to help strengthen institutional capacity had mixed
results, the experience suggests certain necessary conditions for success. While


                                                                                                         13

ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT
systematic assessment of the progress achieved in building sustainable institutional
capacity is beyond the scope of this report, there were some successes. Effective
interventions seem to require a blend of sufficient prioritization of the issues at level
of national or regional policy makers; dynamic, influential leadership at the
operational level by the national or regional executing agency; and Bank efforts,
both financing and technical input, commensurate with the ambition and
complexity of the task at hand. The Bank’s efforts to develop client capacity to
undertake DeMPAs, which addressed a high-profile issue of concern to policy
makers (debt management) under Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB)
leadership with a well-defined and circumscribed task, were apparently successful.
In contrast, its IDF-funded efforts to help set up a priority public program
performance information database and an associated monitoring and evaluation
community of practice were ineffective. Policy-maker demand and ownership was
weak, the implementing agency (Caribbean Center for Development
Administration, CARICAD) experienced problems and had little influence with
country or regional authorities, and the capacity-building task was not neatly
bounded. More than half the funds remained unused.

Portfolio implementation arrangements have centralized client fiduciary capacity,
although the sustainability of that capacity remains a concern. Unlike the business
model elsewhere, the Bank Group has had no resident presence in any of the OECS
countries. Its ability to exercise step-by-step implementation support has therefore
been constrained, and counterpart capacity to implement projects has taken on
particular importance. Although the model varied, implementation arrangements
for country-specific projects usually relied on a single entity—a Project Coordination
Unit (PCU)—in each country to manage the fiduciary functions in all Bank projects,
while responsibility for technical aspects fell to the relevant line ministries and
departments. There were exceptions. In St. Kitts and Nevis, HIV/AIDS project
implementation was domiciled in the Health Ministry, with counterparts arguing
that this was key to creating and sustaining ownership of the project and future
implementation capacity.16 Bank-supported regional projects used one of two
implementation arrangements: implementation by regional bodies such as the OECS
Secretariat and implementation directly by the borrower countries (with PCUs
handling fiduciary aspects) using a common policy platform.17 Arrangements
relying on national PCUs have worked well for the most part, although they have
also meant that line ministries did not build up fiduciary capacity. However, the
extent of PCU integration within regular government structures is in most cases
imperfect. In particular, grading and remuneration of PCU staff is not usually
aligned with regular civil service scales. Although this misalignment can be
explained, it also calls into question the sustainability of the institutional capacity of

                                        ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT
the PCUs. Similar sustainability concerns arise where regional bodies—generally
viewed as tangibly costly, but intangibly beneficial, in the countries—have served as
executing agencies for Bank-supported projects. For instance, the regional e-
government unit that served as implementing entity for the E-Government Regional
Integration Project has largely been disbanded since project closure.

While the newly introduced simplified procedures for small states have facilitated
project implementation, the Bank did not pursue a streamlined investment project
concept for small states. With a view to enhancing project performance and delivery
of results, in April 2013 the Bank introduced some exceptions to the normal
requirements under its investment project financing in small states (World Bank
2013a, p. 3).18 These allow greater flexibility in procurement under Bank-financed
projects (World Bank 2013b). The simplified procedures and documentation
requirements facilitate project implementation and foster local business development
by introducing greater flexibility regarding thresholds for competitive bidding, prior
review thresholds, and supplier/bidder numbers and qualifications. They have
elicited positive feedback from client counterparts. In other respects, however, the
Bank Group has not developed any “streamlined packaging” concepts that could
reduce unit costs of delivering small volumes of financing to small states. In
particular, the Bank did not pursue a new Small Country Umbrella Program
instrument concept. The intent of the instrument, cited in the FY06–09 RPS as an idea
under development, was to enable small states to access funding for small, simple-to-
procure investment projects not involving complex safeguards issues in a way that
would have reduced the transactions cost associated with project preparation and
approval.

High transactions costs of delivering Bank Group support to the OECS point to
potentially significant payoff from streamlined project models. Over the period
FY05–15, for instance, a proxy for average lending cost per dollar of new
commitments in the OECS was 16 times the Region average and 13 times the Bank
average.19 Over the same period, a proxy for average supervision cost per dollar of
active commitments in the OECS amounted to 10 times the Region average and 11
times the Bank average.20 Although the proxies used are crude, they provide a
striking illustration of the orders of magnitude involved.21 The large unit
transactions costs of financing in the OECS help to explain the Bank’s onetime idea
of developing the small country umbrella program concept.

Partnerships featured centrally in the Bank Group program. In the provision of
financing, the Bank Group has been a relatively small player in the OECS.
Nevertheless, various forms of partnership,22 often bolstered by the Bank’s
convening power, helped leverage its technical and financial contributions. These


                                                                                      15

ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT
partnerships—with other bilateral and multilateral development partners, regional
bodies, nongovernmental organizations, and sometimes a combination thereof, in
addition to the beneficiary countries and institutions—facilitated more concerted
channeling and arguably increased the efficiency and effectiveness of external
support to OECS. Casual partnerships, which had a largely coordinating function,
included the regular quarterly meetings of Eastern Caribbean development partners
in Barbados, which the Bank attended. They also encompassed the Bank’s work with
key players, for example, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and International
Monetary Fund (IMF), on specific areas of support.23 In addition, several stronger,
more formal partnerships underlay delivery of several Bank or Bank-sponsored
activities. A very high-profile example is the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance
Facility (CCRIF), where the Bank had a key role in providing the technical expertise
for the facility’s design, providing start-up financing, and helping to mobilize
contributions from several prominent development partners to capitalize the initial
setup. Another example is the Supporting Economic Management in the Caribbean
initiative. Under it, some $19 million in financing from Canada, administered by the
Bank and IMF, has supported strengthening of public finance management in 12
Caribbean countries, including all six OECS countries, since 2011. Yet another
example is the CGF, a partnership of the Bank Group, CDB, Compete Caribbean (a
partnership program supporting private business development), and the Inter-
American Development Bank, together with Canada and the United Kingdom. In
other cases, the Bank partnered with regional organizations, both supra-national and
nongovernmental, as well as development partners in supporting specific areas. In
debt management, for instance, the partnership has involved among others the
Canada, ECCB, and IMF. In the financial sector, it has involved the ECCB, IMF, and
United Kingdom. Other partnerships have involved CARICAD and the OECS
Secretariat. These partnerships have made Bank Group contributions more
significant than if it had acted alone.

Intuition suggests that the intensity of partnerships is higher in the OECS program
compared with Bank Group programs elsewhere. In small countries with limited
institutional capacity, the gains from acting with other parties in delivering support
appears to be especially large. However, short of a qualitative activity-level
comparison between the Bank Group’s OECS program and other Bank Group
country programs, there is no easy way to confirm this. Nevertheless, certain
measures can provide useful indications. For instance, trust funds housed in the
Bank can be seen as partnerships between the Bank as administrator and one or
more donors as contributors. In the Bank’s OECS program, the financing role that
trust funds play is significantly larger than the norm (table 2.2). In this specific
respect (i.e., intensity of trust fund use) then, partnerships have been used more

1The September 2006 Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) was in fact labeled a country
assistance strategy (CAS). In substance, however, there was little difference between it and
the ensuing RPS, and both covered the six independent OECS countries.
2Grenada and St. Lucia—the largest overall recipients of Bank financing—were the only
recipients of development policy operations.
3 In addition to the question of whether some areas covered by the Bank Group program
were not relevant (i.e., possible errors of commission), the question also arises as to whether
there were any areas that the Bank Group program should have covered, but did not (i.e.,
possible errors of omission). The question can, of course, be posed at various levels. At one
level, the question is whether there were any areas that the Bank missed. In fact, there are
few significant gaps of this type, although support for financial sector strengthening could
have been reflected in the FY06–09 RPS, as weaknesses were already evident even before the
2008–09 global financial crisis. Similarly, in some areas (e.g., education) Bank support did
not attempt to address certain issues (e.g., the excessive number of teachers) that were
clearly of central relevance to improving sector performance. At another level, the question

is one of approach. For example, could (and should) the Bank Group have done more in
terms of framing its support within an overall “strategic storyline” relating to the countries’
development, such as their economic and social integration? Because the matter is a highly
subjective one, it is not pursued here.
4 As appendix B illustrates, a large number of country- and OECS-level strategy and policy
documents, both economy-wide and sector-specific, were available during all or part of the
Bank Group’s two strategy periods, although their coverage was neither systematic nor
continuous. Broadly speaking, priorities in Bank Group strategies reflected those in several
of these documents. In any case, because the documents seldom established clear trade-offs
under hard resource constraints, it would be hard to point to any explicit inconsistency
between them and Bank Group strategies. In addition, the Bank Group undertook public
consultations with client stakeholders as to the appropriateness of the proposed priorities in
its draft RPSs, although there is always a question mark—by no means specific to the OECS
case—as to how meaningfully public consultations around proposed strategies can (and do)
modify the Bank Group’s plans (especially in the direction of making planned engagement
more, rather than less, selective).
5 In some areas, such as public sector modernization, Bank support has been sporadic,
leading to some loss of momentum in the pursuit of reforms. The same is arguably true of
the financial sector (over a longer period than that spanned by the two RPSs).
6Citing the scarcity of timely and accurate data in the OECS, the RPS suggested “a more
comprehensive results framework would be developed during the CAS Progress Report and
as each project is developed.”
7At the time of the FY06–09 Regional Partnership Strategy Progress Report (June 2008), the
magnitude and effects of the global financial crisis were not yet fully evident, although a
bout of steep fuel and food price increases had taken place in preceding months.
8In practice, however, the Bank program has typically adjusted ex post—in response to
country demand—to mobilize support for recovery and reconstruction when a natural
disaster occurred.
9For example, the Bank’s efforts to help set up the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance
Facility were clearly a major contribution to dealing with risks related to natural disasters.
10As indicated earlier, prior to the start of the evaluation period, the Bank Group was
already using a regional (i.e., OECS-wide) partnership strategy to frame its support to the
countries as a group rather than individually. In addition, regional project work was
exemplified by the Bank’s OECS Telecommunications and Information and
Communications Technology Development Project (P088448; about $2.75 million), a
technical assistance operation approved in FY05 that was part of the inherited portfolio.
11The definition of multi-country or regional operations used here is a fairly restrictive one,
namely projects that received, or at least were eligible to receive, financing from the regional
allocation of the International Development Association. In other words, it excludes several
projects that were structured as “horizontal” adaptable lending programs where a common
project framework was replicated across countries.
12Their advantages notwithstanding, the Bank Group saw regional operations as being
inherently riskier and more difficult to implement than single-country projects. There is,

however, no immediate evidence that regionally-structured projects perform worse than
single-country projects. In fact, over the evaluation period exiting projects of the former
variety exhibited somewhat better outcome ratings on average than those of the latter
variety.
13The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) is a multi-partner initiative aimed at helping to
identify and implement growth-oriented reforms in 12 Caribbean countries, including the
OECS, under three themes: investment climate, logistics and connectivity, and skills and
productivity. The initiative has both a regional and a country-specific dimension, and
emphasizes stakeholder (e.g., private sector, civil society) participation and accountability
mechanisms to spur government reform implementation. In addition to supporting and
helping to design the CGF framework, which provides for national accountability
workshops featuring policymaker reform commitments and regular “traffic light” updates
in the presence of civil society and private sector participants, the Bank prepared a report
presenting knowledge regarding key constraints to growth in the Caribbean, including the
OECS countries.
14In debt management, for instance, funding from Canada supported Bank and International
Monetary Fund provision of training, coordinated by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, for
country and regional officials on debt management performance (DeMPA) assessments, debt
sustainability analysis, and medium-term debt management strategy (MTDS) preparation. In
addition to preparing three DeMPA assessments, the Bank also provided support for
preparation of Grenada’s MTDS.
15MECOVI is a Spanish-language acronym for a trust-funded program to improve data
relating to household living conditions—Mejoramiento de las Encuestas de Hogares y la
Medición de Condiciones de Vida.
16However, unlike Grenada and St. Lucia, Bank projects in both St. Kitts and Nevis and
Antigua and Barbuda were very small in number, thereby offering smaller prospective
gains from pooling fiduciary functions across projects.
17 Feedback from the client governments suggests that the latter form of arrangement is
preferable because it promotes ownership, facilitates implementation, and provides a better
fit to local needs and preferences.
18The exceptions apply inter alia to “cases where the Borrower/beneficiary or, as
appropriate, the member country is deemed by the Bank to … experience capacity
constraints because of fragility or specific vulnerabilities (including for small states),” and
relate notably to allowing: deferral of certain fiduciary and environmental and social
requirements from the preparation to the implementation phase; as well as special
procurement arrangements.
19The evaluation uses Bank administrative budget data (which distinguishes new lending—
that is, project preparation—and supervision costs) as well as data on the flow of new Bank
lending commitments and the stock of active Bank net lending commitments (that is, the
size of operations under supervision) over the period FY05–15. To proxy preparation costs
per dollar lent, the ratio of new lending costs each FY to new lending commitments in the
following year was calculated, taking the average for the entire period.



                                                                                                  19
CHAPTER 2
ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT

20To proxy supervision costs relative to project size, the ratio of supervision costs in a given
FY to the stock of active net lending commitments at the end of the year was calculated,
taking the average for the entire period.
21While the measures used are crude proxies to capture what is sought, two factors dampen
potential bias and error: the averaging over a 10-year period and the use of a (unit-free)
measure that compares one country group to another.
22The formal definition of a partnership—an arrangement, typically involving dedicated
funding and common objectives for collective action, between two or more legally
autonomous entities—qualifies virtually any activity undertaken by the Bank Group in the
OECS during the evaluation period as a partnership, and is thus a little too broad to be
useful. The evaluation uses the term to denote an arrangement involving multiple parties.
23For example, bi-monthly coordination meetings on support for public financial
management in the Caribbean are held in Barbados among key development partners
involved (i.e., Canada, Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center, European Union,
International Monetary Fund, United Kingdom, World Bank Group, and occasionally, the
Caribbean Development Bank).

24Available information does not however point unequivocally to more intensive use of
partnerships in the OECS program. The analytic and advisory activities program in the
OECS, for instance, has drawn 24 percent of its funding from trust fund sources (and the
remainder from the Bank budget), but this ratio is lower than the Bank-wide average of 43
percent.

3. Contributions to Strengthening Resilience
Chapter 3 assesses the progress toward World Bank Group program objectives for
strengthening resilience (pillar 1). During the evaluation period, the Bank Group
sought to help strengthen the resilience of Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States
(OECS) countries in three areas: fiscal, debt, and public sector management, disaster
risk and environmental management, and human capital and social resilience. The
chapter reviews the program achievements in each of these areas. In each case, it
examines the relevance, or appropriateness, of Bank Group strategic objectives given
the countries’ circumstances; how key components of the program addressed the
objectives; and the progress made toward program objectives—as specified in the
results frameworks in the two Regional Partnership Strategies (RPSs). Details of
Bank Group support and operational products for strengthening resilience are set
out in appendix C. The precise focus of Bank Group strategic objectives varied over
the period. For instance, the FY06–09 RPS was concerned with prevention and
control of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS), but this focus did not extend into the FY10–14 RPS period. In
addition, many elements under the areas reviewed here could equally have
contributed to competitiveness (pillar 2).


Strengthening Fiscal and Debt Sustainability and Public Sector Performance
Bank Group strategic objectives included debt management, public agencies and
human resources (HR), public finance and services, and planning and monitoring
and evaluation (M&E). Coverage of Bank Group objectives was broadly continuous
through the two RPS periods, although following the 2008–09 global crisis emphasis
increased on fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability. Appendix C provides a
summary of the objectives and associated outcome indicators—as modified by the
relevant Regional Partnership Strategy Progress Report, if applicable—during each
of the two RPS periods as well as information on outturns. Combining the two, the
following broad objectives can be distinguished: (i) strengthening debt management
(explicitly retained as a results area only in the second RPS period); (ii) improving
management of public agencies (explicitly retained as an objective throughout, albeit
with specific emphasis on reducing the wage bill as a share of gross domestic
product (GDP) in the second RPS period); (iii) improving public finance
management and public services, with attention to regional harmonization
(explicitly retained as an objective throughout, with emphasis on e-government
services during the second RPS period); and (iv) strategic planning, notably
strengthening links between public spending and development objectives (explicitly


21
CHAPTER 3
CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
retained as an objective only in the second RPS period). In the FY06–09 RPS, the
fiscal and/public sector results area was under the enhancing competitiveness pillar;
in contrast, the FY10–14 RPS placed it under the increasing resilience pillar.1

CONTEXT AND RELEVANCE
While the objectives had broad coverage, their relevance was indisputable. Against a
backdrop of high and deteriorating debt ratios, the relevance of strengthening debt
management is evident.2 Following the global crisis, the 60 percent debt-to-GDP
currency union convergence criterion was exceeded in every country.3 The policy
concern featured centrally in the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank’s Eight-Point
Stabilization Plan, designed to address the impact of the global crisis in the OECS
countries.4 The focus on HR and public agencies also had high relevance given the
OECS countries’ high government wage bills and weak public sector cost-
effectiveness. A FY05 Country Economic Memorandum had underscored the need
for sustained fiscal adjustment and public sector reform to set the stage for higher
growth (World Bank 2005a). The urgency of containing wage bills intensified with
higher deficits after the crisis, even as growing unemployment increased
recruitment pressures. In public finance management and public services, numerous
weaknesses had been documented,5 while tax and customs policy and
administration also exhibited shortcomings.6 E-government services were virtually
nonexistent. The relevance of helping to strengthen these areas was thus strong.
Finally, inadequate grounding of public spending in development strategies
justified a focus on strategic planning.7

BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS
The Bank combined project and development policy lending, trust fund grant
financing, and analytic and advisory activities (AAA) to address these areas, while
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) advised on customs reform. Beginning
in 2010, the Bank used AAA, including Debt Management Performance Assessments,
to help strengthen the countries’ debt management capacity. Lending had only a
sparing role. It also prepared the Comprehensive Debt Framework (CDF), an
analytic construct clarifying the links among policies affecting indebtedness.
Lending and trust fund grants sought to help strengthen agency performance and
HR management capacity. Initially the focus was on Grenada, where the Bank
sought to support a New Public Management (NPM) model of public service
delivery, as well as Dominica. Subsequently, support for government HR
management (e.g., through functional reviews) was extended to St. Lucia, as well as
to Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis. In both Grenada and St. Lucia,
Bank lending supported the introduction of the value added tax (VAT) and
strengthening of revenue administration. Lending also supported improvements in

                                                                              CHAPTER 3
                                               CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
customs in several countries, notably upgrading of the ASYCUDA computerized
customs management system. In Grenada, IFC advisory support complemented
Bank lending for customs reform. In addition, the Bank used regional instruments to
support tax and customs policy and administration as well as public expenditure
management. Since 2011 it has administered a major Canadian-funded partnership
initiative to strengthen public financial management—the Supporting Economic
Management in the Caribbean (SEMCAR) initiative—which provides IT-focused
support in revenue and customs administration as well as public expenditure
management, seeking cross-country systems harmonization and economies of scale.
Beginning in 2008, the Bank supported e-government services in four countries
using a regional adaptable program lending (APL) framework, the Electronic
Government for Regional Integration Project (EGRIP), implemented by the OECS
Secretariat. Finally, the Bank used grant resources, and in some cases lending, to
support strengthening of strategic planning and M&E capacity, both regionally and
in specific countries.

RESULTS
Medium-term debt management strategies (MTDSs) were prepared as planned. The
outcome targeted in the Bank Group’s FY10–14 RPS was achieved with the
preparation of MTDSs by Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and
St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The Bank also contributed to strengthening country
and regional institutional capacity for debt management—including efforts to
distinguish, institute, and strengthen front-, middle-, and back-office functions. In
general, the Bank’s work to build debt management capacity has used partnerships
that helped leverage the impact of its modest but focused outlays of resources and
technical knowledge. The CDF has provided analytic underpinnings for recent Bank
work in the OECS, including the latest (FY15–19) RPS and the Grenada
programmatic development policy financing series, although there are indications
that initial efforts to ensure wider dissemination and use have faltered. Some recent
improvement in debt-to-GDP ratios in some of the countries (still largely above the
60 percent convergence criterion of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union) have
been driven by events such as debt exchanges with creditors or debt retirement
through asset sales. It is hard to argue that the Bank’s support contributed
significantly.

Few results of Bank efforts are evident on the management of public agencies and
HR. Pursuit of the NPM model in Grenada ran into constitutional obstacles and
stalled. The RPS target of reducing the government wage bill as a ratio of GDP in at
least three countries was not met.8 In St. Kitts and Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda,
the implementation of Bank-supported initiatives to strengthen public sector HR

CHAPTER 3
CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
management has not advanced sufficiently to underpin reforms and affect
outcomes. Where Bank-supported initiatives have had more implementation time,
they may have provided some benefits and helped strengthen pockets of
institutional capacity.9 However, reforms associated with Bank support are at best a
slow-paced work in progress, and at worst completely stalled. In St. Lucia, work on
preparing new public service management legislation, while delayed, is now in the
final drafting stages. In contrast, the work on a new government position
classification and remuneration system has progressed little, despite remaining a
notional priority. Even in Grenada, where Bank support has been the most sustained
and intensive, it is difficult to identify any far-reaching government HR-related
reforms to which Bank support has clearly contributed.10 Given the political-
economy complexities of government HR management as a reform area and the
OECS countries’ limited institutional capacity, it is unlikely that in the absence of
consistent hands-on development partner support, successful reform
implementation can be expected in the near term.

Several public finance- and service-related areas supported by the Bank Group have
seen progress, though in some cases with delays. Although not all of the FY06–09
RPS outcomes were achieved, there has been clear progress in areas for which the
Bank initiated support during the period, with associated improvements in
institutional capacity. For example, recent improvements in customs clearance
outcomes are likely attributable to the ASYCUDA system upgrades that the Bank
supported. In Dominica, Grenada, and St. Lucia, Doing Business indicators of days
to export and to import have improved in recent years, with Grenada—where IFC
advisory services on trade logistics complemented Bank support—recording
particularly significant improvements. Implementation of the VAT in Grenada and
St. Lucia, which was supported by Bank financing, has provided a more robust and
less distortionary source of revenue than was previously available. In recent years, it
has amounted to 5–6 percent of GDP in Grenada. Bank support for improvements in
public expenditure management have been more fragmented, although it is possible
to associate some progress with its support (e.g., new procurement laws in
Dominica and Grenada). More recently, the SEMCAR initiative has provided an
umbrella under which support for expenditure management, as well as for revenue
and customs administration, is more consolidated, although available and projected
funding is unlikely to be sufficient to meet program targets or the entirety of the
OECS countries’ institutional capacity-building needs. Despite some implementation
difficulties, EGRIP helped lay the foundations for e-government services in the four
countries concerned. The online tax filing facilities developed under the project are
now in use, although uptake is still low, particularly in the countries where online
payment facilities are still under development. The regional electronic

pharmaceuticals procurement platform that it helped create has been in use to
acquire drugs and medical supplies, and has helped to enhance efficiency and
transparency, with contract awards published online.

Finally, Bank efforts to strengthen capacity for strategic planning and M&E have
had little impact. An OECS-wide grant from the Institutional Development Fund
(IDF) did not achieve its intended outcome of fostering creation and maintenance of
an active M&E community of practice and disseminating performance information
on public programs, owing in part to limited demand and buy-in from the countries.
Although implementation of a Rapid Social Response grant to the OECS Secretariat
fared better, the OECS Growth and Development Strategy it helped produce
remained in draft form as of July 2015, and the extent to which grant activities have
helped institutionalize the subsequent use of M&E is unclear. In Grenada, operation
of a cabinet office M&E unit established under an IDF grant has not been sustained,
while in Antigua and Barbuda implementation of the Public Sector and Social
Transformation project is not sufficiently advanced to have helped strengthen
strategic planning capacity.


Strengthening Environmental and Disaster Risk Management and Climate
Resilience
Under this subpillar, Bank Group strategic objectives spanned two areas. The bulk of
Bank financing for the OECS program was directed to disaster risk management
(DRM), pursued through several pathways. One pathway, although it did not
feature explicitly in Bank Group objectives ex ante, was post-disaster recovery and
reconstruction. Others involved seeking to reduce risks and vulnerability by
supporting infrastructure investments that reduce disaster exposure or
vulnerability; building capacity and encouraging policy changes for improved
disaster risk management (including data and knowledge); supporting the creation
of an innovative regional catastrophic risk insurance pool for disaster events; and
promoting climate change adaptation. The second area covered involved
management of the natural environment. Details of Bank Group strategic objectives
and results sought, as well as outturn information, are in appendix C.11

CONTEXT AND RELEVANCE
The OECS countries are among the most disaster-prone in the world, so placing
DRM among the top priorities for Bank Group support was amply justified. The
OECS countries are highly vulnerable to natural disasters, especially hurricanes and
flooding. The likelihood that a hurricane of at least category 1 force will make
landfall is estimated at one-thirteenth per year for Grenada and one-eighth per year


                                                                                     25
CHAPTER 3
CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
for St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Climate change will likely exacerbate these risks.
Though the direct loss of life from disasters has been relatively small, the effects
from economic disruption and from damage to assets are large. The damage to
Grenada from Hurricane Ivan—which exceeded 200 percent of GDP—was extreme,
but many lesser events have also been crippling.12 The fiscal cost of weather-related
disasters has been a major driver of their public debt buildup. Disaster vulnerability
is driven not just by the natural hazard, but also by exposure of people and assets in
high-risk zones. The countries’ high disaster vulnerability has given DRM
unquestionable relevance and a central place in Bank Group RPSs beyond the
evaluation period, and DRM currently dominates the Bank’s portfolio both in
number of projects and total financing. Nevertheless, Bank Group focus has been on
public rather than private sector exposure.

Sustainable management of natural resources and biodiversity is a challenge,
underscoring the relevance of Bank Group strategic objectives in this area. Both
habitat and biodiversity in the OECS countries are threatened by population growth,
over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution, poorly planned coastal
development, and tourism. Yet the countries depend heavily on tourism, which is
based largely on the appeal of the natural environment. The environment also
sustains economic activity and livelihoods through fisheries and other ecosystem
services.

BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS
Bank support for DRM grew to account for much of the OECS project portfolio,
while support for the environment was confined to Global Environment Facility
(GEF) funding. Details of the Bank’s support for DRM during the evaluation period,
including a full list of the operational products it employed, are in appendix C. Bank
engagement during the period was mostly limited to Grenada, St. Lucia, and St.
Vincent and the Grenadines. There has been a perceptible shift in the Bank’s focus
toward pre-emptive risk reduction, strengthening institutional capacity, and
comprehensive risk management strategies. Emergency Recovery Loans delivered
support for recovery and reconstruction after major hurricanes—Ivan in 2005
(Grenada) and Tomas in 2010 (St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines)—but
also supported measures to reduce exposure, such as retrofitting infrastructure to
enhance resilience. The Bank also undertook post-disaster needs assessments
(PDNAs) following disaster events. Beginning in FY11, it provided financing for
DRM investments in the four International Development Association (IDA) blend
countries (including Dominica starting in FY14) through the Disaster Vulnerability
Reduction Program, set up as a horizontal APL.13 Physical investments aside, the
successive Bank projects provided substantial support for disaster preparedness and

emergency management capacity. Through a combination of AAA, lending, and
convening work, the Bank was central to the establishment of the CCRIF (box 3.1). In
the creation of the CCRIF, the Bank put its comparative advantage to work,
including its unique capability for blending provision of technical expertise,
financing, and convening power for partnerships. Climate change adaptation was
addressed through the DRM portfolio as well as through Caribbean-wide GEF
projects. Finally, the entirety of Bank support for environmental management and
biodiversity protection consisted of two GEF projects—seeking to help strengthen
the management of protected areas and to establish sustained funding for the
protection of marine ecosystems.


 Box 3.1. Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility: A Successful Multi-Country
 Partnership
 The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) is an innovative instrument that solves
 a chronic problem. Private insurers do not provide cost-effective insurance products for small
 states because the transaction costs of developing those products are high, and developing a
 sophisticated actuarial risk appraisal requires substantial upfront investment. The CCRIF’s risk
 pooling feature, and the Bank’s work to support risk modeling for the various countries as well as
 design of the financial setup, overcame these obstacles. The CCRIF now has 16 member countries,
 and offers members—who pay risk-based insurance premiums to purchase desired levels of
 insurance coverage—three distinct insurance products: against a hurricane of specified wind
 speed, against an earthquake of a specified magnitude, and (most recently) against rainfall of
 specified severity. Each product is designed not to insure against losses from a disaster, but to
 provide rapid payouts after the event to help provide the liquidity needed to finance disaster
 response and early recovery phases—including fuel purchases, equipment hire, and overtime
 wages.
 The CCRIF is the result of a partnership among several donors. The facility was capitalized with a
 grant from Japan along with capital contributions from a multi-donor trust fund (with
 contributions from Bermuda, Canada, Caribbean Development Bank, European Union, France,
 Ireland, United Kingdom, World Bank Group) as well as membership fees from the 16 member
 countries. Aside from the formation of the joint risk pool, development partner funds and
 expertise supported data collection and technical product development work. Bank contributions
 included a lending operation (the $14.2 million OECS Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project) that
 financed the insurance premiums of the four blend OECS countries for 2.5 years. A Caribbean-
 wide lending operation (the $45 million Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project) established
 the CCRIF and supported its initial operations. After the initial donor support, all members except
 Haiti now fund their own premium payments, and the facility is a self-sustaining entity with
 strong support from member countries.


RESULTS
The Bank had a positive post-disaster role, and its funding for vulnerability-
reducing investments has had a significant cumulative effect. While views on the
value of Bank PDNAs are mixed, they have enabled rapid preparation of emergency
response projects. Moreover, a visible Bank presence following disasters has


                                                                                                   27
CHAPTER 3
CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
contributed to positive views by governments of its engagement in DRM. Retrofit
upgrade investments have been applied over multiple Bank projects to a significant
portion of community centers and schools used as shelters after a disaster as well as
to hospitals and clinics. Although many facilities face ongoing problems with
maintenance funding, evidence is mounting that retrofit upgrades and risk
reduction investments successfully reduce disaster vulnerability (World Bank
2011).14 Bank financing has also covered assets such as bridges and roads, which are
key to connectivity and economic activity, by funding their rebuilding to higher
standards.15 In addition, protective works funded under Bank projects have targeted
some of the areas most threatened by severe erosion and storm surge.16 A pilot
project in St. Lucia appears to have been successful in reducing landslide risk,
though it is unclear whether the improved drainage will be maintained, and the
scale-up necessary for a significant aggregate effect has yet to occur. Overall,
however, Bank DRM projects have been a main source of funding for capital
investment in infrastructure, and cumulative impact over the evaluation period has
been significant. Critics note, however, that the focus of risk reduction works has
been almost entirely on “hard” traditional engineering works, with very little
support for “soft” works that may be less disruptive to ecosystems.

The OECS countries’ exposure to disasters remains very high. Even restricting the
focus to the public sector, the total scope of at-risk assets is very large, and it would
take expensive retrofits to make a significant difference to their climate resilience.
Some of the most critical assets, such as airports, are still very vulnerable to flooding
and storms. Despite the increasing weight of DRM in its project portfolio, the scale
of resources mustered by the Bank is modest relative to the need. Yet the scale of
potential support is limited by country IDA funding and the ability to borrow given
existing high indebtedness as well as by the absorptive capacity of governments.
Thus, overall progress on risk exposure has been incremental rather than
transformational. Efforts have focused almost entirely on storm and flood
management; yet earthquake, tsunami, drought, and even volcanic eruption hazards
are also significant. Finally, there has been limited progress in the countries where
Bank has not had a DRM lending program.

The Bank contributed to some improvements in understanding vulnerability and the
ability to act on it, but gaps remain, and available knowledge may be underused.
While Bank support has contributed to development of a range of disaster
vulnerability maps for river flooding, storm surge, and coastal inundation, these have
been mainly pilot efforts. Coverage of maps is incomplete, and their use sporadic.
There are some prominent examples of Bank-supported studies influencing decisions.
For example, hydraulic studies made a major difference to the design of a critical
bridge in St. Lucia, drought data and modeling influenced investments on increasing

reservoir storage, and studies and analytic work used in developing the CCRIF were
critical in making the program feasible. Nevertheless, feedback from government
officials suggests that most studies financed under Bank projects are underused in
decision making. Bank projects have also enabled incremental improvements to
hydro-meteorological systems, including equipment, training, and warning systems;
meteorological capabilities and services remain limited.17 Limitations in data
collection systems in particular pose a persistent challenge.18 Bank-supported
geographic information system training, equipment purchase, and other measures
have made some difference in data management capacity, but land information
systems are still poorly integrated, with no central repository for data, and a major
constraint remains the capacity of staff to use data meaningfully. Meanwhile, progress
on land use planning has been very limited, and most countries still have no national
zoning laws or formal disaster risk zones, which are often viewed as unfriendly to the
tourist sector and encounter opposition.19 This has meant that in some countries there
has been considerable new development in high-risk zones, with rapid land use
change from agriculture to housing. Despite a few examples of governments trying to
promote preventive resettlement in local plans or donor-supported projects, efforts
remain at the margin. Building codes have been established and updated in some
countries, and have improved resistance to wind, although design requirements for
mitigating landslide risk and seismic risk are mostly still low. Moreover, codes are
generally followed in public buildings, but compliance is variable for private
construction, especially for housing construction, and inspection and enforcement
capacity remains limited. In general, while the Bank has financed a lot of
infrastructure, studies, equipment, and training, its impact on policy has been less
significant.

The Bank has also contributed to improving capacity for disaster response. Permanent
national emergency management agencies have been established, and have benefited
from various Bank operations.20 These agencies have been involved in the creation of
national emergency plans, as well as from learning reviews carried out after disasters
to assess system performance and generate lessons. For example, the emergency
management office in St. Lucia encountered problems after the Hurricane Tomas.
There were significant shortcomings in the initial response, the emergency operations
center was not fully utilized, and the communications system failed as radio repeaters
were destroyed by the storm. After a learning exercise, response to 2013 flooding was
smoother. The impact of Bank efforts to help build capacity has varied across
countries. In some, the agency has been able to provide leadership across government
in pushing for resilience, in others the agency is still weak and focused on the civil
defense aspects of emergency response. Institutional effectiveness frequently depends

CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
on individual leadership. Some equipment gaps also remain, and facilities
maintenance is an ongoing problem.

With respect to financial risk management, the CCRIF provided a largely self-
supporting, sustainable insurance mechanism. In effect, the facility has allowed
governments to transfer a portion of disaster risk to the pooled mechanism and
onward to reinsurance markets. As of May 2015, the CCRIF had made 12 payouts to
eight member countries—all less than three weeks after the triggering event—for a
total of $35 million.21 All countries,22 including the OECS, are renewing their policies.
Finance ministries report that they intend to continue purchasing insurance and may
expand their coverage. Some already have expanded to the rainfall insurance
product. The coverage offers a real benefit to countries in providing funds needed
for initial responses. Finance ministries note that the space in national budgets for
contingencies is very limited, so liquidity is a significant problem that the facility
helps them solve. Still, this form of insurance can only ever be part of a broader risk
management strategy; it does not cover the vast majority of losses. Overall,
governments report satisfaction with the CCRIF. While some officials argue
premiums are too high and the facility is accumulating assets unnecessarily, CCRIF
managers note surpluses are being used to increase capital reserves and offer some
discounts on premiums. CCRIF analytic work and training courses for governments
are also contributing to improved understanding of risk transfer as part of a DRM
strategy.

Bank support through the series of climate change adaptation projects had limited
impact. Total financing for the projects was small and spread over many countries,
enabling only small-scale actions in each country. In addition, the projects were not
tied into country strategies or coordinated with existing DRM programs, which
contributed to weak government ownership. While many project outputs were
broadly successful, the overall impact on building resilience in the Caribbean was
modest. Sea-level rise monitoring stations established under the projects faced
severe sustainability problems as there was no financing mechanism for
maintenance.23 Some data were produced but contributed little to government
planning processes in the OECS. In Grenada, vulnerability and risk assessments
were piloted, but faced shortcomings in acquiring baseline data and in technical
capacity, resulting in a lack of credible climate change scenarios. Countries
developed national adaptation policy options, but these did not bring new policies.
Some specific assets financed by the GEF projects—a solar powered desalination
plant in the Grenadines, for instance—had substantial impacts for local
beneficiaries,24 but there has been little replication.

                                               CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
The Bank’s support for DRM has had substantial impact, but not much has been
done to support anticipatory adaptation to address long-term climate change
threats. Climate change will bring some state shifts beyond incremental worsening
of storms, particularly through sea level rise. Little has been done to manage the
extreme vulnerability of existing and continued coastal development. In addition,
not much attention to climate change threats outside of DRM, such as the threat to
the tourism sector from coral bleaching.

In environmental management, Bank support had impact in some countries, but the
endeavor to establish sustainable financing sources faces major challenges. The Bank
project aimed at strengthening protected areas management had high impact in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, where it led to significant improvements in the Tobago
Cay maritime protected area, addressing livelihoods and ensuring community
involvement.25 In Grenada, by contrast, the project was unsuccessful. No funds were
provided to implement the management plan, so the overall impact was negligible.26
In most other countries, impacts were between these extremes, with some
improvements in park management, but little increase in public or private sector
involvement. In all countries, funding remains a major constraint. Under the
sustainable financing project—which remains active—a regional umbrella fund has
been established and capitalized. As of May 2015, national trust funds27 were still
being established, and no disbursements had yet been made. Even by project
closure, it will be unclear whether additional funding is having a meaningful impact
on protection of critical ecosystems. Challenges apparent from project design
include the transactions cost of the national trust funds,28 especially how to
operationalize a requirement that governments provide matching funds from new
dedicated funding sources.29 In sum, impact during the evaluation period was
limited. Bank staff, however, underscore the difficulty of making significant strides
in environmental management so long as the source of funding for Bank support is
limited to GEF.


Enhancing Human Capital and Social Resilience
Bank Group objectives for this results area spanned social protection, secondary and
post-secondary education, and health. During both RPS periods, the Bank Group
sought to help rationalize and improve the targeting of social protection programs.
It also sought to help improve post-secondary workers’ skills as well as to enhance
human capital through increased and more equitable enrollment in secondary
education and improved management and efficiency and better-qualified teachers.
Its efforts to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS and mitigate its impact were largely
confined to the first RPS period. During the second period, the Bank Group sought


                                                                                     31
CHAPTER 3
CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
to improve knowledge of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Appendix C provides
an overview of the objectives and outcome indicators and outturns.

CONTEXT AND RELEVANCE
Bank Group objectives were generally relevant. Safety nets in the OECS had poor
targeting and limited coverage, with vague and often subjective eligibility criteria,
unconditional benefits, and high administrative costs (World Bank 2005b). Safety
nets also had high costs (Grosh et al. 2008, 63),30 and pressure to improve the
performance of social protection systems mounted following the global crisis
(Williams et al. 2013).31 In the FY06–09 RPS, safety net-related outcome indicators
were process-oriented, and an outcome focus took shape only in the FY10–14 RPS.
Regarding post-secondary skills, the Bank’s 2011 enterprise survey identified
workforce training as a constraint to business success for private firms, behind only
access to finance and electricity, and unemployment has been a top concern
(Williams et al. 2013).32 Given the limited pursuit of tertiary education, a focus on
developing better-skilled post-secondary workers was justified, although the
enrollment headcount indicator used to measure progress was output-focused and
did little to put the impact of Bank support in perspective. There is an open question
as to whether the Bank could have helped—or indeed still could help—look into the
scope for expanding access to employment opportunities abroad for the countries’
labor force, which would have both augmented remittances and relieved
unemployment. In secondary education, there were shortfalls in access—in 2007, net
enrollment averaged around 80 percent in the OECS countries33 with the poor
disproportionately affected—and systemic inefficiencies, including low student-
teacher ratios and lack of teacher training.34

Finally, the Bank Group’s initial focus on HIV and AIDS, and its shift to NCDs, was
also justified. In the face of alarming and rising HIV and AIDS prevalence rates in
the Caribbean around the turn of the century,35 OECS and other regional
governments had reacted promptly, placing high priority on prevention and
control.36 By the end of the FY06–09 RPS period, prevention and control efforts had
been largely institutionalized. NCDs and chronic conditions now clearly pose an
increasingly important—and costly—threat to well-being and human capital.37 The
shift in Bank Group objectives was appropriate, but they did not cover health
financing, and the progress indicator focused on process.

BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS
A wide range of Bank Group operational instruments covered social protection,
secondary and post-secondary education, and health. Following an earlier
assessment of social protection programs in Dominica, Bank nonlending technical

                                               CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
assistance helped extend coverage to all the countries, albeit later in the evaluation
period than originally planned. These laid the foundations for reform, which Bank
lending helped initiate in Dominica, Grenada, and St. Lucia. Pensions were covered
in regional (Caribbean-wide) Bank AAA. The Bank also provided some support for
capacity-building with respect to labor statistics, but its support for direct
employment programs was very limited. In terms of post-secondary skills building,
Bank project support built on regional AAA and helped expand and institutionalize
vocational training in Grenada and St. Lucia, while IFC invested in a university in
Antigua and Barbuda. Regarding secondary education, a series of Bank projects
covering all of the countries except Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica with a
horizontal APL structure were implemented and helped construct, rehabilitate, and
equip secondary schools, as well as support teacher training, education policy, and
curriculum reform. In addition, AAA and grant funding helped generate knowledge
and supported education policy and strategy development. In support of HIV/AIDS
prevention and treatment, Bank projects were implemented in several of the OECS
countries under an earlier-approved Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and
Control Program also with a horizontal APL structure. Later, Bank AAA added to
knowledge on NCDs and other health-related issues. IFC advised on a hospital
public-private partnership in Grenada.

RESULTS
Little rationalization or targeting of social protection mechanisms has yet taken
place. Bank assistance to the OECS countries has helped raise awareness regarding
the need for reform in social welfare programs. But progress has been very slow.
Factors such as weak institutional capacity, high fragmentation of programs and
lack of data, and limited financial resources for reforms have contributed to the slow
pace. While assessments of social protection mechanisms were eventually
conducted, few programs have been rationalized, and targeting mechanisms for
cash transfers have yet to be implemented. Only in Grenada were three cash transfer
programs consolidated into a single program known as the Support for Education
Empowerment and Development, which began paying benefits in October 2011. No
OECS country has yet improved the targeting efficiency of cash transfer programs or
made cash transfers conditional, although St. Lucia is reviewing health and
education conditions.38 As a result, the latest FY15–19 RPS has retained the same
focus on rationalization and targeting of social protection programs.

The Bank helped institutionalize post-secondary skills training, and enrollment
targets were exceeded, even though the overall impact on labor force skills and
employment was modest. Although Bank-supported skill-building initiatives in
Grenada and St. Lucia have reached only a small portion of the labor force, there is



                                                                                       33

CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
some evidence that they are facilitating employment. With a growing number of
accredited training centers in Grenada, 886 youth had completed training by 2013
and almost two-thirds had found employment within 15 months of starting training.
In St. Lucia, 1,119 unemployed youth had completed Bank-supported training by
2013, and two-thirds had found employment within 15 months. Grenada is
conducting tracer surveys of graduates and employer satisfaction surveys—the kind
of follow-up analysis that has not yet been institutionalized, despite its value in
investigating the impact of training initiatives. Most importantly, Bank support
helped to establish post-secondary skills training systems, which have potential
OECS-wide application.

In secondary education, RPS outcomes were partially achieved. Enrollment rates in
secondary education did not register sustained increases by the targeted average of
10 percentage points across all OECS islands. Data indicate that between 2007 and
2012, there was a perceptible increase in net enrollment only in St. Lucia (figure 3.1).
Nevertheless, there are indications that Bank support made a positive difference in
some cases. By 2008, gross enrollment rates in both of St. Lucia’s secondary school
districts covered by the Bank’s education project had increased substantially (to 68
and 53 percent), although they remained below the national average of 82 percent,
suggesting idle capacity. In the four Bank-supported secondary school districts in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, net enrollment rose from 60 percent in 2004 to 93
percent in 2011. Similar increases in enrollment were observed in Grenada.
Nevertheless, with more lower-income students entering, but also dropping out of,
secondary school, gross completion rates in Bank-supported secondary school
districts in Grenada declined from 82 percent in 2002 to 62 percent in 2011. Although
national-level completion rates in the OECS countries generally improved, they
remained extremely low. In 2012, the pass rate for the Caribbean Secondary
Education Certificate exams ranged from 17 percent in Grenada to 33 percent in
Dominica.39 The proportion of qualified teachers increased from 59 percent in 2009 to
65 percent in 2013, surpassing the 2014 target of 62 percent. However, the teacher
workforce was not reduced to adjust to a declining number of pupils, given political
resistance by a strong teachers’ union. As a result, the pupil-teacher ratio in Grenada
dropped to an even lower level of 15 in 2010 from 23 in 2003 and to 17 from 19 in St.
Lucia. The RPS target of an increased ratio was not met. Given the persistently high
wage bill, the share of nonsalary recurrent expenditure in total recurrent
expenditure did not increase.

Despite data issues, Bank support undoubtedly contributed to improved HIV/AIDS
outcomes. HIV prevalence has remained at about 1 percent of the population.
Regarding prevention, 2006–08 data suggested that about 70 percent of high-risk
groups used condoms.40 The number of people receiving counseling and testing, as
well as those receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), increased in all of the OECS
countries. Better treatment prolonged the mean survival time for AIDS patients and
decreased their mortality rate. In St. Lucia, for example, about 93 percent of AIDS
patients were receiving ART by 2010. The mother-to-child transmission rate was
reduced to zero in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In Grenada, a relatively high
mortality rate in 2002–09 suggested that patients received treatment relatively late,
but AIDS-related deaths declined beginning in 2010. Worryingly, however, the trend
in new infections appears to be reversing: Grenada reported an increase in new HIV
cases from 21 in 2012 to 32 in 2013 (UNAIDS 2014b), and in St. Lucia, new HIV and
AIDS cases have increased since 2010 (UNAIDS 2012). In St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, HIV incidence dropped in 2011, as did the number of new AIDS
patients, but it increased again in 2013 (UNAIDS 2014a).

Finally, the Bank disseminated its analytic work on NCDs and nurse labor. The
Bank’s NCD work was disseminated widely. It recommended health promotion
programs and prevention efforts to reduce risk factors. It also recommended the
strengthening of surveillance and regional legislation and policies as well as staff
training and awareness building. To improve surveillance, the OECS Commission
Statistics Department has launched a regional health management information
system and is considering introducing demographic health surveys.41 The regional
report on nurse labor and education markets was also disseminated, although
several government officials interviewed were unaware of the report. It advocated
scaling up numbers of trained nurses through increased completion rates and

regional collaboration as well as managing migration through agreements with
recipient countries on annual flows and cost-sharing arrangement.


Summary Assessment and Ratings
In terms of increasing resilience (pillar 1), achievement of objectives related to
strengthening fiscal and debt sustainability and public sector performance (subpillar
1.1) was moderately satisfactory. Under this subpillar, Bank Group support
contributed to strengthening debt management capacity, revenue policy and
administration (including customs administration), and various aspects of public
expenditure management in one or more countries. The impact of its support varied
across the specific areas and across different countries, but was certainly positive. In
addition, Bank Group support helped lay a foundation for e-government service
delivery (despite shortfalls in bringing services on-stream and in uptake) and, more
generally, for harmonization of future progress in debt, revenue and expenditure,
and e-government services management. In HR management, despite the efforts in
Grenada and St. Lucia, and more recently in Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and
Nevis, Bank work has not led to significant reforms. The underlying concern of
strengthening the resilience of public finances by curtailing government wage bills
remains unresolved. Similarly, in strategic planning and M&E, little impact can be
seen as a result of the Bank’s support. Nevertheless, in HR management and
strategic planning, resource outlays were more modest and measured.

Concerning environmental and disaster risk management and climate resilience
(subpillar 1.2), achievement of relevant objectives was satisfactory. Under the broad
heading of DRM, attention was focused on Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and
the Grenadines. The Bank Group played a positive role in responding to specific
events, notably Hurricane Tomas. More fundamentally, it played a key role in
encouraging and helping to implement a shift toward preparedness and increased
resilience, although the unfinished agenda remains significant. In particular,
through a combination of projects, the Bank financed retrofits and rehabilitation for
a significant proportion of high-priority assets. In a similar vein, it supported a
community-based pilot initiative in St. Lucia to reduce landslide risks which, while
apparently successful, has not been replicated on a sufficient scale. It also supported
work to enhance knowledge regarding the vulnerability of critical infrastructure,
with the caveat that such work has seen little use in decision making. Perhaps the
most high-profile Bank Group contribution was its leading role in conceptualizing
and operationalizing a self-supporting, sustainable insurance mechanism against
disaster events, the CCRIF. It used a blend of Bank instruments—including the
intangible “convening power” for partnerships—to help correct a market failure.

                                                        CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE
The Bank also helped strengthen the countries’ disaster risk management capacity,
albeit with uneven impact. In land use management, Bank support has had few
results. The Caribbean-wide project support for climate change adaptation
initiatives was too small-scale to establish critical mass and had little impact. Under
the broad heading of environmental management, GEF financing to help strengthen
the management of protected areas had variable impact—high in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines but negligible in Grenada. Bank efforts to help establish sustainable
financing mechanisms to conserve critical ecosystems, while ongoing, have
encountered significant challenges—notably identifying sources for the intended
government matching funds—that risk undermining progress.

Achievement of objectives related to strengthening human capital and social
resilience (subpillar 1.3) was moderately satisfactory. While none of the OECS
countries has yet put in place rationalized, better-targeted social protection
mechanisms, the Bank was able to complete diagnostic work in the countries and
provide follow-on implementation support in some of them, an effort that is
ongoing. Focusing on Grenada and St. Lucia, Bank support helped lay a foundation
for post-secondary skills development in the OECS and implement specific skills-
building initiatives, with positive though modest impact on skills and employment
thus far. In education, it helped construct and equip secondary schools and increase
access in several countries. Nevertheless, its support did not directly address key
constraints in the sector, notably the teacher complement. From a health standpoint,
Bank funding approved prior to the evaluation period made a positive difference in
HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Whether results have been and can be sustained
after the closure of the Bank projects remains an open question, and the apparent
reversal recorded recently in favorable incidence trends is worrisome. The Bank also
contributed to efforts to raise consciousness and to begin addressing the incipient
threat posed by noncommunicable diseases as well as other health sector-related
issues.

1There is a similar degree of arbitrariness as to precisely which specific areas are subsumed
under each strategic objective. For instance, initiatives to strengthen public finance (revenue
and expenditure) management can be viewed as contributing to improved debt
management or even to strengthening the links between development objectives and public
spending, just as they can be viewed as a distinct objective together with improving public
services.
2While the FY06–09 Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) retained debt reduction as an
outcome that the Bank expected to influence, the associated indicator focused on the fiscal
balance, rather than directly on public debt management. Perhaps as a result, the RPS
Completion Report results matrix did not feature it.
3The case of Grenada is illustrative of the broader experience: from about 87 percent in 2008,
debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) had increased to over 100 percent by 2010 and
continued to climb after that. Grenada eventually went into selective default in 2012, and
began negotiating a restructuring of certain components of its debt with creditors.
4The RPS outcome—that at least three countries were to prepare a medium-term debt
management strategy (MTDS)—was process-related, with the Bank arguing that it lacked
the instruments to affect more meaningful outcomes such as the debt to GDP ratio. In fact,
the RPS Progress Report changed the RPS outcome targets from reductions in the debt-to-
GDP ratios to MTDS completion.
5Deficiencies in public finance management spanned many areas, including procurement
and audit. The weakness were documented, for instance, in the FY08 OECS Policy Note on
Project Fiduciary Management.
6In some countries, notably Grenada and St. Lucia, there remained evident deficiencies in
tax policy given the absence of a value-added tax to replace distortionary indirect taxes that
were lacking in buoyancy. Regarding tax and customs administration, at the start of the
evaluation period in 2006, Grenada’s Doing Business indicator of time taken to pay taxes
stood at 170 hours per year, while number of days to export (import) stood at 19 (23). For St.
Lucia, time taken to pay taxes stood at a much lower 71 hours, while number of days to
export (import) stood at 22 (19). Rankings for these aspects have not been available until
very recent years.

7 In particular, Bank diagnostic work in the FY07 Policy Note on Fiduciary Management had
pointed to the need to strengthen linkages between the selection of public investments and
country/regional development strategy objectives as well as to improve cabinet-level
capacity for monitoring the selection, preparation and implementation of capital projects in
line with national development strategies.
8According to International Monetary Fund figures, the wage bill in Grenada, from a baseline
of 9 percent of GDP in 2008, rose to 11 percent by 2011 then declined slightly, reaching 10.8
percent in 2013.
9 For instance, the Institutional Development Fund grant in St. Lucia supported work on
alternative strategies for negotiating with public service unions, which reportedly helped in
guiding subsequent negotiations that resulted in key unions agreeing to a wage freeze for
2015–16.
10For example, the functional reviews undertaken with Bank support did not contribute
appreciably to the key “three for ten” rule of thumb that is now in effect government-wide
to contain the wage bill by workforce attrition. The rule allows for recruitment of a
maximum of three people for every ten people departing (e.g., through retirement), with the
constraint holding government-wide as well as by institution (with certain departments,
such as the police force, exempted).
11Note that indicators were not always very relevant in assessing achievement of their
associated objective.
12For example, Hurricane Tomas in 2010 did damage to St. Lucia of roughly 43 percent of
GDP and 10.5 percent of GDP in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. A severe rainfall event in
2013 did damage of roughly 15 percent of GDP in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, including
damage to bridges, roads, and water supply systems.
13In addition to country allocations from the International Development Association (IDA),
the Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Program drew on the IDA Crisis Response Window,
the Strategic Climate Fund, and the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience.
14In Grenada, infrastructure financed under a 2001 emergency response project survived the
devastating 2004 Hurricane Ivan, and two schools retrofitted under a previous project were
the only schools left largely undamaged after the storm. After Hurricane Tomas in 2010, the
Bank conducted a study of whether activities supported under previous emergency
recovery and disaster management operations over 1998–2011 had improved the resilience,
preparedness, and response capacity of St. Lucia to natural disasters (World Bank 2011). It
found that retrofitted public buildings withstood the hurricane with no damage reported,
that flood-warning systems performed very well while other warning systems mostly
functioned, that communication systems and the emergency operations center did not
function effectively, that damage assessments were not standardized or centralized, and that
advances in hazard mapping and vulnerability assessments had been minor.
15A key bridge in St. Lucia damaged by Hurricane Tomas offers an interesting case study.
Hydrology studies indicated that the river flow had changed and flood risk was likely to be
higher in future, so the bridge was replaced by a more resilient design, with a single span
(avoiding a pile in the river that can accumulate debris in a flood) and the possibility of
allowing four lanes of traffic. The new bridge was substantially more expensive than


                                                                                          39

replacement with the old design would have been (and the high costs led to significant
public and political anxiety), but it is less likely to fail in future, and may have lower
ongoing maintenance costs.
16For example, for a town in St. Lucia that had suffered serious beach erosion and faced
extensive loss of land and regular evacuation, coastal and river protection works were
constructed that allowed for reclamation of a significant section of beach, and protection of
the main houses and businesses in the town.
17For instance, while warning systems have functioned for hurricane events, there was almost
no warning of the flash flooding in St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2013 owing
to the difficulties in predicting this type of event.
18Many sites that used to provide data have been damaged, destroyed, or stolen, and there
are no funds to replace them. For example, St. Lucia once had 18 sites to collect rainfall data,
and now only three sites remain functional.
19The Bank has begun to try to address policy barriers by incorporating disaster resilience
actions in its recent policy lending series in Grenada. But critical policy actions on
enforcement measures for physical planning, design standards, and construction practices
were dropped.
20Previously disasters had mostly been handled by temporary committees established in the
wake of the disaster. The creation of permanent institutions helps to provide ongoing
awareness raising and act as focal point for preparedness. The Bank financed construction
of headquarters buildings for the offices, along with provision of training and equipment
purchase. Subsequent projects further expanded capacity, supporting for example
stockpiling of emergency equipment, training programs for staff, establishment of local
community liaison officers, upgrades to telecommunications systems, and simulation
exercises.
21 Jamaica experienced a serious hurricane in 2009 that did not trigger a payout—substantial
damage from flooding notwithstanding—because at the time only the earthquake and wind
coverage existed, and the wind threshold was not triggered. This generated some frustration
and was one motivation for the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility expanding
its product line to offer rainfall coverage.
22   Other than Haiti, all member countries are now paying their own premiums.
23None of the 18 stations (Caribbean-wide) established under the first project were still
operational by 2005. A second attempt to establish stations was made in the second
operation, but again as of 2011, only three stations were still transmitting data. No stations
were left functioning in the OECS as of 2015.
24The plant has helped mitigate the effects of serious drought and offers the potential for
replication in other small island communities that cannot feasibly be supplied from regular
water connection services.
25The park went from a “paper” park to a genuine protected area, with park management in
place, fee collection, and ecosystem monitoring. The park worked with communities to
establish a formal no-take status. The project included some successful livelihoods
components, and community and private sector involvement, from water taxis and small
enterprises. The park management included governance representation from the water taxi

association, fishers, the tourism board, and local government, supporting public voice in
resource management.
26Livelihoods components were started late in the project and were rushed, and so had little
impact on stakeholders. There was also no meaningful private sector or community
participation.
27The individual countries had insisted on using national trust funds because they were not
confident that their constituencies would be well-served by a single “common pool”
regional fund.
28The transaction costs of establishing and maintaining national cost funds are high (up to
$100,000 per country per year to run, as compared to $400,000 of disbursements per country
per year). Working regionally could achieve economies of scale and lower costs, but a lack
of trust in regional institutions and a strong national desire for local control ends up raising
high transaction costs. However, national trust fund supporters also argue that these have
other advantages. For instance, national conservation trust funds elsewhere in the world
have often become key drivers of the environmental agenda in the country.
29The tourism industry is strongly opposed to additional fees or charges. The cruise ship
sector blocked a proposed $2 per visitor tax. Some countries are proposing systems of
voluntary donations by tourists. Willingness to pay studies are being carried out, but
government officials caution that stated willingness to pay for voluntary fees may not match
actual intention to pay. The overall goal of establishing reliable and sustainable funding is
jeopardized if expenditures depend on an unreliable matching fund mechanism.
 By 2008, OECS governments spending on safety nets was above the Latin America and the
30

Caribbean Region average of 1.3 percent of GDP and ranged from 1.3 percent of GDP in St.
Lucia to 3.2 percent in Grenada.
 By 2013, unemployment had reached 23 percent in St. Lucia and 33.5 percent in Grenada,
31

with the highest unemployment rates recorded among women, young people and the poor.
32At 42 percent in Grenada and 34 percent in St. Lucia in 2013, youth unemployment was
(and remains) of particular concern. Women are also twice as likely to be unemployed as
men.
33Although there is broad gender parity in access to primary and secondary education,
almost twice as many women undertake tertiary education compared with men.
34The student-teacher ratio at primary and secondary levels, already below the Bank-
sanctioned 25, was projected to decline further in the islands (except St. Vincent and the
Grenadines) as demographic trends reduced the student population (OECS 2014). In
addition, almost half of the teacher complement did not have formal qualifications.
35The prevalence rates of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the Caribbean were estimated to be second only to sub-
Saharan Africa’s. By 2005, HIV prevalence in the OECS was estimated at close to 1 percent.
Fears were that given the countries’ small size, the disease could spread rapidly owing to
risky behavior among vulnerable groups such as youth, with adverse effects on the broader
economy, particularly tourism.



                                                                                              41
CHAPTER 3
CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE

36In the late nineties, the Caribbean Taskforce for HIV/AIDS was created and in 2001, the
Pan-Caribbean Partnership against HIV/AIDS was established to take a regional approach
to the disease through knowledge sharing and capacity building. In 2002, pooled OECS
Pharmaceutical Procurement was introduced with support from a U.S. Agency for
International Development project, which decreased pharmaceutical costs by between 35
and 50 percent (Burnett 2003).
37For instance, some 10 percent of the population—predominantly of African descent—has
diabetes, one of the chronic conditions that require costlier specialized care and account for
a growing portion of health spending, placing increased financial pressure on OECS
governments. Other challenges include relatively high levels of government health
spending caused by a high wage bill, and insufficient staffing. At the same time, their small
size limits the OECS countries’ ability to sustain their own higher-cost specialist and tertiary
care hospitals and has compelled them to enter into treatment agreements with other
countries in the region, including Cuba, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United
States. Little information is available on the financial implications of overseas treatments for
the OECS governments, or on the selection process for overseas treatment. Patients who
need specialized care fly to Cuba, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, or the United States, and
have to pay substantial amounts for care and transport privately. Private health insurance is
available for those who can afford paying high premiums. But islands with social health
insurance such as Antigua and Barbuda cover only about half of the population, with the
lowest enrollment rates among the poor.
38Dominica does not apply an objective targeting mechanism for cash transfer programs,
which are paid universally (e.g., to all children who transfer from primary into secondary
school).
39According to a recent report, in Grenada, only 19 percent of students passed at least five
Caribbean Examination Council exams in 2010, a modest increase over the 13 percent in
2000. St. Vincent and the Grenadines registered a 52 percent pass rate in the Caribbean
Certificate of Secondary Level Competence (CCSLC) exams in 2011, a substantial increase
over the 37 percent in 2004. In 2014, 96 percent of the first cohort of the Saddlers secondary
school in St. Kitts and Nevis (renovated with Bank support) passed the five exams for the
CCSLC (OECS 2014).
40More recent data on the number of people receiving counseling and testing and condom
use among young people aged 15–24 and other high-risk groups are not available.

4. Contributions to Enhancing
Competitiveness
Chapter 4 reviews the progress toward program objectives for enhancing
competitiveness (pillar 2). During the evaluation period, World Bank Group efforts
to help the countries of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)
enhance their competitiveness covered three areas: the domestic and regional
financial sector; the legal and regulatory framework, sector linkages, and value
chains for private business; and infrastructure service delivery—in
telecommunications, water and sanitation, and energy. The focus of Bank Group
strategic objectives varied through the evaluation period. During FY06–09, the
financial sector did not feature in the Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) results
framework. The RPS results framework did not encompass St. Lucia’s water and
sanitation sector beyond FY09. Also noteworthy is that conceptually, several results
areas under strengthening resilience (pillar 1) also potentially affected the countries’
competitiveness; public sector performance and human capital, for instance. Details
of Bank Group support and operational products for strengthening competitiveness
are set out in appendix D.


Strengthening the Domestic and Regional Financial Sector
Bank Group strategic objectives included crisis resolution as well as the regulatory
framework in the financial sector, and touched implicitly on access to credit.
Strategic objectives relating to the financial sector were confined to the FY10–14 RPS,
and focused on two areas (see details in appendix D). The first related to
establishing a resolution strategy after the failure of two major insurance companies
operating in the region. The second related to improving the regulatory and
supervisory framework in the financial sector for bank and nonbank financial
institutions. In addition, while no associated strategic objective appeared in either
the FY06–09 or the FY10–14 RPS results frameworks, the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) endeavored to help establish a lending practice benefiting small
and medium enterprises (SMEs) in St. Lucia and address an underlying constraint,
namely credit information, on a Caribbean-wide basis.

CONTEXT AND RELEVANCE
Bank Group objectives in the financial sector had undeniable relevance, particularly
after the 2008–09 global financial crisis. Until the 2008–09 crisis, the OECS had
enjoyed a long period of financial stability anchored by its currency arrangement.


43
CHAPTER 4
CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
The financial sector was relatively deep, with considerable reach.1 Nevertheless,
joint Bank-Fund diagnostic work in 2004 had pointed to several risks, including
challenges facing indigenous banks and weak regulatory and supervisory
frameworks, especially for nonbank financial institutions and offshore banks (IMF
2004). These risks crystallized with the collapse of the Colonial Life Insurance
Company (CLICO) and the British American Insurance Company (BAICO) in early
2009; the two failed insurance companies had exposure in the OECS countries
totaling about 15 percent of the subregion’s gross domestic product. Beyond the
urgent need for resolution, the failures injected renewed impetus into many
initiatives begun in the early 2000s to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
framework.2 Overall, while the financial system remains sufficiently capitalized and
highly liquid, weak economic conditions have continued to push up nonperforming
loans and reduce private sector credit. The circumstances have thus been
appropriate for active Bank Group involvement in the financial sector, which has
also shown timely responsiveness to expressed client (Eastern Caribbean Central
Bank and individual country) needs. IFC’s efforts in St. Lucia to help improve SME
access to credit, which aimed to address a major long-standing constraint in the
business climate, were likewise highly relevant.3

BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS
Largely using AAA, the Bank addressed crisis resolution and longer-term financial
regulation and supervision, while IFC supported SME financing. Briefly, Bank
analytic work and advice to the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union’s Core
Committee on Insurance focused on resolving the BAICO/CLICO bankruptcies and
the associated systemic risk, and on strengthening and harmonizing regulation and
supervision of the insurance sector. Beyond insurance, with a view to helping
strengthen regulation and supervision in the broader financial sector, it focused on
OECS banking sector diagnostics. In Grenada and St. Lucia, development policy
lending supported the implementation of crisis resolution and stability-enhancing
measures, such as enactment of new insurance legislation. IFC engagement in
supporting the development of an SME lending practice in St. Lucia (using both
financing and advisory services) followed the completion of analytic work on
private sector financing by the Bank. IFC advisory services also examined the
feasibility of a microfinance program and helped in setting up a Caribbean region
credit bureau.

RESULTS
Bank Group support enabled progress in crisis resolution and in laying the
groundwork for a stronger financial sector regulatory framework, but less so in
developing SME lending. Bank technical work and financing contributed to the


44
                                                                             CHAPTER 4
                                             CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
development by 2011 of a resolution plan for BAICO. Implementation of the plan
has advanced. By early 2015, individual policyholders had received payments of up
to $300,000, but payments for institutional holders are still being worked out. A
resolution plan for CLICO took significantly longer to develop, and no buyer had
been found. Bank support has also contributed to strengthening financial sector
stability and more generally the regulatory and supervisory framework, notably for
the insurance sector. A new Insurance Act, filling several gaps in insurance
legislation, became effective in 2010 in Grenada. Although similar legislation in St.
Lucia was submitted to Parliament in 2010, it has not yet been approved. Working
with several partners, the Bank has also helped lay the groundwork for additional,
more comprehensive improvements in financial sector regulation and supervision,
although it remains very much a work in progress. IFC’s support for catalyzing SME
financing in St. Lucia helped offer a range of financial services to SMEs and saw
some uptake in lending. The practice, however, has largely been confined to vehicle
loans and has lacked dynamism, as critical constraints in the broader environment
were being only partially addressed.4


Strengthening the Legal and Regulatory Framework, Sector Linkages, and Value
Chains for Private Business
Bank Group strategic objectives pertained to the legal and regulatory framework—
including procedures for business entry and foreign trade—as well as to public-
private partnerships (PPPs). As detailed in appendix D, strategic objectives under
this subpillar spanned both RPS periods. During the FY06–09 period, the emphasis
was on strengthening OECS competitiveness through the modernization and
streamlining of the legal and regulatory framework for private investment, with a
specific focus on St. Lucia. During FY10–14, this emphasis persisted, but was more
specifically directed to procedures for starting a business and for trading across
borders, while the reach was broadened to all of the OECS countries. Throughout
the evaluation period, the Bank Group sought to help strengthen service delivery
through PPPs, although this strategic objective was only reflected in the results
framework in the FY10–14 RPS. Finally, while this did not feature explicitly as a
results area, the Bank Group also sought to improve sector linkages especially
between tourism and agriculture, strengthen individual value chains (again in
tourism and agriculture), and encourage the entry and growth of local SMEs, chiefly
by improving access to finance.5

CONTEXT AND RELEVANCE
Bank Group strategic objectives—guided by prior AAA—were relevant, although
the rationale for prioritizing specific areas was not always clear. Objectives and


                                                                                     45
CHAPTER 4
CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
results areas were generally consistent with the findings of comprehensive FY05
Bank diagnostic work on the growth and competitiveness agenda in the OECS,
which documented numerous weaknesses in the business climate and constraints to
growth.6 Improving this situation was a priority for country and regional policy
makers. Nevertheless, from a private sector and severity of constraints perspective,
the analytic basis for the FY10–14 RPS’s priority focus on business registration and,
in some countries, even on trade facilitation, was not entirely clear. For instance,
2010 enterprise surveys in four of the OECS countries, with samples dominated by
domestic SMEs, suggested that enterprises were far less concerned with business
start-up constraints than with other impediments—including access to finance,
electricity, tax rates, and workforce skills.7 Areas of focus may have been guided by
judgments regarding political tractability or “low-hanging fruit” opportunities, or
the argument that some Bank Group or other development partner engagement was
already provided on more important constraints. Equally, however, the feedback
from firms would likely have argued in favor of a more selective Bank Group
agenda, focusing on regional and national priorities, including financial sector
development, electricity, workforce skills, and perhaps corporate tax reform.

BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS
Bank and IFC activities sought to promote sector linkages, business environment
improvements, and PPPs. Although its efficacy varied, Bank Group analytic and
advisory work helped identify reform opportunities and track implementation. The
Bank prepared analytic work on backward linkages for the OECS tourism sector. In
Grenada, it prepared AAA on cocoa and nutmeg logistics and an agriculture risk
management strategy, and undertook a grant-funded project to help small nutmeg,
cocoa, and livestock farmers adopt improved technologies.8 IFC undertook an
advisory services operation on tourism investment in St. Lucia. The Caribbean
Growth Forum (CGF) initiative established useful country-by-country mechanisms
for identifying and tracking implementation of reforms in the focus areas of
investment climate, logistics and connectivity, and skills and productivity. It also
encompassed a Bank diagnostic report discussing key constraints to growth in the
Caribbean. Regarding business environment reforms, IFC’s Doing Business reform
advisory services provided technical guidance on business start-up and trade
logistics streamlining in several OECS countries. Bank lending operations also
supported measures to help improve the business environment, including
improvements in public services such as customs clearance. The interventions were
selective rather than systematic. Finally, IFC advisory services sought to help realize
PPPs in specific areas, including tertiary health care in Grenada and water and
sanitation, and airport services in St. Lucia. In parallel, the Bank helped develop a
regional infrastructure PPP roadmap, and assisted with PPP frameworks in Grenada

                                              CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
and St. Lucia. Appendix D provides greater detail on Bank Group activities during
the evaluation period.

RESULTS
Although Bank Group support under this subpillar had limited impact on
improving sector linkages, it is associated with some improvement in the business
environment. Although several counterparts interviewed indicated they were
unaware of the Bank’s AAA work on tourism sector linkages, the work is being built
upon through project support under the FY15–19 RPS. In Grenada, small farmers’
adoption of improved technologies has helped enhance their resilience,
productivity, and incomes. Bank lending in Grenada supported a new tourism
authority, but with unclear impact on boosting private sector-led growth in tourism.
As in other OECS countries, tax incentives have continued to be the primary
mechanism to promote investment in Grenada’s tourism sector, although fiscal
constraints and provisions under the country’s International Monetary Fund (IMF)
program have placed some restrictions on their use. In St. Lucia, IFC’s advisory
work on tourism development—well-regarded by local participants, owing largely
to hands-on engagement of a Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services
manager over a sustained period—helped bring together key actors, produce
relevant and timely inputs, and catalyze consensus-building discussions on strategy,
leaving in place a permanent advisory body on tourism with high-level participation
and support and a concrete action plan. In Grenada, training of entrepreneurs by the
Grenada Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) took place under a Bank
project, but there was little evidence of impact, and implementation of the new
GIDC strategy was very slow. Regarding competitiveness more generally, the CGF
initiative has proved useful in advancing some reforms, particularly in Grenada and
St. Lucia, although it remains a work in progress and faces some constraints.
Regarding the business environment, outcomes targeted in the RPS were partly
achieved. Business entry regulations were issued in Dominica and Grenada. In St.
Lucia, the introduction of electronic registration of businesses in 2010 had negligible
uptake. In Dominica, Grenada, and St. Lucia, improvements in procedures for
trading across borders (in part as a result of Bank support for ASYCUDA upgrades
and customs reform) resulted in reduced time to comply with import and export
regulations. Grenada recorded particularly significant improvements and is a
success story in terms of effective IFC-Bank collaboration in support of trade
facilitation (box 4.1).

IFC’s advisory work on PPPs produced few results. Initiatives to put in place PPPs
have had almost no concrete results. In several major cases, advice was given and
steps were taken to structure a PPP and solicit bids, but ultimately the government



                                                                                      47
CHAPTER 4
CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
decided not to proceed with contract award. Despite conducting the bidding process
for a management contract for the Water and Sewerage Company of St. Lucia
(WASCO), the lack of political consensus around the deal led the government to
terminate the process in 2009, after two bids were received but prior to bid selection.
Interviews suggested that there has been little real movement toward PPP in
WASCO since. The IFC advisory work for the partial divestiture of the Antigua and
Barbuda State Insurance Company (SIC) in 2009–12 proceeded as planned.
However, even as ownership limitations imposed by the government limited private
interest in the company, domestic political opposition to divestment was evident
(Caribbean 360 2008). Ultimately, the government decided not to proceed based on
the proposals received and SIC remains a public company. Counterparts
interviewed lauded the quality of IFC advice and technical support for the Grenada
hospital PPP. Nonetheless, after receiving a qualifying bid, it was decided not to
proceed with the transaction. The lack of fiscal resources clearly played a role, but
political support for the PPP arrangement appears to lack depth. While the
government remains interested in some form of PPP or concession arrangement, it is
hard to see that IFC’s work thus far has had a tangible, lasting benefit. Finally, PPP
frameworks were approved in Grenada and St. Lucia. In Grenada, this was a trigger
for the second loan in the Programmatic Resilience-Building development policy
credit series (approved after the end of the evaluation period).


 Box 4.1. World Bank Group Assistance for Trade Facilitation in Grenada: A Success Story
 One notably successful area of engagement during the evaluation period was Grenada’s customs
 reform. Through Bank and IFC activities that, according to those interviewed, maintained
 continuity, Grenada received sustained technical support as its customs service transitioned to the
 use of ASYCUDA World, introduced paperless customs processing, and streamlined and
 automated procedures. The FY15–19 RPS reports that IFC worked closely with the Bank on
 business registration, trade logistics, and credit bureaus in the prior RPS period. The Bank’s FY08
 technical assistance credit (TAC) helped “improve the efficiency and effectiveness of customs,”
 focusing on systems and procedures (including better risk management), upgrading information
 technology, and building staff capacity through training to operate and maintain the upgraded
 systems and procedures. When government funds proved insufficient to finance network servers
 and other hardware required, a portion of TAC funds were reallocated through a restructuring to
 this more urgent need. Earlier, through the Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services, the
 Bank Group had delivered a trade and logistics assessment for Grenada. Although there is no
 cross-reference in project documents between the TAC and IFC’s technical support under its
 “Trade Logistics in the Caribbean” advisory project under the “Grenada Port TA” subproject, it
 appears from interviews that officials regarded the overall Bank Group support effort as effectively
 coordinated with strong technical content. However, customs officials indicated that longer-term
 guidance on organizational “change management” would have been welcome. Overall, the
 experience was regarded as positive and successful.

Improving Infrastructure Service Delivery
In infrastructure, Bank Group strategic objectives covered telecommunications and
information and communications technology (ICT), water and sanitation, and
energy. Strategic objectives as well as outcome indicators and outturn information
are detailed in appendix D. Objectives in the FY06–09 RPS focused on reductions in
communications tariffs, including broadband, as well as increasing broadband usage
and strengthening national and subregional regulatory frameworks for
telecommunications. They also sought to improve the operation and oversight of the
water and electricity utilities in St. Lucia, although the FY08 Regional Partnership
Strategy Progress Report did away with the electricity-related objective. In the
FY10–14 RPS, the focus on ICT and electricity was maintained, but not except in the
context of disaster risk management of water and sewerage. Strategic objectives and
results areas concerned increasing ICT access for the general population and laying
the groundwork for the establishment and operationalization of the Eastern
Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority (ECERA) as an eventual OECS-wide energy
regulator.

CONTEXT AND RELEVANCE
Bank Group strategic objectives were appropriate given the OECS countries’
circumstances and the Bank’s relatively modest lending envelope. For the Bank to
focus on infrastructure areas outside of transport appears reasonable, given not only
the limits imposed by the countries’ borrowing capacity and the blend countries’
allocations from the International Development Association, but also the presence
and capacity of other development partners such as the European Union and the
Caribbean Development Bank in this area. With some exceptions, the main issues in
the infrastructure service areas of Bank Group focus had less to do with access than
with affordability and—especially with WASCO in St. Lucia—with the financial
sustainability of their operations, which affected investment capacity and service
quality, including reliability of access. Electricity tariffs, for instance, were extremely
high, and have consistently featured among the top constraints in the business
environment.9 Since the high costs of energy and telecommunications constituted
significant impediments to competitiveness, the motivation for reducing them was
strong. In telecommunications, the Bank Group’s rationale for focusing on tariff
reductions in the FY06–09 RPS was therefore sound. The rationale for paying
attention to the regulatory framework, of which rapid changes in technology
required prompt adaptation, was likewise sound. In energy, Bank Group attention
in the FY10–14 RPS to the regulatory framework was also relevant, although
improved utility performance and lower tariffs from better regulation is less robust
than for telecommunications and ICT. Nevertheless, a strong, harmonized



                                                                                         49
CHAPTER 4
CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
regulatory framework is crucial to encourage private investment in renewable
energy sources, which show significant promise for the OECS countries. Finally,
attention in the FY06–09 RPS to WASCO was justified in light of chronic
inefficiencies in the utility’s operations, below-cost-recovery tariffs, and inability to
realize the investments needed to upgrade the country water and sewerage system.
Arguably, however, the Bank Group’s approach of promoting private participation
in the utility was ill-suited to St. Lucia’s political economy context.

BANK GROUP SUPPORT AND OUTPUTS
Infrastructure objectives were addressed through Bank projects, complemented in
one instance by IFC advisory services. In telecommunications and ICT, financing
under two regional projects—one approved just prior to the evaluation period and
the second in the latter part of it—sustained long-standing Bank support for
regulatory framework development and sought to increase access to and use of ICT
services. Water and sanitation received financing under two Bank projects in St.
Lucia, both approved prior to the evaluation period. The first, a technical assistance
operation, focused on the institutional framework and improving WASCO’s
performance, with IFC serving as transaction adviser for a planned management
contract for the utility. The second supported urgent water supply investments in
preparation for St. Lucia’s hosting of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Concerning
energy, a Bank project supported strengthening of the regulatory framework for
electricity in Dominica. In parallel, the Bank pursued a regional energy regulation
model. Project financing to help establish an OECS-wide energy regulator was
eventually provided under the First Phase of the Eastern Caribbean Energy
Regulatory Authority (ECERA) Program, covering Grenada and St. Lucia, but it has
since run into major implementation difficulties.

RESULTS
Bank Group support for telecommunications and ICT during the evaluation period
saw some progress. Assistance supporting the design of a new telecommunications
regulatory system in the late 1990s and early 2000s had been remarkably successful.
It had seen the establishment of the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications
Authority (ECTEL) and National Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions
(NTRCs) in five of the countries.10 Bank Group interventions during FY06–14
produced more modest results. Although the OECS saw some progress in reducing
the cost of communications and broadband services and improving Internet
penetration, there is limited evidence that Bank Group support contributed to these
results. The new Electronic Communications Bill prepared under a Bank project—
which expands the mandate of ECTEL and the NTRCs—is not yet enacted. ECTEL
and the NTRCs have thus been constrained in assuring that regulation is able to

                                              CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
keep pace with a rapidly changing ICT industry.11 For instance, the emergence of
new users of telecommunications services raises questions about the adequacy of the
current licensing regime. The convergence of telecommunications, Internet, digital,
and information technologies makes the separation of telecommunications and ICT
regulatory functions obsolete.12 In addition, the lack of a competition authority in
OECS means that the ECTEL and the NTRCs cannot deal adequately with
noncompetitive practices in the sector. Regarding access and use, Bank support saw
the preparation and implementation (with some delay) of Universal Service
Guidelines and the establishment of Universal Service Funds in all ECTEL member
states.13 However, implementation of the Universal Service projects under the Bank’s
first project encountered many difficulties. Capacity issues at some NTRCs caused
delays in defining the projects. But the biggest challenge was a shortfall of interest
by private providers, which necessitated bidding deadline extensions. In the end,
each country implemented one pilot project, resulting in some expansion of ICT
connectivity and thus laying a foundation to be built upon but falling short of the
targeted penetration.14 Implementation of the Bank’s second regional project has
fared better, though it is too early to judge results. In particular, a pooled
procurement conducted under the project was a success, with smooth completion of
the evaluation, selection, and contract award process for a consultancy to conduct a
broadband assessment study.

In St. Lucia’s water sector, Bank Group support did not result in sustained
performance improvements. Bank project support was useful in helping to complete
targeted infrastructure investment in a timely way, ensuring water supply in
northern St. Lucia at a critical time. However, the Bank’s technical assistance project
had few results. Progress in improving the regulatory framework was slow. A new
Water and Sewerage Act in 2006 (amended in 2008) paved the way for the creation
in 2009 of the National Water and Sewerage Commission in 2009, which began
functioning only in 2012.15 Although a tariff review in 2013 allowed WASCO to
begin recovering operating costs,16 its finances continued to deteriorate over much of
the period, and St. Lucia’s aging water and sewerage infrastructure leads to periodic
severe water shortages and makes the country vulnerable. As discussed under
subpillar 2.2, WASCO’s much-anticipated transition to private sector management
never occurred. The process was aborted by the government owing to “a profound
lack of consensus amongst key cabinet members regarding the PPP structure”
(World Bank 2009, 6).

Despite helping to strengthen the regulatory framework in Dominica, the Bank
Group goal of laying the groundwork for regional energy regulation has been set
back. In Dominica, earlier Bank engagement had helped bring about enactment of a
new Electricity Supply Act in 2006, which liberalized the energy sector and provided


                                                                                     51
CHAPTER 4
CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
for independent regulation of electricity. The Independent Regulatory Commission
has since been broadly successful,17 although the expected reduction in electricity
tariffs did not follow from energy sector liberalization. The Bank technical assistance
credit had also supported the drafting of alternative energy legislation to define the
legal and regulatory framework for developing alternative energy technologies. A
geothermal bill was drafted but not yet enacted. The Bank has provided technical
and policy advice on geothermal energy development in Dominica and St. Lucia,
helping to pave the way for potential investments. The central theme of the Bank’s
engagement in the OECS energy sector was to create a regulatory body at the
subregional level. While the OECS governments agreed in principle that addressing
the energy challenges required a regional approach, support for the ECERA
initiative varied.18 Ultimately, only Grenada and St. Lucia made concrete
commitments—on which doubts have since been cast—to the ECERA project, and
the resulting momentum proved insufficient to support the creation of a full-fledged
regional regulatory body for energy. Despite the project’s lengthy preparation
phase, more work was needed ex ante to align stakeholder interests and to manage
expectations.19 In hindsight, a technical assistance project may have been more
appropriate to support the studies and the legal reviews being financed through the
ECERA project. It would have allowed for a more considered assessment of the best
approach to addressing the region’s energy challenges consistent with both political
and technical realities. In sum, the ECERA experience illustrates the pitfalls in a
model that, at least from a technical standpoint, offers a sound small-state
development solution. Nonetheless, Bank engagement under the project has helped
develop national energy regulation in the two countries.


Summary Assessment and Ratings
Achievement of objectives related to strengthening the financial sector in the
countries and regionally (subpillar 2.1) was satisfactory. Although there was a five-
year hiatus in engagement following in-depth diagnostic work in 2004, the Bank
contributed significantly—largely through AAA instruments, supplemented by
some development policy lending, and together with other development partners,
notably the IMF and the United Kingdom—to advancing efforts to strengthen the
financial sector following the 2008–09 global crisis. In particular, technical advisory
support and (in Grenada and St. Lucia) lending helped develop and advance
implementation of a strategy for the resolution of the insurance companies that
failed in 2009. Beyond crisis resolution, Bank technical and advisory support backed
to some extent by lending has helped achieve key steps in strengthening the
regulatory and supervisory framework for nonbank (notably insurance) as well as
bank institutions. The remaining agenda is significant, and Bank support—notably

                                                                              CHAPTER 4
                                              CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
for an independent review of bank asset quality—has continued beyond the
evaluation period. Finally, while not directly reflected in RPS objectives, the SME
lending practice in St. Lucia that IFC support endeavored to catalyze has shown
little dynamism, largely because of the absence of important prerequisites such as an
effective credit information system, which IFC has since begun trying to help
establish.

Regarding the legal and regulatory business framework, sector linkages, and value
chains (subpillar 2.2), achievement of relevant objectives was moderately
satisfactory. Bank Group support—including several Bank operations and IFC’s
Doing Business reform advisory services—contributed to some progress in
streamlining and improving business registration and cross-border trade procedures
over the period, although results varied by country. In Grenada in particular, Bank
project support for deploying ASYCUDA World and reforming customs procedures
paired effectively with IFC advisory work on trade logistics. The Bank also helped
strengthen other business services in the countries, but with unclear impact. The
Bank’s contribution to tourism development and sector linkages was largely in the
form of regional analytic work. In contrast, stakeholder perceptions of IFC advisory
work in tourism development in St. Lucia were very positive. Bank engagement
helped strengthen resilience and productivity of small farmers in Grenada. IFC
advisory services aimed at putting in place PPPs for St. Lucia’s WASCO, a
replacement hospital in Grenada, and a state insurance company in Antigua and
Barbuda were unsuccessful, despite reaching the tendering stage.

Finally, regarding infrastructure, achievement of Bank Group program objectives
was moderately unsatisfactory. In telecommunications, Bank support—
implementation of an investment project approved prior to the start of the
evaluation period and through a new regionally structured, horizontal adaptable
program lending project—tried to build on the success of support that started in
1998. This success had facilitated the creation of regulatory structures, including
ECTEL, and enormously affected access to, and quality and affordability of,
telecommunications services. Although there was progress, impact in two areas fell
short. The evolution and enhancement of the regulatory framework needed to keep
pace with a rapidly moving industry lagged, and work toward universal service
provision suffered major setbacks, though it laid a foundation for expansion of
information and telecommunications technology (ICT) connectivity. Ongoing Bank
support, notably for setting up Internet exchange points and business incubators
and for developing ICT skills, appears to be progressing satisfactorily, with delays in
some countries. In energy, the Bank Group program made substantive contributions
to improvements in Dominica’s regulatory framework over the initial part of the
period. Nevertheless, the central goal underlying Bank Group engagement—to

CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS
establish and begin operationalizing ECERA as a regulator, eventually serving all of
the OECS countries—has had serious setbacks. In the water sector, where Bank
Group support was focused on WASCO during the initial part of the evaluation
period, Bank financing and technical support helped implement key investments
and strengthen the legal and regulatory framework. However, improvements in
WASCO’s management and finances—critical to sustaining adequate operations and
maintenance in addition to investment—have remained elusive. Bank Group efforts,
with IFC as transaction adviser, to help introduce a PPP never progressed beyond
the tendering stage owing to a lack of political consensus within government.

 In the banking sector, the Uniform Banking Acts had been revised during 2004–06 in
relation to the Basel core principles. Following the crisis, additional actions were taken to
strengthen capital buffers, to move toward risk-based supervision, to expand the perimeter,
and to implement consolidated supervision. For nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs),
there was an initiative beginning in 2002 to establish a Single Regulatory Unit (SRU) in each
member state. Progress was uneven, but by 2011, all OECS countries except St. Vincent and
the Grenadines had passed the SRU legislation and all countries had established an SRU. In
2014, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union’s Monetary Council (the currency union’s top
policy-making body) established a core committee to create an Eastern Caribbean Financial
Services Regulatory Commission as the regional regulator and supervisor of the NBFIs.
There was also some progress in harmonizing insurance, money services, and credit union
acts and in developing prudential reporting guidelines and standards.

adequate planning and financial skills and payment culture of local entrepreneurs. In
addition, provision by the St. Lucia Development Bank of subsidized credit to a portion of

6The FY05 country economic memorandum defined skills as the leading issue in small
states, but also laid out a much broader competitiveness agenda under the rubric of
pursuing “greater openness, competition and a more level playing field in the domestic
economy.” Key elements involved steps to reduce barriers to trade and improve factor
mobility across member states; promote a “level playing field” and fair competition in
domestic markets; strengthen private sector capacity through education, standards, and
reward of innovation; and improve public service delivery (World Bank 2005).

While a case for focusing on business registration could be made on the grounds of
facilitating business formalization in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where
informal competition was identified as a major constraint, research shows that registration
reforms on their own have little long-term impact on formalization (Bruhn & Mckenzie
2013).

  As St. Lucia moves to establish a National Utilities Regulatory Commission, a multisector
regulator for both electricity and water, the National Water and Sewerage Commission
(NWSC) will cease to exist, leaving some uncertainty as how the new regulator will
function.
 The 2013 review by the NWSC led to tariff increases of 66.15 percent in water and 50.8
16

percent in sewerage.

  Government authorities in Dominica are reportedly satisfied with the way in which the
Independent Regulatory Commission (IRC) operates, while both the utility and the public
appreciate the presence of an independent arbiter. Experience with the IRC has motivated
several neighboring countries to set up similar utility regulators. However, the IRC
continues to be financed by government budget rather than through license fees and other
fees and levies as originally envisaged, which can potentially compromise its independence.
18
  In particular, those from countries with state-owned electricity utilities—Antigua and
Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines—showed limited interest
in relegating regulatory oversight to an independent regional entity.
19Although the ECERA concept enjoyed broad support from the stakeholders, expectations
differed considerably. Governments and the general public expected ECERA to bring about
lower electricity tariffs through energy sector liberalization; the utilities expected ECERA to
have true regulatory powers without political interference; and the Bank expected ECERA
to enhance the region’s capacity to think strategically, and design and implement
appropriate rules and regulations for the OECS energy sector’s long-term development.
While these goals are not incompatible per se, they were not fully reconciled before the
ECERA project was launched.

5. Learning and Recommendations
Conclusions
The World Bank Group’s program objectives for the Organisation of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) over the evaluation period were relevant, though with
caveats. Program objectives—both the pillars and the detailed results areas—were
relevant, especially within a single Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) period
without regard for its long-term engagement in the OECS. Two attributes could
have further strengthened relevance of objectives. The first is greater focus or
selectivity. This was true both for the pillars and the subpillars. Under the fiscal and
debt sustainability and public sector performance subpillar, for instance, the Bank
Group tried to help strengthen debt management, revenue policy and
administration, multiple facets of public expenditure management, public sector
performance—including Human Resources (HR) and civil service—management, e-
government service provision, and strategic planning and monitoring and
evaluation (M&E). While all were important, pursuing even one or two of them
would already have been a significant challenge. This is equally true of several other
subpillars. There were plausible reasons for Bank Group involvement in these
multiple areas, not least client demand, and involvement in several areas was
measured and involved limited resource outlays, with support primarily through
analytic and advisory activities (AAA) or trust fund grants. The second attribute
concerns greater consistency and continuity of objectives over time. A proviso here
is there may be natural stopping points with disaster risk management (DRM), and
crisis conditions may justify ramping up attention to certain areas, such as the
financial sector. In sum, pursuing fewer results areas with greater continuity could
have strengthened the relevance of objectives. While the strategic objectives in the
latest RPS (FY15–19) continue to have very broad reach, selectivity at the subpillar
level has increased. In addition, long-term consistency and continuity of certain
program objectives, such as those relating to social protection, are evident.

The design of the Bank Group program was also relevant; positive qualities included
good instrument blend and support for regional development solutions. In key areas
the Bank Group used an appropriately sequenced combination of instruments—
including upstream technical work and policy dialogue, lending, and partnerships—
to outstanding effect. Although the RPSs did not plan for contingent responses to
exogenous shocks affecting the countries, the Bank Group program maintained, or
was able promptly to find, the flexibility to respond effectively—with emergency
project lending to St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines following Hurricane

LEARNING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Tomas and with development policy lending to Grenada and St. Lucia following the
global crisis. Where a strong economic rationale existed, the Bank Group program
sought to encourage, and help realize, regional approaches and development
solutions. In some cases, this facilitated the mobilization of regional resources to
complement the four blend countries’ IDA allocations, and also helped create and
sustain a basis for engagement with the two IBRD-only countries, where willingness
and capacity to borrow from the Bank was more restricted.

Other positive qualities of program design included pursuit of partnerships and
attention to institutional capacity constraints. The Bank Group was effective in
seeking and capitalizing on opportunities for partnerships. These involved regional
organizations, bilateral and multilateral development partners, national and regional
nongovernmental institutions, and often a combination of several types of partners.
The program was also very effective—much more so than usual for the Bank—in
leveraging trust fund grant resources. In addition, the Bank Group program took
account of, and tried in several ways to address, the countries’ limited institutional
capacity. Several projects had a primary purpose of delivering technical assistance
and related support for strengthening capacity. Other investment projects had
significant capacity-building components, often aimed at vital functions, such as
support for permanent national emergency management offices. Trust fund grant
financing and a handful of advisory operations of the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) provided additional support for strengthening capacity. AAA was
similarly oriented toward capacity building. In the absence of a resident presence in
the OECS countries, the Bank also helped build and sustain implementation capacity
for its project portfolio in the active client countries and regional institutions, at least
on the fiduciary side.

The assessment also identified some deficiencies in the design of the Bank Group
program or of its components, including task proliferation and weak M&E. The
large number and wide diversity of strategic objectives in the subpillars induced a
focus on, and proliferation of, transactions (tasks), leading to program fragmentation
and associated climb in transactions costs. In interviews, some government
counterparts lamented what they perceived as an excessive focus on transactions by
the Bank Group. A related criticism was that the various strands of Bank Group
work sometimes appeared scattered and insufficiently integrated. Few, for instance,
came to see the complementarity among the Comprehensive Debt Framework-
related work on the links between growth and debt, the participatory,
accountability-oriented work on the constraints to private-sector-led growth under
the Caribbean Growth Forum, the Doing Business advisory work, and past Bank
diagnostics. Some projects, such as the Electronic Government for Regional
Integration Project (EGRIP), had an overly complex design, particularly with regard

to M&E, which necessitated restructuring and led to implementation delays. At the
same time, M&E—for instance, provisions for tracking even the most basic outcomes
that the Bank Group program was trying to impact—was insufficiently emphasized
in projects and other activities, despite the Bank’s cross-cutting efforts to help
strengthen data collection. For example, projects to address the human
immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome had too little
provision for monitoring the evolution of sexual behavior and condom use among
different age groups.

Shortcomings were also apparent in project cost estimates, understanding of
political-economy constraints, integration of Bank-IFC efforts, and capacity-
strengthening initiatives. Cost estimates under certain projects did not sufficiently
provide for constraints peculiar to the OECS clients’ remoteness and smallness.
EGRIP, for instance, encountered difficulties in finding prospective suppliers willing
to tender at close to the original cost-estimate parameters, leading to delays.
Infrastructure cost estimates under DRM projects ran into similar problems. In
certain cases, the Bank Group did not do sufficient work to gain in-depth
understanding and address political-economy constraints apt to affect delivery of its
support. Such cases include the Bank’s support for a New Public Management
initiative in Grenada and for early civil service reforms in Antigua and Barbuda;
Bank and IFC support for water sector performance improvements in St. Lucia; and
IFC support for the hospital public-private partnership in Grenada. Similar risks
materialized in regional programs, such as the ECERA project, leading to
implementation delays and a need to revisit design. Just as significantly, apart from
one very positive experience, integration of IFC and Bank programs was very
uneven and generally insufficient. Finally, while the emphasis on strengthening
institutional capacity in the countries and regional institutions was laudable, the
efforts were sometimes scattered, sporadic, or had overly ambitious objectives. In
some instances, notably under some of the DRM projects, allowances for building
capacity were insufficient to prevent bottlenecks in implementation and funding
absorption.

The extent to which the Bank Group program in the OECS achieved its relevant
objectives during the FY06–14 period is rated moderately satisfactory. In terms of
efficacy, few subpillars saw universally positive outcomes. While in a few areas the
Bank Group’s work warrants a best-practice label and was effective in attaining
objectives, in others, many targeted results were not met, and not many positive
results can be associated with its efforts. Nevertheless, under most subpillars, the
Bank Group was able to make at least some contribution toward positive outcomes.
Under the increasing resilience pillar, achievement of relevant objectives was
moderately satisfactory, and particularly favorable under aspects of disaster risk

           of well-chosen strategic objectives is more likely to get results. Sporadic
           engagement on a particular objective or results area, particularly in the face
           of lofty outcome targets and in difficult areas such as improving public
           sector HR management, is unlikely to be associated with lasting results. At
           the same time, wide dispersal of objectives and results areas is likely to come
           at the expense of results and impact. A limited number of objectives allows
           for deeper, more hands on engagement, particularly important in OECS
           countries given their limited institutional capacity. Selectivity also allows for
           the development and maintenance of a cluster of activities in a specific
           sector, larger project size to counter high transactions costs per dollar of
           assistance delivered, and dedicated staff who build country knowledge and
           relationships.
          Relevance of program design. For both national and regional projects, it is
           important to keep designs simple to allow for limited institutional capacity.
           Flexibility in project designs is also important. In small states, indivisibilities,
           remoteness, and limited private sector capacity can mean fewer, higher-cost
           bids than expected on project contracts. It is thus important to build
           flexibility in project designs to accommodate costs that significantly exceed
           initial estimates. Proper sequencing of Bank Group activities also aids
           effectiveness, and can make the difference between success and failure. In St.

    Lucia, IFC’s efforts to help build a market for small and medium enterprise
    finance were substantively unsuccessful, as fundamental constraints
    remained unaddressed. Finally, project design, including the underlying
    paradigm, needs to be consistent with the country and regional political
    economy backdrop.
   Operational arrangements. Project Coordination Units (PCUs) are important
    repositories of fiduciary capacity. Where the Bank Group does not have a
    resident presence, national-level PCUs can help protect portfolio quality and
    ensure cost-effectiveness better than implementation units for each project.
    They cannot, however, address capacity shortfalls in the technical ministries
    and agencies involved in project implementation. At the same time,
    incomplete integration of PCUs into regular government structures can raise
    issues concerning the sustainability of the associated capacity. Similar
    observations hold for capacity repositories at the regional level. Finally,
    particularly in the absence of resident Bank Group presence, it is desirable to
    minimize turnover of operational staff, especially task team leaders, during
    project preparation and implementation.
   Regional engagement. With respect to small states pursuing economic and
    political integration, a sound rationale—based on regional public goods,
    externalities, and scale economies—is necessary for regional Bank Group
    engagement, particularly regionally packaged financing. Crucial additional
    criteria include: Does the regional development solution underlying the
    Bank Group support adequately safeguard individual country interests? Are
    the costs associated with the regional solution reasonable? Is an adequately
    functioning national solution already in place? Despite the challenges
    involved, there can be the potential for transformational regional
    engagements. The CCRIF is successful precisely because its regional nature
    allows for risk pooling. But regional engagement also has limits.
    Infrastructure projects can often be best structured nationally, even in small
    states. Understandably, countries prefer to devote their national funding
    from the International Development Association to investments with local
    rather than regional benefits. National projects have better country
    ownership, which is important for infrastructure projects that will impose
    ongoing costs. Some functions make sense to undertake at a regional level,
    such as those requiring specialized expertise that may not be feasible to
    develop and maintain at the local level (e.g., hydrometeorology services or
    climate change expertise). In particular, regional procurement can yield
    significant benefits. Certain experiences in regional procurement, including
    some under Bank projects, have brought significant payoffs. The regional e-
    procurement in bulk of pharmaceuticals under the EGRIP-enabled platform

LEARNING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
         is generally thought to have been successful. In information and
         communications technology, the regional procurement under the Caribbean
         Regional Communications Infrastructure Program is similarly perceived as
         beneficial. Even where functions remain wholly national, there are often
         gains from cross-country knowledge, training, and capacity-building work.
        Political economy backdrop. A thorough understanding of the political
         economy around an area of prospective Bank Group support is essential. As
         demonstrated by the Bank Group involvement in St. Lucia’s water sector and
         in regional energy regulation, for both national and regional projects, it is
         important to gain an in-depth understanding of, and to internalize, political-
         economy risks in the design and implementation of Bank Group support.
         Thorough stakeholder consultations can help reduce such risks and make
         smooth project implementation more robust in the face of government and
         counterpart turnover or simple wavering of political commitment.
        Bank-IFC collaboration. Concerted World Bank-IFC support can have impact
         in addition to projecting a favorable image among stakeholders. Proper
         alignment of, and complementarity in, support can be effective in helping to
         bring about favorable results, as demonstrated by the experience with
         customs reform in Grenada. Although political economy complications
         ultimately made the collaboration unsuccessful, Bank-IFC “teaming up” to
         support reform in St. Lucia’s water sector also represented model alignment
         of efforts.
        Disaster risk management. It is important to use the political window of
         attention created by a disaster to advocate and support long-term risk
         reduction. Severe weather events in Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and
         the Grenadines helped make DRM a priority for them, enabling the Bank’s
         now-substantial portfolio. Given the historical waxing and waning of
         attention to DRM, the long-term challenge will be to ensure that approaches
         focusing on preparedness can be sustained as the memory of recent disasters
         fades, such as by raising awareness of the long-term trends from climate
         change. In DRM implementation, building the “soft” systems is more
         difficult than undertaking “hard” investments. Investments in works can
         reduce disaster risk, even at significant financial cost and with
         implementation constraints. Building softer systems, such as data collection
         and analytic capabilities, and ensure that they are tied to decision-making
         processes, is more challenging. It is thus important that project designs
         provide not just for the needed capacity-building work, but equally for
         initiatives to link data and analytics to end users in government, the private
         sector, civil society, and the public.

                                                          LEARNING AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendations
Several recommendations emerge from the findings of this regional program
evaluation. These are confined to actions that are within the purview of the Bank
Group country team for the OECS. Issues relating to the modalities for delivering
Bank Group support to small states will be discussed in a chapeau report of the
cluster country program evaluation. The recommendations have been developed
against the backdrop of the current (FY15–19) RPS, although they have general
validity.

       Given the breadth of the areas in which new Bank lending is envisioned,
        ensure that the underlying objectives of new lending operations are selective
        and specific even as they contribute to broader development objectives.
       Ensure simplicity of design in the new lending operations, avoiding
        proliferation of project components and counterparts, using well-reasoned
        but simple and parsimonious project M&E frameworks. In parallel, keep a
        sufficient margin of flexibility in project funding to accommodate cost
        variations.
       Continue to pursue opportunities to support cooperative OECS-wide
        development solutions, but only where the economic rationale and support
        among country stakeholders are strong. Where these cannot be assured, the
        FY15–19 RPS’s formula of national projects under regional frameworks
        offers a good fallback that can lower transactions costs while avoiding
        political economy pitfalls and supporting coordinated action in
        uncontroversial areas.
       Ensure that new projects include, or are accompanied by, sufficient provision
        to support the institutional capacity required to implement investments
        efficiently and sustainably, including support for national PCUs or regional
        executing agencies. Where support is through development policy financing,
        provide for parallel technical assistance to implement and sustain targeted
        reforms.
       In parallel with new lending—and facilitated by greater selectivity and
        continuity of program coverage—continue to work toward consolidating the
        portfolio of activities and ensuring complementarity among lending and
        nonlending activities, which can usefully be organized into clusters
        supported by dedicated staff.

Plan and pursue in-depth Bank-IFC collaboration in two or three specific areas—for
instance, related to competitiveness and the business climate, the financial sector, or
infrastructure—where the institutions’ complementarity and synergy in contributing
to development results can be showcased.
