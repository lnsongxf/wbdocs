  Box 1
                      Cambodia is on track to become a lower-middle income economy by 2015

The World Bank classifies economies based on their Gross National Income (GNI) per capita. GNI is the total value of goods and services
produced within a country (i.e., its GDP) plus the income received from other countries (notably from repatriation of profits and wages) less similar
payments made to other countries earned in the domestic economy. For example, if a Cambodian company operating in a foreign country sends
some of its profits back to Cambodia, this increases Cambodia’s GNI increases. GNI is considered to be the best single indicator of economic
capacity and progress, although it is recognized that GNI does not, by itself, measure welfare or success in development. GNI per capita is thus
the World Bank's main criterion for classifying countries into income groups.

For the period July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015, the World Bank has established a set of income group thresholds (Table B1.1). Low-income
economies are those with a GNI per capita (calculated using the Atlas Method) of US$1,045 or less in 2013; lower-middle-income economies are
those with a GNI per capita of more than US$1,045 but less than US$4,125; upper-middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of
more than US$4,125 but less than US$12,746; and high-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of US$12,746 or more. The per capita
income thresholds are updated the first of July every year to incorporate the effect of international inflation.


                                   Table B1.1 Gross National Income per capita thresholds for income
                                   group classification as of July 2014 (in constant US$ of 2013):

                                        $12,746 <                 high income

                                    Note: The thresholds are updated every July. For the latest thresholds see
                                    http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-and-lending-groups

As the thresholds remain constant over time in real terms, growth simulations need to be performed in constant 2013 US dollars. To
assess the income grouping that Cambodia could belong to in the future, its economic growth is projected in constant 2013 US dollars and the
resulting GNI per capita is compared with the thresholds presented in Table B3.1.

Cambodia’s economy is likely to reach lower-middle income status in 2015, and this would be officially recorded in July 2016. At the
forecast GDP growth in constant terms of 6.9 percent in 2015, and annual population growth of 1.2 percent, Cambodia will likely reach a GNI
per capita of US$1,096 (measured in constant 2013 US$) in 2015, which exceeds the US$1,045 threshold (Tables B1.1 and B1.2). As the World
Bank updates income grouping membership in July, Cambodia’s lower-middle income status would likely be officially recorded in July 2016.

                     Note: Estimation is based on a Gross National Income of $950 in 2013. Forecasted GDP growth is taken as a
                     proxy for GNI growth. Annual population growth is assumed to be 1% per annum from 2015 onwards.

At the baseline growth scenario of 6.9 percent annual real GDP growth, Cambodia would reach upper-middle income status by 2039.
Reaching high-income status by 2050 would require a real GDP growth rate of 9 percent (Table B1.2), which is equivalent to an 8 percent per
capita income growth rate. Judging from countries’ past growth experiences since 1950, maintaining such growth rate would require an
extraordinary effort. The fastest growing countries over two decades reached average annual per capita income growth rates of 8.9 percent (China)
and 6.1 percent (Armenia). However, attaining upper-middle income status before 2050 is well within reach if GDP growth exceeds the low case
scenario of 4.9 percent. Under the baseline of 6.9 percent GDP growth, Cambodia would reach it already by 2039.

continues to grow but at a slower pace, while
there has also been diversification in export
destinations (Figure 2). The sector continues to
attract additional investments although the labor
unrest that the sector experienced in the past has

fulfilling orders, leading to a number of major
brands diversifying their orders with other low
wage competitors. In addition, there are some
export destination diversification successes. In                              Source: Cambodian authorities

policy tightening has also contributed to subdued
inflation. Food price risks related to El Niño

27.     In the 2015 budget, budgeted revenue
can be further improved. A conservatively
budgeted revenue target, together with a declining
grants component, gives rise to an overall deficit
(including grants) forecast at 3.8 percent of GDP
in 2015, compared with 2.5 percent of GDP
estimated for 2014 (Figure 16). The domestic
revenue budgeted for the 2015 fiscal year, at 15.9
percent of GDP, appears conservative and slightly
below the estimated collection of 16.1 percent of
GDP in 2014. It is, however, higher than the 15.5

the recent past. Consumption in the bottom 40
percent of the consumption distribution grew at
an average annual rate of 7 percent during 2007-
12, almost double the 3.6 percent rate for the total
population. This was mainly the result of a
dynamic agricultural sector. Inequality has
declined significantly, with the Gini coefficient
falling from 32 in 2008 to 28 in 2012.
Nonetheless, the progress in equality has slowed
in the past few years. Poverty in Cambodia under
the U$ 1.25 PPP a day measure (which allows for
international comparisons) was 6.0 percent in
2012 (See Box 5 for more detail).

33.     In the next few years, rural poverty is
likely to decline at a slower rate than in the
past. In rural areas, further poverty reduction will
be made more challenging due to slow crop yield
improvement        and     reduced     international
agricultural commodity prices.

34.    As in recent years, it is likely that
inequality will decrease at a slower pace in
Cambodia in the near term. The projected
sources of economic growth in the short to
medium term, mainly the construction, garment
and tourism sectors, are unlikely to favor the poor
disproportionately.

short and long run. Although the country has
seen major improvements in terms of coverage,
low education attainment and malnutrition are
more prevalent among the poor population.
Despite Cambodia’s remarkable progress in
poverty reduction, most households that have
escaped poverty have done so only by a small
margin and remain ‘near-poor’, leaving them
highly vulnerable. Recent initiatives with the
introduction and funding of health equity and
retirement funds are steps in the right direction.
However, a better understanding of the coping
mechanisms available for vulnerable households
and their effectiveness would help to mitigate the
risk of them falling back into poverty.

Meanwhile, the rapidly rising wage bill will

investment to strengthen the agriculture and
tourism sectors, as well as to support overall
structural reforms discussed earlier, requires
enhanced efficiency in public spending and
additional financial resources. It will therefore be
important to continue improving domestic
revenue collection by further broadening the tax
base and strengthening tax administration.
Improvements in revenue collection continue to
be made almost continuously and, therefore, it is

administration and good governance. While the

Selected Issue –Dollarization Issue: Advantages, Disadvantages and Ways
Forward

            1.     Motivation
The objective of this selected issue on “Dollarization Issue: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Ways Forward”
is to provide some views and lessons learned to support current efforts being made by the RGC to strengthen
the use of the local currency, the Cambodian riel.

            2.     Brief background
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cambodia resorted to domestic bank financing to finance its fiscal
deficits, which resulted in hyperinflation.17 This appeared to encourage the use of other currencies such
as the US dollar (and to a lesser extent the Thai baht) to substitute the local currency.

                                                                               US dollar substitution for the Cambodian riel

                                                                               percent (US$30.7 million) at the end of 1993 to 63

                                                                               into the secondary currency over a period of just three
                                                                               years.19

                                                       The widespread use of US dollars by a country’s
residents is a phenomenon called dollarization. Since 2007, the share of foreign currencies in broad
money has reached around 80 percent and the economy has become dollarized (Figure S1-1). The share of
US dollar deposits in total deposits has fluctuated between 92 percent and 98 percent during the past two
decades. By December 2014, US dollar deposits reached almost US$8.6 billion, more than half the size of
the economy. The total value of US dollars in circulation, however, remains unknown. Various domestic and
external factors determine the relative strengths of the costs and benefits of dollarization, as discussed below.

            3.     Advantages
The economy has achieved an impressive performance during the past two decades. This has led
some to believe that dollarization in Cambodia has been a blessing, underpinning macroeconomic stability
and growth, although such a hypothesis remains to be studied. A number of major advantages of dollarization
are as follows:

First, dollarization is known to constrain cash-strapped governments from resorting to domestic
financing, a major cause of spiral inflation in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Cambodia.
Dollarization, together with exchange rate targeting—pegging of the riel to the dollar—is considered to have
anchored price levels. In a context of dollarization and a pegged riel to the US dollar, people think in terms
of dollars, and prices in the domestic currency are indexed to the exchange rate; e.g., the price of local
products tends to rise like the price of imported products when the riel depreciates (Im and Dabadie, 2007).20
Therefore, a stable riel versus US dollar exchange change rate supports stable prices.

Second, during times of external shocks when there is a US dollar shortage, the total value of US
dollars in circulation can help finance current account deficits, a role often played by foreign
reserves. For instance, this contributed to Cambodia coming out relatively unscathed from the 1997 East-
Asian Financial Crisis.21

                                                                                is most beneficial to a small open economy, like

                                                                                dollarization attracts capital inflows and facilitates

economy remains highly dollarized which imposes limitations on monetary policy. The RS, therefore,
opts for the continuation of a managed float exchange rate regime to maintain stability of the riel, while
strengthening public and investor confidence in the local currency to promote its greater use and reduce the
high level of dollarization.24 The 2014-18 National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) of the RGC also
calls for a greater control over the economy, especially monetary policy, and concludes that de-dollarization
should be the first step toward this.25 Specifically, the NSDP advocates the utilization of riel-denominated


20 Tal Nay Im and Michel Dabadie 2007, Dollarization in Cambodia. Prices of most goods (and services) in Cambodia are indexed by suppliers to riel versus US
dollar exchange rate (and to riel versus Thai baht exchange rate as well). For instance, a dozen of locally produced oranges cost CR 10,000 when the riel versus
dollar exchange rate is CR 4,000; this means the dozen of oranges cost US$2.5. If riel depreciates to CR 4,100 per US dollar, the same will cost CR 10,250 (the
cost likely reaches CR 10,300 as Cambodia does not circulate riel 50 bank note anymore); and this is equivalent to US$2.51, a full exchange rate “pass-through” to
prices.
21 During the crisis, Cambodia did not experience any major devaluation while Thai Baht lost 54 percent of its value against US dollar between June 1997 and

January 1998. Cambodia’s real growth rate was 4 and 5 percent in 1997 and 1998, respectively (followed by double-digit growth for the subsequent two years in a
row) while Thailand’s growth contracted by 2.8 percent and 7.6 percent in 1997 and 1998, respectively.

27 In general, current account deficits driven by trade deficits which are caused by high demand for capital goods and raw material imports needed to develop
production sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing sectors during the early stage of economic developments are appropriate. However, persistent current
deficits driven by sustained high import demand that is fueled largely by domestic consumption including less productive investments in some sectors such as
construction, land, and real estate in a speculative nature actually increase vulnerability to external shocks.

29 For Cambodia, garment exports account for 75 percent of total exports.
30 A survey reportedly discussed in a 2006 US treasury report revealed that Cambodia was holding US$2 billion in cash or 0.7 percent of the total US$281.7 billion

bills classified as “foreign holdings of US currency”, while during the period 1994-2010, US Federal Reserve’s seigniorage earnings is US$289 billion (Feige, 2011).
Let’s conservatively assume that Cambodia continued to hold only 0.7 percent of the total US dollar cash abroad i n 2010; this implies that seigniorage loss for
Cambodia is about US$2.023 billion (US$289 x 0.7%) as of 2010.

Third, dollarization and exchange targeting may not anchor price levels as well as one might expect.
Cambodia’s inflation is almost as volatile as that of Vietnam (Figure S1.4), and it is not much better than
regional peers. In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, Cambodia’s inflation skyrocketed due largely
to “imported” inflation caused by world food and petroleum price shocks. This happened because
dollarization facilitates (with freely circulated US dollars and riel) full “pass-through” of prices of imported
goods denominated in US dollar to prices of domestically produced goods denominated in riel. This is
because domestic producers hedged to maintain not only US dollar equivalent value of their goods but also
the purchasing power received from selling their goods. In this regard, domestic producers effectively
“index” prices of their domestically produced goods to prices of imported goods, and increase prices of their
goods when imported goods become more expensive, although the riel versus US dollar exchange rate
remains stable.

                                 Cambodia inflation is almost as volatile
                                                                                    Fourth, the key feature of dollarization is a fixed

     Source: Cambodian authorities                   In the early stages of development of the banking
                                                     sector, with its newly established monetary
authorities, human resources capacity and a regulatory framework to manage monetary policy in
Cambodia were weak. Therefore, at that time, the benefits of dollarization outweighed the costs.
Dollarization helped to avoid the hyperinflation and supported the earlier structure of international trade in
which the US was the main export market for Cambodia’s narrowly based export products, namely garments.
As Cambodia’s export products and destinations have become more diversified, dollarization has led to
reduced competitiveness.

But the constraints imposed by dollarization are becoming particularly apparent for the
management of Cambodia’s rapidly expanding banking and financial sector. It is therefore
important to restore the central bank’s ability to serve as lender of last resort in the case of a sudden
large shock. The ratio of gross international reserves to private sector deposits reached its record low of 53
percent in December 2014, down from 103 percent in December 2005, reducing the central bank’s capacity
to stabilize the banking system when facing a financial crisis. Other countries also seek to limit the extent of
dollarization, owing to its potentially adverse effects on macroeconomic policy and financial stability
(Kokenyne, Ley, and Veyrune, 2010).
33 In dollarized economies, local authorities are likely to peg their local currencies to the US dollar because: (i) if they devalue their local currencies, their economies
could become fully dollarized; (ii) if they overvalue their currencies, they could be running down their international reserves.
34 Kang (2003) argues that currently, most goods are produced (and imported) and sold (and exported with their prices expressed in US dollars. Under the situation

that more than 70 percent of all transactions use the US dollar, the exchange rate (riel versus US dollar) seems to lose most of its original meaning.

“Once dollarization takes hold, economic agents are reluctant to switch back into using the local
currency, because they lack confidence and the cost of redenominating transactions is high until a
consensus is reached among market participants to use the local currency.” (Kokenyne, Ley, and
Veyrune, 2010). In addition, Cambodia’s exceptional economic performance and investors’ confidence
actually drive dollarization, instead of decreasing it, as the country attracts large capital inflows (Menon, 2008;
and Duma, 2011). A weak correlation between deposit dollarization (and credit dollarization) with the
nominal riel versus US dollar exchange rate also helps to confirm this.36 This implies that dollarization in
Cambodia is likely to stay unless addressed.

Developing a roadmap to increase the use of riel, as currently planned by the authorities, is a positive
step. First, determining: (i) what monetary framework—inflation targeting or exchange targeting (pursuing
a basket of currencies to anchor expectations while minimizing volatility for the tradable sector)—is the most
appropriate; and (ii) how to promote confidence in such a framework. Second, further enhance the capacity
to run proper monetary policy. Third, learning from the experience of a number of successful countries.37
See Table S1-2 for a summary of key macroeconomic settings that promote de-dollarization.38 Prudential
measures, developing domestic currency capital markets together with foreign exchange markets, and
exchange rate appreciation promote de-dollarization.39 The implicit guarantee of a stable exchange rate may
instead reinforce dollarization by encouraging borrowing in US dollars.

36 There are two types of dollarization: (i) deposit dollarization measured by US dollar deposit as a share of the total deposit; and (ii) credit dollarization measured
by US dollar credit as a share of total credit. All other things being equal, depreciation of the riel increases the attractiveness of the US dollar and leads to increased
dollarization and vice versa. Correlation between deposit dollarization and credit dollarization with the nominal exchange rate of only 0.47 and 0.24, respectively
implies the nominal exchange rate changes (appreciate or depreciate) only weakly affect (decrease or increase) deposit and credit dollarization.
