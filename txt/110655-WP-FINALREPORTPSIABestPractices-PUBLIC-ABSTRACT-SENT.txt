                                Chapter 1: Overview
                                Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) is an analytical approach used to
                                assess the distributional and social impacts of policy reforms on various stake-
                                holder groups. PSIA can ensure that decision makers have a strong analytical and
                                evidence-based foundation as they make a policy choice, especially if conducted
                                before or during the reform process.1 The PSIA approach was formally launched
                                in 2002 to fill and identify gaps in the analysis of policy reforms supported by the
                                World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Originating in support of De-
                                velopment Policy Financing (DPF),2 currently PSIAs are conducted in a number of
                                contexts, ranging from the design of Bank operations to the design of country
                                policies or programs not financed by the Bank.

                                Specifically, PSIAs aim to support and improve the design of policies and pro-
                                grams. They (a) provide empirical evidence on the poverty, social, and distribu-
                                tional effects of reforms; (b) suggest changes to the proposed policy, including
                                ways to mitigate any adverse impacts; and (c) identify alternative policy options to
                                improve poverty reduction and distributional outcomes. In doing so, PSIAs en-
                                hance aid and policy effectiveness and contribute to national dialogue and in-
                                creased transparency surrounding policy reforms.

                                The PSIA Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) was established in 2010 with contri-
                                butions from Norway, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and
                                Switzerland, and it is coming to a close in September 2016.3 In the six years of
                                its existence, the PSIA MDTF has funded more than 200 grants in over 80 coun-
                                tries across the globe.4 PSIA outputs have taken different forms such as technical
                                assistance, policy notes, inputs into larger pieces of analytical work, or stand-
                                alone products. The analytical work is usually closely linked to the ongoing policy
                                dialogue and complemented by a range of activities that aim to build partner-
                                ships, enhance national capacity, and raise awareness.

                                 	 The term “policy reform” is used broadly to describe changes of policies, programs and/or government
                                   interventions. These changes may or may not be included in laws or regulations. PSIA considers both the
                                   design and the implementation of these reforms.

                                 	 Given the versatility of PSIA, it is difficult to assess the entire universe of PSIA-type analysis that has been
                                   conducted at the World Bank. It is worth noting that a large number of PSIAs not funded by the MDTF have
                                   been conducted both before 2010 and during the MDTF period (2010–16).



10   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
As part of the MDTF’s commitment to share knowledge in this area, the MDTF Secretariat embarked
on a systematic review of PSIA outputs to learn from the diverse experiences of operational teams
and counterparts that received support under the MDTF. Experiences from the ground show that PSIA
products can contribute to shifting the policy dialogue in support of more evidence-based, inclusive re-
forms. Yet, the complexity and multifaceted nature of these engagements make it sometimes difficult to
capture their tangible contributions to the policy process. The publication at hand consolidates the wealth
of information gathered during this exercise, encompassing the many learning and dissemination activities
undertaken to get a better sense of the value of this type of work for policy making.

The goal was to identify innovative and successful practices and to share their insights and lessons
with PSIA practitioners and the broader policy community. For the purposes of this report, we define
“innovative” PSIAs as those that fill critical knowledge gaps and whose approaches address shortcomings
of existing tools and methods in their respective thematic areas. Further, we consider an innovative PSIA
to have been “successful” if the engagement (a) improved local stakeholders’ institutional or technical
capacity to generate and use evidence for policy reforms; or (b) informed the policy dialogue, either
through uptake of recommendations by client country counterparts or by influencing Bank operations in a
given field.

This publication is based on a systematic desk review, followed by interviews with task team leaders
(TTLs) of short-listed PSIA.5 The team reviewed output and monitoring documents for a total of 113 PSIAs
that have been completed between 2010 and 2015 (and were supported under the MDTF).6 For a selec-
tion of 45 PSIAs, additional inputs from TTLs were requested, either through interviews or via email. The
overarching question guiding this exercise was, what lessons can be learned from PSIAs with good-prac-
tices PSIAs that have informed the policy dialogue in their respective thematic areas?

To account for the complexity of PSIA, the review covered both (a) the scope and depth of analysis,
and (b) its policy relevance and engagement. We looked in depth at the policy and programmatic con-
text; the distributional impacts (who is affected, why, and how); and the PSIA recommendations.7 The case
studies also explore actions to follow up on PSIA recommendations, thus increasing understanding of how
these PSIAs have, or are expected to, contribute to policies and Bank operational lending as well as capac-
ity building.8

The report provides a substantive overview of PSIA activities and links with existing resources and
toolkits that provide guidance for practitioners and policy makers. It provides an overview on innova-
tions and good practices in the following 10 thematic areas: fiscal policy, subsidy reform, social protection,
labor markets, education, health, water, energy, transport, and agriculture.9 Each of those chapters consists
of (a) an overview section that presents broader issues and sector- or theme-specific trends; (b) a summary
of salient tools and methods used in conducting PSIAs in the respective areas; and (c) a selection of case
studies that showcase good practices from different regions. The report concludes with a “Final Remarks”
chapter that summarizes the main lessons and identifies areas of interest and emerging approaches that
should be strengthened in the future.

The PSIAs featured here cover only a subset of the broad range of sectors and topics represented
among all MDTF-funded PSIAs.10 Notably, many PSIAs are cross-sectoral and touch upon issues that are
connected to more than one chapter. They also represent substantial diversity in terms of “product types”

        and the way PSIAs are embedded in Bank operations. For instance, some PSIA fed into Economic and
        Sector Work (ESW),11 improving their pro-poor focus and incorporating specific policy recommendations.
        (Examples include PSIAs on freight transportation reforms in Pakistan [chapter 10] and on investment pri-
        oritization in agricultural development in Nicaragua [chapter 11, Box 11.2]). Others have, at different de-
        sign stages, informed one or more DPF components. The PSIAs presented here have also helped to ad-
        dress poverty and social exclusion in the context of technical assistance (TA) projects or have contributed
        to global and regional knowledge products.12

        Complementing existing literature on the subject, the report is expected to increase awareness on
        the value of PSIA in policy-making processes and to be a key resource for TTLs and other interested
        stakeholders in conducting PSIAs.13 Specifically, its objective is to showcase how successful PSIAs have
        supported the identification of policy impacts and mitigation measures in varying contexts, sectors, and
        thematic areas. The report examines how, where, when, and why PSIAs have been used; what their out-
        comes have been; and the lessons learned.


        METHODOLOGY
        PSIAs use a diverse and wide range of methods and integrate cutting-edge poverty analysis with
        various forms of social analysis. Innovations in PSIA have taken various forms, such as new tools for data
        collection and analysis, the integration of existing methods and frameworks to address a policy issue, and
        the application of well-established approaches to new fields and policy instruments. Although many in-
        novations presented in this report are driven by new technologies and the availability of more and better
        data (for example, geospatial data in health and agriculture), there are also examples where innovative
        approaches are developed as a response to poor data.

        Many innovative studies have supported and have benefited from the transfer of technical knowl-
        edge, both within and across regions. Moreover, standardization and harmonization of certain research
        instruments have become an important part of the PSIA agenda. This applies to multicountry studies (such
        as the Commitment to Equity [CEQ] assessments and the Subsidy Simulation Stata Package [SUBSIM] ap-
        plications in the Middle East and North Africa region)14 that allow for international and intertemporal com-
        parison, as well as to national efforts to standardize and integrate monitoring and evaluations systems
        (such as the PSIA of the fisheries sector in Mozambique, discussed in chapter 11, Box 11.1).

        The choice of methods in PSIA is driven by (a) the question being studied; (b) data availability; and (c)
        time, capacity, and resources. Whether a (primarily) quantitative or a (primarily) qualitative research de-
        sign is adequate depends on these factors.15 The use of certain methodologies varies across sectors, given
        different research angles. For instance, PSIA of fiscal policies is overwhelmingly quantitative because it
        focuses on vertical inequalities (that is, welfare implications along the income distribution). In other areas,
        such as social protection and health, the emphasis on horizontal inequalities is more common (that is,
        group- or identity-based disadvantages), often requiring qualitative data to identify vulnerable groups and
        understand the underlying dynamics of exclusion. Another aspect is the nature of outcomes the PSIA is
        trying to assess. Qualitative data on subjective outcomes (such as “life satisfaction” or “feeling treated
        with respect”) contrast with quantitative data on objective outcomes (such as income or literacy scores).

12   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
Additionally, ownership and in-country capacity to generate and use PSIA are important consider-
ations in the choice of tools and methods. There is a potential trade-off between (a) the level of sophis-
tication of certain methods, and (b) the methods’ accessibility and feasibility given existing capacity, re-
source, and time constraints. PSIA teams have addressed this trade-off in different ways, depending on the
client’s needs and local circumstances. Innovative models such as SUBSIM helped Bank teams in various
countries in the Middle East and North Africa region to produce robust simulations of subsidy reforms
under tight budgets and timelines. On the other hand, to ensure local ownership in Cameroon and Sierra
Leone, the PSIA teams developed a subsidy simulation model that took into account the client’s existing
technical capacity.

Mixed-methods studies have been common among MDTF-funded PSIAs. The methods highlighted
throughout this report are diverse—including both experimental designs (such as the discrete choice ex-
periment in Senegal, discussed in chapter 7) and quasi-experimental designs (such as the assessment of
rural roads development in India, discussed in chapter 10). Good practices have successfully integrated
different methodologies (either sequentially or concurrently), including the following design strategies:

•	 Exploratory design, which uses qualitative data to explore relevant issues to design a survey or a new
   instrument.

•	 Explanatory design, in which qualitative results help to explain and interpret the findings of a quantita-
   tive study.

•	 Triangulation, which uses qualitative and quantitative data in a complementary manner to confirm or
   cross-validate findings.

•	 Nested design, in which a study is guided by either a qualitative or a quantitative research design but
   embeds the other method to address a particular aspect.

A PSIA in Bhutan that explored a new research area (culture in sustainable development) had to re-
fine multiple quantitative and qualitative methods on a trial-and-error basis. Given the lack of referen-
tial studies and the scope of the Bhutan study, the team used both exploratory and explanatory strategies
and put together a comprehensive upstream assessment of a proposed bill on cultural heritage (chapter
5, Box 5.1).

A recurring theme in the spectrum of qualitative methods has been to solicit perceptions of benefi-
ciaries and other stakeholders. Researchers acknowledge their importance for the analysis of processes
of exclusion and inclusion. Additionally, many methods to inquire about subjective views (such as focus
group discussions or stakeholder workshops) play an important role in raising awareness about policy is-
sues and thereby propel the national dialogue around reforms. Given that awareness of existing policies
or reform proposals is often strikingly low, such methods are particularly important. For example, in the
water and energy sectors, information asymmetries can contribute to increased cost for consumers. In
Ukraine, engaging with stakeholders through interviews, focus groups, and workshops was crucial to iden-
tify demand-side constraints in the water sector. Understanding consumer attitudes helped to design an
effective awareness campaign as well as to improve accountability of service providers (chapter 8).

        PROVIDING POLICY MAKERS WITH EVIDENCE
        The featured PSIAs helped policy makers to be more informed about the trade-offs they face when
        designing and implementing policy reforms. The value of PSIA precisely consists in providing evidence
        to quantify and rationalize these trade-offs, which are otherwise difficult to grasp. For instance, short- and
        long-term effects need to be balanced in a sensible way. An example is the adoption of renewable tech-
        nologies, whose overall positive impact in the long run (especially by reducing climate-change-related
        costs) may cause energy prices to rise in the short to medium term.

        Analyses of fiscal policies, presented in this report, offer insights into the relative importance of dif-
        ferent revenue and spending categories regarding their distributional and budget impacts. For in-
        stance, in Indonesia, a striking 23 percent of public spending goes toward energy subsidies. These are
        important for the poor, but it is the affluent population groups who benefit the most in absolute terms.16
        A broader look at the fiscal system suggests an enormous potential to raise, reallocate, and spend fiscal
        resources more effectively from an equity point of view. PSIA strengthens the narrative in favor of such
        complex reforms that help to free fiscal resources for more pro-poor policies.

        While PSIAs are usually conducted ex ante to inform policy design or implementation, it is worth not-
        ing that it is state of the art to incorporate lessons from previous interventions. It is fairly common that
        PSIAs have elements of both ex ante and ex post evaluation, given that they are conducted in the midst of
        a larger reform process. In some countries, the MDTF supported more than one PSIA to follow up on pre-
        vious work and accompany long-term sectoral reforms. (See, for instance, the discussions of PSIAs in chap-
        ter 3 on Cameroon and in chapter 4 on Fiji.)

        Findings from numerous PSIAs suggest that designing policies that reach the poorest and most vul-
        nerable groups is particularly challenging, given that they often face multiple deprivations that are
        perpetuated by social norms and a general lack of voice and empowerment. Although PSIA is usually
        portrayed as an approach primarily intended to identify and mitigate adverse impacts, the experiences
        presented here suggest that, in fact, PSIAs commonly help to identify opportunities that either leverage
        the positive impacts or improve the efficiency of a given policy. For instance, a PSIA in India found that the
        public investments in rural roads had limited benefits for rural women (chapter 10). Although men were
        more likely to travel to other areas, women benefited indirectly through the auxiliary demand created for
        local goods and services. This has implications for small-business or agribusiness policies and labor market
        opportunities. Breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and social exclusion often requires integrated policy
        interventions in various sectors and on different levels. A good example in this regard is the PSIA on youth
        inclusion in Tunisia that, instead of using a narrow “job lens,” opted for a holistic approach that spans the
        areas of (a) participation and active citizenship, (b) access to economic opportunities, and (c) youth-friendly
        services at the local level (chapter 5).

        Even pro-poor reforms that are targeted toward underserved communities tend to have potential for in-
        creasing effectiveness and efficiency through complementary policy measures. A discrete choice experi-
        ment (DCE) in Senegal estimated the impact of various factors on women’s probability of delivering their
        babies in a health facility (chapter 7). Given that indirect costs associated with maternal health services
        pose a significant barrier, the government started piloting a maternal health conditional cash transfer
        (CCT) program as a result of this PSIA. In Albania, a PSIA demonstrates that good poverty targeting re-
        quires in-depth knowledge about the use of public services and the realities on the ground (chapter 4). The
        study assesses the allocation mechanisms of disability benefits and suggests policy changes to address
        existing inconsistencies and improve targeting accuracy.

INFORMING OPERATIONS AND POLICY REFORMS
There are good examples of PSIA that have substantially influenced the policy dialogue and thereby
changed the course of reforms. Yet, it is generally difficult to attribute follow-up actions to the PSIA work
itself because numerous factors influence the policy-making process. Moreover, in many cases the success-
ful implementation of PSIA recommendations can only be verified in the medium or long term. The nature
of the relationship between research and policy making has been a long-standing topic of investigation for
social scientists. While there is a rich literature on this topic, no single explanatory model can possibly do
justice to the complex policy environments, institutional structures, and political arrangements that influ-
ence decision-making processes.17 Although some generic lists of success factors are certainly useful,18 it
is important to bear in mind that PSIA is a realist approach that assumes that context really does make a
difference to program outcomes.

Despite the difficulty of establishing causative correlations between PSIA and policy reform, a few
lessons can be learned from the successful engagements included in this report:

•	 Increasing public awareness has in many cases ensured the government’s buy-in or shifted the national
   policy dialogue by amplifying the voices of stakeholders outside government. It goes almost without
   saying that the effective communication of PSIA results is crucial in this process. As has been empha-
   sized elsewhere (see appendix I), this review reaffirms that a communication strategy with dissemination
   and learning activities should be considered an integral part of the PSIA process.

•	 Close cooperation and partnerships with key stakeholders may prove instrumental in the success of the
   Bank’s engagement. Support for more inclusive, evidence-based policies requires both tapping into lo-
   cal expertise and enabling local champions—within or outside government—to participate more effec-
   tively in the policy-making process.

•	 Uptake of PSIA recommendations and continuation of policy discussions by World Bank country teams
   is very important, given that reform processes tend to be slow and require assistance over extended
   periods. Thus, linking policy recommendations to follow-up operations—including technical assistance,
   lending, and investment activities—may be necessary to advance the dialogue on difficult issues.

The PSIA on cashew policies in Guinea-Bissau illustrates how these various dimensions come together
and ultimately succeeded in influencing government policy. First, extended policy discussions with
various stakeholders generated a debate within government. Second, wide news coverage and public
awareness were crucial in building the momentum to move forward with the reforms. Third, PSIA findings
were incorporated in the Bank’s country program, and several operations from the Bank and other donors
followed up on issues raised by the PSIA (chapter 11).

In Fiji, two consecutive PSIA assessed — ex ante and ex post — the country’s social protection poli-
cies. The scope and depth of this analysis and the close collaboration with counterparts ensured the gov-
ernment’s endorsement of the recommendations made by the PSIA teams, with the suggested policy
changes to be implemented with follow-up assistance from the Bank (chapter 4).

The success of specific PSIA is, to a certain degree, influenced by factors that are beyond the control
of research or government teams. For instance, political instability has been an issue for PSIAs conduct-

17
  	 In the field of international development—where research is driven by the aim to influence policy—it has been claimed that cutting-edge
    knowledge is underused by decision makers or that research neglects the concerns of the poor in a top-down fashion. Several development
    organizations have programs that aim to understand the factors that determine the use of evidence in policy making: see, for instance,
    Jones (2011) and the website of the Research and Policy in Development (RAPID) program at the Overseas Development Institute(https://
    www.odi.org/programmes/rapid/).
18
  	 A World Bank report that reviews the link between PSIA and policy and planning processes in partner countries finds that the more-influen-
    tial PSIAs are associated with the following factors: alignment with the national policy calendar, operational relevance and usability, high-
    level champions on the government side, and local advocates in Bank or development partner offices at the country level (World Bank
    2009).

        ed in Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a PSIA was conducted in
        a fragile and conflict-affected environment and had to deal with political sensitivities, insecurity, and the
        high mobility of survey participants (chapter 11). Yet, as these experiences reveal, it is critical to find ade-
        quate responses to address these risks and help policy makers to navigate through often difficult reform
        processes.

        This report has placed special emphasis on the context in which the analytical work was conducted.
        This includes the local political landscape, ongoing policy discussions, and existing engagements with the
        World Bank and other development partners. Several cases illustrate and underline that the choice of
        methods, the scope of analysis, and the definition of complementary and follow-up activities all require
        careful consideration of contextual factors. A critical aspect in this regard is the configuration of stake-
        holder interests, often referred to as the “political economy” of reforms.

        Ultimately, all reforms have winners and losers, and policy makers have to balance competing inter-
        ests, notwithstanding the reform’s technical plausibility and expected results. It is not unusual that
        reform efforts result in protests, social unrest, or even governments stepping down. For instance, phasing
        out consumer subsidies is a particularly delicate issue. There are plenty of examples where subsidy reforms
        have been stalled or reversed because of political pressures. Therefore, systematic assessments of political
        economy risks and consultations with stakeholders are indispensable elements of PSIA. For instance, in
        Cameroon the World Bank team commissioned a series of interviews and focus groups to identify key
        stakeholders and assess the population’s level of awareness of price subsidies as well as potential reactions
        to policy reform (chapter 3). One of the findings was that the population in anglophone areas was more
        sensitive to the subject—with a higher potential for social unrest. This was related to their strong sense of
        ethnic and regional exclusion due to historical grievances toward francophone areas.


        STREGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS AND LOCAL CAPACITY
        The PSIA agenda is ultimately about strengthening and disseminating tools, processes, and institu-
        tions that promote evidence-based and inclusive policies. For instance, improved data collection and
        better monitoring and evaluation systems support policy makers, development partners, and stakeholders
        from civil society in their efforts to work toward greater equity and more inclusive and sustainable develop-
        ment. In the context of the MDTF, efforts to foster PSIA capacity have covered formal and informal techni-
        cal training, standardization of data collection, and support of organizational development and participa-
        tory decision making. An example is the multicountry engagement to implement the CEQ approach, a
        diagnostic tool for distributional analysis of fiscal policies (chapter 2, Box 2.1).

        The country studies had a special emphasis on capacity building. With the support of the MDTF, techni-
        cal workshops were conducted in Armenia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Jordan, and South Africa between January
        and June 2014. In addition to technical training, in-country workshops were used to present preliminary
        findings of the analysis and to solicit government and stakeholder feedback on the results. Moreover, in all
        cases the teams undertaking the analysis included local counterparts who work in think tanks, universities,
        or on country office staffs previously unfamiliar with incidence analysis.19

        Improved capacity to incorporate evidence into policy making can also result from better collabora-
        tion and information flows among stakeholders. Effective collaboration makes new partnerships (both
        nationally and with international actors) an integral part of capacity building. PSIA teams have highlighted
        the fact that local knowledge and experience is not adequately used by policy makers. For instance, in
        Bhutan, the PSIA brought together key government agencies that used to work in isolation. This resulted
        in improved coordination and facilitated the design and subsequent implementation of an integrated ap-
        proach to cultural assets management (chapter 5, Box 5.1). This of course, underscores the importance of

        19
          	 The final independent evaluation of the PSIA MDTF found that in-country stakeholders considered informal on-the-job training to be the
            most valuable and effective way to build local technical capacity (World Bank 2016a).

careful attention to the local political economy in effective capacity building and collaboration. Technical
trainings and workshops frequently conducted as part of PSIAs tend to be an entry point for new partner-
ships and improved communication between various stakeholders.

Part of the challenge in supporting capacity development is that it is a slow process that requires a
long-term vision and continuous engagement. This raises questions about the expectation that PSIA
engenders institutional change through one-shot interventions. There also may be a potential trade-off
between impactful analysis that informs policy makers in a timely manner and capacity building, which
generally takes more time to build. Some of the experiences presented here suggest that working with
strong local advocates for PSIA who can engage in decision making is critical. An approach that is nar-
rowly focused on technical aspects often fails to achieve local ownership and sustainability regarding the
use of evidence and analytical tools in the national policy process.

                                SECTOR OVERVIEW
                                Fiscal policy is one of the main policy options available to governments to tackle
                                poverty and reduce high levels of income inequality. Yet, any such effort to redis-
                                tribute incomes through taxes and social spending needs to be balanced with the
                                goals of fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability.1 Although in-kind ben-
                                efits (such as education and health care) indirectly affect the distribution of market
                                incomes in the medium and long term, other fiscal instruments (such as taxes and
                                transfers) directly reduce or increase the inequality of disposable incomes.2 For
                                policy makers to make informed decisions on fiscal reform, prior knowledge about
                                both the potential distributional impact and the efficiency and sustainability of
                                specific interventions is indispensable.

                                With the formulation of its twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting
                                shared prosperity, the World Bank Group has renewed its commitment to making
                                growth more equitable and inclusive. The shared prosperity goal—of boosting
                                the income growth of the bottom 40 percent—increased attention to the distribu-
                                tion of the costs and benefits of public policies, including nonincome dimensions
                                (World Bank 2016). Through objective assessments, Poverty and Social Impact
                                Analysis (PSIA) promotes an evidence-based dialogue and therefore challenges
                                entrenched institutions to live up to their mandates. As such, distributional analy-
                                sis of fiscal policy not only helps to inform policy design but also contributes to
                                enhanced accountability and transparency.

                                For policy makers, a key challenge of fiscal reforms is to balance the competing
                                objectives of greater equity and economic efficiency. The notion of a fundamental
                                trade-off between redistribution and growth neglects the fact that the complex
                                relationship between both goals is not a linear one and depends on a variety of
                                factors. In fact, growing evidence suggests that, under certain circumstances, high
                                income inequality can be detrimental to growth and macroeconomic stability
                                (Brueckner and Lederman 2015; Ostry, Berg, and Tsangarides 2014). Similarly,
                                environmental and social sustainability require particular attention to the costs
                                that accrue to the poorest groups of the population. Values and perception sur-
                                veys in developing countries show a clear trend of increasing popular support for
                                redistribution, which is often driven by rising levels of economic inequality (IMF
                                2014; Indonesia MoF and World Bank 2015). Certainly, the identification of the
                                appropriate level of redistribution and the mix of policies will evidently depend on
                                a country’s context and preferences.

18   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
Although redistribution can be achieved through both taxes and public spending, the respective efficiency
costs will usually differ. Poorly targeted public spending programs incur an unnecessarily high fiscal burden
and leave room for increasing redistribution without raising more revenue. For instance, PSIAs on subsidy
reforms in many countries have shown that cash transfers for the poor are usually superior to indirect meth-
ods, such as price subsidies. Fiscal policy in low- and middle-income countries tends to achieve lower re-
distribution than in most high-income countries. For instance, in the developing world, indirect taxes play
a more prominent role in revenue collection.3 Careful analysis can help to identify policy options that en-
hance the effectiveness of redistributive measures without compromising fiscal prudence. Yet, in most
countries, knowledge is still sparse about how the choices on the composition of revenue and expenditure
affect trade-offs between equity and efficiency. Although a great number of studies have examined spe-
cific policies or programs (say, the effects of a water tariff increase), governments generally lack a good
understanding of the cumulative effects of these individual policies in terms of efficiency and equity (Es-
tache and Leipziger 2009; Ostry, Berg, and Tsangarides 2014).

Overall, PSIAs on fiscal policies have proven to be strategically relevant, for both the World Bank and its
clients. The work funded by the PSIA Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) has addressed fundamental knowl-
edge gaps and provided policy makers with a road map to align their efforts in different sectors with the
overarching goals of equity and poverty reduction.

This chapter presents highlights and insights from PSIAs on tax reforms as well as from broader fiscal re-
forms that span various sectors or categories of public spending. The PSIA MDTF has supported distribu-
tional and political economy analysis in this area, covering a large number of countries, including Colom-
bia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jamaica, Jordan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Mexico, Niger, Paraguay, Tanzania, Thailand, the Russian Federation, and Turkey as well as regional PSIAs
in the East Asia and Pacific and the Europe and Central Asia regions. Salient topics have been value added
tax (VAT), income tax, and “sin” tax4 reforms as well as the labor market impacts of fiscal restructuring (in-
cluding public retrenchment). Good practices presented in this chapter include a comprehensive fiscal
incidence analysis from South Africa and in-depth analysis of a tax reform in Colombia. The extensive ex-
perience from subsidy reforms will be presented in chapter 3. Likewise, public spending programs that
specifically address a particular sector are not considered here and will be covered in the respective chapters.


TOOLS AND METHODS
Fiscal policy PSIAs vary in their scope and methodology. Studies funded by the MDTF take into account
both the revenue and the expenditure side of fiscal reform, and in some cases also include spillover effects
on labor markets. Accordingly, they use a wide range of methods and tools, ranging from standard benefit
incidence analysis to computable general equilibrium (CGE) models and behavioral microsimulation exer-
cises. While the choice of methods evidently depends on the purpose of the analysis (for example, ex ante
versus ex post assessment), it is further constrained by data availability as well as time, resource, and ca-
pacity requirements. For instance, serious problems of misreporting incomes and expenditures, as well as
difficulties in obtaining data on top incomes, are well-known challenges in most countries.

In principle, evaluating the impact of fiscal policies on income inequality requires an assessment of the
actual incidence of tax and transfer policies, which will generally differ from their statutory incidence. In
practice, however, most research estimates the statutory incidence, given that detailed data on the struc-
ture of the economy and on consumers’ and producers’ behavioral responses (such as tax evasion, chang-
es in consumption and work patterns, and so on) are often unavailable. Moreover, PSIA work in this area

3
 	 The Commitment to Equity (CEQ) project has generated a wealth of evidence to this effect. A study comparing the fiscal incidence of
   Brazil and the United States finds that fiscal policy in the United States is more effective in redistributing income, primarily because of Bra-
   zil’s underutilization of the personal income tax and the small size of Brazil’s direct, progressive social transfers (Higgins et al. 2013).
4
 	 A “sin” tax is a specific type of excise tax that applies to goods that are regarded as harmful to society, such as alcohol and tobacco. In
   addition to raising revenue, the purpose of these taxes is generally to reduce consumption of the respective goods by increasing their
   prices.


                                                                                                               PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016          19
        has underlined the importance of carefully considering the implications of different assumptions and con-
        cepts for the analysis. For instance, whether a tax reform can be judged as progressive or regressive de-
        pends critically on the underlying concepts of incidence (relative or absolute) and welfare (for example,
        income versus consumption). Different angles may lead to different conclusions and therefore require in-
        formed judgment.

        Fiscal policy assessments may relate to specific problems or questions (say, the distributional implications
        of a particular tax), or they may be more general in nature and involve an extensive analysis of the cost and
        redistributive impact of a large number of taxes and transfers. The literature offers a wide array of analyses
        that use sophisticated models to address a particular policy issue. However, considerable knowledge gaps
        remain when it comes to assessing the incidence of fiscal systems at the aggregate level, including the in-
        teraction between different policy interventions. Having an integrated view on the overall impact of fiscal
        policy is instrumental, yet such an assessment may compromise the level of sophistication of the analysis.
        This is partly because of difficulties in obtaining detailed, micro-level data that cover the whole fiscal policy
        spectrum and are comparable across sectors.5

        To fill this knowledge gap, the MDTF supported a global work program that aims to implement the CEQ
        assessments in multiple countries across the globe (Box 2.1).6 Although the CEQ assessment relies on
        standard incidence analysis, that is not new by itself. However, it is the first global effort to comprehen-
        sively assess the tax-benefit system in developing countries, including indirect subsidies and taxes as well
        as in-kind benefits in the form of free education and health care. Research in this area has predominantly
        focused on specific policies or components rather than examining the net effect of a country’s mix of poli-
        cies and programs. Moreover, comparability has been an issue given the variety of approaches used.

        The advantages of using an integrated analysis of the fiscal system that is homogeneously applied across
        countries are evident: The CEQ assessment offers a better understanding of how effective tax and transfer
        policies are at redistributing income and reducing poverty, given the fiscal resources used. Further, the
        framework allows for international and intertemporal comparison and thereby will enhance the under-
        standing of the relationship between fiscal policy and inequality in varying contexts. In contrast to many
        existing benefit incidence studies, great care is placed in defining income concepts, and reliance on sec-
        ondary sources is kept to a minimum. (For definitions of the basic CEQ income concepts, see Figure 2.1.)

        Indonesia provides a good example of the value of this type of analysis. Inequality has been rising faster
        than in other countries in the region, and fiscal policy only has a modest impact on reducing income in-
        equality (chapter 3). Although Indonesia has successfully halved poverty within a decade,7 there are grow-
        ing concerns about the uneven distribution of incomes and the slowdown of the pace of poverty reduc-
        tion. The findings of the CEQ study clearly indicate ways to improve the effectiveness of fiscal policy, with
        subsidies playing a key role in implementing pro-poor reforms. In the case of South Africa (as further dis-
        cussed below in the “Highlights and Good Practices” section), the CEQ assessment shows that redistribu-
        tion through fiscal policy is particularly challenging when facing extreme levels of inequality. The South
        African situation calls for concerted efforts to implement rigorous pro-poor reforms in a variety of sectors.

BOX 2.1: THE CEQ FRAMEWORK FOR FISCAL INCIDENCE ANALYSIS

 To identify the main constraints that prevent effective poverty and inequality reduction via tax and benefit poli-
 cies, the World Bank Poverty Network has partnered with the Economics Department at Tulane University to
 implement a diagnostic tool—the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) assessment—in a set of countries across the
 world. While being initially focused on Latin America, the CEQ project and its partners, in close coordination with
 the World Bank’s Latin American Poverty and Gender Group, have successfully expanded the research program
 to an increasing number of countries in other regions. The MDTF helped to fund the first set of pilot studies in
 Armenia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Jordan, South Africa, and Sri Lanka, as well as several trainings and workshops on
 the use of the CEQ assessment (both in-country and in headquarters).
 The CEQ assessment provides a framework for estimating the incidence of social spending, subsidies, and taxes,
 and offers specific recommendations on how governments can improve efficiency and effectiveness in achieving
 their equity goals through fiscal reform. Specifically, it relies on standard incidence analysis and a diagnostic
 questionnaire to address three questions:
    hat is the overall contribution of social spending, subsidies, and taxes to the reduction of inequality
 • W
   and poverty?
 • What are the distributional and poverty impacts of specific taxes and transfers?
    hich changes in taxation and spending could increase redistribution and poverty reduction while maintain-
 • W
   ing fiscal prudence?

        In contrast to the general lessons provided by the CEQ assessment, some policy questions that relate to
        specific tax and spending instruments require methods that better accommodate the heterogeneity and
        interactions of economic agents. Both consumers and producers generally respond to policy-induced
        changes in prices or disposable incomes by adjusting their consumption and production decisions. In fact,
        some policies are specifically designed to change the behavior of individuals (such as providing incentives
        for labor market participation). But behavioral responses, whether intended or unintended, can affect the
        welfare and revenue implications of any given tax and social spending program.

        To account for these indirect effects of supply- or demand-side changes, different types of microsimulations
        are employed. Although many tax microsimulation models can be considered nonbehavioral, a number of
        innovative approaches have been developed to incorporate behavioral assumptions. A useful tool in this
        regard is the LATAX microsimulation model, which has been developed to simulate tax reforms in Mexico
        and was adopted for analyses in countries throughout the Latin American region (Box 2.2). It is a flexible and
        easy-to-use modeling tool that allows users to integrate a number of behavioral response parameters (in-
        cluding for labor supply, VAT pass-through, and consumer demand). This feature makes it a useful comple-
        ment to other approaches such as the CEQ assessment, which does not account for behavioral effects.


         BOX 2.2: THE LATAX MICROSIMULATION MODEL

           The MDTF supported the adoption and implementation of the LATAX microsimulation model, which is based on
           a similar model for Mexico (MEXTAX) and has been developed by researchers from the London-based Institute
           for Fiscal Studies (IFS). LATAX is a flexible, static microsimulation model for ex ante analyses of future or coun-
           terfactual tax reforms. Developed in STATA software, it is designed to be a user-friendly public program for
           simulating VAT, excise duties, income taxes, and social security contributions as well as (non-means-tested) price
           subsidies (Abramovsky and Phillips 2015). The model has been applied to MDTF-funded PSIAs of tax reforms in
           Colombia and Mexico, and it can be easily adjusted for use in other countries.
           LATAX estimates revenues and the distributional impact of tax reforms by modeling the tax system at the indi-
           vidual or household level.a Therefore, it requires survey or micro-level administrative data with detailed informa-
           tion on demographics, income, and expenditure. The LATAX interface is easy to use and does not require sophis-
           ticated knowledge of the underlying theory or program code. Different modules allow for customization of the
           type of analysis to be performed, reform parameters, and certain additional assumptions. For instance, optional
           behavioral response modules make it possible to integrate assumptions on changes in behavior along previ-
           ously specified margins.b

          a. Based on the available data and parameters defined by the user, the program quantifies indirect tax payments, the direct tax base,
          direct tax payments, revenue effects, and the distributional impact of tax changes across income or expenditure distributions and by
          household types.
          b. The following behavioral response parameters can be included in the simulation: (a) labor supply (elasticities of participation and
          hours of work are available); (b) VAT pass-through (the degree to which indirect taxes are passed on to consumers by producers); and
          (c) consumer demand (consumers’ responses to changes in prices induced by changes in taxes).

HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD PRACTICES

Colombia: Leveraging PSIA to Promote Equitable Fiscal Policy
In Colombia, a PSIA of the 2012 tax reform illustrates how several different methodologies can be com-
bined to inform the policy dialogue on various levels (World Bank 2014b; World Bank 2014c). The debate
around the tax reform was inherently linked to the government’s overall strategy to foster equity and inclu-
sive growth in the country. Hence, the PSIA was conducted at a critical moment and managed to take
advantage of ongoing discussions and initiatives, both in academic and policy circles. The scope and
depth of this PSIA was possible because the team successfully built on existing research and created part-
nerships with institutions already involved in similar work.

The analytical work had three main elements:8

•	 An incidence analysis that used the CEQ framework determined how changes in the tax system affect
   government revenues and income inequality. To ensure that the wealthiest segment of society was ac-
   curately captured in the assessment, the PSIA team extended the initial analysis by integrating tax re-
   cord data with household survey data. Obtaining confidential data from the Tax Administration Depart-
   ment was crucial for undertaking a robust and more comprehensive analysis.

•	 LATAX microsimulations were used to account for likely behavioral impacts of the tax reform as well as
   potential effects on government revenues.

•	 Modeling of worker preferences, utilizing a general equilibrium framework, captured some of the likely
   spillover effects on the labor market. While changes in Colombia’s taxation system will have a direct
   bearing on government revenues and the distribution of incomes and wealth, this third component was
   important to understand the relevance of indirect effects on the labor market.

The collaboration with researchers from the CEQ project and the use of the LATAX model enabled the
Bank team to produce a PSIA that combines the distributional profile of the overall fiscal system with an
in-depth analysis of the proposed tax reform (taking into account behavioral and general equilibrium ef-
fects). Given relatively low tax revenues (as a share of gross domestic product [GDP]) compared with other
countries in the region, Colombia could potentially afford to eliminate extreme poverty through progres-
sive taxes and transfers. With perfectly targeted transfers, Colombia would require less than 1 percent of
GDP to eradicate extreme poverty, lifting the poor up to the poverty line of US$2.50 per capita per day
(using 2012 numbers).9 Although the 2012 reform was expected to increase total and formal employment,
its anticipated impact on inequality was only moderate.10 Additional reductions in inequality would require
deeper fiscal reform that encompasses higher, more progressive taxes as well as more generous, more
effectively targeted social transfers (World Bank 2014b).

The findings of this study helped the incoming government of Colombia to identify national priorities for
poverty reduction (particularly through the new National Development Plan). Moreover, it increased aware-
ness of economic inequality in Colombia and provided critical inputs into the policy discussion. Broad
dissemination of the results was accompanied by an “Equity Day”—a high-level, closed-door workshop




8
 	 Specifically, three main components of the 2012 Colombian tax reform were analyzed: (a) a new alternative minimum tax (IMAN) for per-
    sonal income tax payers; (b) a new corporate tax (CREE) to offset a decrease in payroll taxes; and (c) a streamlined VAT system, reducing
    the number of tax rates from seven to three while also creating a new luxury tax (World Bank 2014c).
9
 	 That adds up to US$2,926.5 million per year or US$61 per capita per year at 2005 international prices (Lustig, Meléndez, and Rodriguez-
    Castelán 2014).
10
  	 These findings were confirmed by a successive ex post assessment conducted by the World Bank.


                                                                                                          PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016         23
        that focused solely on the main equity challenges in the country.11 The World Bank has continued the en-
        gagement surrounding the distributional and employment impacts of the tax reform, and these follow-up
        engagements have benefited from the analysis and partnerships built through this grant.12

        In addition to the high analytical value of this PSIA, it is important to note that its success was certainly re-
        lated to its close link to the ongoing policy dialogue around the Bank’s technical and financial assistance.13
        As such, it directly responded to the client’s needs while leveraging existing initiatives in the sector.

        South Africa: Commitment to Equity under Conditions of High Inequality
        In South Africa, a MDTF-cofunded study that applies the CEQ assessment became an important part of
        the third South Africa Economic Update (“Focus on Inequality of Opportunity”), which focuses on fiscal
        policy and redistribution (World Bank 2012). By applying state-of-the-art fiscal incidence analysis, the as-
        sessment quantifies the distributional impact of the main tax and social spending programs (as discussed
        earlier in Box 2.1).

        South Africa is a unique example, given its high levels of inequality and the pivotal role of redistributive
        fiscal policy. The comparison with other CEQ studies of middle-income countries provided useful bench-
        marks for policy effectiveness. The PSIA emphasized the importance of substantial improvements in basic
        public services—such as education, water and sanitation, and health care—which are essential to breaking
        through the vicious, self-perpetuating cycle of inequality. Yet, given slowing economic growth and a high
        fiscal deficit, higher and more-inclusive economic growth will be crucial factors in addressing the chal-
        lenges of high inequality and poverty in South Africa.

        The results show that the tax and social spending system in South Africa is progressive overall.14 More than
        3.5 million people have been lifted out of poverty through redistributive fiscal policy.15 In fact, the reduc-
        tions of poverty and income inequality are the largest achieved among the emerging economies included
        in the CEQ project. Nonetheless, in spite of this sizable redistribution, levels of inequality remain excep-
        tionally high relative to other middle-income countries (Table 2.12.1). Strikingly, South Africa’s Gini coeffi-
        cient after fiscal policy is still higher than Brazil’s Gini coefficient before fiscal policy. Although the market
        incomes (before taxes and social spending) of the richest 10 percent are more than 1,000 times bigger
        than those of the poorest 10 percent, inequality of disposable incomes (after taxes and social spending)
        shrinks to a 66-fold disparity between the top and bottom 10 percent.

        The insights of this PSIA were substantial and provided critical inputs to the policy dialogue around key
        strategic areas, including South Africa’s National Development Plan (NPC 2011). The value added of this
        PSIA was further reflected in substantial efforts for capacity development. A two-day training (held April
        20–21, 2015) provided applied knowledge to South African policy makers and technical staff on how to
        implement CEQ assessments, including hands-on simulations using recent household survey data and fis-
        cal administrative accounts. Such capacity-building components were an integral part of the global CEQ
        work program.



        11
            The Equity Day workshop was held on March 12, 2013, with participants from the Colombian government (including the ministers of finance
            and labor, four vice ministers, and other senior government officials); managers and experts from the World Bank; experts from other inter-
            national organizations (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Inter-American Development Bank, and United Nations
            Development Programme); and academics.

          	 The poorest 50 percent of the population receive approximately 70 percent of outlays on social grants and 54 percent of spending on
            education and health. The share of the population living in extreme poverty in 2010 (measured as less than US$1.25 per day) was 39.2
            percent based on their market income but much lower (25.9 percent) based on their postfiscal income. The policies with the largest impact
            on poverty are the child support grant and the old-age pension (Inchauste and Lustig, forthcoming).
        14
          	 The following taxes were assessed: the personal income tax, VAT, excises on alcohol and tobacco, and the fuel levy (Inchauste et al. 2015).

In all CEQ pilot countries, the teams undertaking the analysis included counterparts who work in local think

once finalized, the analysis and its findings will be made available for Bank staff and other practitioners
online to enable practitioners to compare results across countries and over time. The CEQ assessments
that have been conducted in all six regions have contributed to greater transparency and will enable civil
society organizations and other stakeholders to monitor the governments’ efforts to reduce inequality
(Inchauste and Lustig, forthcoming). The growing body of research will also prove valuable for interna-
tional donors, particularly, given its advantage of international and intertemporal comparability (also see
World Bank 2014a).

Chapter 3: Subsidy Reform
SECTOR OVERVIEW
In the past decade, the World Bank has been engaged with many governments
on the discussion of consumer subsidies, particularly in the Middle East and North
Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa regions. These subsidies regulate consumer prices
of essential energy and food products and are widespread in developing coun-
tries. The analysis presented in this chapter focuses solely on consumer prices and
does not take into account supply-side factors. Thus, sector-specific issues related
to the production of subsidized goods are not covered here. Further, because
subsidy reforms are prominent fiscal measures that tend to have many similarities
across countries, the Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) of subsidy re-
forms are dealt with separately in this chapter, continuing the debate on fiscal
policy reforms in chapter 2.

Generally, price controls through subsidies are introduced as responses to eco-
nomic crises or international price shocks and are intended as short-term mitiga-
tion measures. Yet, if left in place as long-term programs, governments are often
faced with the untenable burden of increasing and uncontrollable fiscal costs.
Subsidy schemes that control prices force governments to (fully or partially) ab-
sorb increases in international prices or in domestic consumption. For instance,
many countries that had introduced fuel subsidies before the global rise in oil
prices went through fiscal crises when oil prices climbed to unprecedented levels.
The price distortions created by subsidies may lead to significant economic inef-
ficiencies and further increase the total amount of subsidies paid by the govern-
ment, especially when the subsidized products are imported. Artificially low prices
incentivize the excessive consumption of subsidized goods relative to local or
potentially cheaper (in terms of presubsidy price) alternatives (Coady 2006).

Despite being generally introduced to protect poorer households from rising con-
sumption prices, the benefits of subsidy programs are often skewed toward the
richer and urban parts of the population, as is the case for most petroleum prod-
ucts (Verme and Araar 2016). Thus, they tend to be ineffective and inefficient in-
struments for poverty reduction. Moreover, as costs for subsidies rise, budget
constraints may negatively affect other social services as well. Historically, the
World Bank has had limited success in influencing governments to push for re-
forms in this area despite the evident risks and inefficiencies.

Many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa implemented or increased price subsi-
dies in response to price shocks, economic crises, and social tensions in 2007 and
2008. As a result, pass-through of international prices was further constrained. In
the following years, rising food and commodity prices1—accompanied by excep-
tionally high oil prices —led to rapidly increasing fiscal costs, reinforcing the need


	 After drastic price increases in 2007–08, international oil prices fell in the second half of 2008 but re-
1

  bounded strongly thereafter.


                                                                                                          PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016   27
        for reforms. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the median increase in the fiscal cost of energy subsidies was 1.6 per-
        cent of gross domestic product (GDP) between the end of 2008 and the end of 2011.2 In the case of en-
        ergy subsidies, it is important to note that this trend was much more pronounced for oil exporters, which
        tend to have more difficulties in passing through international price changes.

        In the Middle East and North Africa, global price shocks coincided with profound political transformations
        that led to social upheavals and regime changes in 2010–12. While the fiscal crises were worsening in the
        face of political instability and economic recession, it was extremely difficult for the new governments to
        implement unpopular reforms. Yet, in some countries, the policy dialogue around subsidies finally gained
        traction and led to subsequent reforms (see, for instance, the Moroccan example in the “Highlights and
        Good Practices” section below). The World Bank played an active role in this process, which involved dis-
        cussions and negotiations over long periods of time.

        The turnaround in global oil prices to presently low levels (followed by declines in prices of major com-
        modities) can be seen as both an opportunity and a barrier to continued progress in the area of subsidy
        reform. On the one hand, it diminishes the immediate impact on consumer prices of a removal of subsidies
        and therefore reduces the social costs (in the short term). On the other hand, it also alleviates fiscal pres-
        sure and weakens the political incentive to act and push for reforms.

        The PSIA Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) has extensively funded analytical work in the area of subsidies,
        particularly for food and fuel products. Between 2010 and 2014, several governments in the Middle East
        and North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa regions have requested the World Bank’s assistance to assess
        policy options and the viability of reform proposals. This offered a unique opportunity for the World Bank
        to support these efforts and improve the fiscal sustainability and targeting of public spending. PSIA grants
        have supported work in many countries, including Cameroon, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Mauritania, Si-
        erra Leone, and Sudan. Additionally, as part of a regional approach, studies have been conducted in Dji-
        bouti, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and the Republic of Yemen. Moreover, a PSIA conducted in Indo-
        nesia has informed the policy dialogue on subsidy reforms, as part of the Commitment to Equity (CEQ)
        work program (see chapter 2, Box 2.1). The resulting body of research has provided valuable insights into
        differences and similarities between countries as well as into the main challenges and success factors.
        Moreover, the World Bank used the opportunity to exploit synergies through cross-country collaboration.


        TOOLS AND METHODS
        The distributional analysis of subsidies is very similar to analyses of other fiscal policies such as taxes. The
        diverse methods available for PSIA in this area have been predominantly quantitative. One of the funda-
        mental challenges of developing the right PSIA methodology is the trade-off between complexity and
        accuracy on the one hand, and ownership and accessibility for policy makers on the other hand. Lessons
        from the MDTF indicate that a more sophisticated approach—one that enhances the precision of results—
        is not always justified when considering the benefits of simpler tools that local authorities and a greater
        number of stakeholders can use and comprehend. Tools that are accessible to a broader audience en-
        hance in-country capacity to conduct PSIA and increase transparency about underlying assumptions.

        In addition to numerous country studies in this area, the MDTF has also funded the development of tool-
        kits and work that explores the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of subsidy reform PSIAs. For
        instance, one of the outputs was a paper that identifies essential differences across different welfare mea-
        sures and computational methods to assess the impact of price changes (Araar and Verme 2016). By test-
        ing how certain methodological differences affect empirical results, this research provides guidelines on

    BOX 3.1: SUBSIM—A STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO SUBSIDY SIMULATION

     The subsidy simulation model SUBSIM was developed in 2011, with subsequent updates in the following years,
     and it has been used in eight countries in the Middle East and North Africaa as well as in other regions. SUBSIM
     is programmed in Stata and has an accessible Windows interface.
     Using household budget survey data and input-output (IO) matrixes, it estimates distributional, poverty-related,
     and budgetary impacts of energy and food subsidies. Provided that sufficient data is available, the model can
     estimate both the direct and indirect effects.b SUBSIM uses an econometric IO model that is “lighter” than most
     computable general equilibrium (CGE) models because it does not require the same amount of preparation and
     detailed specifications of behavioral responses. Nevertheless, the IO model is expected to capture the bulk of
     indirect effects, generating results similar to those of CGE models.
     Different modules allow for customization—including the optional integration of compensation measures (cash
     transfers)—and a rudimentary module that only estimates direct effects and therefore has lower data require-
     ments. In contrast to most other models in use, SUBSIM allows users to present direct and indirect effects sepa-
     rately. Moreover, it enables users to choose between linear and nonlinear pricing, first-order or higher-order effects,
     and short- or long-term estimations as well as between different welfare measures (given that requirements
     may be different based on data availability and the magnitude of price variations). This extraordinary versatility
     makes this model unique and applicable to various country contexts.c

     a. The eight Middle Eastern and North African countries include Djibouti, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Jordan, Libya, Morocco,
     Tunisia, and the Republic of Yemen.
     b. Direct effects on household welfare arise from the price changes of subsidized products that are being studied. The indirect
     effects result from price changes of other, nonsubsidized products that may be affected by demand- and supply-side responses (for
     example, a change in fuel subsidies indirectly affects the price of transport services).
     c. The model has a user guide that is publicly available on the SUBSIM website: “SUBSIM: A User Guide, Version 1,” accessed Oct.
     7, 2016, http://subsim.org/refs/SUBSIM%20Guide_v_8.pdf. The SUBSIM model itself is available in English or French.




the choice of critical assumptions, which will depend on the context and available information.3 The paper
is a useful reference for practitioners who design PSIA in the context of subsidy reforms.

Another initiative that stands out in this regard is the development of SUBSIM, a subsidy simulation model
resulting from a regional effort to develop a versatile toolkit applicable to different countries in the Middle
East and North Africa (Box 3.1). The MDTF supported the development of SUBSIM to enable country
teams and governments to rapidly assess the impact of consumer subsidies on poverty, inequality, and the
fiscal budget. The initiative was a direct response to the increasing demand by governments in the Middle
East and North Africa for the Bank’s technical assistance on subsidy reforms.

Although the Bank was already using a variety of different tools and approaches, no model existed that
could provide impact assessments that were both accurate and could be conducted quickly under time
constraints. Given that the SUBSIM team was involved in the policy discussions in most Middle Eastern and
North African countries that were going through subsidy reforms since 2011, there was a unique opportu-
nity for effective cross-country collaboration. The value of this regional approach has gone beyond the
SUBSIM model itself. Thanks to efforts to standardize data and results, a large number of reforms and



	 The discussed assumptions include monotonic and strictly convex utility functions; single-valued and continuously differentiable demand

  functions; complete, reflexive, and transitive preferences; constant marginal utility of income; utility-maximizing consumers; and normal
  goods. The theoretical part offers definitions, geometrical illustrations, and various computation options. The empirical part provides sen-
  sitivity analyses of the welfare measure regarding price shocks, changes in demand functions, consumption bundles, and elasticities (Araar
  and Verme 2016).

                                                                                                           PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016         29
        products assessed through SUBSIM are comparable across countries, providing lessons and insights for
        future reforms within and outside the region (Verme and Araar 2016).

        In response to client demand, another modeling tool was developed for PSIAs in Cameroon and Sierra
        Leone (as further discussed in the “Highlights and Good Practices” section below). It was specifically de-
        signed to be easy to use and accessible to a wide range of stakeholders without specialized computer
        training or software requirements (in contrast to previous tools that were Stata-based). It is worth noting
        that there is a potential trade-off here—between ease of use on the one hand and analytical precision on
        the other. However, while having a high level of sophistication, the model struck a good balance between
        both. An intensive hands-on training was crucial to ensure that the ministries’ staffs could understand and
        master the tool as well as to ultimately promote the government’s ownership.

        The Excel-based model is based on experiences from several successful reforms in Asia (particularly ben-
        efiting from work in Indonesia) and calculates the impact of fuel-price changes on revenue, inflation, and
        poverty (accounting for direct and indirect effects).4 Further, the team constructed a “poverty basket infla-
        tion” index for the analysis to accommodate consumption patterns of the poor, hence increasing accuracy
        compared with a standard consumer price index. The model generated robust results and proved to be
        useful for a range of highly detailed analyses that have followed this PSIA.5

        Despite recent successes, international experiences show that reforming subsidy programs is challenging
        and delicate. In some cases, attempts to move to market-based pricing have resulted in protests that suc-
        ceeded in stalling or reversing the reform process. This underlines the importance of taking into account
        the political economy and public perceptions when conducting PSIA on subsidy reform. Hence, qualitative
        analysis of stakeholder configurations and political economy risks has become an integral part of most
        engagements in this area.

        For instance, in Cameroon the World Bank commissioned a series of interviews and focus groups to iden-
        tify key stakeholders and assess the population’s level of awareness of price subsidies as well as potential
        reactions to policy reform (World Bank 2013). The results show that awareness of price subsidies is low
        among the poor, particularly the rural poor who benefit the least from subsidies. The urban rich have much
        better knowledge of subsidy programs and are also the main beneficiaries. However, the poor are highly
        sensitive to even small changes in prices. Taxi drivers and taxi-moto drivers are among the key stakehold-
        ers, because they rely heavily on fuel and have a high capacity for organization. They are a particularly
        vocal group in the urban centers and believed to be responsible for initiating riots in the past. Moreover,
        there are regional disparities worth taking into account. In anglophone areas (where there is a strong sense
        of ethnic and regional exclusion) awareness of fuel subsidies tends to be higher because of historical griev-
        ances toward francophone areas (which are considered to have captured the profits of local oil produc-
        tion). It is critical to consider these configurations when devising reform options, information campaigns,
        and mitigation measures. Subsidy reforms cannot be isolated from the political landscape with its existing
        conflicts and struggles.


        HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD PRACTICES

        Morocco: Impacts of the 2014 Subsidy Reforms and the Way Forward
        An ex post PSIA of subsidy reforms in Morocco reaffirmed the government’s reform course and underlined
        the effectiveness of evidence-based, gradual approaches to phase out regressive subsidy programs (Ver-
        me and El-Massnaoui 2015). The analysis uses the SUBSIM model (discussed earlier in Box 3.1) and was

2014c). The distributional, poverty-related, and budgetary impacts of the 2014 reforms were assessed by
simulating the effects of induced price changes, both directly through subsidized products and indirectly
through changes in the price of nonsubsidized products.6

The practice of consumer subsidies has a long history in Morocco. First introduced during World War II,
price subsidy schemes have been in place for more than 70 years, although their objectives changed over
time—ranging from export incentives to price stabilization and social policy. Driven by the global dy-
namic of rising oil and commodity prices, food and fuel subsidies in Morocco became an increasingly
unsustainable burden for the fiscal balance. Because Morocco relies entirely on oil imports, it was par-
ticularly the rapidly increasing costs of fuel subsidies that contributed to worsening the country’s fiscal
crisis. (Fuel subsidies amounted to 90 percent of the free market price in 2012.) The government re-
sponded to the increasing pressure with successive reforms starting in 2012 and 2013 with reductions in
fuel subsidies.7 A more comprehensive reform in 2014 included the removal of subsidies for gasoline and
fuel oil, changes in electricity tariffs, and a gradual elimination of diesel subsidies. The only subsidized
consumer products that remained in place (as of January 2015) were flour, sugar, liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG), and electricity.

Results from the simulations show that the reforms significantly reduced the fiscal deficit, thus were highly
effective from a budget perspective.8 Further, welfare losses caused by the price adjustments primarily af-
fected high-income groups and had only a moderate impact on the poor (Table 3.1). This is because gaso-
line and diesel are largely consumed by the rich, and the changes in the tariff structure of water and elec-
tricity did not affect the lower consumption blocks. Additionally, there were significant indirect effects,
particularly for petroleum, but the impact on the lowest quintile was still relatively low. Although 50 per-
cent of the fiscal savings came from the richest quintile, the overall impact on poverty was negligible. The
prioritization of certain elements of the subsidy programs allowed the government to eliminate costly and
regressive components while maintaining some of the more progressive subsidies. Experiences from other
countries confirm that this practice can prove effective to minimize resistance and move forward with the
much-needed reforms.

        2015). Thus, further reforms will require careful consideration of compensation mechanisms to address the
        associated social and political costs. Clearly, a targeted, progressive reform package that includes mitiga-
        tion measures could contribute to significant additional budget savings. LPG subsidies have the biggest
        potential in this regard because the benefits (in absolute terms) are larger for the upper quintiles. Currently,
        the low oil prices can be an opportunity to push for further subsidy reductions, given that smaller price
        differentials would reduce welfare losses in the short term. However, low oil prices also expand the fiscal
        space of the government and give little incentive for tough measures of fiscal consolidation.

        Cameroon: Making Strides in Subsidy Reform through Capacity Building
        Given limited take-up of previous technical assistance in the area of subsidies, a PSIA activity in Cameroon
        sought to provide policy makers with tools and training that would enable them to conduct impact assess-
        ments internally, as well as by engaging with key stakeholders to advance the dialogue surrounding the
        analytical work (Error! Reference source not found.Box 3.2). Subsidies on fuel and imported food prod-
        ucts were put in place as reactions to price shocks in 2007 and 2008 to prevent drastic price increases and
        protect consumers from fluctuations on international markets. Yet, with rising global commodity prices, the
        cost of these subsidies grew to extremely high levels, increasing by an average of 11 percent per year
        between 2010 and 2013 (del Ninno 2015). In 2012, Cameroon was spending an estimated 20 percent of
        government expenditure on price subsidies. The World Bank’s engagement with the government of Cam-
        eroon on subsidy reform started in 2009, yet reforms to cut subsidies had not taken place until 2014. An
        MDTF-funded PSIA conducted in 2012/13 indicated that subsidies overwhelmingly favored the rich and
        therefore provided an opportunity to shift public spending to programs with a better potential for poverty
        reduction (World Bank 2014c). Moreover, qualitative work pointed to a lack of public awareness and lim-
        ited technical capacity of the administration.

        In 2014, reforms were finally implemented leading to price increases in several petroleum products, includ-
        ing gasoline (by 14 percent), diesel (by 15 percent), and domestic gas (by 8 percent). With the exception
        of LPG, these subsidies were largely regressive and benefited the affluent urban population. For instance,
        at the time of the reform, gasoline represented 1.2 percent of total expenditure for the richest quintile
        compared with 0.1 percent for the poorest quintile. The subsidy reform was coupled with social policy
        measures that consisted of a 5 percent salary increase for public workers, a 50 percent tax reduction in the
        transport sector, and a 27 percent minimum-wage increase. Starting in 2014, the World Bank and the gov-
        ernment of Cameroon conducted an ex post analysis to evaluate the impact of the reform package (World
        Bank 2016). The MDTF provided funding for the analytical work (qualitative and quantitative assessments)
        as well as for complementary training that would allow the government to improve its monitoring and
        evaluation capacity (Box 3.2).

        To address capacity constraints and in response to government demand, the World Bank conducted a
        technical training for members of the government’s Technical Committee for Monitoring Economic Pro-
        grams and researchers from a local think tank that was supporting the fieldwork and analysis of the PSIA.9
        The training provided basic knowledge on the design of ex ante and ex post impact assessments, as well
        as detailed guidance on the use of an Excel-based modeling tool for subsidy simulation (as previously
        discussed in the “Tools and Methods” section). Additionally, a dissemination workshop attended by a wide
        range of stakeholders proved particularly valuable in bringing key stakeholders together and facilitating

           in the international PSIA conference and the subsequent technical workshop in Cape Town in July 2015 (funded by the PSIA MDTF).

 BOX 3.2: CAMEROON AND SIERRA LEONE—A REGIONAL APPROACH
 TO CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

      PSIAs in Cameroon and Sierra Leone focused on enhancing government capacity to develop and use modeling
      tools that estimate the poverty and distributional impacts of changes in food and fuel prices. While the PSIA in
      Sierra Leone was the beginning of a dialogue on fuel subsidy reform, Cameroon had already started the reform
      process with a reduction of subsidies in 2014—several years after the World Bank began engaging with the
      government in this area. Preceding discussions and previous engagements have shown that, in both countries,
      externally commissioned analyses on the risks and opportunities of subsidy reform had not generated enough
      traction in the policy dialogue. This was partly related to a lack of trust and limited understanding of the analyses
      among authorities and stakeholders. The PSIA work sought to address these barriers by providing policy makers
      with tools and training that would enable them to conduct impact assessments internally as well as by engaging
      with key stakeholders to advance the dialogue surrounding the analytical work.
      The PSIA team developed a modeling tool that has relatively low technical and capacity requirements and is
      therefore accessible to a wide range of stakeholders. The goal was to empower stakeholders who have a good
      knowledge of the issue but whose analytical skills are not necessarily strong enough to develop a quantitative
      narrative. The tool could also be used to explain changes to other members of the government in a way that was
      both specific (in terms of dollar-amount costs and benefits) and understandable to a nontechnical audience. This
      would provide an opportunity to support local champions and shift the policy dialogue from donor-driven advo-
      cacy to an internal government discussion. Trainings on the use of the model, which were conducted in both
      countries, demonstrated the effectiveness of intensive capacity-building programs that are hands-on and tai-
      lored to the counterpart’s needs.a While considered instrumental, there was no guarantee that improved owner-
      ship would lead to stronger political will for reforms. Evidently, exogenous factors, such as the development of
      global commodity prices, would play a crucial role in this process.
      In the case of Sierra Leone, the originally proposed project could not be fully completed. The outbreak of the
      Ebola crisis in mid-2014 interrupted the policy discussion on subsidy reform and resulted in a partial restructuring
      of the project. Given the severity and unpredictability of the situation, the PSIA team in Sierra Leone decided to
      shift remaining resources to support the Cameroon PSIA, which was in the preparation stage at the time. Fortu-
      nately, as part of the post-Ebola revenue-raising strategies, fuel subsidies have been eliminated in Sierra Leone.b
      Sources: World Bank 2014b, 2015a, 2016.

fruitful exchanges between policy makers, technicians, civil society groups, and unions.10 The discussions
revealed that taking into account concerns from the transport sector is instrumental when moving forward
with the reforms. For instance, involving union representatives in a transparent process is important to
maintain a constructive dialogue around the reforms as well as for complementary mitigation measures.

Despite the magnitude and relevance of consumer subsidy programs in Cameroon, results from a percep-
tions survey show that general knowledge about the reform and existing subsidy schemes was strikingly
low (with the exception of urban, high-income households, who are also among the primary consumers of
most subsidized products). The findings suggested a lack of trust in the reforms that is largely attributed
to a lack of accurate information among the population. The PSIA concluded that transparency and a sen-
sible communications strategy to promote public debate will be key requirements for the success of future

     The workshop (on June 24, 2015) was attended by approximately 80 representatives from the government (Technical Committee for Moni-
     toring Economic Programs), civil society, trade unions from the transport sector, and think tanks.

        reforms. Moreover, follow-up analysis is planned to better understand the distributional and social policy
        implications of the reform process, particularly in the context of external shocks.

        Despite evident challenges, the World Bank’s engagement in the debates over the past six years has
        shown clear signs of success. Considering the authorities’ initial reluctance and the fact that subsidy reform
        is a sensitive policy issue in the country, a gradual removal of subsidies—with particular attention to pro-
        tecting vulnerable groups—is certainly the most sensible and effective strategy for Cameroon.


        Indonesia: Subsidy Reform as a Cornerstone for More Effective Fiscal Policy
        In Indonesia, analysis based on the CEQ methodology11 revealed a considerable potential to increase the
        effectiveness of several fiscal policies in reducing poverty and inequality. In the presence of rising inequal-
        ity, the combination of low direct taxes, low public spending, and poor targeting results in only modest
        redistribution. Here, subsidies play a major role in the fiscal policy debate, given their large share in gov-
        ernment spending. Taken together, the largest two spending items—education and energy subsidies—
        have almost no effect on income inequality in the country (Indonesia MoF and World Bank 2015; World
        Bank 2014a).

        Since recovering from the 1997–98 Asian Financial Crisis, Indonesia has enjoyed robust growth,12 but in-
        come inequality has also risen sharply over the same period. The gains of economic growth have been
        distributed unevenly, mainly benefiting an emerging consumer class and leaving large sections of the poor
        and vulnerable behind. Although poverty decreased significantly in the past 15 years,13 inequality (as mea-
        sured by the Gini coefficient) has been climbing faster than in most East Asian countries, achieving record
        levels in 2014. Conservative estimates suggest that per capita consumption grew by more than 6 percent
        per year for the richest 10 percent of the population but by less than 2 percent per year for the bottom 40
        percent of the income distribution.

        The uneven economic development has slowed down the pace of poverty reduction and raised concerns
        about potential negative repercussions. Public perceptions reaffirm the need to address this issue: 88 per-
        cent of Indonesians surveyed in 2014 believed that government action was urgently required to address
        inequality (Indonesia MoF and World Bank 2015). Inequality is partly driven by unequal access to educa-
        tional opportunities coupled with an increasing income gap between high-skilled jobs and jobs in the in-
        formal and low-productivity sectors of the rapidly transforming economy. Further, inequalities of wealth
        and the poor’s vulnerability to shocks tend to reinforce and accelerate this dynamic.

        Against this backdrop, the CEQ country study explores the role and impact of Indonesia’s fiscal policy as
        well as the reform options available (Indonesia MoF and World Bank 2015). The way the government
        raises revenue and allocates its spending has direct and indirect effects on economic growth and the dis-
        tribution of incomes. The findings of the CEQ assessment suggest that fiscal policy has a very limited re-
        distributive impact in Indonesia.14 The Gini coefficient falls only modestly (by 2.5 points) when comparing
        the distribution of market incomes (before fiscal policy) with disposable incomes (after fiscal policy).15

        Figure 3.1 illustrates the role of fiscal policy in a set of countries that were included in the CEQ work pro-
        gram, with Indonesia at the lower end. In contrast, Brazil and South Africa achieve substantially higher re-
        ductions in inequality through fiscal policy (with Gini reductions of 14 and 17.5 points, respectively).

        On the revenue side, taxes are the main instrument, raising 73 percent of total government revenue. The
        relatively low personal income taxes only amount to 10 percent of tax revenues. Here, international bench-

            Between 2000 and 2014, Indonesia’s real GDP per capita grew at an annual average of 5.4 percent (Indonesia MoF and World Bank 2015).

marks suggest a notable potential for both raising more revenue and lowering inequality (for instance,
through a broader tax base and improved compliance). The value added tax (VAT) and the tobacco excise,
which make up about half of Indonesia’s tax revenue, are neutral regarding their overall redistributive im-
pact. Although taxes can contribute to the redistribution of incomes from the top to the bottom, experi-
ences from other countries indicate that public spending generally has the greatest impact on reducing
inequality.

On the spending side, those programs that have been estimated to be the most effective in redistributing
incomes receive the lowest spending. For instance, social assistance is strongly pro-poor, but it only
achieves small reductions in inequality because overall spending is too low, and the most effective cash
transfer programs—direct, targeted cash transfers—make up the smallest share of this category. Strikingly,
the largest spending category consists of energy subsidies, amounting to 23 percent of primary spending.
These expenditures are important for the poor in relation to their incomes, but they benefit largely the af-
fluent in absolute terms (the richest decile receiving eight times more than the poorest decile). Education
is the second-largest spending item and has the largest impact on redistribution among all spending cat-
egories. Yet, with a reduction of the Gini coefficient by 1.9 points, its impact is still relatively small.

From an equity point of view, the findings suggest an enormous potential to raise, reallocate, and spend
fiscal resources more effectively. As recommended by the PSIA team, phasing out energy subsidies to free
fiscal resources is a cornerstone in the fiscal reform process. Recent trends in economic growth and public
concerns about rising inequality have called the plausibility of subsidies into question. However, it is im-
portant to note that energy and food subsidies tend to receive great support among the poor. Ultimately,
it is the broader picture and the systematic assessment of the fiscal system that strengthen the narrative in
favor of much-needed reforms.

The CEQ assessment was a critical input for the policy dialogue between the World Bank and the govern-
ment of Indonesia. Specifically, it helped the Bank team to convince the authorities to replace fuel subsi-
dies with a targeted cash transfer program, and, more recently, to rethink the rice subsidy program. The
Government of Indonesia and the World Bank have agreed to extend the analysis in a joint program that

Chapter 4: Social Protection
SECTOR OVERVIEW
Effective social protection policies occupy a center stage in governments’ poverty
and social exclusion agendas. Few countries are spared from having to wrestle
with unanticipated systemic shocks such as economic crises or natural disasters.
The consequences of unemployment, illness, and disability can by devastating if
no safety nets are in place. The poor are particularly vulnerable and most affected
by these shocks, given that they are typically more exposed to risk, have only
limited access to social protection services and other risk management instru-
ments, and face a number of obstacles in the labor market. Therefore, risk man-
agement strategies and ways to build resilience to shocks have important distri-
butional implications.

Designing systems that effectively target the poor and most vulnerable is essential
to achieving the World Bank’s twin goals of reduced poverty and shared prosper-
ity. However, it is well acknowledged that effective, well-functioning social protec-
tion programs need to be complemented by consistent labor market policies (as
further discussed in chapter 5). Moreover, pursuing cost-effective approaches and
ensuring fiscal sustainability is a fundamental pillar of best practices in this sector.

The composition of the Bank’s lending portfolio has been moving toward support-
ing social protection system-oriented operations. The Bank has been working with
partners to coordinate efforts and resources to help poorer countries build social
protection systems that are fiscally sustainable in the long term, using resources
cost-effectively to meet country goals. Building social protection systems also re-
quires long-term engagement, and thus it can be harder to measure how such
systems are practically implemented. It also depends on countries’ abilities to
develop their institutional capacities, especially across sometimes weak social
protection agencies. Therefore, capacity building is a key component, especially
in low-income and fragile contexts. This capacity building includes the generation
of accurate, useful, and timely data to improve results.

By looking at the effectiveness and distributional impacts of social transfers, Pov-
erty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) has been informing the social protection
policy agenda worldwide. The PSIA Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) has support-
ed distributional and political economy analysis of social protection reforms in
Afghanistan, Albania, Armenia, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Djibouti, the Do-
minican Republic, Ecuador, Fiji, Georgia, Lesotho, the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia, Mauritania, Mexico, Mongolia, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru,
Romania, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Swaziland. In addition, regional PSIAs
have been conducted in the Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the
Caribbean, and Africa regions.

        These PSIAs explore the implications of social protection systems (including conditional cash transfers
        [CCTs]) on access to basic services such as education, health, social insurance, employment, pensions,
        nutrition, land, housing, and public works. Social protection PSIAs are increasingly focusing on targeting
        mechanisms1 and coverage levels. This chapter presents the main lessons from good-practice PSIAs that
        not only inform policy design but also promote program and policy implementation directly. By assessing
        the continued viability and reform of the social protection programs in these countries, these PSIAs pro-
        vide a solid basis for policy makers to make informed policy choices.

        The “Highlights and Good Practices” section below presents insights from some successful PSIAs of social
        protection reforms:

        •	 In Ecuador, a PSIA raised awareness on the importance of cooperation between different government
           levels in the development of safety nets (compared with a CCT graduation strategy).

        •	 In Romania, a PSIA informed the consolidation of three means-tested programs into a flagship program
           for low-income households, thereby strengthening work requirements, active labor market policies, and
           school conditionality.

        •	 In Fiji, the PSIA led to the government’s endorsement of key changes to the social protection system,
           hence improving targeting accuracy and poverty reduction.

        •	 In Albania, the PSIA assessed the disability criteria of social assistance and helped prioritize beneficiaries
           who report functional and medical disability.

        These PSIAs have successfully recognized the importance of appropriate policy, legal, and institutional
        frameworks as well as collaboration between different stakeholders—both across economic sectors and
        between the national and local levels.


        TOOLS AND METHODS
        PSIAs in the area of social protection have successfully combined quantitative and qualitative methods as
        part of a multidisciplinary approach that addresses the complex nature of social protection policy reform.
        Data collection methods have ranged from surveys and national censuses to interviews, focus groups,
        questionnaires, and mobile data collection.

        The use of mixed methods often helped to integrate the views of stakeholders at different levels. For ex-
        ample, in Albania, while quantitative survey results identified the challenges in the design and perfor-
        mance of the disability program, the qualitative results provided the beneficiaries’ firsthand experience
        with the implementation of the program (World Bank 2012b). An institutional stakeholder analysis was also
        conducted to understand the interests of institutions and organizations (including government policy makers,
        associations, civil society, donors, large firms, and so on) that can potentially influence disability reforms.

        In Romania, a PSIA (World Bank 2011d) was used to separate the bottom-quintile NEEDT (neither in em-
        ployment, education, disability, nor training) population into eight groups using Latent Class Analysis
        (LCA). LCA allows for multidimensional statistical profiling of the inactive population and identifies clusters
        or groups of out-of-work individuals that are (a) as homogeneous as possible within each cluster, according
        to a set of observable characteristics; and (b) as distant as possible between clusters (Box 4.1). In the case
        of Romania, the latent variable was defined as barriers in accessing the labor market. Using observed char-
        acteristics (such as gender, location, education, number of children, and minority status), the LCA algo-
        rithm generated eight clusters. This categorization highlights the heterogeneity in situations and con-
        straints in accessing the labor market.

    BOX 4.1: LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS

     LCA is a nonparametric method that is used to identify similar “latent classes” of the population through a
     number of “indicator” variables that signal underlying class. It is a form of cluster analysis. Observations in each
     cluster share similar values of a latent (unobserved) variable, which is inferred from observed characteristics. LCA
     estimates the likelihood that an observation with specific characteristics (observed variables) belongs to one of
     the defined clusters and estimates parameters for class profiles and class size. The advantage of LCA over other
     clustering techniques is that cases are not absolutely assigned to classes but have a probability of membership
     for each class. It can also deal with both continuous and categorical data.
     To understand the employment barriers of the poor NEEDT population, the Romanian PSIA used LCA to separate
     them into eight groups: (a) educated, urban, unemployed men; (b) married, middle-aged, rural women; (c) un-
     educated, idle youth; (d) young, rural family women; (e) single Roma youth; (f) educated, rural unemployed; (g)
     urban Roma family women; and (h) young urban couples.
     LCA generated a rich picture of different barriers to labor market integration in this context, considerably aug-
     menting the limited amount of information contained in traditional descriptive statistics. The PSIA uses this
     profiling analysis to suggest tailored activation policies and support services to respond to the challenges faced
     by each of the identified groups.

The Fiji PSIA (World Bank 2014b) used a relatively new computational package for economic and poverty
analysis: the ADePT software. ADePT was developed by the World Bank and uses micro-level data from
various types of surveys (such as household budget surveys, household income and expenditure surveys,
demographic and health surveys, and labor force surveys) to produce rich sets of tables and graphs for a
particular area of economic research. This software platform facilitates the use of new techniques and
methods for a wide audience of policy practitioners and enables users to draw policy implications from
empirical evidence. In Fiji, this tool, in combination with the poverty mapping software, allowed for auto-
mated survey data and economic analysis to generate highly disaggregated, small-area estimates of pov-
erty—which was unique for the Asia and Pacific region. This poverty mapping methodology helped to
create the first-ever poverty maps in the country (World Bank 2011c).2


HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD PRACTICES

Ecuador: Assessing the Impact of the CCT Graduation Strategy
By drawing recommendations from a pilot program in the province of Chimborazo, Ecuador, this PSIA pro-
vides evidence to ensure successful implementation of the graduation strategy of the Human Development
Voucher (Bono de Desarrollo Humano, or BDH) CCT program (World Bank 2015a). In Ecuador, CCTs cover
34 percent of the total population, which is close to 100 percent of the families living in poverty and ex-
treme poverty—the biggest population coverage in Latin America and the Caribbean. However, this exten-
sive coverage has created fiscal pressures with no measurable human capital impact for poor beneficiaries.

The objective of the strategy was to refine the program’s targeting criteria to prioritize the extreme poor
and progressively reduce coverage for the poor to encourage families that become financially stable to
leave the program. In this context, the PSIA helped the provincial government to design the “Family Pro-

        motion Plan,” a program meant to support families in accessing other existing programs.3 As a result, a
        year and a half later, more than 700,000 households stopped receiving the BDH, losing a monthly income
        of US$50.

        The PSIA data analysis on supply and demand identified existing services supporting skills development,
        labor insertion, and entrepreneurship (supply) as well as the needs profile of eligible families (demand). In
        addition to identifying supply gaps, the initial assessment generated baseline information to feed the
        evaluation of the pilot.4 Considering the positive results of the pilot, the Bank’s team is recommending an
        expansion of this intervention, which is designed to improve the families’ abilities to react and maintain a
        certain income level.

        The project results were presented to the technical secretary of the Coordinating Ministry for Social Devel-
        opment (MCDS). The MCDS then established “economic inclusion” as a cornerstone of the Family Promo-
        tion Plan for households receiving the BDH.5 The PSIA has produced documents for its replicability, such
        as an operations manual (OM) and applications in Excel for the preparation of family plans. The OM, to-
        gether with the technical instruments for implementation (software, databases, and tools to gather infor-
        mation), allow for its standard application in other processes accompanying BDH households. The interim
        results of the OM (for example, outlining the criteria for families’ participation and the implementation
        process of the graduation strategy) were presented to high-level representatives of the Ministry of Eco-
        nomics and Social Inclusion (MIES) in a workshop (MIES 2013).

        Even though the project has faced delays and implementation challenges (for example, administrative bar-
        riers), Bank involvement and follow-up have been key for the pilot completion and the preparation of key
        documents that would feed the design of the graduation strategy. Activities have been aligned with the
        Bank’s current Interim Strategy Note for the country as well as with operations supporting the BDH CCT
        such as three nonlending technical assistance (TA) products on safety nets, skills and employability, and
        monitoring and evaluation. This PSIA has been successful given that it has fostered a close partnership with
        the national and local governments and has helped build local capacity. The program design can be rep-
        licated or adapted to other subnational governments within the country (Box 4.2).

        Romania: Simulation of the Cost and Outcomes of Safety Nets
        and Activation Policies
        This PSIA supported an ambitious reform of Romania’s social protection system that would merge three
        means-tested social assistance programs into a single flagship anti-poverty program targeting the poorest
        quintile of the population: the Minimum Social Insertion Income (MSIY) program.6 The PSIA simulates the
        poverty and social distributional impacts of the reform of the three programs: the Guaranteed Minimum
        Income (GMI) program, the Family Benefit (FB) program, and the seasonal Heating Benefit (HB) program
        paid during the cold season (World Bank 2013a). Besides consolidating the three programs, the envisaged
        reform will increase the adequacy of the benefits, expand the coverage of the poor, and modify the MSII


        3
         	 The current relationship between the population and the provincial government through the promoters has helped to fulfill this objective.
           The promoters have served as counselors for the families and have been the link between the households and the services offered by the
           different programs.
        4
         	 Supply information was gathered by interviewing key district informants about the location, estimated distance, and travel time from the
           district to the service center. Demand information was gathered by interviewing eligible families; the questionnaire applied to these families
           included relevant modules from the survey of the Registro Social of 2008 and 2013, the survey on social inclusion designed by the Ministry
           of Economic and Social Inclusion (MIES), and the national survey on employment and underemployment. The sixth stage involved a final
           evaluation of processes and results and included another round of data collection (by phone) on the conditions of eligible families after the
           intervention (that is, treated and control families).

         	 The Chimborazo project ended once the results were transferred to the MCDS.
        6
         	 The PSIA was an important element that contributed to the success of this reform. The other funding sources were (a) the supervision bud-
           get of the World Bank’s Social Assistance System Modernization Project loan (World Bank 2011d); (b) the technical assistance financed from
           the loan; and (c) counterpart resources. All of these sources blended to support the progress of the reform (PSIA TTL Emil D. Tesliuc, senior

    BOX 4.2: ECUADOR’S CCT GRADUATION STRATEGY

     The main value added of the PSIA of Ecuador’s CCT graduation strategy is that it has raised awareness among
     key decision makers at the national and local levels, highlighting the importance of consolidating safety nets for
     households that graduate from the CCT program but remain vulnerable (potential risks being the loss of produc-
     tive assets, physical disability, death of a household’s breadwinner, disease, and so on). Safety nets and other
     joint strategies can improve households’ income-generating opportunities and capabilities and can help avoid
     loss of capital.
     Stakeholder engagement, as a key component of policy reform, has been integral to this analysis. The PSIA work
     has showcased the importance of clarifying and coordinating stakeholder responsibilities at various institutional
     levels. The Bank team coordinated the work with the national government (by including features of the counsel-
     ing program under discussion) and at the local level (by agreeing to the terms and implementation plan with the
     provincial government).
     The pilot program was implemented by the local government of Chimborazo Province, in close collaboration
     with local consultants hired by the Bank; managing capacities at Chimborazo were also strengthened. The pro-
     vincial government’s involvement here was essential to informing the program’s design and to leading coordina-
     tion with services implemented by the central government. In addition, the team strongly believes that the
     Chimborazo pilot contributed to raising awareness about the need to work on self-generating income activities
     among the households receiving the BDH. Knowledge acquired through the pilot program has been shared with
     the governments of Dominican Republic and Peru.

program benefit to one that stimulates work.7 The PSIA also assessed the practice of school conditionality
in Romania against the international benchmarks and made recommendations for improving its effective-
ness. The findings of the PSIA described the notable effects that the simulated reform would have on
employment, human capital development, poverty and inequality reduction, policy improvement, and the
political economy for the reform in Romania (World Bank 2014c).

Employment effects. In 2012, a quarter of the adults in the poorest quintile were neither in employment,
education, disability, nor training (NEEDT) (Bachas 2013b). The PSIA used Household Budget Survey (HBS)
data and LCA (discussed earlier in Box 4.1)8 to separate the bottom quintile of NEEDT individuals into
eight homogeneous groups, ranked by their distance from the labor market (probability of being
employed).9 The analysis quantified the size of these groups and described their characteristics, employ-
ment barriers, and the type of active labor market programs (ALMPs) that could increase their probability
of employment.

Among the poor NEEDT population, about one-third were found to be easily employable, and another
third would require significant assistance (such as ALMPs), while the last third had low employment pros-

   ensure that the EU 2020 poverty reduction indicator is met (SPC 2015).

 	 The statistical cluster analysis was based on the 2011 and 2012 rounds of the Romanian HBS. The PSIA helped develop a supplementary
   module to be added to the national HBS, to obtain the necessary data for the proposed estimation strategy and better capture the eligibil-
   ity criteria for means-tested programs and the labor market response of beneficiaries. The LCA for the Minimum Social Integration Income
   (MSIY) program beneficiaries also allowed for an estimate of what proportions of the NEEDTs are easily employable, moderately employ-
   able, or hard to employ. This was a small input that fills in the knowledge gap on how the current means-tested programs work, and how
   the consolidated program may work, according to TTL consultations.

   rate of inactivity. The employment gap by income increases for women (Bachas 2013a).

        pects. Table 4.1 suggests specific activation policies for each NEEDT group of poor who were identified in
        the study. For example, the largest two groups—educated, urban, unemployed men and married, middle-
        aged, rural women—possess good education and previous work experience and are relatively close to the
        labor market. Job search assistance, short training or retraining courses, and childcare policies and tax in-
        centives could be particularly effective for them. The groups of inactive youth have less access to the labor
        market and possess low human capital.

        Another barrier faced by the poor NEEDT population in resuming employment was that their earnings
        would be fully accounted for in reducing their social assistance receipts, up to a threshold. Often, benefi-
        ciaries would lose entitlements to health insurance as well. This type of poverty or benefit trap was incor-
        porated into the design of the GMI program. The PSIA simulated the labor market impact of MSIY if the
        GMI benefit formula would be changed to one with an income disregard. The draft MSIY law adopted by
        the government has introduced a 50 percent income disregard in the benefit formula, to encourage the
        combination of social assistance incomes with other earnings.

        The PSIA recommended an impact evaluation to estimate the magnitude of the employment effects trig-
        gered by the new benefit formula (Gerard 2013a). The actual impacts of a given reform are unknown ex
        ante and can involve unintended consequences. Thus, it is very important to pilot reforms by enabling the
        government of Romania to make informed decisions and readjust program parameters.

        Human capital effects. The reform simulated under the PSIA is also directed at encouraging human capi-
        tal accumulation. The PSIA suggests that the existing school conditionality attached to the social assis-
        tance programs in Romania could be improved by (a) targeting school enrollment and attendance condi-
        tionality toward older students from the poorest families; and (b) rewarding achievement and learning



42   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
(instead of enrollment or attendance). As in the case of financial work incentives, it is important to pilot new
policies first to learn about their impacts, and an impact evaluation may help the government of Romania
to choose new schooling conditions adequately (Gerard 2013b).

Distributional effects. Overall, the introduction of the MSIY program will bring substantial efficiency and
equity gains for the Romanian low-income population. Its implementation will reduce poverty and inequal-
ity in Romania, reduce the administrative and private costs of means-tested programs, and improve work
and human capital accumulation incentives and requirements (World Bank 2014c).

Policy improvement effects. The PSIA exercise has successfully informed the policy dialogue on poverty
reduction and social protection in Romania. The adoption of the legislation and the implementation of the
program are key targets of the Government of Romania. They are supported by a results-based Social As-
sistance System Modernization project tied to a number of disbursement-linked indicators (World Bank
2011d) and by a trigger in the country’s Development Policy Financing (DPF) provisions.

Many of the program features analyzed in the PSIA have been included in the draft MSIY law, such as the
full consolidation of means-tested programs, the introduction of the earning disregards, and the simplifica-
tion of the eligibility and recertification requirements. Under the MSIY, the budget for means-tested pro-
grams will be further increased and will be maintained at this level in real terms thereafter. Given the in-
crease in funds, the coverage of households in the poorest quintile can be expected to increase from the
current level of 60 percent (based on HBS data from the National Institute of Statistics as well as adminis-
trative data) to about 80 percent, with progressive coverage and larger benefit levels for the poorest. This
measure alone would ensure that 580,000 fewer persons would live in poverty by 2020 than in 2008, as-
suming that after the approval of the MSIY legislation in October 2016, necessary actions related to the
upgrade of its management information system (known as SAFIR) are also launched soon after.

Political economy effects. Despite the frequent change in senior counterparts, the PSIA analysis has been
instrumental in maintaining the momentum for the reform, because it has enabled the Bank team to sup-
port the policy engagement with different ministers of Labor, Family, and Social Protection and their
teams.10 After the PSIA ended, the Bank team continued to support this agenda by helping the client draft
the MSIY law and then disseminate it. In May 2016, the law was adopted by the government of Romania
and sent to the Parliament, and was adopted by the Parliament in October 2016. Its implementation ar-
rangements are expected to be ready in two years, with implementation expected to begin in April 2018.

The PSIA has helped to provide Romania’s government with a good understanding of the advantages of
the reform as well as its likely outcomes on reducing poverty and inequality and activating nonworking
MSIY beneficiaries. Because the PSIA captures the effects of the parametric reform on a number of vulner-
able groups (for example, Roma), this reform could be a model for other countries in the Europe and
Central Asia region that have operated several fragmented means-tested programs for such groups.

Fiji: Measuring Targeting Accuracy and Poverty Impact of Social Protection Policies
Two PSIAs on the assessment of the social protection system in Fiji have helped to create the first-ever
poverty maps in the country, which provide a powerful visual depiction of poverty pockets and can help to
ensure that anti-poverty programs reach the poor. Beyond its support of targeting, this work is informative
for the planning process at a subnational level and for analyzing resource allocation and existing programs
(World Bank 2011b). Moreover, in discussing the geographic variation of poverty, another related report
on Fiji’s poverty trends, profiles, and poverty maps has been the first of its kind in the Pacific region to
present highly disaggregated estimates of poverty nationally (World Bank 2011c). Both reports have been
nominated for best economic analysis by the World Bank’s former Human Development Network, particu-

 	 The PSIA team has worked closely with the leadership of the Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (MoLFSP); the General Director-
10

   ate for Social Assistance Policy; the National Agency for Social Benefits and Inspection; staff from the frontline units; and academia and
   research think tanks.

        larly for their use of the Bank’s ADePT tool, an innovative software platform for automated economic and
        poverty analysis (as discussed earlier in the “Tools and Methods” section).

        In collaboration with the Fiji Bureau of Statistics (FBoS) and Department of Social Welfare (DSW), the Bank
        team undertook an extensive analysis of poverty and existing social safety nets in the country to obtain
        data on key social protection programs and to measure the programs’ impact on poverty status. The initial
        PSIA (World Bank 2014d) evaluated the impact of changes in social protection policies on the welfare sta-
        tus of beneficiaries (poverty and inequality).

        As part of a follow-up PSIA, the government of Fiji then asked the Bank to provide technical support in
        implementing new social protection programs, as well as analytical support in measuring the targeting ac-
        curacy (for poverty benefit) and distributional impact of the new programs to inform the government con-
        cerning whether the programs were meeting the original objectives and whether any adjustments (to
        coverage, benefit size, and so on) would be needed in the future to meet the government’s goals (World
        Bank 2014b). The analysis of the design and operational side of the social protection system encompassed
        quantitative and qualitative analysis of the Family Assistance Program (FAP), Fiji’s main social protection
        program.11

        The analysis of poverty and social protection in Fiji identified vulnerable groups and established the key
        performance indicators (targeting accuracy, coverage, benefit size, and poverty impact) of the existing so-
        cial protection system (mostly FAP). The government of Fiji has implemented changes to the social protec-
        tion programs, including more clearly defined program eligibility and improved poverty targeting, follow-
        ing the extensive technical advice received from the Bank over recent years. Following the engagement
        and discussions of the Bank team with DSW and the Ministry of Finance, a Cabinet resolution endorsed two
        key changes to the social protection system in the country: (a) introduction of the Poverty Benefit Scheme
        (PBS) at a household level (targeting the poorest 10 percent of population); and (b) introduction of the old-
        age social pension for people aged 70 years and older. (Few elderly are covered by social insurance from
        the Fiji National Provident Fund, and as a result, the poverty risk for this group is high.)

        One of the key challenges was working with the government’s counterparts on how the proposed policy
        changes could be implemented with no substantial additional budget demand. Following the govern-
        ment’s endorsement of the new social welfare programs, the Bank’s team has been engaged with DSW to
        provide further assistance with implementation (including information technology [IT] support) of the en-
        dorsed policy changes.

        The initial PSIA grant (World Bank 2014d) funded an ex ante evaluation of various policy scenarios, which
        helped inform the subsequent policy reform. The current PSIA exercise (World Bank 2014b) is focused on
        ex post assessment of the approved policy changes and will help the government of Fiji to adjust and fine-
        tune poverty-targeted benefits. With the second PSIA, the Bank and FBoS have been involved in the pre-
        paratory work to evaluate the new social protection programs by designing the new social protection
        module of the 2013/14 HIES—which captures new social transfers introduced by the government early in
        2013. The actual evaluation will still need to be undertaken after the HIES data become available. It is
        important to keep investing in the design of survey instruments that would support monitoring and evalu-
        ation efforts.

        These activities have been implemented smoothly because there has been a strong genuine interest from
        the client. The Bank team shared experiences with FBoS and DSW regarding the design and implementa-
        tion of social welfare programs and assisted the counterparts in in the preparations for a new survey instru-


        11
             The main source of expenditure data was the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) from two rounds: 2002/03 and 2008/09.
             The report also used ADePT to apply the poverty mapping methodology mentioned before and generate highly disaggregated, small-area
             estimates of poverty using the national census of 2007. The analysis was supplemented with quantitative and qualitative data obtained from
             the survey of FAP beneficiaries using ADePT. The Bank team will need to follow up with FBoS on HIES data collection and analysis to ensure
             that data are in place to measure the programs’ impact. HIES data are expected to be of high quality.

ment that captures new programs. The capacity of DSW and FBoS improved as a result of this project. On
one hand, the collaboration between FBoS and the World Bank led to building capacity for poverty mea-
surement. The capacity-building exercise included dedicated training for household surveys under FBoS
using ADePT. On the other hand, DSW has further advanced its capacity to implement targeted social
assistance programs using this software as well.

Overall, findings suggest that the government of Fiji should consider increasing fiscal allocations to ac-
commodate a gradual increase in the coverage of social assistance. Pensions are often found to be the
largest transfer as a share of total per capita expenditure and are a key driver of poverty reduction (as il-
lustrated in the next case, concerning disability benefits in Albania).

Albania: Improving the Effectiveness of Disability Benefits
Disability expenditures in Albania have grown drastically over the past 10 years, increasing by 53 percent
because of increases in both the number of beneficiaries and the level of benefits—at the expense of
other, more poverty-focused programs.12 An MDTF-funded PSIA assessed the profile of recipients of dis-
ability allowances or pensions and examined the impact of proposed disability reforms on current benefi-
ciaries (World Bank 2014a).

This PSIA is innovative in that its results have filled a considerable knowledge gap and have significantly
contributed to the design of disability reforms in Albania. It has improved understanding about (a) the
profile of beneficiaries of disability allowances or pensions in Albania, and (b) how the proposed disability
reforms and potential changes in the system would affect the current beneficiaries. This has helped to bet-
ter understand the political economy surrounding these reforms and how different political constituencies
(major stakeholders) would respond to, and influence the reform efforts. The PSIA made the case for a
much-needed reform in this area at a time when the government of Albania had already been moving
toward reforming its disability assistance program.13

To address the general lack of detailed data on disability, the PSIA team complemented new survey data
from the Albania Disability Survey (World Bank 2012b) with qualitative data from focus groups. Using a
mixed-methods approach for the analysis was useful in this case, given that the qualitative data provided
valuable firsthand experience of beneficiaries. An institutional stakeholder analysis was also conducted to
understand the interests of institutions and organizations that can potentially influence disability reforms,
which was invaluable in presenting a complete picture of the issues and challenges in this area.

Strikingly, the results from the quantitative survey showed that 11 percent of the beneficiaries of the dis-
ability assistance program report no functional disability. The qualitative survey confirmed that benefits
have been poorly allocated. The following factors point to structural weaknesses in assigning and admin-
istering beneficiaries (World Bank 2012b): (a) scattered legislation (special laws for some disability catego-
ries); (b) outdated medical eligibility criteria; (c) medical assessment only (as opposed to medical and
functional assessment); (d) conflict of interest among the players who determine disability; (e) weak mech-
anisms and poor capacity to graduate recipients who are no longer eligible; and (f) weak benefits admin-
istration (paper-based records).

The analysis conducted by this PSIA has been critical to substantiate the reform proposals and policy dia-
logue around the implementation. Specifically, it recommended improvements in equity (by improving the

12
   Disability assistance programs are not part of Albania’s Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS), and no qualitative survey has been
   undertaken before on disability benefits to understand the views of disability assistance beneficiaries and other stakeholders. While overall
   spending on social assistance is comparable with other countries in the region, the composition has gradually shifted away from benefits
   targeted to the poor. Two cash transfer programs account for most of this spending: disability assistance benefits and the Ndihma Eko-
   nomike (NE) program, which is the main poverty-targeted social assistance benefit. The relative balance in spending on these two programs
   has shifted significantly over time in favor of disability benefits. Given the lack of data, this unsustainable increase in disability spending
   could not be explained at the time, before the PSIA was undertaken.

        disability eligibility criteria and processes) and efficiency (by modernizing the administration and strength-
        ening oversight and controls) (World Bank 2014a). This consists of a shift from the medical to the social
        model that includes functional and medical assessments in eligibility determination. Moreover, the PSIA
        recommended the use of a poverty severity index instead of simple poverty headcount in identifying ben-
        eficiaries. This included the recommendation for an automated management information system (MIS).

        The results from this PSIA were used in the design of the results-based Social Assistance Modernization
        Project (SAMP), which currently supports the reforms of the disability assistance program (World Bank
        2012a). The SAMP is a follow-up operation to the Albania Social Sector Reform Development Policy Loan
        (World Bank 2011a) and will support the implementation of these policy changes to ensure that the ben-
        efits accrue to those in need. The PSIA was developed in coordination with the Ministry of Welfare and
        Youth as part of the dialogue and support for disability reforms under the SAMP, which helped to both
        build capacity in the understanding of the challenges in this area and to build the government’s ownership
        of, and commitment to, the disability reform agenda. The PSIA contributed to a better design of the proj-
        ect and also informed important follow-up activities.

        The government of Albania is committed to reforming disability benefits, with fiscal consolidation as the
        driver as well as concerns about equity and efficiency. It has already taken important steps in this direction,
        including the following:

        •	 It has formally endorsed the principles behind disability reforms (the social model) by adopting the
           United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.

        •	 It has also demonstrated its commitment to redressing imbalances in spending by reforming the index-
           ation of disability benefits (from ad hoc to inflation-based).

        The issue of coverage and beneficiary selection should be at the center of the reform agenda on disability
        assistance. A social insurance scheme that pools the health risks over large populations can address the
        high costs of disability without the need to rely on assets. The government of Albania has come a long way
        in designing the disability reform and has pretested it in a small area. The government is now preparing to
        pilot the reform (in fall 2016) and will do an outreach campaign beforehand to communicate its rationale,
        build ownership, and ensure the sustainability of the reforms.14

Chapter 5: Labor Markets
SECTOR OVERVIEW
The role of the government in improving job access has become a key compo-
nent of the development agenda and is actively supported by the World Bank.
Policies following this agenda are often referred to as “activation policies” and
“graduation policies”; they are necessary complements to the successful imple-
mentation of social assistance programs.1 The Bank takes into account the impor-
tance of integrating labor market policies with well-functioning social safety nets
(as further discussed in chapter 4).

According to the Bank’s Social Protection and Labor (SPL) Strategy 2012–2022
(World Bank 2012), SPL systems are being built, refined, or reformed in almost
every country to help their people find jobs; improve their productivity; cope with
shocks; and invest in health, education, and their own well-being. Effective SPL
systems, first, build resilience by ensuring protection against sudden shocks. Sec-
ond, they improve equity by reducing poverty. And third, they promote opportu-
nity to improve people’s productivity and incomes by building their human capital.

The World Bank’s technical and financial assistance has contributed to rigorous
data collection and analysis in this sector to identify policy interventions that im-
prove access to labor markets and labor mobility, with special attention to vulner-
able groups. In the Middle East and North Africa, Europe and Central Asia, South
Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and East Asia and the Pacific regions, one
of the main policy imperatives has been increasing access to economic opportuni-
ties, particularly among more-vulnerable groups, including youth, women, and
ethnic minorities. Schools and universities often fail to impart essential skills to
equip those confronting the challenges of the labor market for transitioning to
adulthood and active citizenship. The benefits of labor market programs do not
always reach young people. Labor informality and exploitation are cited as the
primary concern among employed youth in qualitative research. Young entrepre-
neurs also struggle to gain access to finance, which remains one of the main chal-
lenges in successfully establishing a business.

This chapter presents highlights and insights from Poverty and Social Impact Anal-
yses (PSIAs) on recent reforms in the provision and delivery of active labor market
programs (ALMPs) as well as on challenges related to the labor market integration
of refugees. As part of the ongoing policy dialogue with partner countries, the
PSIA Multi-Donor Task Force (MDTF) has supported distributional and political
economy analysis of labor market reforms in Bangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, China,
Colombia, Ecuador, the Arab Republic of Egypt, India, Jordan, the former Yugo-

  targeted at individuals benefiting from social security with the goal of sufficiently increasing income so they
  do not require social assistance anymore.

         BOX 5.1: BHUTAN’S PIONEERING APPROACH TO CULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT

           In Bhutan, an ex ante impact assessment led by the World Bank and Bhutan’s Ministry of Home and Cultural
           Affairs contributed to a policy shift in the way the Royal Government envisions managing its cultural assets and
           landscape. Facing rapid modernization and the abandonment of ancient cultural practices and entire traditional
           villages, the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) began formulating its first Cultural Heritage Bill in 2010.a In
           line with Bhutan’s sustainable development priorities and Gross National Happiness (GNH) philosophy, the bill
           is envisioned to improve social development, community vitality, and subjective well-being indicators. In this
           context, the MDTF supported a PSIA that assessed the potential implications of the proposed bill for villages,
           their owners and households, their cultural assets, and geographic areas.
           The PSIA had a dual focus: covering both groups who could be potentially impacted by the bill and the institu-
           tional needs for its implementation. Given the novelty of the sector and the lack of referential studies, the PSIA
           refined multiple quantitative and qualitative methods to define a coherent and relevant mixed methods ap-
           proach, including the following:
           •	 Stakeholder analysis and institutional mapping, with interviews and focus group discussions
           •	 Compilation of secondary data from various sources
           •	 Sampling and a baseline survey of 56 potential heritage villages and households and selection of 4 sample
              villages (Drugyel, Korphu, Rinchengang, and Sakteng)
           •	 A rapid appraisal of the remaining traditional houses and their residents in Thimphu
           •	 A poverty assessment to determine the characteristics of those potentially affected by implementation of the bill
           •	 Comparative case studies on incentive mechanisms, penalties, and funding mechanisms
           The PSIA determined the profiles of “vernacular heritage sites” and described the potential impacts of the bill
           along four key transmission channels: assets, employment, financial architecture, and governance. Its findings
           confirmed the need for revisions to the proposed bill to imbue greater value to heritage assets and establish
           formal mechanisms for their stewardship. In doing so, the bill is now expected to generate employment oppor-
           tunities and overall improvements in living conditions for the rural poor and better achieve GNH principles. The
           PSIA also recommended special attention to the most marginalized and vulnerable groups to further support
           these principles. The PSIA has also provided the RGoB with a robust and practical framework for the upstream
           assessment of its cultural heritage policies.
           The World Bank team worked closely with its counterparts at the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs to ensure
           that the analytical work was embedded in the ongoing policy discussions.b Moreover, the team acted as a con-
           vener and facilitator bringing together key government agencies that used to work in isolation. This is resulting
           in more concerted efforts for the formulation of an integrated approach to the stewardship of Bhutan’s cultural
           landscapes. Upon completion of this PSIA, the RGoB and the Bank have remained engaged on the Cultural
           Heritage Bill through a follow-up PSIA on the bill’s implementation.
           This PSIA is the first at the World Bank that explores the role of culture in sustainable development. It demon-
           strated the unique value and potential of culture for economic and social development, particularly for the poor-
           est in rural areas. Hence, it is likely to contribute to a strategic shift in the Bank’s portfolio in Bhutan by system-
           atically incorporating culture as an intrinsic driver of a more inclusive development.

tion to a regional PSIA in South Asia. Moreover, PSIAs on unique issues such as preservation of cultural
heritage in Bhutan (Box 5.1) have spillover effects and highlight the relevance of labor market opportuni-
ties and poverty reduction strategies.


In addition, a PSIA assessed the ex ante poverty and social impact of the planned mechanization policy of
cotton harvest in Uzbekistan on farm workers and vulnerable private farmers, and identified mechanisms
to mitigate the possible negative impacts of this policy on these groups (Swinkels et al. 2016). If success-
fully implemented, an accelerated mechanization effort is expected to have an overall positive impact by
minimizing the need to massively mobilize labor for cotton harvesting. The findings have been influential
in shaping the policy dialogue and the design of Bank operations around the mechanization of the cotton
sector. Results have also been used to design the formal ongoing household survey questionnaire that is
being administered in the country.

Other salient PSIA topics have been youth inclusion in labor markets and refugee dynamics, activation
reform and policies, rural productive inclusion, employability constraints, the minimum wage, work incen-
tives, economic mobility, skills development, gender equity, access to labor markets, and entrepreneurship
opportunities. Good practices presented in this chapter include comprehensive analysis of inclusive labor
market policies in Tunisia to help propel its young population into the workplace and the distributional
impact of refugee influx on Turkey’s formal and informal labor markets.


TOOLS AND METHODS
In the area of labor markets, PSIAs have collected data through a variety of qualitative methods (such as
interviews, questionnaires, and narrative stories to build in-depth qualitative research) and quantitative
methods (such as numeric survey ratings and innovative quantitative assessments that integrate various
tools and data sources). For instance, analysis conducted in Tunisia to examine issues of youth exclusion
used a combination of tools and methods (World Bank 2015b): (a) rigorous quantitative analysis of data
from two household surveys for rural and urban Tunisia, which include a combined household and youth
survey tool; (b) comprehensive qualitative research results from youth groups from all around the country;
and (c) an institutional assessment of current ALMPs and services for the youth. The methodology devel-
oped under this PSIA was designed for future use across other regions and the Bank’s Global Practices to
collect youth-relevant data globally. It uses a holistic conceptual framework that understands youth inclu-
sion as multidimensional policy challenge.

In the case of a PSIA in Turkey that assesses the distributional impact of Syrian refugees in Turkish host
communities (World Bank 2015a), the team benefited from the availability of quality data on both Syrian
refugees’ origins2 and destination regions. The PSIA uses a novel instrument to measure the wage and
employment effects related to the influx of refugees into Turkish labor markets. The instrument uses a
measure of travel distance to make sure that the labor market impacts are not confounded with other
place-specific characteristics that influence economic trends and are correlated with distance from the
border. The strategy behind this instrument is based on the idea that travel distance from the Syrian gov-
ernorate (from which the refugee is fleeing) to each potential destination region3 on the Turkish side is a
key determinant of refugee location decisions and thereby can be used to control for certain unobservable
characteristics (as further discussed in Box 5.2).

         BOX 5.2: TRAVEL DISTANCE INSTRUMENTING STRATEGY

           In the migration literature, it is fairly common to use travel distance as an instrument for measuring impact. The
           instrument uses the fact that refugees from different Syrian governorates will use different border crossings
           (there are 10 between Turkey and Syria) to reach different parts of Turkey, generating considerable variation in
           travel distances. Once Del Carpio, Wagner, and Triebe (2015) included controls for distance from the border, none
           of the employment estimates is statistically significant, and the magnitude of the point estimate for the overall
           employment effect is small. Even without the distance controls, only the instrumental variable results for formal
           employment are statistically significant, and they suggest a negative pre-trend: the instrument is negatively cor-
           related with the fraction of people in a subregion who attend school.
           However, the potential shortfall of this instrument is that distance may also be capturing other differences be-
           tween communities: the key threat to the validity of any distance-based instrument is that subregions that are
           close to a border crossing will systematically differ from those farther away. The PSIA team was able to directly
           deal with this concern by including a high-order polynomial of the inverse distance from the closest Syrian bor-
           der crossing to the most populous city in each Turkish subregion as a control variable. Thus, the team’s estimates
           do not confound the impact of refugees on the Turkish labor markets with unobservable characteristics that are
           correlated with distance from the border.
           Moreover, placebo tests show that the instrument is uncorrelated with preexisting trends in employment as well
           as with the likely impact of the 2012 education reform. Del Carpio, Wagner, and Triebe (2015) run regressions
           using data from the Turkish Household Labor Force Survey (LFS) 2009 and 2011. As a placebo test, the authors
           pretend that the Syrian refugees arrived between 2009 and 2011, rather than between 2011 and 2014, to see
           whether the instrument is correlated with Turkish outcomes in this preceding period. The tests show that the
           instrument is uncorrelated with preexisting trends in employment or with the likely impact of a major 2012
           education reform.
           Identification relies on the fact that there are multiple border crossings between Turkey and Syria, and Syrians
           from different provinces have a differential likelihood of using any one of these. Once distance controls are in-
           cluded, the key identifying assumption of the instrument is that unobserved trends in economic outcomes in a
           subregion systematically depend only on its proximity to the border, while the flow of Syrian refugees also de-
           pends on the degree to which Syrians from each governorate are likely to flee to Turkey and the different border
           crossings they are likely to use. The instrument is significant at the 1 percent significance level in every specifica-
           tion estimated, showing that despite controlling directly for distance from the border, the instrument provides
           sufficient identifying variation.

HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD PRACTICES

Turkey: Impact of Syrian Refugee Influx on Turkish Host Communities
The PSIA in Turkey filled an important knowledge gap by examining the distributional impact of Syrian
refugees on Turkey’s formal and informal labor markets.4 The PSIA uses an innovative travel distance instru-
menting strategy (further discussed in Box 5.2) to assess the wage and employment effects among differ-
ent segments of the host population (World Bank 2015a). The analysis is part of a larger research project
with development partners that involved intense cross-sectoral work within the World Bank and with dif-
ferent ministries in the government of Turkey (Brenner et al. 2015).

In late 2014, as noted earlier, reliable information on the number and distribution of Syrian refugees across
subregions of Turkey became available. The PSIA combines this information with a survey from the Disas-
ter and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) on the origin cities of Syrian refugees and with the 2011
and 2014 Turkish Household Labor Force Surveys to assess the impact of the refugee influx on Turkish la-
bor market conditions (Del Carpio, Wagner, and Triebe 2015). The instrumental variable estimates are
consistent with one-for-one displacement of Turkish workers by Syrian refugees in a local labor market.

The full impact of the presence of Syrian refugees on the labor market has yet to be analyzed. Neverthe-
less, preliminary findings suggest that the refugees, who overwhelmingly do not have work permits, result
in the displacement of informal, low-educated, frequently unpaid, female Turkish workers, especially in
agriculture. The fact that the magnitude of the estimated displacement effect is very large reflects the high
degree of substitutability between refugees and certain Turkish workers (informal, part-time, and field
workers). It also likely reflects the relocation of Turkish workers across provinces (Del Carpio, Wagner, and
Triebe 2015).

Although there is net displacement, the inflow of refugees also creates higher-wage formal jobs, allowing
for occupational upgrading of Turkish workers. This is likely because refugees decrease the costs of pro-
duction for Turkish firms (an expansion of the supply of certain types of labor), resulting in a scale effect
that appears to outweigh the substitution effect for formal, regular jobs, thus increasing the demand for
those types of jobs. In the same vein, all the negative employment effects of the refugee flow is in part-
time work, with the number of full-time jobs practically unaffected. Among women, the displacement from
the labor market is also associated with an increase in school attendance. The resulting average wage in-
crease is likely because some of those who would have experienced wage losses exited the labor market.

To fully assess the potential impact of work permits, allowing the Syrian refugees to join the formal Turkish
labor market in the longer term, would require an understanding of the skill set of the refugee population.
Currently, little is known about the refugees who have arrived in Turkey, making data collection a priority.
In addition to the research itself (Del Carpio, Wagner, and Triebe 2015),5 the PSIA contributed to (a) the
establishment of a steering committee, consisting of different government agencies and international or-
ganizations, to share knowledge and oversee the research; (b) the development of a representative sam-
pling methodology that will be used for future research; (c) a forthcoming quantitative survey with a great-
er emphasis on the labor market challenges and opportunities for Syrians and host community Turks, which
will likely be undertaken in the first half of 2017; and (d) a forthcoming qualitative research survey that will
also focus on labor market challenges and opportunities, scheduled to be conducted during early 2017.6

        The PSIA has had long-reaching influence already:

        •	 It has had an impact on the ongoing Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) of Turkey.

        •	 It is expected to provide inputs to the next Country Partnership Framework.

        •	 It has supported the policy dialogue with the Ministries of Labor and Education, the Directorate Gen-
           eral of Migration Management, and the Disaster Prevention Agency on structuring programs for refu-
           gees. Sessions have been held with these institutions to discuss experiences of development programs
           targeted toward long-term displaced individuals around the world.

        The government of Turkey and the World Bank are currently working in partnership on a program of tech-
        nical assistance that aims to identify and mitigate the impact of Syrians under Temporary Protection (SuTP)
        on Turkish host communities. The need to manage host-refugee tensions is an opportunity to learn how to
        prevent social tensions through intercommunal interaction and trust building. Overall, through a collab-
        orative approach, the Bank has been able to gain the counterparts’ trust and buy-in by demonstrating that
        the research will generate important insights.

        The key challenge facing the government of Turkey now is to mitigate the potential negative socioeconomic
        impacts of hosting SuTP while building on the positive contributions refugees can make and supporting
        them to be self-reliant until they are able to return to Syria. Investments should be designed to relieve the
        socioeconomic pressures on host communities and ensure the spread of benefits to them. This should in-
        clude lessons on how municipalities can be supported to respond to refugees (World Bank 2015b).

        Tunisia: Youth Inclusion Study
        In Tunisia, the MDTF cofunded a PSIA to provide evidence on the socioeconomic integration of young
        people who are neither in education, employment, nor training (NEET). Young NEETs aged 15–29 years
        are most affected by economic exclusion in Tunisia, representing an estimated 33 percent of the popula-
        tion—one of the highest rates in the region (CMI, World Bank, and ONJ 2014). This work supported the
        Tunisia Youth Inclusion economic and sector work (ESW) and assessed the impact of recent ALMP reforms
        and proposed reforms on labor market intermediation7 to inform the Tunisia Employment Development
        Policy Loan II. The PSIA was successful in shaping the overall youth agenda in the Maghreb region, even
        beyond Tunisia.

        Instead of approaching youth development only through a narrow “job lens” (economic inclusion), it uses
        a cross-sectoral approach that covers the following dimensions: (a) participation and active citizenship, (b)
        access to economic opportunities, and (c) youth-friendly services at the local level (Figure 5.1). The multi-
        dimensional youth policy approach connects education to jobs in a three-way collaboration among the
        school system, technical colleges, and local corporate partners. The analysis quantified key issues in youth
        participation and identified levels of trust in various institutions by various youth segments.8

        The report recommends that costly ALMPs geared to help university graduates should be redirected to-
        ward young people with lower levels of education (World Bank 2015b). Further, there is a need for more
        nongovernmental and civil society organizations to bring young people closer to other local institutions.
        Young Tunisians need better career guidance in universities and schools, with their formal education ex-
        tending to technical and life skills as well as foreign languages. Moreover, better Internet coverage could
        lead to increased use of online job sites. Last, promoting self-employment among young people by facili-
        tating access to credit is seen as an effective option to redress social and regional disparities.

This analysis involved intense collaboration across the World Bank’s Global Practices and benefited from
synergies in the policy dialogue with country’s stakeholders. This PSIA has informed the Tunisia Urbaniza-
tion Review; the Tunisia ESW, “Breaking the Barriers to Youth Inclusion” (CMI, World Bank, and ONJ 2014);
the Country Partnership Strategy under preparation; and a new World Bank investment project under
preparation, “Productive Inclusion Opportunities for Young Women and Men”. The ESW put in place a
cross-sectoral steering committee that fosters in-country partnerships and created for the first time a plat-
form for exchanging views on youth inclusion across institutions, and including youth stakeholders.9 The
intense engagement underlying this work also helped strengthen the capacity of Tunisia’s National Youth
Observatory (Observatoire National de la Jeunesse, or ONJ), which acts as a communications bridge be-
tween young people and the government, focusing on challenges and policy issues related to the youth.

Chapter 6: Education
SECTOR OVERVIEW
Education policy is one of the key policy priorities of governments to reduce pov-
erty and improve shared prosperity. As mentioned in chapter 2 on fiscal policy,
education has direct and indirect effects on the growth and the distribution of in-
comes in the medium and long term as well as other important social benefits for
individuals and society at large. Across the developing world, one crucial policy
mandate has been increasing access to higher quality and more efficient educa-
tion services, particularly of the more vulnerable groups. These issues are particu-
larly critical in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and Latin America and the Carib-
bean, as the countries in these regions have reached universal enrollment at the
primary and secondary levels of education. However, socially disadvantaged stu-
dents, especially at the secondary level, face significant barriers to completing
school and pursuing a tertiary education, with sizable differences depending on
students’ location, gender, and socioeconomic background.

One of the key issues in this sector is the high risk of student dropouts. Vulnerable
students miss more hours, especially those living in rural areas and farther away
from schools. In some countries and regions, especially poorer ones, students are
more likely to end their studies once they reach the of their mandatory education
period (usually primary school). Moreover, schools and universities often fail to
impart skills that adequately equip students for formal and constantly changing
labor markets, while, in some countries, university admissions are discretionary
and lack transparency. All these issues create disincentives for girls and boys to
stay in school and complete their tertiary education. Addressing these challenges
requires attention to issues such as school attendance, dropout rates, and school
performance.

To address these issues and support the World Bank Group’s twin goals of reduc-
ing poverty and boosting shared prosperity, the Bank’s financial and technical as-
sistance has contributed robust data collection and analysis on education to iden-
tify well-targeted policy interventions that improve governance and support
equity in access to, and completion of, higher education. These analyses have
supported the development of national legislation and programs to tackle school
dropouts and other key issues while strengthening accountability of education
services providers in the country.

Although there have been many Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) across
all regions of the World Bank Group (Belarus, Brazil, Colombia, India, Malawi,
Serbia, and Tajikistan, to name a few), this chapter presents the main insights and
contributions from two sets of PSIAs that were instrumental in supporting recent
education reforms in Mexico and Moldova. These PSIAs have produced key data
and information on student enrollments, school attendance, student transfers,
and school performance to inform ongoing education reforms. These analyses


                                                                                   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016   57
        have strategically informed the overall design of policies and programs and have contributed to improve-
        ments in their implementation. They have also been successful in strengthening the capacity of country
        counterparts and building in-country partnerships on education policy reforms.


        TOOLS AND METHODS
        Education PSIAs often rely on mixed-method approaches combining both qualitative and quantitative
        methods to support policy reform and inform program and operational lending. As the two sets of PSIAs
        in this chapter highlight, a wide range of methods can be used depending on the specific education re-
        form, including randomized control trials (where possible), panel data, group discussions, and face-to-face
        interviews. Data are generally derived from existing information systems such as censuses or surveys or
        other official data available nationally and internationally.

        In Moldova, the PSIA aimed to understand the impact of school network optimization on school atten-
        dance. As Figure 6.1 shows, the government planned to close down particular schools and improve the
        quality of others. This would have an impact on the student population and their education. The PSIA fo-
        cused on understanding and recommending policy options to address any negative impacts.

        The PSIA relied on descriptive statistics and regression analysis using data from the 2009 Programme for
        International Student Assessment (PISA) Plus and the student-level education measurement information
        system (EMIS). It focused on students in areas where the school population was directly affected by the
        reform to determine whether it had an immediate negative impact on them. The information was used to
        develop a profile of the bottom 40 percent of primary and secondary school students compared with their
        well-off peers, as well as to identify determinants of student performance and attendance.

        Differences in performance outcomes can be due to a range of factors, which can broadly be classified into
        either individual characteristics (inherent to the student) or the external environment (such as the school or
        its geographical location). However, students in similar schools will likely have some similar characteristics
        and potentially similar performance outcomes. In other words, their performance outcomes may be af-
        fected by shared variance such as their location or similar classroom size or the same teacher. To under-
        stand the variation due to the different sets of characteristics and account for correlations within these, the
        quantitative analysis employed hierarchical regression modeling. The analysis explained how much varia-
        tion in performance was predicted by the student characteristics (such as individual socioeconomic status,
        gender, ethnicity, urban-rural, or other vulnerabilities) and how much was due to school attributes (such as
        class size, student-teacher ratio, proportion of qualified teachers, and socioeconomic school composition).1
        It confirmed the importance of both individual and school-level variables, but it also showed that the ur-
        ban-rural divide was not a significant factor in student outcomes once the analysis was controlled for the
        school’s socioeconomic composition.

        Quantitative analysis was supplemented with qualitative analysis. The qualitative study aimed to under-
        stand how much information on education reforms, including “quality indicators,” was reaching students,
        parents, teachers, and school directors—and what information is needed on performance and other pa-
        rameters of education at their institution to be able to demand better education for the students. To do
        this, the study employed focus groups and semistructured interviews with a sample of school stakeholders.
        Focus groups were conducted with students and parents and were stratified (by a community deprivation
        index) in urban and rural communities. Semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted with school-


        1
         	 Use of hierarchical regression models in education-related analyses allow for distinguishing the impact of school characteristics versus
           student characteristics. These models also better account for shared variance or correlation within these characteristics. The analysis em-
           ployed student-level EMIS and PISA 2009 Plus datasets. Although the student-level EMIS and PISA 2009 Plus datasets have valuable data
           on various aspects of schooling in Moldova, the EMIS is not without shortcomings (in particular, regarding the completeness of the data on
           student vulnerabilities), limiting possible analysis. Data from Moldova’s participation in the 2015 PISA round (which was supported by the
           World Bank Moldova Education Reform Project) should be released by the end of 2016 and will considerably improve the available data
           for any future analysis of the role of socioeconomic background on education of importance for education policy makers (World Bank 2015).

teachers, school administrators, and educational authorities to see what information is available for stake-
holders’ oversight of the school work and its performance (Olefir et al. 2015). These analyses comple-
mented each other to identify the determinants of performance and attendance that can be influenced
through education reforms to improve the quality of education for all students including the most vulnerable.

In Mexico, the PSIA relied on a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and positive deviance (PD) to analyze and
assess different aspects of education reforms (Box 6.1). The RCT supported the design of a strategy to
evaluate the effects of the government of Mexico flagship scholarship program for students at risk of drop-
ping out of school. PD was used to identify “positive deviant” students, learn from them, and devise a set
of remediation strategies to support students at risk of dropping out.

As mentioned, both sets of PSIAs were useful in informing different aspects of education policies in two
very different contexts. The next section sheds more light on the PSIAs themselves and their outcomes.

         BOX 6.1: POSITIVE DEVIANCE AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL
         IN MEXICO’S EDUCATION REFORM


            Positive deviance (PD) is a problem-solving approach based on the observation that in any community there
            are people (positive deviants) whose uncommon but successful behaviors or strategies enable them to find
            better solutions to a problem than their peers, despite facing similar challenges and having no extra resourc-
            es or knowledge than their peers. This approach was used as part of Mexico’s PSIA on education reform to
            identify students who were positive deviants and remained in school despite facing similar challenges as
            dropouts. The approach was featured in the qualitative evaluation of the Movement against Dropout (Mov-
            imiento contra el Abandono, or MCA) program and the decentralized nature of the targeting of scholarships.
            The MCA early detection toolkit selects schools according to their success and failures in reducing dropouts
            to identify students at risk and a set of remediation strategies.
            The PD methodology consists of five basic steps: define, determine, discover, and design, with monitoring and
            evaluation (happening throughout the four Ds).
            In Mexico, using the PD approach, schools were selected according to their success and failure in reducing
            dropouts. The selected schools were included in the MCA program. This approach to school selection allowed
            the PSIA to (a) conduct rigorous impact evaluations of different aspects of the Reform of Higher Secondary
            Education (Reforma Integral de la Educación Media Superior, or RIEMS); and (b) detect a number of opera-
            tional lessons and to either confirm or refute assumptions that program operators had at the central level. This
            approach has a great advantage of being able to be implemented quickly and therefore to course-correct the
            intervention in a short period of time. PD projects in Argentina, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and the United States
            (New Jersey and California) have addressed dropout rates and the challenges associated with keeping girls in
            school.
            In addition, the PSIA team designed the evaluation for the scholarship program as a randomized controlled
            trial (RCT). RCT is a study or experiment that aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment or interven-
            tion, by randomly assigning individuals to either the intervention group receiving the treatment under inves-
            tigation or to a control group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment). RCTs have been used in
            evaluating a number of educational interventions for many years now (for example, trainees are randomly
            assigned to receive one of two or more educational interventions). Well-designed and implemented RCTs are
            considered the “gold standard” for evaluating an intervention’s effectiveness because they allow for the
            evaluation of an intervention itself, as opposed to other factors, for causes of the observed outcomes.
            The PSIA helped to design the RCT. Once implemented, it will have the advantage of being able to attribute
            causality to the intervention, even though this will take a longer time, and some schools may not be able to
            participate in the exercise because of financial constraints.

HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD PRACTICES

Mexico: Reducing Dropouts among the Poor in Upper-Secondary Education
In 2007, the government of Mexico introduced the Reform of Higher Secondary Education (Reforma Inte-
gral de la Educación Media Superior, or RIEMS) to address the challenges faced in the country’s upper
education system. At 40 percent, the dropout rate at the upper-secondary (Educación Media Superior, or
EMS)2 level was exceptionally high when reforms were initiated. A considerable proportion (40 percent) of
those who left school in their first year came from the poorest households (in the bottom 40 percent of the
income distribution). The high opportunity cost of education, poor educational quality, and low flexibility
in programs (to allow for transfers or to switch educational tracks) contributed toward these dropouts.

To address these issues, the reform established a National Secondary Education System (Sistema Nacional
de Bachillerato, SNB) to align EMS among the four different providers (federal, state [school], public uni-
versity, and private). The main elements of the reform include the following:

•	 Competency-based curriculum (CBC), which moves teaching away from the memorization of facts
•	 Coordination and regulation, which sets up common bodies to guide a diverse EMS system
•	 Certification, which acknowledges the adoption of the reform by systems, schools, and students
•	 New tools and institutions that support capacity building and monitoring and evaluation
•	 Mentoring and student welfare, aimed at ensuring equity

In support of these reforms, the World Bank provided technical assistance to the government of Mexico,
focusing on their impacts in rural Oaxaca through two PSIA. The first PSIA focused on reforms for accredi-
tation policy for schools managed through the SNB—a central element of the ongoing reform (World Bank
2014c). The second PSIA (World Bank 2015) provided support on the following:

•	 The design of a strategy to evaluate (using RCT) the government of Mexico’s flagship scholarship pro-
   gram for at-risk students

•	 Qualitative assessment of the Movement Against Dropout (MCA) early detection toolkit, using a PD
   design whereby schools were selected according to their success and failures in reducing dropouts to
   identify students at risk and a set of remediation strategies (with a focus on the decentralized nature of
   the targeting of scholarships)

•	 Redesign of Construye-T, a youth development program focusing on an innovative socioemotional skills
   (SES) agenda that promotes self-regulation, self-esteem, perseverance, resilience, grit, and empathy as
   key competencies for labor market success.

These PSIA were crucial in helping to elevate policy dialogue and maintain focus on education reforms in
2012 when a new government took office in Mexico. The dialogue helped to align the focus of the PSIA
work with the priorities of the new government, with a stronger focus on school dropouts and disadvan-
taged schools. The earlier PSIA supported a rich policy dialogue with the Secretariat of Public Education
(SEP) and the Council for the Evaluation of Higher Secondary Education (COPEEMS). This dialogue con-
tributed to modifications to the governing rules of the school accreditation system, allowing more disad-
vantaged schools into the SNB and enabling them to receive support for improving their quality of educa-
tion once within the system.

The follow-on PSIA further supported education reforms by bringing greater attention on rural upper-
secondary education and its links to the labor market in poorer states such as Oaxaca. It highlighted the

	 One of the objectives of the EMS is to prepare the student population for the labor market by providing them with competencies and skills

  that are relevant to employers within and outside their communities.

            BOX 6.2: SUPPORTING STUDENTS’ SOCIOEMOTIONAL SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
            IN MEXICO

             In recent years, socioemotional skills (SES) have become a topic of interest in the education discourse. There is a
             general agreement in the literature on the importance of these noncognitive skills, which are demanded by
             employers and are highly valued by labor markets (as much as cognitive skills) because they represent attitudes
             that prevent or minimize risky behaviors. The World Bank has played a crucial role on the SES policy agenda and
             in what works to keep students in school.
             Mexico’s Construye-T youth development program is one of the world’s largest programs focusing on building
             up SES in students, with the Subsecretariat of Upper Secondary Education (SEMS) overseeing its implementa-
             tion. The program is executed at the school level by local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that train
             teachers and school directors on how to build up self-esteem, perseverance, empathy, grit, self-regulation, and
             other SES among high schoolers.
             The PSIA was instrumental in firmly incorporating SES within the education agenda. It correctly identified the
             school environment as the main gateway to improving SES among students. The PSIA provided just-in-time sup-
             port to help the government of Mexico develop a training program for school principals on how to measure and
             improve the environment at their schools. This support included capacity-building workshops that focused on
             innovative ways to building up SES; measure the impact of interventions on SES; and assess, foster, and evaluate
             school environments.
             The Construye-T program provides rich insights into programs aimed at building SES among students. Although
             the importance of such programs has been long recognized by educators, SES have remained relatively mar-
             ginal in the core reforms of educational policy in many countries. Yet more can be done. Countries will benefit
             from incorporating SES into preschool and basic education curricula as well as pedagogic practices through, for
             instance, (a) self-regulation during the preschool years; and (b) motivation, self-esteem, and capacity to develop
             healthy interpersonal relationships during adolescence.
             Youth employment programs should incorporate training components on behavioral (socioemotional) skills in
             addition to technical, basic cognitive, or trade-specific skills. Mentoring programs can also benefit older students
             but are rare and of limited scope. The experiences with similar reforms and interventions in the Australia, Colom-
             bia, Peru, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States offer useful lessons and insights.

        importance of teacher training in pedagogical methods and the latest EMS curricula as well as their skills
        evaluation. It also recommended specialized instruction on rural pedagogic issues such as the use of the
        mother tongue for instruction.

        The PSIA also focused on reducing dropouts by training school principals and teachers on how to identify,
        assess, and respond to at-risk students and by redesigning the scholarship support system and providing
        training opportunities, ensuring that teacher training is well articulated, responds to specific teachers’
        needs, and is accessible to all upper-secondary education teachers. This approach also supported those
        aspects of the reforms that aim to ensure that poorer and indigenous populations are well targeted.

        The technical dialogue helped strengthen the capacity of the Subsecretariat of Upper Secondary Educa-
        tion (SEMS),3 supporting its ability to address evolving policy priorities in a just-in-time fashion. The PSIA

supported an extensive knowledge sharing process aimed at SEMS’s policy makers so that they could
learn from the latest research at the World Bank and best international practices. These workshops built
the capacity of the federal and the state education authorities (Box 6.2) regarding teacher policies, policies
for at-risk students, strategies for transitioning to the labor market, and general upper-secondary reform
issues such as pedagogical approaches to reduce dropouts among the poor.4

These PSIAs were critical to the Bank’s engagement in Mexico, supporting the development of a series of
three development policy operations (DPOs) operations on education. The PSIAs contributed to the suc-
cessful closure of the Second DPO on Upper Secondary Education in Mexico and laid the foundation for
the third DPO by providing critical technical support.5 In middle-income countries such as Mexico—where
there is greater interest in Bank support through technical assistance than through lending operations—
the PSIAs played a pivotal role in maintaining the momentum of education reforms and drove the Bank’s
lending linked to them.6 These PSIA outcomes on upper-secondary education are relevant not only for
Mexico but also for many other countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region.

Moldova: Education Outcomes among Disadvantaged Groups
Moldova is among the poorest countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and lags behind on its human
development indicators compared with other countries in the region. The poorest population, which is
concentrated mainly in rural areas, has the worst education outcomes; they lag behind their peers in urban
areas. This is also reflected in the level of satisfaction, with the bottom 40 percent expressing more dis-
satisfaction with the quality of education than the upper 60 percent of households by income (Olefir et al.
2015). Improving the quality, relevance, and efficiency of the education system, especially for the socially
disadvantaged population, is one of the key priorities of the government of Moldova.

This PSIA was conducted to support the government’s efforts to reform the education system (World Bank
2014a). It focused on the impact of the school network optimization reform component on school atten-
dance. This PSIA builds on an earlier analysis that highlighted the importance of updated, reliable data on
education decision making (World Bank 2014b). This earlier analysis supported the collection and analysis
of data on enrollments, attendance, and movement of over 66,000 students in the eight southern regions
of Moldova and provided inputs for the design of the Moldova Education Reform Project (MERP).

Following the success of the first PSIA, Moldova’s Ministry of Education (MoE) decided to conduct a sec-
ond, nationwide PSIA exercise in support of the MERP (World Bank 2014a). Using mixed methods, this
PSIA aimed to (a) examine the distributional impacts of the school network consolidation to inform ongo-
ing education reforms, including ensuring that students directly affected by the reform are adequately
accommodated in the “receiving” schools; and (b) analyze the determinants of performance and atten-
dance of Moldovan students to support improvements in the quality of education for students (both girls
and boys) from all socioeconomic backgrounds.

The information produced as a result of the PSIA was pivotal in the development of a student-level educa-
tion management information system (EMIS) to guide decision making. The PSIA relied on descriptive
statistics and regression analysis using data from the 2009 Programme for International Student Assess-
ment (PISA) Plus and the EMIS. Regression analysis of determinants of students’ absence shows that, for
student grades, both individual and school characteristics do matter; vulnerable students miss more hours
(with and without excuse), and among vulnerable students, the impact of additional risk factors depends
on the grade level.

        The analysis also shows that the urban-rural divide is not significant once one controls for school socioeco-
        nomic composition; urban students miss fewer hours without excuse, and students who have to travel less
        than 3 kilometers to school miss about 13 percent fewer hours, which underlines the importance of contin-
        ued monitoring of attendance and dropouts in relation to the school network consolidation process using
        the EMIS. Indeed, this EMIS has been supporting the development of national legislation and programs to
        address school dropouts while strengthening accountability of education services providers in the country.
        The EMIS has been useful in highlighting the importance of the continued need to monitor attendance
        and dropouts of the resettled school population to ensure that they are adequately accommodated.

        These PSIA have provided several valuable policy insights for the delivery of quality teaching and learning
        across the entire education system in Moldova. The PSIA included stakeholder consultations with students,
        parents, teachers, and school principals to learn about their knowledge and understanding of school reforms
        as well as their feedback on the type of information that would be useful to them. This has provided valuable
        insights for policy makers at the MoE and the World Bank Group for its ongoing operations in the country.

        The PSIA have been successful in strengthening the government’s capacity to perform analytical work re-
        lated to education reforms and investments and has had an important influence on in-country partner-
        ships. This included a training workshop for the MoE, the Centre for Information and Communication
        Technologies in Education, and education-related NGOs, mainly the Institute for Public Policy and the Pro
        Didactica Educational Center. This helped strengthen the capacity of these institutions on data analysis
        related to the reforms.

        One of the main contributions of the education reforms PSIA in Moldova is the improved capacity of the
        MoE’s Quality Assurance Agency to analyze student performance and inform the implementation of the
        ongoing MERP. Based on the findings of the PSIA, the Quality Assurance Agency has incorporated a basic
        questionnaire on socioeconomic background of students into the examination process.

        The PSIA process has also helped to advance the implementation of the Disbursement Linked Indicator
        (DLI) 10 under the MERP: “Revised national testing of all 4th and 9th grade students completed and its
        results analyzed, publically disseminated and used by the MoE” (World Bank 2014a). It also supports the
        ongoing Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and the Country Partnership Framework’s objective of im-
        proved quality of and access to education services. Based on the PSIA, the key next steps for implementa-
        tion include the following (World Bank 2014a):1

        •	 Implementation of reforms of the national student assessment system to increase the reliability and
           credibility of results and align with international standards and best practices
        •	 Optimizing or “right-sizing” the school network through the application of per capita budget allocations
        •	 Accelerating implementation of school quality assurance standards
        •	 Developing and implementing school principal training program, with a focus on school management
           and launching reform of teacher and director policies
        •	 Expanding the EMIS to encompass all subsectors, not only the primary and secondary levels
        •	 Reforming curriculum across the different levels of the education system

        Overall, the education PSIAs have supported policy dialogue on efficiency and inclusive education reforms
        in Moldova. The PSIA process is scalable and replicable, as the experience in Moldova has shown. The
        MoE is interested in conducting a similar analysis to compare performance across students from different
        socioeconomic groups. Continued strengthening of the statistical and analytical capacity in the country to
        populate and utilize the EMIS will be important for keeping education reforms on track and promoting
        accountability at all levels of the school system.

                                SECTOR OVERVIEW
                                The right to health is a fundamental human right—one that is guaranteed and
                                protected by most countries (Backman et al. 2008). Ensuring equitable access to
                                quality, affordable health services is an important policy area that has gathered
                                greater prominence in recent years with the global movement toward universal
                                health coverage (UHC).2 Health outcomes are also closely related to income and
                                productivity. While higher incomes facilitate better nutrition, health awareness,
                                and access to health services, better health outcomes support higher human cap-
                                ital formation, contributing to a country’s economic development (Bloom and
                                Canning 2000, 2003). This dynamic makes health an integral part of a country’s
                                development agenda.

                                However, public expenditure on health care is often very low, especially in devel-
                                oping (low- to middle-income) countries. Although private spending is on the rise,
                                it is uneven and reflective of the income disparities in a country. This uneven
                                spending contributes to two of the main barriers to better health outcomes, espe-
                                cially among lower-income households: (a) weak health systems that afford only
                                limited, uneven access and poor quality of services; and (b) increased financial
                                burden in accessing health care. Of particular concern are catastrophic out-of-
                                pocket (OOP) health expenditures that place a huge and unexpected financial
                                burden on household budgets (see, for example, Xu et al. 2003). Those who are
                                uninsured and poor have less capacity to absorb such health shocks than those
                                who are insured and have higher incomes. At the same time, uneven supply of
                                essential medicines and vaccines, shortages in the health workforce, and poor
                                health infrastructure and facilities contribute to higher levels of preventable morbid-
                                ity and mortality. This is especially relevant to maternal and child health outcomes.

                                As countries implement reforms aimed at strengthening health systems and im-
                                proving health equity, a key consideration is how to adapt and enhance existing
                                poverty-targeting mechanisms and health systems to achieve UHC. Having timely,
                                relevant information on distributional impacts is an important starting point in this
                                process. The Bank has begun undertaking rigorous data collection and analysis
                                through Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) to identify well-targeted policy
                                interventions for achieving UHC. Across the World Bank’s regions, PSIAs are in-

                                PSIAs cover diverse topics such as coverage, quality, and affordability of health

services; increasing access to health services; determining health insurance premiums and copayments;
and capacity building for health equity and financial protection analysis.

This chapter presents the main insights and contributions from select PSIAs in the health sector. These
PSIAs used innovative approaches to measure and analyze data to inform Bank-supported operations. In
Kosovo, for instance, the PSIA supported a comprehensive analysis of health reform policies focusing on
the development of pro-poor health insurance packages (World Bank 2015). In Kenya, the PSIA examined
the public sector supply chain to understand whether the infrastructure and pharmaceutical budget alloca-
tion formula are biased against poorer communities (World Bank 2014c). Similarly, the PSIA in Senegal
focuses on providing more-equal and affordable reproductive health care (World Bank 2014a), while the
PSIA in Vietnam revolves around closing equity gaps in the quality of health services and in access to
health care across regions and different population groups (World Bank 2014b).

These PSIAs have been successful in terms of the using sophisticated, mixed-method analytical approach-
es and a rich policy dialogue around reforms in the health sector. They have provided or combined key
data for policy makers to identify and address the obstacles to the utilization of affordable, quality basic
health care services by the poor, particularly by women.


TOOLS AND METHODS
The tools and methods used for health sector analyses at the World Bank are as diverse as the topics they
cover. Health PSIAs successfully combine different instruments using a mix of methods to analyze distribu-
tional impacts of different health reforms. The choice of methods mainly relies on the availability of up-to-
date, quality data. Data sources in health are relatively limited and of varying quality compared with other
sectors such as transport or water. Although health specific surveys exist, they have limited information on
other aspects such as employment and income. On the other hand, household budget surveys collect
limited information on health care services. Such limitations are reflected in the data collection and ana-
lytical choices of the PSIAs highlighted here.

Multiple forms of data collection were used for the PSIAs covered in this chapter. Qualitative approaches
involved in-depth interviews, focus groups, and literature reviews. Main sources for quantitative analysis
included health facility surveys, censuses, household budget surveys, and other specialized surveys as well
as Ministry of Health records.

The PSIA in Kosovo is another good illustration of how mixed-methods approaches can be used to provide
real time information. The PSIA supported the Bank’s policy dialogue with the Ministry of Health on the
design and implementation of Kosovo’s mandatory health insurance scheme and its benefits package. Us-
ing triangulation, the PSIA collected data in three iterative stages, with earlier stages informing the later
stages (Figure 7.1). The analysis quantified the distributional impact of proposed health insurance reforms
on poverty. Simulations of the poverty impact of health insurance scenarios were modified to reflect and
inform evolving discussions and help shape the reform proposal.

In other cases, relatively newer and innovative methods such as geospatial analysis are being adapted to
the health sector. For instance, in Kenya the PSIA used a multidisciplinary approach that integrated three
types of datasets—health care facility geocodes, poverty maps, and pharmaceutical supply-chain logistics
(shipping and distribution) data—to provide insights on equity in the distribution of medicines (World Bank
2014c). The use of poverty maps in a geospatial framework provided the best methodology for under-
standing supply-chain network constraints and the geographical dimension of poverty.

The analysis consisted of three related regression exercises using district-level data. This constitutes the
first known effort to take advantage of two recent improvements in data availability in Kenya: district-level
estimates of the incidence of poverty and geospatial information on the precise location of clinics and
dispensaries served by the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA). The analysis overlaid the local-

        level pharmaceutical supply with poverty data to identify gaps in service, supply-chain constraints, and the
        geographical dimension of poverty. This methodology has considerable potential for replication and scal-
        ing up to support policy decisions and is well worth further exploration, especially for understanding sup-
        ply chain gaps in Kenya and elsewhere.

        In Vietnam, the PSIA employed generalizable reducible metrics (GRM) using clinical observation and exit
        surveys for data collection, as further discussed in Box 7.1 (World Bank 2014b). Medical vignettes were
        also used to assess provider knowledge and attitudes while, on the demand side, data were collected on
        households’ backgrounds, including living standards, disabilities, use of medications, preventive medi-
        cine, reproductive health, living environments, health-seeking behaviors, and health expenditures (from
        6,000 households in eight provinces) using a modified version of household module used in the 2001–02
        Vietnam National Health Survey (VNHS).

        In Senegal, the PSIA aimed to understand the reasons behind the lack of demand for maternal health ser-
        vices in the Kedougou region. To do this, the PSIA employed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) approach
        (World Bank 2014a). DCE is an attribute-based measure of preferences that can be used when revealed
        preference data is missing. Individual preferences about goods and services are estimated by the attri-
        butes or characteristics of that good or service. This is a recognized and widely applicable approach for
        eliciting preference data in the health sector.

        The PSIA combined results from a classic demographic household survey that captured socioeconomic
        and health data on each of the 306 women surveyed with preference data from a DCE questionnaire. The
        study design and data collection were carried out in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the
        National Agency for Statistics, and Dakar University. The DCE questionnaire was designed with inputs from
        several focus groups of health workers and pregnant women. The DCE proposed a choice between two
        hypothetical health facilities with six attributes: distance, transport, health care personnel type, health care
        personnel attributes, availability of equipment and drugs, and delivery-associated cost. This choice was
        asked 16 times, with varying levels of attributes. A logistic regression was then used to estimate the impact

    BOX 7.1: GENERALIZABLE REDUCIBLE METRICS AND QUALITY
    OF HEALTH CARE PROVISION

     Various approaches have been used to assess health care quality. Principal approaches include vignette tests of
     health care providers, direct observation of clinical practice, and standardized patients. In this last approach
     (considered the “gold standard”), well-trained individuals act as real patients without the knowledge of the
     health professional, which allows the study to record the practice of the doctor for a “standardized” set of
     symptoms and illness. In Vietnam’s case, the standardized patient approach was determined to be prohibitively
     difficult to implement, so a combination of vignette tests and direct observation was employed. Known as gen-
     eralizable reducible metrics (GRM), this approach relies on direct observation of clinical practice by a trained
     observer, combined with exit surveys with patients as they leave the health care facility.
     In the GRM framework, a main assumption is that a given set of provider behaviors will predict better perfor-
     mance across all illnesses, and observations for each specific illness are not necessary (that is, average behavior
     across many illnesses on certain metrics predicts tracer-condition-specific behavior for providers). This relaxation
     of conditions allows for greater flexibility in assessing the quality of health care, as was the case in Vietnam.
     Similar approaches have been successfully deployed in different settings, including Cambodia, India, Rwanda, Sri
     Lanka, and Tanzania.
     The most challenging part of the data collection was the clinical observation. It requires each observer to spend
     between five and eight hours in every clinic to ensure sufficient sample and variation by the time of day. Clinical
     observations will typically not yield information about patients because these are seldom assessed by providers
     or are not required for the clinical decision making. However, supplementing clinical observations with exit sur-
     veys can yield important new data because (a) they permit estimates of additional outcome variables (such as
     patient satisfaction); and (b) they provide data on patient characteristics such as education, ethnicity, wealth,
     and health status, whose impact on provider behavior can be directly assessed.
     This methodology was used in Vietnam with the study instruments being developed in close collaboration with
     government researchers. On the supply side, the study drew from the Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) diagnostic
     tool;a the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool;b and the service provision module for the
     2001–02 Vietnam National Health Survey (VNHS), which included the use of vignettes.
     Source: World Bank 2014b, 2014d.
     a.The SDI diagnostic tool, developed by the World Bank, has already been implemented in several African countries. The tool
     analyzes quality of services, with health facilities at the core of the service delivery chain. Quality depends on two overlapping
     dimensions: (a) the availability of inputs and services offered; and (b) how these inputs are utilized and services delivered.
     b. The SARA tool—developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Agency for International Development
     (USAID) initially for monitoring the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)—creates tracer indicators of the service availability and
     readiness to measure progress of health system changes, to plan and monitor key interventions, to provide an evidence base for
     the country’s annual health reviews, and to support planning and managing health systems.




of these attributes (and their levels) on the probability of delivery at a health facility.3For Senegal, the
model showed good predictive validity for actual facility choice, and thus this tool can be used for eliciting
the preferences of health care users, including those who are illiterate. A maternal health care supply sur-
vey was also undertaken that covered 28 public health facilities in the Kedougou region of Senegal and
covered health worker knowledge, absenteeism, management of maternal and child health services,
financing, human resources, and general health facility characteristics (Puret 2015; World Bank 2014a).

        The health PSIAs in this chapter show that combining information from different datasets and sources is
        effective in developing a better understanding of the demand for and supply of health services as well as
        pro-poor health care reform—as further illustrated in the next section.


        HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD PRACTICES

        Kosovo: Health Insurance Contributions and Copayments
        In 2012, the government of Kosovo passed the Health Law, which supports the government’s substantial
        reform agenda. This includes the introduction of a mandatory health insurance scheme aimed at raising
        more revenues for the health sector and improving the quality of care and resource efficiency. A comple-
        mentary Health Insurance Law was also passed in 2014, which lays out the legal framework for the health
        insurance scheme (Lee-Kwan and Gittelsohn 2014; World Bank 2015).

        The health insurance scheme is expected to be financed through payroll taxes, with a flat rate of 7 percent,
        split equally between the employer and the employee. This insurance will cover family members of the
        insured as well, but all other nonexempt people will have to pay a flat fee of €2 per month. The health
        insurance scheme aims to generate insurance contributions across the board—from people working in the
        formal and informal sectors of the economy, especially since most people are employed in the informal
        economy.

        This PSIA was designed to analyze the distributional impact of proposed health insurance contributions
        and copayments in Kosovo. As countries experience the process of health system reform, an important
        policy question has been how to protect vulnerable groups from the catastrophic and impoverishing ef-
        fects of health care expenditure. The simulations suggested that catastrophic health spending is lowest
        and poverty reduction is highest when the health insurance scheme offers exemptions to the poor, gener-
        ates revenue in a progressive manner, and redistributes benefits from premium revenues among all house-
        holds (Lee-Kwan and Gittelsohn 2014).

        These results have influenced, and are reflected in, the Health Insurance Law, which exempts the poor from
        these cost-sharing payments and any premiums. It also guarantees some of the health services for all, in-
        cluding emergency care, services for uninsured children, and essential public health services. The package
        also covers drugs that are currently paid for out-of-pocket and account for approximately 85 percent of all
        out-of-pocket spending.

        Overall, this PSIA was useful in terms of providing timely and relevant data and much-needed distribu-
        tional impact analysis to inform policy making in real time (World Bank 2015). Kosovo’s commitment to the
        reforms and willingness to engage has been an important success driver as well. The World Bank is also
        supporting the health insurance reform through the ongoing Kosovo Health Project, which has also ben-
        efited from the PSIA. The project is providing specific support to the following aspects of the health insur-
        ance program’s design and roll-out:

        •	 The outpatient drug benefit scheme, to improve financial protection and deliver visible benefits to those
           insured

        •	 Simple and clear administrative requirements to prove “exempt” status from paying health insurance
           premiums

        •	 Social marketing and communications strategies to inform the public and improve enrollment in the
           health insurance scheme

        •	 Strategies to improve quality of care and public accountability, and monitor and restrict informal pay-
           ments by health providers (for example, media campaigns on patient entitlements and responsibilities,



70   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
    credible public complaint and grievance redress procedures, and public disclosure of reports on infor-
    mal payments)

•	 Strategies to reduce wait times and improve transparency, such as electronic appointment setting and
   systematic, data-driven monitoring of wait times for care by the Health Insurance Fund and Ministry of
   Health

The PSIA also generated policy-relevant insights that have informed the Bank’s discussions with the Swiss
Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC) Trust Fund in Kosovo to support improvement of the coun-
try’s poverty targeting mechanisms—a key precondition if the health insurance reforms are to have the
desired poverty impact.4

Kenya: Pro-Poor Health Care Supply Chains
One of the challenges low-income countries face in the health sector is the distribution of essential medi-
cines and supplies. In Kenya, there are about 7,000 health facilities, of which around 4,000 are operated
by the government. The majority of these (3,500) are small health centers and dispensaries that provide
primary care. Most of these facilities receive their medicines and supplies from the Kenya Essential Medical
Supplies Agency (KEMSA), a quasi-independent affiliate of the Kenyan Ministry of Medical Services and
the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation (Raja, Gwatkin, and Trimble 2013).

This PSIA was conducted to determine the availability and the effectiveness of supply-chain infrastructure
in delivering essential medicines and medical supplies to poor communities within the public health sys-
tem (World Bank 2014c). As highlighted earlier in the “Tools and Methods” section, the PSIA employed
geospatial analysis, combining poverty and logistics data with geospatial codes.

The PSIA found that, contrary to the assumption, poorer districts did not fare worse than richer districts. In
fact, they received 15 percent more medicines and supplies than richer districts. The results also indicated
that transporting supplies to poor districts cost more than the transport costs for richer districts. However,
this did not appear to affect how well KEMSA supplies reach poor districts.

KEMSA contracts with private trucking companies to deliver supplies to health facilities, and it is switching
its payment system from one based on a “push” approach to one based on a “pull” approach.5 About
one-third of facilities had already switched to this system by 2013. The formula used for determining the
ceiling or drawing rights under the pull approach is also being revised. The original formula was based on
the number of facilities in a district (70 percent), the district population (10 percent), and the percentage
of the district’s population living below the poverty rate (20 percent). The new formula considers the clinic
workload (50 percent of total weight) and increases the weight of the population size (to 20 percent) while
reducing the weight attached to the number of facilities and population below the poverty line (to 15 per-
cent). The PSIA showed that this new formula tended to favor richer districts, but the statistical significance
of the relationship is weak.

The PSIA team collaborated closely with KEMSA for the analysis, which was an important factor in its suc-
cessful implementation and in generating a constructive policy dialogue. The PSIA also supported World
Bank operations in the country, including the mid-term review of the Health Sector Project, which provided
almost US$80 million in support of procurement of essential medicines and supply-chain strengthening
through KEMSA’s capitalization. The PSIA also showcased the value of merging data from different sources
for a multidimensional analysis and highlighted the importance of the poverty angle in assessing the per-
formance of the pharmaceutical sector.

	 Under the “push” approach, each facility automatically receives a predetermined quantity or set of medicines and supplies every quarter,
5

  while a “pull” approach determines a ceiling or “drawing right” for each facility, and the facility decides how much and which medical sup-
  plies it needs and orders them for each quarter.

        Vietnam: Barriers to Equity in Quality Health Care
        Over the past 20 years, Vietnam has made considerable progress toward improving the provision of health
        services across the country. The country has an extensive service delivery system, and most primary health
        services are covered under the national health insurance program. Nonetheless, there are concerns about
        the supply and quality of services. Prior analyses have highlighted persistent inequalities in health out-
        comes related to ethnicity and poverty. For example, only 27 percent of pregnant women in poor house-
        holds have four or more antenatal care visits, compared with 89 percent of those living in wealthier house-
        holds. Similarly, the child mortality rate among ethnic minorities is three times higher than among the
        ethnic majority Kinh/Hoa children. Staff shortages and absenteeism, poor working and living conditions,
        and lack of policy to support retention of health workers in rural areas has contributed to low quality of care
        in poor areas.

        The PSIA aimed to understand the distributional quality of basic health services in Vietnam (World Bank
        2014b). It combined both supply- and demand-side analyses (as detailed in the previous section on meth-
        ods) to understand the gaps in service provision and utilization as well as the reasons behind these gaps.
        The study design includes a particular focus on the differences between socioeconomic groups, between
        ethnic minorities and the ethnic majority, and between urban and rural areas.

        This study was conducted jointly by the Bank and the Health Strategy and Policy Institute (HSPI), a research
        institute of the Ministry of Health for building and modifying health strategies and policies. The PSIA is
        aligned with Pillar 3 on Opportunity in the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2012–2016, which
        includes support to the government of Vietnam to improve the basic public service delivery and access.
        Moreover, the work contributed to capacity development by engaging with HSPI throughout all phases of
        the analysis, including study design, questionnaire development, training and piloting, field implementa-
        tion, quality control processes, and data entry and cleaning. These efforts have not only benefited this
        specific study but will also have a very important impact on the institute’s future activities in terms of re-
        search and policy recommendations.

        This PSIA is still ongoing but has already begun to shed light on some of the challenges in provision of
        health services. For instance, the PSIA found the clinical guidelines and case management protocols are
        often not properly followed by doctors, leading to misdiagnoses of diseases and indicating the need to
        improve quality of services through training and refresher courses for doctors. The PSIA also highlighted
        the disparities in use of services across different provinces, with only 18 percent using outpatient services
        in Dong Thap compared with 74 percent in rural Hanoi and 66 percent in urban Hanoi.6

        Because Vietnam is at the initial stages of developing policies to address the higher-order concerns in
        health inequity, barriers to affordable access, and quality of care, this PSIA will be an important source of
        key information, evidence, and further areas of research that are expected to inform future policy debate
        on health reforms.

        Senegal: Exploring Women’s Maternal Health Preferences
        Senegal has a high maternal mortality ratio: 392 deaths per 100,000 live births. The Kedougou region has
        the worst maternal health indicators, with only 32 percent of women using maternal health services and
        only 25 percent of pregnant women having skilled attendance at birth. This PSIA was conducted to under-
        stand the factors behind women’s utilization of, and preferences for, delivery at health facilities in the Ke-
        dougou region (World Bank 2014a).

        Using a DCE approach, the PSIA aimed to (a) rigorously explore the preferences influencing women’s de-
        livery decisions, and (b) simulate the potential cost-effectiveness of various solutions. It found that system-
        atic barriers on the supply side that affect the quality of service were the leading cause of poor utilization:

•	 About two-thirds of the health facilities were understaffed, and existing staff had poor knowledge and
   skills needed for providing maternal health care.

•	 Absenteeism, low availability of drugs, and poor quality of equipment also acted as deterrents for women.

•	 Although the national health policy guarantees free maternal health services, in practice health facilities
   charged women for maternal health services. This, combined with transport costs and long travel dis-
   tances, made access to services difficult, especially for poor women.

The analysis showed that the most cost-effective way to improve utilization of services was to ensure free
availability of drugs and transport (Figure 7.2).

This was the first time DCE was used in the West Africa region. The DCE results have informed the World
Bank-supported result-based financing for the country’s Health and Nutrition Financing project. This pro-
gram combines (a) supply-side incentives paid to health facilities (to improve the quality of health care
services); and (b) demand-side incentives paid to pregnant women to help them cover their transport and
health care costs. Although a full evaluation is expected in 2018, early results from the demand-side incen-
tives program are showing large participation levels of women already.

This PSIA was critical in understanding how maternal health is addressed through policies and programs in
Senegal. It pinpointed that what held women back from delivering at health facilities or with the support
of a skilled birth attendant was not their preferences per se but rather hidden costs associated with access-
ing health services The PSIA also helped to build local capacity for data collection and analysis, especially
on the use of DCE.

As the examples from this chapter highlight, health-related PSIAs showcase the flexibility of PSIAs in their
focus and use of methods, having covered topics ranging from health insurance to quality of service provision.

Chapter 8: Water
SECTOR OVERVIEW
Water is the quintessential natural resource—a necessity of life. Access to clean
drinking water and good sanitation are essential for improving health and hygiene
and contributing to higher human productivity. Water is also a limited resource, and
its use comes with unique challenges. First among these is water scarcity. According
to estimates, about 20 percent of the world’s population lives in areas with physical
water scarcity, and another 20 percent live with economic water scarcity (that is,
water may be available, but access to it is limited because of financial or capacity
constraints) (Molden 2007). A second challenge is water quality. If water quality is
poor, it poses a public health hazard. Without proper sanitation, living conditions
can deteriorate, contributing to poor hygiene and ill health. An estimated 780 mil-
lion people lack access to improved, clean drinking water, and an estimated 2.5
billion do not have access to improved sanitation (Cooley et al. 2014).

As with any other development issue, challenges and opportunities in the water
sector, while broadly similar (such as providing clean drinking water and improving
sanitation), are also unique to country contexts. For instance, countries in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia face challenges related to an aging water supply infrastruc-
ture and system inefficiencies that have required attention within the larger context
of transitioning from central to market economies. On the other hand, countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions struggle with a lack of infrastructure and scar-
city of water resources. For instance, in Mexico and Mozambique, challenges sur-
round the expansion of water supply to different areas and how to ensure its quality.
Improving water supply and sanitation has necessitated rising tariffs as countries
move toward reducing subsidies related to public utilities to recover the costs as-
sociated with these improvements. In doing so, care needs to be taken to ensure
that poor and vulnerable populations are not negatively affected by tariff increases.

As part of its engagement on water and sanitation, the World Bank has used Pov-
erty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) for understanding on-the-ground realities
and analyzing the potential impact of policy and programmatic actions. The anal-
yses already undertaken have helped to determine the efficacy of proposed re-
forms related to water scarcity and use, quality of water supply, and public-private
partnerships for scaling up water services to the population.

This chapter focuses on how PSIAs have been used to identify challenges and
solutions in the water sector, focusing on household water supply. It draws on
PSIA experiences in three countries: Mexico, Mozambique, and Ukraine.1 Al-
though the PSIAs in all three countries focus on household consumption of water,


	 The Multi-Donor Task Force (MDTF) supported PSIAs on water resources in the following economies: Al-
1

  bania, Armenia, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Malawi, Montenegro, Tajikistan, West Bank and Gaza, and
  the Republic of Yemen.


                                                                                                     PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016   75
        each has a slightly different approach based on the specific question being asked and the country context
        (listed in order of appearance in the “Highlights and Good Practices” section below):

        •	 In Mozambique, the PSIA focused on the impact of recent water sector reforms, water consumption
           patterns, and targeting of subsidies in light of these consumption patterns in low-income, peri-urban
           areas around Maputo (World Bank 2014a, Zuin, Nicholson, and Davis 2012b).

        •	 In Ukraine, the PSIA aimed to address demand-side challenges in the uptake of much-needed sector
           reforms and tariff increases (World Bank 2013).

        •	 In Mexico, the PSIA explored issues related to quality and supply of water and sanitation, focusing on
           vulnerable populations in targeted areas in the State of Oaxaca (World Bank 2015a).


        TOOLS AND METHODS
        Based on the needs of the assessment and the questions being asked, different PSIAs took different ap-
        proaches. Several methods were employed, including stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions,
        and primary and secondary data quantitative analysis.

        Recognizing the time and resource constraints, the methods used needed to be sensitive to the question
        at hand to be able to assess potential impact. This is critical in implementation decision making. In Mozam-
        bique, the PSIA employed quantitative analysis, using a sample survey that covered six peri-urban neigh-
        borhoods around the city of Maputo, which is home to 106,000 inhabitants (Zuin, Nicholson, and Davis
        2012a, 2012b). The survey had been collected earlier as part of another study focusing on the legalization
        of water resale and was adapted for the PSIA, which covered broader water reform issues from the per-
        spective of these peri-urban neighborhoods. These neighborhoods were selected because they were
        representative of the water use and supply arrangements in Maputo’s peri-urban areas.2 Using a pre- and
        post-test design, the survey collected data from 1,284 households. The PSIA then employed multivariate,
        bivariate, and descriptive techniques to understand the unique context and issues related to water supply
        and usage in the targeted neighborhoods.

        Similarly, in Mexico, the PSIA was based on a household (face-to-face) survey of over 2,060 households in
        19 urban centers in the state of Oaxaca (World Bank 2015a, 2015b). It specifically targeted female heads
        of households or adult women who were responsible for providing water to the household (buying it, car-
        rying it, and so on). It included households that were connected to water service via the Oaxaca Metro-
        politan Area Water Utility (Servicios de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Oaxaca, or SAPAO) and the State
        Water Commission (Comisión Estatal del Agua, or CEA) and municipal utilities, as well as homes that were
        not currently connected. The survey was conducted with relatively limited resources but was able to de-
        velop a representative sample. The sampling method involved drawing a probabilistic, multistaged sam-
        ple representative of the poor population living in urban areas of the State of Oaxaca. The methodology
        was developed with considerations for replicability across other Mexican states. The World Bank worked
        particularly with the SAPAO and CEA in designing the survey instrument and in sample selection. In addi-
        tion, the Bank sought the advice of the State Secretariat of Indigenous Affairs on the approach to identify-
        ing the urban indigenous population and tailoring the questionnaire appropriately. This helped to enhance
        knowledge exchange and collaboration across these entities and with the Bank team.

        In Ukraine, given the strong focus on household consumers and demand generation, engaging stakehold-
        ers meaningfully was important for understanding demand-side constraints. Multiple stakeholders were
        consulted through interviews, focus groups, and workshops to understand their attitudes; grasp the po-
        litical economy barriers to reform (including the reasons for lack of consumer interest); and determine how
        to engage consumers and suppliers in improving accountability and governance. In addition, engaging

Mozambique: Understanding the Distributional Impact of Water Reforms in
Maputo
A common challenge facing many low-income and developing countries is how to improve the supply of
water to consumers within resource-constrained environments. Many of these countries have traditionally
subsidized the supply of public utilities to household consumers. However, as costs increase and con-
sumer prices remain low, the utilities are unable to generate sufficient revenues to maintain or improve
services. Increasing tariffs to cover the cost of water supply comes with the challenge of ensuring that there
are no regressive distributional impacts. Care has to be taken to ensure that subsidies aimed to provide
financial relief to the poor are properly designed and targeted. This requires a strong understanding of the
particular context, stakeholders, and their consumption patterns. In Mozambique, water tariff reforms initi-
ated to improve the water sector have had to address this very issue.

Beginning in 2010, the government of Mozambique and the country’s Water Regulatory Council (CRA)
have engaged on a series of reforms aimed at increasing the urban water supply and improving access to
affordable and reliable water supply services. Primary policy changes include (a) adjustments to the tariff
structure that decrease water costs for low-income households; (b) reducing connection fees and allowing
for payment in installments, accompanied by “connection campaigns” in selected neighborhoods; and (c)
legalization of water resale on a pilot basis in three neighborhoods.

The PSIA in Mozambique aimed to support the government’s water reforms through understanding the
impact of water sector reforms on water usage, especially among low-income households. It aimed to
“identify and interpret observed changes in the water market between 2010 and 2012, and discuss how
and the extent to which they may have been affected by the policy interventions implemented during this
period” (Zuin, Nicholson, and Davis 2012b).

The PSIA analyzed the water market in several peri-urban neighborhoods within greater Maputo, focusing
on (a) the different types of water supply services such as individual (household) water connections, public
standpipes, and the purchase of water from neighbors; (b) the socioeconomic and demographic charac-
teristics of households in greater Maputo; and (c) the households’ preference and willingness to pay for
water service improvements. It also analyzed the impact of potential policy changes, particularly on low-
income households.

The analysis showed that, on average, 70 percent of households in the target neighborhoods had a private
connection on their premises, albeit with significant variations across neighborhoods regarding coverage,
service provider, and reliability. Many households still relied on shared water points, and most lacked suffi-
cient knowledge about water metering, billing, and the variety of plans for water connection and payments.

The PSIA also examined the new tariff structure in Mozambique. Water utility tariffs are based on consump-
tion. Consumption is divided into blocks with increasing prices. The lowest block of consumption is pro-
vided at a subsidized rate, assuming that it covers water usage among the poorest households. As part of
tariff reforms during 2010 and 2012, the CRA lowered the size of this first, subsidized consumption block
from 10 cubic meters to 5 cubic meters, increased the pricing for the upper two consumption blocks, and
increased the meter rental fee and the value added tax (VAT) on water utilities.

        The PSIA revealed that this new structure of water tariffs would not significantly reduce the financial burden
        of water expenditures for poor households. First, the total cost to the households includes not only the
        subsidized tariff but also the VAT and fixed meter rental fees. When these additional costs are taken into
        consideration, households in the subsidized block end up paying the highest price per cubic meter of
        water. Second, many low-income households have high levels of water consumption, either because they
        are large households with big families or because they are selling their water to neighbors who do not have
        a water connection. Thus, these households end up in the two consumption blocks that experienced the
        highest price increases between 2010 and 2012 (Zuin, Nicholson, and Davis 2012a, 2012b).

        Figure 8.1 shows the tariff structure prereform in 2010 and postreform in 2012. The prices, in Mozambique
        meticais (Mt), include the cost of the VAT and the meter rental fee. As the figure shows, the price per unit
        is the highest for the first block of 5 cubic meters of water consumption, and there was a significant in-
        crease of over 75 percent in the second block of consumption (of up to 10 cubic meters per month) (Zuin,
        Nicholson, and Davis 2012a, 2012b).

        Given these considerations, the PSIA recommended a review of the tariff structure and subsidies offered
        under the new structure to better target subsidies for the poorest households, specifically suggesting an
        alternative pricing mechanism that looks at both location and volume to account for socioeconomic and
        water supply arrangements in different neighborhoods. It also recommended improving consumer aware-
        ness through better communication and consideration of increasing support for the water resale market by
        ensuring costs are viable for consumers and resellers with fair pricing and competition.

        The PSIA helped the government of Mozambique to understand the distributional impact of the water
        tariff reforms as a whole. The CRA welcomed the recommendations and plans to adopt them gradually

Water Supply Project.

Ukraine: Generating Demand for Good Governance in the Water Sector
Population stress on an aging infrastructure for drinking water and sewage as well as poor management
are among the main challenges facing countries in the Europe and Central Asia region. Most of these
countries have legacies of the systems developed under the former Soviet Union, with utilities being pro-
vided at subsidized rates, considerably below cost recovery. Following the breakup of the former Soviet
Union, newly formed countries maintained their existing systems, continuing to provide utilities, including
water and sewage, under the older model and at subsidized rates. However, to reduce system inefficien-
cies and to create a system that would be sustainable in the longer term, countries initiated reforms begin-
ning in the 1990s. These reforms have centered on sensitive issues such as removal of subsidies and im-
proving institutional arrangements.

Recently, Ukraine undertook reforms in the water sector as part of larger energy and utilities reforms to
revitalize its outdated and overburdened infrastructure. When water sector reforms were introduced in
Ukraine, the economy was at the brink of default and there was considerable social unrest. An increase in
tariffs was a condition of the bailout package from the International Monetary Fund. Most consumers also
show little trust of the government and local utilities (Figure 8.2).

These conditions, coupled with the Bank’s investment in infrastructure through a new project and aware-
ness campaign, helped to generate political acceptance for the reforms. In addition, the National Commis-
sion for Regulation of Communal Services (NCRCS) was established in 2011 to regulate the sector toward
greater efficiency, sustainability, and improved service delivery. The NCRCS is developing performance

        benchmarks and new tariff structures. It is also working on setting mechanisms for disclosing information
        to consumers and improving accountability mechanisms.

        In Ukraine, the PSIA focused mainly on how to generate stakeholder buy-in for the changes, especially
        among end users. The PSIA was conducted to answer a specific question: how to improve accountability
        in service delivery. However, given the existing low tariffs and widespread supply of water in the country,
        although there is little incentive for demanding good governance in the sector (or appetite for tariff in-
        creases), the need exists in order to address the problems within the sector.

        The PSIA explored ways to increase citizen engagement for greater accountability and better governance.
        The work focused on major cities and used stakeholder analysis to “filter out weak reform initiatives and
        identify those that are likely to be politically and technically feasible, and to identify potential champions
        for reforms” (World Bank 2013). The PSIA uncovered that utilities have limited capacity to collect fees
        because water is considered an essential good and the right to it is protected under the law. Thus, there
        was a need for more positive dialogue to change attitudes and behaviors regarding use of water resources.
        The PSIA’s main recommendations included

        •	 Establishing a water service benchmarking system that is publicly available;

        •	 Standardized testing of the quality of drinking water and its public disclosure;

        •	 Conducting public awareness campaigns on consumer rights and water service indicators;

        •	 Institutionalizing consumer feedback through mechanisms such as citizen report cards;

        •	 Developing a more robust metering system that is flexible to respond to different types of residential
           customers;

        •	 Establishing greater transparency in utility procurement through allowing public monitoring;

        •	 Clarifying the division of responsibilities for maintaining communal water infrastructure and clear com-
           plaint-handling mechanisms; and

        •	 Establishing incentives-based regulation and expanding the authority of the country’s Water Commis-
           sion nationwide.

        The findings of the PSIA supported the design of the institutional development component in the Second
        Urban Infrastructure Project (UIP II) and facilitated a follow-on, more in-depth PSIA on institutional devel-
        opment in Ukraine.

        Mexico: Water and Sanitation Services among Urban Poor and Indigenous Peoples
        The State of Oaxaca, Mexico, is the third-most marginalized state in the country. At 79 percent, it has the
        third-lowest drinking water coverage in the country, after Chiapas and Guerrero, and the lowest sanitation
        coverage (71 percent). Only 85 percent of Oaxaca’s urban population and 63 percent of the rural popula-
        tion have access to drinking water and sanitation. In addition, uneven and poor quality of water and sanita-
        tion services is a major barrier. The lack of a systematic disinfection of water and intermittent service provi-
        sion lead to water that is unsafe for human consumption. This pushes users—those who can afford it—to
        buy more-expensive water from private sources. On the supply side, the multiplicity of actors in the sector,
        lagging capacity of agencies responsible for providing water and sanitation services, and poor interagency
        coordination make service provision more expensive and inefficient.

        The PSIA on water and sanitation in Oaxaca aimed to investigate the use of water and sanitation services,
        satisfaction, and ability to pay among vulnerable population groups (including the poor, indigenous peo-
        ples, and the Afro-Mexican population) in 19 urban areas (World Bank 2015a). These areas were jointly

identified by the government of the State of Oaxaca and the World Bank as areas of interest for the Mod-
ernization of the Water and Sanitation (MAS) Sector Program. Earlier evaluations of the water sector had
identified gaps in knowledge regarding the disposition and ability to pay as well as the water-use patterns
and sanitation system of the poor, indigenous migrants and Afro-Mexicans living in urban areas. This PSIA
built on this knowledge to inform the implementation of the MAS Sector Program.

The PSIA found that the continuity of services contributes the most to satisfaction among customers. Wa-
ter service cuts or interruptions are caused mainly by the need to repair pipes or wells. The quantity of
water supply was also a major source of concern for households, as expressed by the women responsible
for providing water to the households. Most surveyed households had drinking water services as well as
sanitation facilities such as a toilet or latrine.1 Households often supplemented their drinking water supply
with water brought in through privately owned and operated water tanker trucks despite the fact that the
cost is exponentially higher—reportedly four times higher, on average, across the 19 cities. Overall, house-
holds perceived that water from private sources was of better quality than that provided via public servic-
es. Just over half (56 percent) of households using only the public water supply considered it to be of good
quality, while 77 percent of those using a private water supply considered it better than the public water
supply. Perceptions about the quality of services were also more positive among nonindigenous and high-
er-income, urban households than among indigenous groups and those in lower-income, less-developed
areas. Further work needs to be done to understand whether this is a mere perception issue or whether
issues of quality do vary across these neighborhoods.

The PSIA also found that although most households (94 percent) looked favorably upon improving the
quality of water and sanitation services, their willingness to pay was limited: only 56 percent were willing
to pay more for better drinking water, and about 51 percent were willing to pay more for improved sanita-
tion services (Figure 8.3). Those who were not willing to pay more cited financial constraints or a distrust
of the utilities to deliver improved services as the two main reasons for their unwillingness. The PSIA rec-
ommended improvements in customer services and better, timely communication with consumers about
maintenance and repairs to address some of the consumer side issues related to the water supply. The



	 Sixty-four percent have a water tank, 24 percent have a water pump, and 17 percent had a cistern. Additionally, 81 percent of the house-
1

  holds had access to some form of sanitation facility either inside or outside their homes.


                                                                                                        PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016        81
        evaluation of the complaint handling mechanism could be improved particularly for the services provided
        by telephone.

        The PSIA was designed to complement the implementation of the Program for Results (P4R) operation for
        the MAS Sector Program in the State of Oaxaca. The results of the study provided a solid evidence base
        for policy design and service provision planning in the most disadvantaged urban neighborhoods, and
        they were shared with key stakeholders such as the Oaxaca Metropolitan Area Water Utility, the State Wa-
        ter Commission, the Municipality of Oaxaca, the State Secretary for Infrastructure, the State Secretary for
        Finance, the Federal Water Committee, the State Secretariat of Indigenous Affairs, and civil society (repre-
        sented, among others, by the Oaxacan Water Forum through the Institute of Nature and Society of Oaxaca).

Chapter 9: Energy
SECTOR OVERVIEW
Access to clean, affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is an important facet
of socioeconomic development. Energy resources are critical for supporting the
health, well-being, and livelihoods of people across the globe. Yet, not everyone
has access to these resources, or their access is uneven. An estimated 1.1 billion
people worldwide live without access to electricity, for instance. Similarly, close to
3 billion people use traditional biomass resources such as wood or dung, causing
indoor and outdoor air pollution.2

In many low- and middle-income countries, energy provision has traditionally
been subsidized by the government. However, limited resources and the need to
find long-term, sustainable solutions for energy generation and provision have
necessitated shifts toward privatization of energy services or subsidy removal. At
the same time, concerns over climate change have spurred interest in green
growth and low-cost, renewable energy.

Reforms can have both intentional and unintentional distributional impacts. For
example, although adapting to climate change and developing renewable energy
resources will have positive impacts overall, especially in the long run, reforms
may cause energy prices to rise in the short to medium term, making it unafford-
able for the poorest or most-vulnerable households. Moreover, regulations associ-
ated with a policy may not be readily available or may become too complicated
for consumers to fully understand. For instance, regulations regarding ownership
and payment for a meter in a building, or regarding consumers’ rights, may either
provide incomplete information or be too complex for consumers to be able to
make informed decisions or take advantage of their options. Understanding and
responding to these issues helps to address any potential negative impacts. It
also generates more support for the reforms among stakeholders. For example, in
India’s Himachal Pradesh State, where there is interest in inclusive growth, the
World Bank-led Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) supported the state
government in reviewing its development trajectory and identifying potential
challenges and opportunities for hydropower-supported green growth (Box 9.1).

To understand the distributional impact of energy reforms, the World Bank has
been employing PSIAs extensively in addressing the distributional impacts of en-
ergy reforms across different regions and countries such as Armenia, Belarus,
Burma, Bulgaria, Morocco, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam. This chapter fo-
cuses on energy reforms related to electricity supply and tariff regulation in four
different contexts.

         BOX 9.1: PATHWAYS TO SOCIAL INCLUSION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT—
         THE CASE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH

           The Indian State of Himachal Pradesh (HP) has made significant progress toward improving its development
           outcomes in the past few decades. It is also the home to one of India’s main hydropower operations, accounting
           for 15 percent of the country’s hydro-powered energy. At the same time, the watersheds of HP are an important
           carbon sink for greenhouse gases.
           In 2012, the World Bank commissioned a PSIA as part of the Development Policy Loan (DPL) to Promote Inclu-
           sive Green Growth and Sustainable Development in Himachal Pradesh to support the state government of HP in
           its planning for expanding its hydropower potential by 10 gigawatts over the next 10 years.
           The PSIA aimed to inform the policy dialogue surrounding the DPL. It was designed as a two-stage, mixed-
           methods study that would (a) provide a macrosocial analysis of the state’s development trajectory, and (b) as-
           sess community and household-level knowledge of and attitudes toward hydropower and watershed reforms.
           The PSIA employed quantitative analysis based on existing household survey data and qualitative analysis using
           focus groups and interviews to provide further nuanced information about people’s perceptions that would have
           been hard to capture in a survey.
           The PSIA highlighted the main factors associated with HP’s progress, including a strong focus on inclusive
           growth and accountability. For instance, it showed that land ownership among the state’s Scheduled Castes (SC)
           has helped them to benefit from poverty reduction interventions as much as other social groups. The state gov-
           ernment’s investment in infrastructure, especially in hilly and rural areas, as well as in education, sanitation, and
           health have all contributed to greater inclusive growth.
           The PSIA acknowledged the importance of infrastructure investments (especially in hydropower for future eco-
           nomic development) and support of rural development programs (such as on community-based watershed
           management that supports agriculture and green growth). It also captured citizens’ perceptions and concerns
           and highlighted the importance of more and better communication and awareness building surrounding green
           growth.
           This PSIA was timely and useful for informing the World Bank’s lending operations for the state government’s
           hydropower project. The macrosocial analysis provided insights into what worked well in HP and how future
           infrastructure-led growth may affect its future social and economic trajectory. The PSIA also strengthened the
           government’s understanding of hydropower and watersheds for green growth. Overall, the PSIA generated
           strong interest on green growth and social and environmental sustainability and has opened new avenues for
           future dialogue and cooperation between the World Bank and the state government of Himachal Pradesh.

        Among the PSIAs discussed in this chapter, two focus on energy sector reforms in the Europe and Central
        Asia region (specifically, in Belarus and Uzbekistan), highlighting a common challenge among the region’s
        countries—that of improving energy efficiency and preventing undue or extreme hardship for households
        as a result of rising prices. Heating, especially in the winter months, is essential to survival in these coun-
        tries. There is a fine balance between improving energy efficiency and preventing undue or extreme hard-
        ship for households as a result of rising prices. PSIAs were carried out in these countries, either as part of
        a World Bank operation or as stand-alone products, to determine the distributional impacts of subsidy
        removal and rising prices on poor and vulnerable households.




84   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
The chapter also draws on PSIAs on energy reforms in Morocco and Vietnam. In Morocco, the PSIA helped
to develop a general equilibrium model to analyze energy reform outcomes (World Bank 2014b). The
government’s interest in reducing dependence on energy imports and promoting green growth prompted
energy reforms. The model was developed to support the government in determining which course of
action to take and what the impacts would be. Similarly, in Vietnam, the government was interested in hav-
ing petroleum prices determined by market forces, with changes in prices closely reflecting fluctuations in
international markets. Yet, changes in petroleum prices affect the prices of services and goods across the
economy, which in turn affects household consumption. The PSIA focused on developing a model that
would help policy makers better understand the potential impact of petroleum price liberalization (Thanh
et al. 2012).


TOOLS AND METHODS
PSIAs have the flexibility to use different approaches and methods to address questions surrounding dis-
tributional impacts. As in other sectors, PSIAs in the energy sector have used both quantitative and qualita-
tive methods to understand the distributional impacts of policy reforms or a particular course of action.
The PSIAs highlighted in this chapter showcase how different methods and tools have been developed
and used to support the analysis needed, ranging from surveys to focus group discussions.




 BOX 9.2: DEVELOPING A MODEL TO MEASURE ENERGY REFORM IMPACTS
 IN MOROCCO

   The PSIA in Morocco was the first economic evaluation of Morocco’s energy strategy. To do this, the PSIA inno-
   vated on a CGE model to adapt it to the country’s context, using a hybrid CGE model called MANAGE, a recur-
   sive dynamic model, with labor growth treated as an exogenous factor and capital growth derived from savings
   and investment. The model uses constant elasticity of substitution (CES) functions among different inputs. En-
   ergy is assumed to be a complement of capital in the short term but a substitute in the long term. Newer capital
   is assumed to be more energy efficient than old capital, and there is specific capital for solar and wind energy
   that cannot be used in other sectors. The model also assumes a consumer preference shift toward the newer
   renewable technologies.
   The model also has the capacity for multiple types of inputs and outputs. It assumes Morocco is a small country
   in terms of trade volume, and its imports and exports do not affect the world prices of goods. It uses the Arm-
   ington structure of imperfect substitution between imported and domestic goods. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
   sions in the economy are tracked as a function of the different types of fossil fuels in use. The model also allows
   for disaggregating households by wealth quintiles, allowing it to analyze distributional impacts of policy reforms
   on the poor as well as the entire economy. It uses a constant difference of elasticity (CDE) structure for house-
   hold demand, calibrated from different price and income elasticities.
   The PSIA used data from household surveys and the social accounting matrix (SAM) for 2007. Energy disag-
   gregation was derived from the energy balance provided by the Ministry of Energy, and the data were well inte-
   grated into the SAM. Using this information, analysis was conducted for a business-as-usual or reference case
   (which showed the impacts on the economy if no interventions were made and subsidies were kept in place) as
   well as two different scenarios that examined the effects of subsidy removal and injection of investments in re-
   newable energy.

        The PSIA in Morocco focused on developing a quantitative tool for analyzing the impact of policy reforms
        in the energy sector using a hybrid computable generalized equilibrium (CGE) model called MANAGE.
        This is a recursive dynamic model conceived for energy and climate change research, with labor growth
        being exogenous and capital growth derived from savings and investment decisions. The model has many
        standard characteristics of a dynamic CGE model of neoclassical economic growth but is adapted to pro-
        vide more “richness” on the energy sector (Box 9.2).

        In Vietnam as well, the PSIA focused on developing a dynamic CGE simulation tool to project how chang-
        es in fuel and electricity prices may affect inflation and poverty (Thanh et al. 2012). The model captures
        both the direct and indirect impacts of fuel price and electricity tariff changes on poverty as well as the
        variation of impacts across geographical regions. This model also simulated the impact on production
        costs and the fiscal impact for determining compensation (mitigating measures) to keep welfare of poor
        households unchanged.

        The PSIA analysis relied on 2010 income and expenditure data from the Vietnam Household Living Stan-
        dard Survey. Because income and price elasticities were not available for Vietnam, the analysis relied on
        values estimated in another study (Dongling 1999) for less-developed countries. The study estimated in-
        come and own-price elasticities for 13 less-developed economies. The PSIA adapted these data to the list
        of consumption goods in nine broad categories. The data were used to construct the indirect utility func-
        tion. The Frisch parameter3 was also estimated from data available in existing literature (Huff et al. 1997).
        Sensitivity tests were conducted to ensure the robustness of the model. Using different sets of parameters,
        the study showed that the empirical model could produce relatively stable results without being suscep-
        tible to the choice of price elasticities and the Frisch parameter, and thus had potential as a reliable way to
        assess, ex ante, the impacts related to electricity and fuel price reform.	

        While the PSIAs in Morocco and Vietnam used quantitative methods to develop and implement tools that
        provided ex ante insights into policy reforms, the Belarus and Uzbekistan PSIAs used mixed methods (with
        quantitative and qualitative components) to gain in-depth insights on consumer perceptions and behavior
        associated with removal of heating subsidies and increasing use of renewable energy resources.

        In Belarus, the PSIA examined the barriers and challenges faced by residential energy consumers and
        other relevant stakeholders in the towns of Smorgon, Kalinkovichi, and Starye Dorogi (SATIO 2013). Data
        collection instruments were first developed and piloted for validation and then administered. They included

        •	 A quantitative survey of 600 households as well as 36 pilot surveys;

        •	 Twelve focus group discussions with residents and one pilot focus group; and

        •	 Fifteen in-depth interviews, including three in the pilot phase, with experts at different levels of decision
           making connected with the study topic.

        In addition, the PSIA examined available channels of communication to increase public awareness of en-
        ergy efficiency and renewable energy measures such as media campaigns.

        In Uzbekistan, a similar methodology was used (World Bank 2014a). Qualitative analysis was based on fo-
        cus group discussions, individual interviews, stakeholder mapping, and ethnographic interviews. In two
        cities where the planned District Heating Energy Efficiency Project will be implemented—Chirchick and
        Andijan—the following data were collected:

        •	 The quantitative analysis was based on a survey of 300 households, with 150 selected from each city.
           Although this was a small sample to be representative, the purpose was to obtain a sufficiently large
           sample of specific heating solution types to allow for analysis.

•	 Eight focus groups (four in each city) were conducted. These focused on residents of multistory apart-
   ments, stratified by gender and heating type.

•	 Key informant interviews were conducted with eight individuals in Andijan and six in Chirchik, represent-
   ing energy provision and management across national, municipal, and local divisions to provide a local
   supply-side perspective on district heating systems. To identify participants for in-depth interviews, a
   stakeholder mapping was conducted.

•	 Finally, six interviews with heating consumers were also conducted to provide a detailed account of
   demand-side issues and behaviors. These were turned into mini case studies to support learning.


HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD PRACTICES

Morocco: Socioeconomic Impacts of the Green Growth Policy
The government of Morocco is committed to greater energy independence and sustainable green growth.
Currently, Morocco imports 96 percent of its total commercial energy, most of which (84 percent) is in the
form of oil and coal. In addition, most poor people use wood for fuel, which contributes to deforestation.
Reforming the energy sector and moving toward locally produced renewable energy is critical to the Mo-
roccan green growth strategy. This will reduce the country’s foreign exchange burden of energy imports
and reduce GHG emissions.

Within this context, the government of Morocco’s energy strategy has three major goals:

•	 To guarantee adequate energy supply while also reducing dependence on energy imports

•	 To limit the environmental impacts of growth

•	 To guarantee energy access to the population, especially the poor

Understanding the impact of policy reforms ex ante is important in identifying the best course of action.
This PSIA was requested by the government of Morocco to develop a simulation model that the govern-
ment could use to estimate the impact of energy reforms. This would be the first dedicated model to as-
sess the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of different energy policy choices in Morocco. The
PSIA required engaging with different institutional actors for the development and utilization of the model
who had previously not worked together on this. Support from the PSIA Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF)
provided necessary resources for conducting the activity and allowed for recruitment of both local and
top-notch international experts. It also showed a useful amount of flexibility in the planning of resources
and implementation of the activity, which was necessary to accommodate the heavy institutional transac-
tion costs required in bringing the different actors together.

The World Bank worked with an interministerial group consisting of the Directorate for Planning of the
Department of Energy within the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment (MEMEE) as well as
the High Planning Commission (HPC). This PSIA has helped to facilitate a new collaborative partnership
within executive branches that will be important for future energy policy and planning. A substantial
amount of effort was spent in building consensus among stakeholders around the objectives and method-
ological choices behind the activity. This helped to create links between two previously disconnected
government units: those engaged in economic modeling at the HPC and those working on the energy
policy within the Energy Department (World Bank 2014b).

The PSIA was successful in developing an innovative analytical tool to assess the economic implications of
Morocco’s green energy policy and to identify the best course of action. It innovated on the standard CGE
model (as described earlier in the “Tools and Methods” section) and ran three different energy policy sce-
narios: a base model and two variants. It also discussed the implications of each scenario. The PSIA showed


                                                                                 PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016   87
        that the baseline or “business as usual” case would lead to large increases in energy consumption, depen-
        dence on imported energy, and GHG emissions, contrary to the goals of the government. It would also
        lead to a substantial increase in the government budget burden due to energy subsidies and, ultimately,
        was not sustainable. In the first variant on the model, the PSIA assumed large investments in renewable
        energy without addressing the high cost of energy subsidies. In this scenario, the PSIA showed a reduction
        in economic growth due to the high cost of the renewable investments coupled with the continued energy
        subsidies. The magnitude of investments required surpasses the national savings capacity and requires
        foreign capital investment.

        In the second variant, the PSIA showed the effects of subsidy removal with renewable investments. This
        scenario showed the following:

        •	 In the short term, subsidy removal leads to a reduction in economic growth, but growth accelerates
           substantially in the long term because of the stimulus of reduced taxes and increased energy efficiency.

        •	 The elimination of energy subsidies causes adverse impacts on poor households such that an improved
           social safety net would be needed to accompany the subsidy reductions.

        •	 A fixed (nominal) exchange rate policy is not compatible with the policy of subsidy reduction because it
           exacerbates the economic impacts of the subsidy removal. The inflation induced by the subsidy re-
           moval causes appreciation of the real exchange rate.

        •	 Subsidy reduction combined with renewable energy and efficiency investments can increase economic
           growth and reduce GHG emissions.

        The PSIA provided a comprehensive economic evaluation of Morocco’s energy strategy for the first time.
        The results of the analysis have informed the energy component of the World Bank’s Morocco Inclusive
        Green Growth DPL series, particularly the reform measures regarding fossil fuel subsidy removal and the
        renewable energy investment framework. The government also adopted the recommendations under the
        second scenario in its reform process, pairing subsidy removal with large renewable energy investments in
        solar and wind, which had been identified as the optimal course of action for enhancing economic growth.4

        Belarus: Biomass-Based District Heating and Social Impacts
        At 90 percent, Belarus’s population is highly dependent on district heating. Like other former Soviet Union
        countries, Belarus has kept residential tariffs low through a series of subsidization and cross-subsidization.
        As of 2013, heating tariffs were at one-sixth of the cost of production and supply. However, this is not sus-
        tainable. Belarus imports 80 percent of its gas from the Russian Federation for heating and electricity
        generation. To reduce dependence on imports and achieve cost recovery, Belarus aimed to increase resi-
        dential heating tariffs to cost recovery levels by 2016. To achieve this, residential heating tariffs were ex-
        pected to increase by 112–256 percent, depending on the international price for natural gas. This was
        expected to contribute to an increase in the national poverty rate from 5.4 percent in 2009 to about 6.3–
        7.2 percent in 2014.

        To reduce the burden of high energy costs for residents and to ensure continued affordability of energy
        supplies, energy-efficiency and energy-saving measures were required. The government was also inter-
        ested in greater use of renewable energy resources to reduce its dependence on imported oil and gas,
        reduce wastage, and bring down costs. However, the affordability and accessibility of these resources for
        the poor and vulnerable segments of the population needed further exploration.

88   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
This PSIA was proposed for that very purpose—supporting the Belarus Biomass District Heating Project. It
aimed to assess the “perceived” affordability and the acceptability of energy efficiency and renewable
energy measures available to residential consumers of district heating to reduce the cost of energy supply,
with a particular focus on the towns of Smorgon, Kalinkovichi, and Starye Dorogi (SATIO 2013).

The PSIA helped to clarify the main issues with reforms from the perspective of local governments and the
residents who are the final consumers of district heating. This work allowed for a better understanding of


 BOX 9.3: CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT ON HEATING REFORMS IN BELARUS—FINDINGS
 AND RECOMMENDATIONS

   Successful implementation of any reforms requires buy-in for those reforms, especially among affected popula-
   tion groups. The PSIA in Smorgon, Kalinkovichi, and Starye Dorogi on heating reforms helped to bring the per-
   spective of residential consumers of district heating and local service providers to the policy dialogue. The PSIA
   highlighted consumer choices, ability to pay, and barriers to equitable heating consumption, reaching the fol-
   lowing main findings:
  •	 While, at the macro level, the focus is on replacing or updating deteriorating heating networks for greatest
     levels of energy efficiency, at the micro level, consumers preferred simpler, faster, and less costly methods such
     as installation of energy-efficient windows and doors.
  •	 Consumers also had low awareness of state and local programs that promote energy efficiency, use of renew-
     able energy, and other energy sources available to them. When informed about focus of the reforms on pro-
     moting biofuels as an alternative heating source, residents expressed mixed reactions with concerns over
     availability and quality of the supply, the technology used, and its effects on the environment.
  •	 Household income, different types of apartment ownership, difficulty of monitoring heat consumption by
     apartment,a lack of cooperation between tenants, concerns over low quality of services, and lack of trust for
     utilities were all impediments in adopting more energy-efficient methods of heating.
  •	 About 40 percent household residents surveyed indicated that they would have difficulty in paying for in-
     creased cost of heating. The survey also showed that, on average, residents were willing to spend 57,000 to
     117,000 rubles (roughly US$5.98 to US$12.27)b per month to enhance energy efficiency.
  •	 There was a general distrust of utilities, mainly stemming from a lack of transparent billing. This was especially
     highlighted for the existing system of deductions on capital repairs, which is based on apartment size and
     linked to the maintenance cost of the building rather than on the cost of these repairs for the building itself.
   These types of issues require attention to encourage citizen engagement and buy-in for the reforms. Based on
   these findings, the PSIA recommended that targeted information sharing strategies be used, including advertise-
   ments on utility bills; presentations at building tenant meetings; and communication through social media to
   raise awareness about the energy efficiency program and resources for residents, focusing on locally relevant
   information. It also recommended that the government examine the feasibility of programs to encourage ener-
   gy-efficient methods, such as through preferential loans, ability to pay in installments, and public subsidies.
   At the service provision level, transparency in all service provision and billing is important to build customer
   trust. Finally, installation of meters and heat regulators at the unit level will be important to empower consumers
   and to create incentives for them to be more energy efficient.

        their needs, expectations, and concerns regarding heating reforms. It also provided insights on how best
        to address their concerns. The PSIA highlighted residential consumption patterns, consumers’ preferred
        energy efficiency measures (such as window replacement), and their willingness to pay (estimated between
        Rub 57,000 and Rub 117,000 per month). The PSIA especially was useful in bringing attention to the fact
        that residents had incomplete information about the energy-efficient measures being offered and needed
        more clarity (Box 9.3).

        The PSIA also helped to create space for dialogue on poverty in the context of energy reforms. Poverty is
        a delicate topic in Belarus and had to be approached with sensitivity. The PSIA helped in opening the door
        for discussion, especially once the Bank team was able to show how poverty and affordability-related is-
        sues affected the planned Biomass District Heating Project. The discussion included a focused, half-day
        workshop on the PSIA aimed at government representatives. It highlighted how the assessment supported
        the project through asking the right questions, increasing efficiency, and focusing on measures that are
        more affordable and for which there is greater demand—which also helped to generate greater buy-in
        from the government on the importance of addressing poverty-related challenges within the project.

        The PSIA was supported through the PSIA MDTF, and the work was conducted by a small World Bank team
        and a local consulting firm (SATIO). The same Bank team also supported the development and implemen-
        tation of the Biomass District Heating Project. This helped to create synergies, fostering a deeper under-
        standing of the main challenges that residential consumers face because of price hikes, especially those in
        lower-income households. This knowledge fed back into the design of the project, which now has a great-
        er poverty focus.

        Uzbekistan: Cold Comfort—District Heating
        As in Belarus, Uzbekistan’s municipal district heating (DH) systems provide space heating and hot water to
        public buildings and urban residential areas. Constructed during the 1950s to 1970s, the systems are in
        poor condition because of chronic underinvestment in operations and maintenance as well as a lack of
        upgrades to the infrastructure.

        To respond to an aging infrastructure and poor service provision, the government of Uzbekistan began
        taking steps in 2009 toward reforming the DH system. In support of these reforms, the World Bank initi-
        ated the District Heating Energy Efficiency Project (DHEEP) in 2015, which is one of its most significant
        energy projects in the country. It aims to improve the reliability of heat supply and the quality of heating
        services in Uzbekistan’s three urban centers: Andijan, Chirchick, and the Sergeli District of Tashkent.

        The PSIA was conducted to support this project. It aimed to assess the ex ante poverty and social impact
        of district heating reform in Uzbekistan on vulnerable households and recommend mitigation measures for
        any negative impacts. The PSIA focused on two of the urban areas included in DHEEP: Andijan (where the
        DH system no longer provides service to residential customers) and Chirchik (where over one-third of resi-
        dents still receive DH services).

        The PSIA found the following (World Bank 2014a):

        •	 During the winter season, 94 percent of all households, whether connected or not to the DH system,
           had to employ some form of coping strategy such as wearing extra warm clothing indoors and using
           alternative sources of heating to supplement poor heating.

        •	 The absolute expenditure on energy was greater for poor households than for nonpoor households,
           with the extreme poor (bottom 20 percent) spending 28 percent of their total average monthly expen-
           diture on energy, compared with 13 percent for the nonpoor (top 60 percent).




90   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
•	 Large households were the most vulnerable. Because the normative tariff structure was based on family
   size, households with large families paid the highest tariffs for DH. In comparison, pensioners, people
   with disabilities, and female-headed households were better off.

•	 Women generally bore the burden of ensuring household heating and chores related to energy use
   (such as fetching firewood). With 85 percent of respondents in Andijan and 79 percent of respondents
   in Chirchik of the opinion that a well-functioning heating system would save time and effort on house-
   hold chores, reforms that improve provision of DH services would likely benefit women.

Additionally, poor customer service and lack of transparency in billing have resulted in considerable disinter-
est from consumers to invest in DH improvements. Long response times and even nonresponsiveness of
utilities have resulted in a culture where residential DH users often address their own problems themselves
to the extent they can; many have invested in alternative sources of heating such as Dutch stoves and Chi-
nese boilers. Moreover, because utilities are bundled, it is difficult for customers to determine the accuracy
of their bills, with a strong preference for metered billing rather than normative pricing. Although most
people agree that well-functioning household heating would improve the quality of life, there was skepti-
cism about the DH companies’ and government authorities’ ability to deliver. Thus, although many of the
respondents were willing to pay more (to a certain extent and in installments) for better services, there was
also concern that the utilities and the government would not be able to deliver (World Bank 2014a).

Based on these findings, the PSIA recommended that DH rehabilitation should be initiated in areas where
households are using the least-effective and most-expensive heating options and take steps to ensure that
utilities are functioning well. Demonstrating the effectiveness of DH was important, and these would be
steps in the right direction. Beyond rehabilitating the conveyance and distribution infrastructure of DH
systems, further research on apartment heat retention is recommended in the interests of energy effi-
ciency. In addition, the PSIA recommended a gradual increase in tariffs, with some form of support to the
most vulnerable households that should occur parallel to system improvements. Introduction of an install-
ment-based payment system would increase ability to pay. Finally, the PSIA recommended monitoring al-
ternative heating options, particularly Chinese boilers, to understand consumption patterns.

The PSIA generated dialogue on consumer or demand-side issues with the government. It also helped
participating cities to understand and commit to developing social action plans to address the issues iden-
tified. The PSIA also created interest in expanding the analysis to Tashkent and acted as an entry point for
a forthcoming wider study, “Energy Subsidies in Uzbekistan: Impact and the Way Forward.” It has also
been identified at the World Bank as a best-practice example of engaging with stakeholders and has been
presented at multiple Bank events on citizen engagement.

Vietnam: Assessing Price and Tariff Reform—Building Capacity for Change
In 2008 the government of Vietnam initiated steps to bring petroleum prices to international levels to re-
duce its subsidy bill. This included a substantial initial increase (31 percent) in petroleum prices. This would
likely have both direct and indirect impacts on household consumption and expenditures.

The PSIA in Vietnam aimed to help the government to develop an analytical tool for understanding, ex
ante, the distributional impacts of such a price increase on inflation and poverty incidence (Tranh et al.
2012). It focused on three issues: (a) quantifying the link between changes in electricity and fuel prices and
poverty; (b) identifying key alternatives for future price changes and associated impacts; and (c) under-
standing the differential impacts across geographical locations. The PSIA team also developed a manual
for the analytical tool and delivered multiple training courses to build local capacity on using the tool.

The PSIA simulated multiple scenarios to support the government in understanding potential impacts. The
baseline assumed an increase in the prices of electricity and fuel by 10 percent and 5 percent, respec-




                                                                                    PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016   91
        tively, keeping all other prices and household production unchanged. Even under this assumed scenario,
        poverty would immediately increase by 0.65 percent because of an increase in the cost of living.

        However, in reality it is likely that increases in the prices of fuel and electricity would affect the production
        costs of goods and services, in turn also raising those prices and further increasing the cost of living. The
        analysis showed that if the prices of both electricity and fuel increased by 10 percent, it would (a) lead to
        a 0.58 percent increase in the consumer price index (CPI), and (b) contribute to a 0.78 percent increase in
        poverty in the short run and to a 0.88 percent increase in the long run. The PSIA also broke down the im-
        pacts by region, allowing for informed policy making.

        The analysis emphasized that trying to compensate households after price changes (based on the percent-
        age increase in overall CPI or the percentage increases in electricity and fuel prices) may not help the
        households to return to their initial levels of welfare. The tool generated considerable interest, including
        from the Minister of Finance, who was also briefed on the model as part of the dissemination activities.

Chapter 10: Transport
SECTOR OVERVIEW
Transport is an important driver of economic and social development. It is critical
in connecting people to markets and services as well as communities with each
other. Improving people’s mobility and flow of goods and services is critical for
countries to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. However, many peo-
ple and communities, especially in rural areas, lack access to reliable transport
services. There are still many remote communities, especially in low-income coun-
tries that lack access to even a single road. This isolation often acts as a barrier to
education and employment opportunities as well as to basic services such as
health care. The World Bank estimates that about 1 billion people, or 40 percent
of the rural population in International Development Association (IDA)-supported
countries lack direct access to an all-season road.1 In other cases, lack of routine
maintenance, aging infrastructure, and the pressures of urbanization affect the
availability, quality, and safety of transport systems.

Transport is one of the major areas of focus of the World Bank Group’s invest-
ments. World Bank engagement on transport focuses on a range of issues such as
rail, road, air, and water transport infrastructure and policies; urban and interre-
gional transport and connectivity; road safety; and climate resilience. Many coun-
tries have considerable scope for improvement in their transport systems. This
includes availability of safer, cleaner, and more-affordable services; more-efficient
and long-lasting accessibility solutions; better responsiveness to climate change;
enhanced competitiveness through more-efficient transport; and generation of
employment opportunities.

This chapter focuses on Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) in three coun-
tries: India, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan.2 Each PSIA approaches the transport sector
from a slightly different angle, based on the unique context of the issues in the
country and the question under study:

•	 In Pakistan, the PSIA aimed to understand the distributional impacts of im-
   provements to the freight rail infrastructure as part of a larger economic and
   sector work (ESW) on updating the freight rail system to make it more com-
   petitive as a regional trade hub (World Bank 2014b).

•	 In Uzbekistan, the PSIA focused on the potential for improving socioeconomic
   outcomes in the Ferghana Valley through developing a new railway line—the

 	 Other countries with MDTF-supported PSIAs on transport issues include Albania, Argentina, Brazil, Burkina
   Faso, Croatia, Ethiopia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Russian Federation, and Uzbeki-
   stan.

            Pap-Angren Railway—that would enhance both freight and commuter transport in the region (World
            Bank 2014a).

        •	 In India, the PSIA focused on rural road development under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
           (PMGSY) (Prime Minister’s Rural Roads Scheme) program, which had been launched in 2000 (World Bank
           2014c). The PSIA was used ex post to understand the effects of greater road connectivity of remote
           communities with market hubs in three states: Jharkand, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh.


        TOOLS AND METHODS
        Measurement of transport systems considers six dimensions: accessibility, affordability, quality, efficiency,
        financial autonomy and costs, and government and institutions. Depending on the specific issue being
        addressed, the methods may examine one or more of these dimensions. Both qualitative and quantitative
        methods can be employed for the analysis, as highlighted by the three PSIAs in this chapter. Given the
        flexibility of methodology and design, PSIAs can be conducted ex ante or ex post. As these examples
        highlight, this has been useful for transport PSIAs to understand distributional impacts and planning proj-
        ect interventions: although the India study was conducted ex post, the analyses in Pakistan and Uzbekistan
        were conducted ex ante.

        In Pakistan, the broader ESW focused on all six dimensions and relied on multiple analyses, including a
        strategic environmental assessment (SEA), an analysis of spatial disparities and industrial cluster develop-
        ment, and a PSIA. A series of workshops with the government of Pakistan identified the scope and pre-
        pared the groundwork for the analysis using the PSIA and SEA methodologies. The PSIA specifically aimed
        to answer three questions:

        •	 Which groups will be affected, how, and to what extent over the short and long term?

        •	 What will be the distributional impacts on the well-being of social groups?

        •	 How will Pakistan’s freight programs correlate with social cohesion and inclusion in Pakistan?

        To address these questions, the PSIA used both quantitative and qualitative methods. The qualitative
        analysis helped to identify stakeholders within each freight transport sector (ports, aviation, highways
        trucking, and rail as well as affected communities). Information was gathered through interviews and dis-
        cussions with members of the different stakeholder groups. The quantitative analysis focused on distribu-
        tional impacts. For this, the PSIA first developed a social accounting matrix (SAM), representing the flows
        of all economic transactions that take place within the Pakistani economy. With the SAM, the PSIA used a
        computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, based on data from the Federal Bureau of Statistics House-
        hold Income and Expenditure Surveys of 2005–06 and 2007–08 (the last two years for which these data
        were publicly available). The CGE model was used to estimate how Pakistan’s economy may react to trans-
        port reforms proposed by the government. A CGE model is an empirical tool based on neoclassical gen-
        eral equilibrium theory that links a country’s current account balances to national savings and investments.
        In such a model there is no room for current account imbalances, but CGE models are often calibrated to
        observed data for a country. The model was run for a 10 percent increase in total factor productivity (TFP)
        of rail transport.3 The modeling showed that, at this level, there is an overall positive impact on the econ-
        omy. This helped to identify the main social consequences of increased TFP as well as potential interven-
        tions for social development and poverty alleviation (World Bank 2014b).

        In Uzbekistan, to understand the unique context and characteristics of the region’s (Ferghana Valley) trans-
        portation needs and opportunities as well as its challenges such as quality of services, the PSIA used mixed
        methods. The PSIA devised and executed its own survey focusing on transport and the Ferghana Valley.

        3
         	 The TFP variable refers to the efficiency and intensity with which such inputs are utilized in production, rather than to the portion of output
           that is explained by the amount of inputs used in production.

New data were collected from both rural and urban areas in the Ferghana Valley (n=638) to capture infor-
mation on demographics; socioeconomic characteristics; and access to and use of transport services, in-
cluding frequency of use, major destinations, modes of freight and passenger transportation, and associ-
ated costs (World Bank 2014a).

The quantitative analysis was supplemented with 14 focus groups and 29 face-to-face interviews. Focus
groups were held with (a) households, including vulnerable households; (b) entrepreneurs from micro- and
small enterprises (MSEs); (c) farmers; (d) self-employed; (e) freight carriers; and (f) those employed in
handicrafts production. In-depth Interviews were also held with these stakeholder groups as well as repre-
sentatives of (a) the Chamber of Entrepreneurs and Producers (CEP); (b) large enterprises, including large
transport companies; (c) the tourism-related enterprises; (d) local authorities; and (e) the Uzbekistan Temir
Yollari’ State Joint Stock Railway Company. The focus groups and interviews emphasized the accessibility
and quality of services; the impact of these services on the volatility of imports and exports from the Fer-
ghana Valley as well as on the stability of productivity and income; and access to employment, education,
and health services (World Bank 2014a).

In India, the PSIA aimed to understand the economic impact of a national road-connectivity program: the
PMGSY. The PSIA employed both quantitative and qualitative methods to measure quantifiable differ-
ences in the economic impact on villages and gain an in-depth understanding of how the PMGSY roads
supported local communities. The PSIA used a quasi-experimental design to compare villages that had
PMGSY-supported roads with those without similar road access.4 Although the villages were selected ran-
domly, the team aimed to also include at least one village at the end of the PMGSY road, because these
were most likely to have had no roads before the intervention. A specially designed survey of 66 villages
in the states of Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh was conducted with 1,050 households. This
included 1,032 supplementary interviews with women in these households.

To compensate for the lack of baseline data, the PSIA relied on people’s recall of conditions before the
road construction. The survey was supported by 257 focus group discussions, half of which were with
women only. The data were further supplemented by key stakeholder interviews with members of local
and state governments, transport operators, and agricultural market organizers (World Bank 2014c).


HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD PRACTICES

Pakistan: Freight Rail Reforms
As the PSIA highlighted, the transport sector constituted 10 percent of Pakistan’s gross domestic product
(GDP) and provided 6 percent of the employment in the country. The transport sector played an important
role in linking other sectors in the economy, contributed to both domestic and international trade, and
helped facilitate the spatial transformation occurring in Pakistan. However, inefficiencies in the system
were costing Pakistan’s economy roughly 4–6 percent of GDP per year.

Within this context, the government of Pakistan’s 2011 Framework for Economic Growth sought to place
Pakistan on a sustained high economic growth path of 7 percent per year by reducing the cost of doing
business, improving the investment climate, and strengthening institutions. Trade and transport reforms
are central to achieving the framework’s goals.

Pakistan has the potential to become a hub for regional trade, which will have spillovers for economic
growth. Central Asia, China, India, and Iran are among the dynamic economies to which Pakistan could
connect. However, it is important that the government of Pakistan implement the right types of policies to
leverage its geographic location and transport infrastructure.

        This PSIA supported a larger ESW on green growth in the transport system in Pakistan. The PSIA contrib-
        uted to the ESW by (a) identifying social and poverty priority issues associated with the transport and trade
        policy reforms that the government of Pakistan is planning to carry out in the freight and trade facilitation
        sectors; (b) assessing alternative interventions to address identified priorities; and (c) recommending cost-
        effective and feasible policy reforms that could be incorporated as part of the freight and trade facilitation
        sectors to address social and poverty-related priorities.

        The PSIA strengthened the case for infrastructure improvements by showing that a 10 percent increase in
        transport TFP would increase the income of all households, with the largest potential for income increases
        among rural agricultural laborers and the urban nonpoor (by 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively). At
        the same time, the analysis showed that an increase in the TFP in rail or road transport could adversely
        affect nonfarm households and the urban poor. At the national level, efficient rail and road sectors have
        the potential for increasing revenue from indirect taxes through increased imports and exports. Based on
        the analysis, the PSIA found the following (World Bank 2014b):

        •	 Trade and transport reforms could be highly advantageous, especially if they promote investments as-
           sociated with industrial development.

        •	 Spatial transformation through connectivity in freight transport infrastructure is essential as a link be-
           tween industries and domestic and international markets.

        •	 The success of trade and transport reforms is dependent on addressing potential risk issues that will af-
           fect vulnerable groups in areas such as social conflict, youth and female employment, HIV-AIDS, and
           involuntary resettlement and displacement.

        A complete set of recommendations based on the overall ESW is presented in Table 10.1.

        The ESW supported the policy dialogue between the World Bank and the government of Pakistan, and
        had an impact on the programs run by the government and civil society. The Planning Commission in-
        cluded recommendations from the ESW in Pakistan’s Framework for Economic Growth and used its find-
        ings and recommendations to prepare a new “manufacturing revitalization” policy and a new transport
        policy. This PSIA also had spillover effects on other Bank operations and sector and country strategies.
        Specifically, the overall analytical methodology (the PSIA and the SEA, collectively referred to as SEPSA)
        has been integrated into Bank operations such as the Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project and
        is the basis of a new operation requested by the government of Pakistan on inclusive industrial growth. The
        ESW also helped to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Pakistan Planning Commission, the Ministry
        of Industry, and the National Trade Corridor Management Unit (World Bank 2014b).

        Uzbekistan: Improving Connectivity through Rail
        The Ferghana Valley is located in the easternmost part of Uzbekistan and comprises three provinces: Fer-
        ghana, Andizhan, and Namangan. About a third of the country’s population lives in the region. While the
        region has considerable economic potential, it lags behind the rest of the country in terms of socioeco-
        nomic development. In 2012, GDP per capita in the three provinces was below the country average (by 11
        percent, 32 percent, and 52 percent, respectively), and one-fourth of all the poor in Uzbekistan were con-
        centrated in the region. This is the highest concentration of poverty in any region in the country. Poor
        transport connectivity has been identified as a significant obstacle to development of the Ferghana Valley
        (World Bank 2015).

        Increasing the capacity for transport in the Ferghana Valley has strong potential for enhancing economic
        development in the region. Although freight and passenger transport through the region had been in-
        creasing by 10 percent annually prior to 2005, the subsequent years have seen a slowdown. By 2014, the
        transport system—specifically the highway that runs through Kamchik Pass—was close to reaching its ca-
        pacity. Because of weather-related road closures, traffic congestion, road safety, and increasing costs as-
        sociated with use of the existing highway system, there is a need for intervention.

98   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
Given the clear need for improving transportation options in the Valley (World Bank 2014a), this PSIA was
conducted to inform the World Bank’s project supporting the development of a railway line through the
Ferghana Valley (Map 10.1). The PSIA aimed to assess the expected distributional and socioeconomic ef-
fects of improved rail connectivity in Uzbekistan on the population in the Ferghana Valley, with a particular
focus on welfare gains for the poor and other vulnerable groups in the region.

India: Rural Road Development
In 2000, the government of India launched the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) (in English,
the Prime Minister’s Rural Road Scheme) with the main objective of connecting eligible communities in
rural areas through all-weather roads. Eligibility for the program depended on population size, with a focus
on communities of 500 persons or more in the plains, and of 250 people or more in hill states, desert areas,
and tribal and backward districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Planning Commission).
The program aimed to bring all of India’s villages into the mainstream by (a) improving connections to
markets; (b) reducing the time spent traveling to and from work or school, even in the rainy season; and (c)
improving villagers’ access to health services in a timely manner.

Although the PMGSY has helped to connect many communities, little information is available on how com-
munities have benefited, which ones have benefited more than others, and why. Given this context, the
PSIA aimed to analyze the differential impacts of the PMGSY public infrastructure policy. It focused on the
barriers and capacity constraints in accessing employment opportunities because of poor rural road con-
nectivity among different community groups in villages of Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh
states—with a special interest in the impacts on women, youth, and scheduled caste and tribe communi-
ties. The findings of the PSIA were expected to inform future phases of the PMGSY and recommend suit-
able policy interventions.

The PSIA was conducted in close collaboration with India’s National Rural Roads Development Agency
(NRRDA), an implementing government agency of the Ministry of Rural Development, with the fieldwork
conducted by NRRDA and a local consulting firm. This was supplemented by analysis of household-level
data by an international consultant with past experience in India specifically linked to the program.

The extensive analysis highlighted the gains made and the remaining issues. It found that the PMGSY has
indeed supported new and additional employment and business opportunities and has helped villagers to
save time relative to the control group across the three states (World Bank 2014c). Overall, two-thirds of
those living in PMGSY villages considered that opportunities had improved, while only a quarter of their
counterparts in the control villages felt the same way. However, just under half of all women in the PMGSY
villages said that at least some people had benefited. Although the majority in all three states reported
that their incomes had increased, less than 30 percent thought that their incomes were more regular or
stable than before. The PSIA also found that while greater economic specialization occurred in both the
control and treatment villages, PMGSY roads in the treatment villages influenced the cropping patterns to
shift toward commercial crops.

In addition, the analysis showed that as the PMGSY roads enabled the men to seek opportunities outside
the village, the women tended to take up the slack on the family farm or in the family business, poten-
tially filling the void left behind by the men. In a ranking of income opportunities created by the roads,
respondents ranked the opportunity to use the roads for direct movement5 between villages and other
locations for work as the highest-ranked benefit, followed by the creation of local demand for goods and
services. The role of direct movement was especially prominent among members of Other Backwards
Castes (OBC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) groups, who tend to depend heavily on unskilled wage labor.6

	 “Direct movement” refers to the use of transport infrastructure—in this case, roads—for travel to different locations.
5


	 OBC, ST, Scheduled Castes (SC), and “other” groups refer to population groups based on caste, religion, or ethnicity in India, as classified

  by the government of India.




                                                                                                           PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016         99
         For women, the most important avenue for seizing income generation opportunities was the improved
         connectivity through roads. This increased demand and supply of local goods and services in the neigh-
         boring regions and contributed to complementary private investments, such as purchase of more livestock
         or installation of an irrigation pump. At the same time, women from Scheduled Castes (SC) and “other”
         groups or those with little schooling did not perceive that they had benefited from the new opportunities.
         Most women attributed this result to their households’ lack of productive endowments, especially the lack
         of skills.

         About one-third of the respondents living in PMGSY villages said that some of their fellow villagers were
         profiting from new and additional employment and business opportunities, but they claimed not to have
         done so themselves. The rural poor are inadequately endowed with respect to privately held productive
         resources and their general economic environment. They all lack something—complementary infrastruc-
         ture, complementary public policies, or local demand. The study concludes that the women view their
         households’ lack of productive endowments—and, to a lesser extent, the lack of complementary public
         policies—as the prime grounds for their inability to exploit the potential opportunities generated by the
         PMGSY roads. This pattern differed strongly from the men, who felt the lack of complementary policies
         was a dominant reason for not benefiting from the PMGSY roads, with inadequate endowments playing a
         distinctly minor role.

         Further, although the PMGSY provided opportunities to contribute to road development through the
         “transect walk,”1 only about 30 percent of villagers interviewed had reported being aware of the event. At
         the same time, only 18 percent of the household heads reported that one or more family members had
         helped to build their village’s road. Employment opportunities for participation in road construction were
         provided under India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), but few found this to be
         attractive employment. Overall, the participation and direct employment of villagers in the planning and
         building of their PMGSY roads was weak.

         Based on this analysis, the PSIA suggested that the PMGSY program consider several policy and program-
         matic options at the state and national levels to address the challenges faced by the more-excluded
         groups to share in the benefits equally (World Bank 2014c):

         •	 Investing in training programs for skill improvement and awareness building, especially among women,
            to exploit new opportunities within their villages such as preparing and selling semifinished goods or
            processing of agricultural outputs

         •	 Investing in creating local or nearby market centers to increase local demand from nearby villages and
            towns

         •	 Promoting availability of credit or insurance, including credit for microenterprises through private sector
            investments to support financing options for microenterprise and small businesses

         •	 Promoting the availability of suitable infrastructure such as agriculture equipment or infrastructure for
            grain storage to facilitate local enterprise

         •	 Using the PMGSY as an “integrator” of various employment schemes and programs to better link the
            schemes’ benefits and promote community participation

         •	 Giving NRRDA a leading role in improving coordination among the various departments by, for in-
            stance, inviting officers of the departments involved to participate in the transect walks




         1
          	 A “transect walk” is intended to offer villagers the opportunity to accompany officials and engineers on a walk along the proposed road
            alignment, and then to express any reservations and make suggestions for its improvement. The event is supposed to be publicly an-
            nounced well in advance.

The PSIA findings were shared with the Ministries of Rural Development at the federal and state levels and
were well received. The Ministry of Rural Development has also initiated action to incorporate learnings
from the PSIA into the program. The study findings and recommendations have informed the World Bank’s
support to the PMGSY and the program’s policies for more equitable distribution of benefits in terms of
employment opportunities created by this rural roads program. It also helped clarify the likely short-term
impacts of future road works under the ongoing PMGSY program in the country. In addition, this PSIA has
informed the methodology being adopted for the ongoing activity “India: Impact Evaluation PMGSY

                                 SECTOR OVERVIEW
                                 Rising global demand for food, persistent rural poverty and vulnerability of farm-
                                 ers, and environmental degradation and climate change pose immense challeng-
                                 es for the agricultural sector. To feed 9 billion people by 2050 (UNDESA 2013),
                                 substantial increases in productivity and a transformation of the current food sys-
                                 tem are needed. There is wide agreement in the development community that
                                 agricultural growth is key to achieving the World Bank Group’s twin goals of end-
                                 ing poverty and boosting shared prosperity, given that 78 percent of the world’s
                                 poor live in rural areas, mainly relying on agriculture as their primary source of in-
                                 come.2 Throughout the developing world, more frequent, more intense weather
                                 events such as droughts and floods increase food price volatility and put farmers’
                                 livelihoods at risk. Other global dynamics, such as growing demand for high-value
                                 products and emerging trade routes, may provide new opportunities.

                                 Government intervention in agricultural markets is intended to correct market fail-
                                 ures in order to improve efficiency and coordination in the sector, increase the
                                 productivity and value added of local production, improve producers’ access to
                                 markets, foster farmers’ resilience to shocks, or ensure food security for the do-
                                 mestic population. For instance, to improve the terms of trade vis-à-vis interna-
                                 tional traders and buyers, many developing countries have established quasi-gov-
                                 ernmental organizations (such as marketing boards) that manage international
                                 trade and prices for a given commodity. Although public interventions in input,
                                 credit, and output markets may be instrumental in addressing barriers in agricul-
                                 tural development, government effectiveness is not uncommonly hampered by
                                 mismanagement and corruption. In recent years, there has been renewed focus
                                 among development partners on mobilizing private investment in agriculture to
                                 complement cost-effective public support (Townsend et al. 2013). Moreover, gov-
                                 ernments need to carefully consider potential trade-offs of a given policy instru-
                                 ment. For instance, price regulation that intends to protect farmers’ income may
                                 conflict with the goal of guaranteeing affordable food for the urban population
                                 (Lundberg 2005, 151).

                                 Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) in agriculture have been predomi-
                                 nantly conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa (including Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Mo-

supported a multicountry study in the West African Sahel that examines rural resilience to shocks and
vulnerability to malnutrition.3 Other MDTF-funded PSIA topics include fertilizers and seed distribution
programs; mechanization and labor conditions (cotton harvesting); mobilization and targeting of agricul-
tural investment; institutional governance (farmers’ cooperatives); price stabilization and procurement
policies (in the rice and grain sector); industrialization and competition (in the cashew sector); and liberal-
ization and privatization (in the coffee sector).


TOOLS AND METHODS
Governments have great interest in tools and methodologies that help them to identify and target reforms
and investments that foster growth in marginalized rural areas. Given the importance of the rural economy
and export agriculture for the poor in the developing world, boosting productivity and access to markets
for the rural population remains a key policy objective for the World Bank and its clients. The impact of any
given reform can be evaluated along different transmission channels, which include input prices, commod-
ity prices, credit and interest rates, employment, wages, market structure, taxes and transfers, and public
goods.4

In the development community, the concept of the value chain has evolved as a key framework to identify
the winners and losers of policy changes or external shocks in agriculture. Specifically, the framework aims
to understand the processes and interactions of firms and individuals that contribute to the creation and
delivery of agricultural products to consumers. Increased attention to producers’ links to domestic and
global markets is driving new approaches to generate growth and reduce poverty. In fact, the value chain
literature brought forth a large number of approaches and methodologies that help to identify priority
sectors and development potential; develop strategies to increase value capture and value creation; en-
hance opportunities in global markets; improve the business and policy environment; and monitor and
evaluate value chains toward the overall development goals (Webber and Labaste 2010).

Examples for the use of the value chain framework among MDTF-funded PSIAs include work in Guinea-
Bissau, Mozambique, and Pakistan (World Bank 2015a, 2015b, 2015d). In Guinea-Bissau, analysis of the
cashew sector builds on a theoretical value chain model that characterizes competition and the pass-
through of price changes at the farmer-trader link and the trader-exporter link (as further discussed below
in the “Highlights and Good Practices” section). The simulation of counterfactual scenarios provides im-
portant inputs for the policy dialogue on export duties. Academics and World Bank teams from other de-
partments have expressed interest in applying this model to other areas.

In Mozambique, a model developed in the context of a PSIA calculates the direct and indirect value added
generated along the coastal fisheries value chain, as well as their distribution among households, capital
owners, and the state (see Box 11.1). By offering a variety of economic indicators, the value chain model
helps to improve the monitoring and evaluation capacity of the Ministry of Fisheries. Although quantitative
value chain analysis is very common, the value chain literature also acknowledges the use of qualitative
methods such as key informant interviews, participatory chain mapping, and focus groups, particularly in
contexts where reliable data are limited (Donovan et al. 2015, 16).

             BOX 11.1: MOZAMBIQUE—MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE COASTAL
             FISHERIES VALUE CHAIN


              Over the past two decades, Mozambique has developed a comprehensive statistical system for the fisheries
              sector, relatively unique by the amount and diversity of data and time series available. However, the govern-
              ment’s data collection and processing is highly fragmented and poorly implemented, without a clearly defined
              policy objective. The Bank team worked closely with the government of Mozambique to develop a standardized
              socioeconomic model that enables authorities to significantly improve performance tracking of the fisheries
              sector. Specifically, the PSIA helped to integrate various datasets in order to evaluate both the social and eco-
              nomic impact of coastal fisheries along the entire value chain, including both the harvest and postharvest
              sectors.a The work was part of a technical assistance agreement with the government of Mozambique, and it
              had the objective of enhancing the administration’s capacity to apply tools for a sound economic management
              of the sector.
              The value chain model gives a clear and detailed picture of the contribution of the coastal fisheries sector to the
              economy. The Ministry of Fisheries indicated willingness to embed the model into its national information sys-
              tem in order to inform progress monitoring and provide policy guidance. The adoption and use of the model was
              supported by complementary training for ministry staff, a user manual for the model, and a case study describing
              the economic impacts of the fisheries sector in the country. However, the PSIA indicated that limited technical
              and institutional capacities remain important challenges that need to be addressed to ensure effective use and
              expansion of the model in the future. The principal constraints identified relate to the difficult access to quality
              datab and to the limited exposure of the ministry staff to economics.c
              Source: MdP 2014; World Bank 2015d.
              a. It calculates the direct value added generated by each subsector, the indirect value added for upstream activities (intermediate
              consumption), and the distribution of the direct and indirect value added among households, capital owners, and the state.
              b. Although available quantitative data is rich at the production level (fishing and aquaculture), data are lacking for upstream
              activities such as processing and marketing. The main constraint for model development would reside in obtaining data for
              small-scale and informal fishing activities, which are the most labor-intensive, tend to be female-operated, and contribute to the
              livelihoods of the poorest.
              c. Recommendations of the PSIA include the following: (a) data collection and processing need to be improved and streamlined,
              given that data must be collected from various sources within the fisheries administration; and (b) a complementary long-term
              training program should be developed to support adoption, correct use, and development of the model within the administration.
              The Bank team continues to work with the client and potential partners to ensure deployment and improvement of the model.




         Another important development in this sector has been the use of innovative geospatial approaches. A
         case in point is an MDTF-funded PSIA conducted in Nicaragua that introduces a new angle to investment
         prioritization (World Bank 2013a). The team developed a tool to classify microregions according to their
         unique characteristics and potential for development, an area not covered by previous sector analyses (see
         Box 11.2).5 Specifically, the tool combines poverty maps and market accessibility analysis with an econo-
         metric stochastic profit frontier model. Although detailed socioeconomic profiles help to inform policy
         prioritization (by identifying deprived regions), they fall short of accommodating the criterion of resource
         optimization. Unlike poverty maps or cluster analysis, this PSIA offers a model that identifies those regions
         where investments have the biggest potential impact on poverty reduction, given certain economic and
         geographic constraints.

    BOX 11.2: NICARAGUA—NEW TOOLS FOR INVESTMENT PRIORITIZATION

     In the context of an economic and sector work (ESW) on competitiveness and integration in Central America, an
     MDTF-funded PSIA supported the development of a tool that allows policy makers to prioritize investments in
     agricultural development. This PSIA applied the analytical tool to the Nicaraguan context, but further analysis
     on Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Nicaragua soon followed.
     In Nicaragua, geographic information system (GIS) technology, a detailed georeferenced household survey, and
     good availability of micro-level biophysical data enabled construction of a typology that captures the heteroge-
     neity of rural populations based on a variety of socioeconomic, institutional, and physical criteria.a Areas that
     have a high incidence of poverty but low potential in agricultural development need to be targeted through cash
     transfer programs or other social policy measures. On the other hand, areas that show high productive potential
     in the presence of efficiency bottlenecks require targeted investments (for example, investments that improve
     accessibility or reduce transaction costs).
     The policy discussions have confirmed that this type of analysis is highly relevant for Nicaragua and other gov-
     ernments in the region, where the Bank is continuing its engagement on investment prioritization and agricul-
     tural development.b The PSIA had an impact on Bank activities in Nicaragua through the Agriculture Public
     Expenditure Review and the sectorwide approach in agriculture (PRORURAL).

     a. The criteria include climate, topography, production assets, access to roads and markets, off-farm job opportunities, demography
     (such as population density and gender distribution), and institutions and services (such as credit providers).
     b. The ongoing dialogue with clients and stakeholders is considered to be instrumental given the complexity of the model and
     demand for the Bank’s assistance to apply the analysis to policy making.




MDTF-funded PSIAs have highlighted the value of participatory methodologies and political economy
analysis. PSIA is ultimately about identifying the people who are likely to be affected by a given policy.
However, in addition to the analysis of potential impacts, it is important to understand the perceptions and
political influence of different stakeholder groups, as has been illustrated in the case of coffee sector re-
forms in Burundi (described in the “Highlights and Good Practices” section below). Even sensible and
technically sound reforms are deemed to fail if the interests and positions of powerful stakeholders are not
taken into account. Thus, a sense of ownership among all relevant stakeholders is crucial to ensure effec-
tive policy implementation and minimize unintended consequences.

Quantitative methods are still dominant in most PSIAs in agriculture, but experiences from the MDTF show
that qualitative methods are increasingly employed to collect and analyze data, either to complement or
to replace quantitative approaches. PSIAs from Burundi and Uzbekistan are examples for the use of quali-
tative methods. In Burundi, focus group discussions provided insights on capacity constraints among cof-
fee cooperatives and were helpful to interpret and validate the quantitative results from a household sur-
vey (World Bank 2014c). In Uzbekistan, the collection of qualitative data through focus group discussions,
semistructured interviews, and mini case studies was used to shed light on social and labor issues related
to the mechanization of cotton harvests (World Bank 2013b).6 Soliciting the views of cotton farmers and
pickers was crucial to identify critical social risks as well as the groups that are most likely to be affected.
The methodology proved to be useful to start the policy dialogue on a new and highly sensitive issue. In
both countries, qualitative findings have been used to design a sound questionnaire for a complementary
household survey.



	 Inquiry techniques that were used included participatory wealth ranking, scoring and ranking of problems and options for solving them, and
6

  formal questionnaires for collecting farm economic data (World Bank 2013b).

         HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD PRACTICES

         Guinea-Bissau: Revisiting Instruments to Support the Cashew Economy
         In Guinea-Bissau, a PSIA found strong evidence to advocate for the abolition of an existing export levy on
         cashews, given its negative impact on poverty. Despite considerable political instability, this PSIA has suc-
         cessfully created public awareness on the issue and influenced the government’s policy discussions around
         cashew sector reforms. Cashew production is vital for Guinea-Bissau’s economy and plays a key role in the
         country’s strategy for poverty reduction, given that it is the primary source of household income for the
         poor. Raw cashew nuts are the country’s main export good, with export volumes increasing substantially in
         recent years. However, only a fraction of harvested cashews are processed in the country, pointing to
         missed opportunities to improve value creation. Smuggling into neighboring countries—to circumvent the
         high export taxes in Guinea-Bissau7—is estimated to make up a significant portion of cashew exports (Ha-
         nusch 2016).

         In 2011, the government introduced a surcharge on cashew exports to finance the newly established Fund
         to Promote the Industrialization of Agricultural Products (FUNPI). FUNPI was created, in the presence of
         high global cashew prices, to increase the value added of cashew production through improved process-
         ing capacity. Although the importance of policies that support agribusiness development were evident,
         FUNPI also created concerns about the potential negative impact on poverty of the export levy, particu-
         larly when international prices are low. Moreover, FUNPI had failed to achieve its intended objective, as
         resources had leaked and none of the envisaged promotion of cashew processing had taken place. In this
         context, a PSIA was conducted to provide analytical foundations for the policy dialogue on cashew sector
         reforms (World Bank 2015a). It was intended to support a development policy operation (DPO) and an
         investment project with an emphasis on cashew sector reform, yet a military coup in April 2012 led to the
         suspension of World Bank operations in Guinea-Bissau, delaying the PSIA work. It was only resumed when
         the Bank started reengaging with Guinea-Bissau in late 2013.

         The analysis builds on a theoretical model of the export agriculture value chain, whereby exporters, trad-
         ers, and farmers operate under imperfect competition.8 The dominance of a small number of traders and
         exporters, who capture the bulk of the cashew rents, weakens the farmers’ position in the value chain. In
         the face of these distortions in competition, the introduction of the FUNPI levy is borne mainly by farmers
         (who absorb 80 percent of the levy), while exporters (13 percent) and traders (7 percent) only absorb a
         small fraction. Likewise, farmers are more exposed than others in the value chain to international price
         shocks (either positive or negative), because these have strong effects on farm-gate prices.

         Simulations of the welfare effects show that poor and rural households are disproportionally affected by
         these effects because their share of income derived from cashews is much higher (Cont and Porto 2014).
         Accordingly, the FUNPI levy hit poor cashew-producing households the hardest (scenario B in Table 11.1:
         Welfare Effects of FUNPI Levy in Guinea-BissauTable 11.1). Overall, it was estimated that the FUNPI levy
         raised extreme poverty (at the national extreme poverty line of US$1 per day) by 3 percentage points. The
         results thus indicate a robust and pronounced negative impact on poverty that has to be pitted against a
         lack of progress on cashew processing—the intended purpose of FUNPI.

          	 Industrial and other export taxes add up to 11 percent of the reference price, which the government defines at the beginning of every
            export season. In 2011, an additional tax was introduced that finances the Fund to Promote the Industrialization of Agricultural Products
            (FUNPI), with a contribution of CFAF 50 per kilogram (approximately US$100 per ton) of exportable cashews (Cont and Porto 2014, 7). (In
            contrast to other exports taxes, the FUNPI surcharge is a per-unit tax.)
         8
          	 The model characterizes the value chain as an oligopsony in the farmer-trader link and as a bilateral oligopoly in the trader-exporter link.
            Cashew processors interact as buyers at the final stage of the value chain (Cont and Porto 2014).

price between 2008 and 2013 (US$950 per ton).



Additionally, the PSIA looked at the combined effect of the FUNPI tax with other policy measures to ex-
plore the potential impacts of FUNPI when funds are used as originally intended:

•	 Complementary policies that increase competition are beneficial by reducing costs at the respective
   links with traders and exporters in the value chain.

•	 Policies that increase the processing capacity are likely to create added value by displacing volume from
   exporters to processors.

•	 The provision of services to farmers directly reduces farmers’ production costs but would also affect
   cashew supply and consequently equilibrium prices.

Although all these policies would help to recover reductions in farm-gate prices and household welfare,
taken separately none of these measures was estimated to likely be sufficient to compensate for welfare
losses incurred by the FUNPI levy. Therefore, a comprehensive policy package and dramatic improve-
ments in the governance of FUNPI would be required to achieve its objectives. Given the magnitude of
the negative poverty impacts of the tax, the PSIA recommends the abolition of the levy as the preferred
scenario.

The findings were presented in Guinea-Bissau in September 2014, causing considerable public debate,
including wide news coverage. There were strong voices within the government demanding the suspen-
sion of the FUNPI levy, and increased public awareness was crucial to build momentum and move forward
with the reforms. The Bank followed up on recommendations through a number of projects and contrib-

         uted to increased visibility of the issue among donors.9 Several policy recommendations of the PSIA—in-
         cluding the abolition of the FUNPI levy but also recommendations with implications for rice and social
         protection policy—are included in the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), which was presented at
         the donor roundtable in early 2015 and is informing the Bank’s wider strategy in the country. Through these
         various channels, the Bank’s engagement played an important role in the policy dialogue that led to the
         successive reduction of the FUNPI rate (by 20 percent), followed soon after by the complete suspension of
         the FUNPI levy.

         The country’s political instability and weak institutions were a major challenge for this PSIA. Guinea-Bissau
         is a poor and fragile state with a considerable lack of data for policy analysis. The coup d’ėtat of 2012
         caused a political and economic crisis that put the Bank’s activities at risk. However, in spite of these barri-
         ers, the PSIA team reengaged as soon as the suspension of activities was lifted and managed to generate
         a robust analysis under considerable time pressure. The suspension of the FUNPI levy is estimated to have
         reduced extreme poverty by 3 percentage points, making this PSIA an important contributor towards
         achieving the Bank’s goals. The success of this PSIA was related to a variety of factors, including some
         beyond the control of the research teams undertaking the analysis. Yet, the example also shows that ad-
         equate responses can address these risks and help policy makers to navigate through often difficult reform
         processes.

         Burundi: Building Consensus for Policy Action in the Coffee Sector
         In Burundi, PSIA helped to address the concerns of a group of key stakeholders in the coffee sector—the
         coffee producers (World Bank 2014c, 2015c). Coffee is big business in Burundi, accounting for over 60
         percent of export revenues (as of 2011). Over half of Burundian rural households rely on coffee proceeds,
         directly and indirectly, for their livelihood. In 2007, coffee proceeds provided 43.8 percent of direct reve-
         nues for rural households. Although agricultural production and export has been the domain of the private
         sector, the public sector owned about 85 percent of coffee washing stations (CWS) for cleaning coffee
         berries, an intermediate step in the coffee supply chain.

         There are about 118 CWS in Burundi, strategically located so that harvested cherries from plantations can
         reach washing and pulping equipment no later than six hours after harvest. However, CWS have suffered
         from poor management affecting the quality of coffee. Because Burundi exports 100 percent of its coffee,
         addressing the quality issue was imperative as it affects price. Therefore, in 2008, the government of Bu-
         rundi decided, with support from international partners including the World Bank, to privatize the CWS.
         This was part of larger reforms initiated in 2005 to enhance the competitiveness of Burundian coffee in
         international markets.

         However, there has been considerable opposition to this by coffee growers, stemming from concerns
         about how privatization would affect their livelihoods. The issue became highly politicized, leading to a
         suspension of privatization activities. The coffee growers’ lobby also sent a formal complaint to the World
         Bank to stop the privatization on humanitarian grounds. One of the underlying issues was insufficient con-
         sultation with coffee growers. They were concerned that privatization of CWS would weaken their position
         in the coffee value chain, given that CWS operate as the link between coffee growers and exporters. Vola-
         tile coffee prices in the international markets and delays in payments to farmers for their produce also
         contributed to their concerns. Under the reforms, the government had also reserved 25 percent of the
         CWS shares for local coffee grower associations to purchase, but the financial requirements to qualify as a
         buyer for these shares were difficult to meet. These concerns triggered a discussion between the Bank, the
         government, and other donors, which resulted in the PSIA.

            other donors were involved in the policy discussion. The International Monetary Fund discussed the reduction of the FUNPI levy in its 2014
            Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and made the audit of FUNPI a structural benchmark of its 2015 Extended Credit Facility (ECF).

The PSIA found no evidence to suggest that privatized CWS reduced household welfare for the majority
of the coffee growers. However, the PSIA also identified some vulnerable groups that needed special at-
tention. Data analysis showed that those who sell their coffee cherries to private washing stations, while
having incomes about 21 percent higher than those who sell to public CWS, may be more vulnerable to
external price shocks. The PSIA did not find robust signs that coffee growers selling cherries to private
CWS have lower household welfare. No significant differences were found regarding

•	 Coffee revenues per household;

•	 Food consumption per household member; or

•	 The farmers’ (and, as such, heads of household) perceptions of being poor.

The PSIA also highlighted the need for up-front investment in the supply chain with better communications
and more-inclusive reforms. Households overwhelmingly continued to self-finance their coffee activities
after privatization, with other financing sources playing only a marginal role (Figure 11.1). The PSIA recom-
mendations include (a) assisting coffee growers with finding durable solutions for financing the 25 percent
reserved shares; (b) supporting capacity building and training to improve crop productivity; and (c) for the
most vulnerable households, promoting diversification of activities toward nonagricultural business.

The PSIA results were disseminated through different communications channels including the government
and coffee grower networks. This helped to better engage stakeholders, while the analytical evidence
helped to generate buy-in for the policy reform. As a result of this exercise, a new project focusing on the
whole value chain for the coffee sector was launched and, as of late 2014, privatization of CWS was back
on the Parliament’s agenda.

Democratic Republic of Congo: Interventions against Sexual
& Gender-Based Violence
In an exceedingly challenging operating environment, a PSIA conducted in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) explored the nexus between trade and gender by testing the effectiveness of specific inter-
ventions (World Bank 2014a). Small-scale, cross-border traders provide critical trade links across neighbor-
ing countries in the African Great Lakes Region. Yet in the DRC, these traders, the large majority of whom


                                                                                  PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016   109
         are women, frequently face harassment and demands for bribes at the border.10 They also face a volatile
         security situation inside DRC’s territory, as conflict in the eastern part of the country continues to pose a
         threat to their lives and livelihoods. This PSIA is also motivated by an increased interest in regional trade
         integration in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the existence of fragmented national markets lowers opportuni-
         ties for trade gains and agricultural value chains.11 While contributing to economic growth, the facilitation
         of cross-border trade for small-scale women traders will also portray an important gender empowerment
         component if trade facilitation is not at the cost of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).

         In 2011 the World Bank’s Africa Region Gender Innovation Lab embarked on a quantitative study with the
         goal of informing the discussion about the constraints these small-scale traders face (García Mora and
         Roshan 2013). The work built on a qualitative survey from 2009 and aimed to further the understanding of
         corruption and SGBV taking place at the border. In this context, the PSIA MDTF supported an impact
         evaluation of a cross-border training program, which sought to help policy makers devise gender-smart
         interventions in the trade sector, with the goal of replicating the model in other border posts in the Great
         Lakes Region (World Bank 2014a).12 In addition to quantitative data collection through baseline and end-
         line surveys (in 2011 and 2013), focus groups were conducted in May 2012 to prepare traders for a mobile-
         phone data collection element of the project.

         The impact evaluation uses a randomized control trial to assess the impact of the trader training on cor-
         ruption, SGBV, and income indicators for small-scale traders in Rwanda and the DRC. The evaluated inter-
         ventions included (a) workshops that trained cross-border traders on taxes and tariffs, information related
         to sexual harassment and bribes at the border-crossings, and formation and management of cooperatives;
         and (b) workshops that trained border officials on taxes and tariffs and on traders’ rights. The project and
         analytical work was conducted in close collaboration with national and local government entities in the
         DRC13 as well as in partnership with the Catholic University of Bukavu and with International Alert, a non-
         governmental organization (NGO) that has been working with small-scale traders in Eastern DRC since
         2009. It is important to note that the PSIA faced a number of challenges related to the sensitivity of the
         topic, political instability, and the fragile and conflict-affected environment (Box 11.3).

         The surveys and focus group discussions indicate that corruption and SGBV are predominant trade barri-
         ers. The findings from a randomly selected sample of traders in the DRC towns of Goma and Bukavu re-
         vealed that 67 percent of respondents reported having experienced some form of corruption; 10 percent
         reported having undergone some form of physical violence; 31 percent reported having been insulted;
         and approximately 5 percent of traders reported having experienced some form of SGBV while crossing
         the border during a 30-day recall period. Structured interviews with 66 border officials from the four main
         border agencies (customs, immigration, hygiene, and arms control) and focus group discussions with trad-
         ers revealed that the officials demonstrate higher socioeconomic welfare than the traders. They also report
         low job satisfaction and poor working conditions, have limited knowledge about correct fees and border
         crossing procedures, and have reported conflicting information on border payments. Finally, contrary to
         the traders’ accounts, they also reported low rates of SGBV at border crossings.

         The impact evaluation results indicate a drop in (self-reported) bribe payments and SGBV, which was pos-
         sibly related to a change in trading patterns among those traders who participated in the workshop: that
         is, some traders opted to cross the border at times when the guards were not present.14 Paradoxically,
         desired results can be attained through nondesired channels, without changing the nature of legal cross-

110   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
 BOX 11.3: IMPACT EVALUATION IN THE DRC IN THE CONTEXT OF CONFLICT
 AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY

   Between 2011 and 2013, the MDTF supported an impact evaluation of a training program designed to em-
   power small-scale traders and to reduce trade barriers at the border between Rwanda and the DRC. The train-
   ings were conducted for both traders and border officials to inform them about existing taxes and tariffs, as well
   as the traders’ rights in the face of sexual harassment and corruption. This PSIA illustrates some of the difficulties
   that researchers face when conducting fieldwork on sensitive issues and in challenging environments. Although
   impact evaluations have some common challenges, conducting such an analysis in a fragile and conflict-affected
   country comes with its own problems.
   Multiple breakouts of violent conflict occurred during the study period that adversely affected the fieldwork.
   Further, elections in the DRC in the fall of 2012, which were accompanied by significant political instability,
   caused additional delays. The deteriorating security situation in the Eastern DRC and the capture of the city of
   Goma by M23 rebels in November 2012 delayed the training activities conducted by the partner NGO (Interna-
   tional Alert). Data collection was additionally hampered by the lack of infrastructure in parts of the Eastern DRC.
   The evaluation used a randomized control trial to measure the training program’s impact on several indicators
   related to corruption, SGBV, and income. The baseline survey used a random sample of 628 female traders (of
   whom 75 percent live in the DRC and 25 percent in Rwanda). However, randomization of the sample of 66
   border officials was obstructed because the government of the DRC defined a subset of border officials from
   whom the research team was permitted to draw a sample to interview. Thus, it is impossible to evaluate the
   training of border officials in a rigorous manner.
   Moreover, the experimental mobile-phone survey of traders was dropped in February 2013 after several months
   and multiple unsuccessful attempts to establish contact with a threshold number of baseline survey respon-
   dents. Given the high mobility of traders and the sensitive nature of the intervention, there were problems veri-
   fying the identities of some traders based on the data collected at baseline. The surveyed traders exhibited a low
   degree of trust when initially approached by survey enumerators.a Therefore, an intensive tracking exercise was
   conducted during the follow-up survey to increase the response rate and ensure a sufficiently large panel sample
   for the two survey waves. Thus, the team managed to complete the impact evaluation despite these challenges.

border trading activities. However, in this case, the results may not be sustainable. A major limitation of this
PSIA was the difficulty in evaluating the training of border officials (as discussed in Box 11.3). In fact, the
training and incentives of border authorities may prove critical for sustained change in this area.

Interventions that target training on taxes, tariffs, and trade regulations are not always straightforward. The
general ambiguity around the tax regime could only be partly addressed, because it is to some extent
deliberate: the lack of clear information benefits certain actors who wish to extract rents. It also appears
that addressing information constraints may be necessary but insufficient to address the challenges faced
by small-scale traders in the Eastern DRC. It is equally important to create permanent mechanisms that
ensure both social accountability and access to critical information. The informality of tariff mechanisms
and regulations on the borders in the Great Lakes regions requires extensive reforms, including improve-
ments in enforcing and monitoring existing regulations. Yet, there is clearly a need for further analysis of
the causality of corruption and SGBV and its nexus to ongoing trade reforms.

         This work spurred the policy dialogue on gender-informed programming to improve the conditions of
         cross-border traders in the region. This dialogue was carried out not just at the local and national level, but
         also extended regionally and influenced the operations of the World Bank and relevant partners. Collabo-
         ration with civil society organizations, particularly the partnership with International Alert, helped to
         strengthen advocacy and raise the issue of SGBV in the dialogue around trade reforms. Within the World
         Bank, the engagement led to the integration of a conflict prevention strategy into the national strategy of
         the World Bank in the DRC.1 The accompanying analytical work was used to inform the design of a re-
         gional operation on cross-border trade in the Great Lakes region.

                                 Chapter 12: Final Remarks
                                 This report highlighted good practices and specific innovations of the Poverty
                                 and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) approach in the context of PSIA challenges
                                 and opportunities in different sectors and thematic areas. The report covers 10
                                 thematic areas, but, in fact, many PSIAs are cross-sectoral in nature and touch
                                 upon issues that are connected to more than one theme. Moreover, the PSIAs
                                 featured here cover only a subset of the broad range of sectors and topics repre-
                                 sented among all PSIAs funded by the PSIA Multi-Donor Task Force (MDTF).

                                 Similarly, the PSIA exhibit substantial diversity in terms of “product types”
                                 and how they are embedded in World Bank operations. For instance, some
                                 PSIAs fed into the Bank’s economic and sector work (ESW), improving their pro-
                                 poor focus and incorporating specific policy recommendations (such as the PSIA
                                 on freight transportation reforms in Pakistan and the one on investment prioritiza-
                                 tion in agricultural development in Nicaragua). Others have, at different design
                                 stages, informed one or more of the Bank’s Development Policy Financing (DPF)
                                 products. The PSIAs included in this report also address poverty and social exclu-
                                 sion in the context of technical assistance (TA) connected to lending operations or
                                 have contributed to global and regional knowledge products. One of the greatest
                                 advantages of PSIA is its flexibility and capacity to adapt to different contexts and
                                 needs. The main lessons learned from the PSIA experience are reflected in their
                                 adaptation of methods, support to capacity building, and enhancement informed
                                 policy dialogue and Bank lending operations in client countries.


                                 METHODOLOGY
                                 PSIA use a diverse and wide range of methods, which can integrate cutting-
                                 edge poverty analysis with various forms of social analysis. The choice of meth-
                                 ods in PSIA is driven by (a) the question being studied; (b) data availability; and (c)
                                 time, capacity, and resources.2 The use of particular methodologies—whether
                                 qualitative, quantitative, or mixed—varies across sectors and is driven by the re-
                                 search focus. For instance, PSIA on fiscal policies are overwhelmingly quantitative
                                 because they focus on vertical inequalities (welfare implications along the income
                                 distribution). In other areas, such as social protection and health, the emphasis on
                                 horizontal inequalities is more common (group- or identity-based disadvantages),
                                 often requiring qualitative data to identify vulnerable groups and understand the
                                 underlying dynamics of exclusion. Some have also employed experimental de-
                                 signs (such as the discrete choice experiment in Senegal, as detailed in chapter 7)
                                 and quasi-experimental designs (such as the assessment of rural roads develop-
                                 ment in India, described in chapter 10).

114   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
Mixed-methods studies have been common among MDTF-funded PSIAs. One aspect of determining
the best mix of methods concerns the nature of outcomes the PSIA is trying to assess. Qualitative data on
subjective outcomes (such as “life satisfaction” or “feeling treated with respect”) contrast with quantitative
data on objective outcomes (such as income or literacy scores). Good practices have successfully inte-
grated different methodologies (either sequentially or concurrently), including the following design strategies:

•	 Exploratory design, which uses qualitative data to explore relevant issues to design a survey or a new
   instrument.

•	 Explanatory design, in which qualitative results help to explain and interpret the findings of a quantita-
   tive study.

•	 Triangulation, which uses qualitative and quantitative data in a complementary way to confirm or cross-
   validate findings.

•	 Nested design, in which the study is guided by either a qualitative or a quantitative research design but
   embeds the other method to address a particular aspect.

A recurring theme in the spectrum of qualitative methods has been to solicit perceptions of benefi-
ciaries and other stakeholders. Researchers acknowledge their importance for the analysis of processes
of exclusion and inclusion. As such, many methods to inquire about subjective views (such as focus group
discussions or stakeholder workshops) play an important role in raising awareness about policy issues and
thereby propel the national dialogue around reforms. Given that awareness of existing policies or reform
proposals is often strikingly low, such methods are particularly important. For example, in the water and
energy sectors, information asymmetries can contribute to increased cost for consumers. In Ukraine, en-
gaging with stakeholders through interviews, focus groups, and workshops was crucial to identify demand-
side constraints in the water sector. Understanding consumer attitudes helped to design an effective
awareness campaign as well as to improve accountability of service providers (chapter 8).

Innovations in PSIA have taken various forms. They include new tools for data collection and analysis,
the integration of existing methods and frameworks to address a policy issue, and the application of well-
established approaches to new fields and policy instruments. Although many innovations presented in this
report are driven by new technologies and the availability of more and better data (such as geospatial data
in health and agriculture), there are also examples where innovative approaches are developed as a re-
sponse to poor data. This is highlighted in the PSIA on cultural heritage and sustainable development in
Bhutan. This PSIA developed its methodology through multiple refinements to quantitative and qualitative
methods, often learning through trial and error because of the lack of referential studies and the scope of
this analysis. The team used both exploratory and explanatory strategies and put together a comprehen-
sive upstream assessment of a proposed bill on cultural heritage (chapter 5, Box 5.1).

Many innovative studies have supported and have benefited from the transfer of technical knowl-
edge, both within and across regions. Standardization and harmonization of certain research instruments
have become important to the PSIA agenda. This applies to multicountry studies (such as the Commitment
to Equity [CEQ] assessments, and the Subsidy Simulation Stata Package [SUBSIM] applications in the
Middle East and North Africa region)3 that allow for international and intertemporal comparison, as well as
to national efforts to standardize and integrate monitoring and evaluations systems (such as the PSIA of
the fisheries sector in Mozambique, discussed in chapter 11, Box 11.1).

Additionally, ownership and in-country capacity to generate and use PSIA are important consider-
ations in the choice of tools and methods. There is a potential trade-off between (a) the level of sophis-
tication of certain methods, and (b) their accessibility and feasibility given existing capacity, resource, and
time constraints. PSIA teams have addressed this trade-off in different ways, depending on the client’s

         needs and local circumstances. Innovative models such as SUBSIM helped Bank teams in various countries
         in the Middle East and North Africa region to produce robust simulations of subsidy reforms under tight
         budgets and timelines. On the other hand, to ensure local ownership in Cameroon and Sierra Leone, the
         PSIA teams developed a subsidy simulation model that took into account the client’s existing technical
         capacity.


         PROVIDING POLICY MAKERS WITH EVIDENCE
         Another feature of PSIA, as showcased in this report, is their role in helping policy makers to make
         informed decisions about the trade-offs they face when designing and implementing policy reforms.
         The value of PSIA lies in providing evidence to quantify and rationalize these trade-offs, which are other-
         wise difficult to grasp. For instance, short- and long-term effects need to be balanced in a sensible way. An
         example is the adoption of renewable technologies, whose overall positive impact in the long run (especially
         by reducing climate-change-related costs) may cause energy prices to rise in the short to medium term.

         The analyses of fiscal policies presented in this report offer insights into the relative importance of
         different revenue and spending categories regarding their distributional and budget impacts. For
         example, in Indonesia, a striking 23 percent of public spending goes toward energy subsidies. These are
         important for the poor, but the more affluent population groups benefit the most in absolute terms.4 A
         broader look at the fiscal system suggests considerable potential to raise, reallocate, and spend fiscal re-
         sources more effectively, especially from an equity point of view. PSIA strengthens the narrative in favor of
         these types of complex reforms that help to free fiscal resources for more pro-poor policies.

         Generally, PSIA is conducted ex ante to inform policy design or implementation, but they may also
         provide ex post lessons from previous interventions. It is fairly common that PISA have elements of both
         ex ante and ex post evaluation, given that they are conducted in the midst of a larger reform process. In
         some countries, the MDTF supported more than one PSIA to follow up on previous work and accompany
         long-term sectoral reforms. (See, for instance, the discussions of PSIAs in chapter 3 on Cameroon and in
         chapter 4 on Fiji.)

         The PSIA experience highlights the challenges in designing policies that reach the poorest and most
         vulnerable groups. These groups often face multiple deprivations that are perpetuated by social norms
         and a general lack of voice and empowerment. Although PSIA aim to identify and mitigate adverse im-
         pacts, as the experiences presented here underscore, they also help identify opportunities that either le-
         verage positive impacts or improve the efficiency of a given policy. For instance, a PSIA in India found that
         the public investments in rural roads had limited benefits for rural women (chapter 10). Although men were
         more likely to travel to other areas, women benefited indirectly through the auxiliary demand created for
         local goods and services. This has implications for small-business or agribusiness policies and labor market
         opportunities. Breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and social exclusion often requires integrated policy
         interventions in various sectors and on different levels. A good example in this regard is the PSIA on youth
         inclusion in Tunisia that, instead of using a narrow “job lens,” opted for a holistic approach that spans the
         areas of (a) participation and active citizenship, (b) access to economic opportunities, and (c) youth-friend-
         ly services at the local level (chapter 5).

         Even pro-poor reforms that are targeted toward underserved communities tend to have potential for
         increasing effectiveness and efficiency through complementary policy measures. A discrete choice
         experiment (DCE) in Senegal strengthened the case for piloting a maternal health conditional cash transfer
         (CCT) program to encourage better maternal and newborn health outcomes (chapter 7). In Albania, an-
         other PSIA assessed the allocation mechanisms for disability benefits. It demonstrated that good poverty

116   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
targeting requires in-depth knowledge about the use of public services and the realities on the ground and
suggested policy changes to address existing inconsistencies and improve targeting accuracy (chapter 4).


INFORMING OPERATIONS AND POLICY REFORMS
PSIA have also influenced policy dialogue and contributed to changes in the course of reforms. The
nature of the relationship between research and policy making has been a long-standing topic of investi-
gation for social scientists. While there is a rich literature on this topic, no single explanatory model can
possibly do justice to the complex policy environments, institutional structures, and political arrangements
that influence decision-making processes.5 Although some generic lists of success factors are certainly
useful,6 it is important to bear in mind that PSIA is a realist approach that assumes that context really does
make a difference to program outcomes. At the same time, it is generally difficult to attribute follow-up
actions to the PSIA work itself, because so many factors influence the policy-making process. Moreover, in
many cases, the successful implementation of PSIA recommendations can only be verified in the medium
or long term.

Nevertheless, some broad lessons can be learned from the successful engagements highlighted in
this report:

•	 Increasing public awareness has in many cases ensured the government’s buy-in or shifted the national
   policy dialogue by amplifying the voices of stakeholders outside government. It goes almost without
   saying that the effective communication of PSIA results is crucial in this process. As has been empha-
   sized elsewhere (see the resources in appendix I), this review reaffirms that a communication strategy
   with dissemination and learning activities should be considered an integral part of the PSIA process.

•	 Close cooperation and partnerships with key stakeholders may prove instrumental to the success of the
   Bank’s engagement. Support for more inclusive, evidence-based policies requires both tapping into lo-
   cal expertise and enabling local champions—within or outside government—to participate more effec-
   tively in the policy-making process.

•	 Uptake of PSIA recommendations and continuation of policy discussions by World Bank country teams
   is very important, given that reform processes tend to be slow and require assistance over extended
   periods. Thus, linking policy recommendations to follow-up operations (including technical assistance,
   lending, and investment activities) may be necessary to advance the dialogue on difficult issues.

The PSIA on cashew policies in Guinea-Bissau illustrates how these various dimensions come togeth-
er and ultimately succeeded in influencing government policy. First, extended policy discussions with
various stakeholders generated a debate within government. Second, wide news coverage and public
awareness was crucial to build momentum to move forward with the reforms. Third, PSIA findings were
incorporated in the Bank’s country program, and several operations from the Bank and other donors fol-
lowed up on issues raised by the PSIA (chapter 11).

In Fiji, the Bank’s engagement resulted in two consecutive PSIA that assessed the country’s social
protection policies (covering both ex ante and ex post evaluation). The scope and depth of this analy-
sis and the close collaboration with counterparts ensured the government’s endorsement of the recom-

 	 In the field of international development—where research is driven by the aim to influence policy—it has been claimed that cutting-edge
   knowledge is underused by decision makers or that research neglects the concerns of the poor in a top-down fashion. Several development
   organizations have programs that aim to understand the factors that determine the use of evidence in policy making: see, for instance,
   Jones (2011) and the website of the Research and Policy in Development (RAPID) program at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI)
   (https://www.odi.org/programmes/rapid/).
6
 	 A World Bank report that reviews the link between PSIA and policy and planning processes in partner countries finds that the more-influ-
   ential PSIAs tend to be associated with the following factors: alignment with the national policy calendar, operational relevance and us-
   ability, high-level champions on the government side, and local advocates in Bank or development partner offices at the country level
   (World Bank 2009).


                                                                                                          PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016        117
         mendations made by the PSIA with the suggested policy changes to be implemented with follow-up as-
         sistance from Bank (chapter 4).

         PSIA also underscore the relevance of the context in which the analytical work was conducted. This
         includes the local political landscape, ongoing policy discussions, and existing engagements with the
         World Bank and other development partners. A critical aspect in this regard is the configuration of stake-
         holder interests, often referred to as the “political economy” of reforms. Several cases illustrate how the
         choice of methods, the scope of analysis, and the definition of complementary and follow-up activities
         took these contextual factors into consideration.

         The success of PSIA is also influenced by external factors that are beyond the control of research or
         government teams. For instance, political instability has been a challenge for PSIAs conducted in Guinea-
         Bissau and Sierra Leone. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the PSIA was conducted in a fragile and
         conflict-affected environment; it had to contend with not only political sensitivities but also insecurity and
         the high mobility of survey participants (chapter 11). Yet, as these experiences reveal, it is critical to find
         adequate responses to address these risks and help policy makers to navigate through often difficult re-
         form processes.

         Ultimately, all reforms have winners and losers, and policy makers have to balance competing inter-
         ests, notwithstanding the reform’s technical plausibility and expected results. It is not unusual that
         reform efforts result in protests, social unrest, or even governments stepping down. There are many in-
         stances across the globe where reforms have stalled or reversed because of political pressures. For in-
         stance, phasing out consumer subsidies is a particularly delicate issue. Therefore, systematic assessment
         of political economy risks and consultations with stakeholders are indispensable elements of PSIA. For in-
         stance, in Cameroon, the World Bank team commissioned a series of interviews and focus groups to iden-
         tify key stakeholders and assess the population’s level of awareness of price subsidies and potential reac-
         tions to policy reform (chapter 3). The PSIA found that the population in anglophone areas was more
         sensitive to subsidy reforms and presented a higher potential for social unrest. This stemmed from their
         strong sense of ethnic and regional exclusion; thus, to be successful, reforms would need to ensure trans-
         parency and ensure sensitivity to their concerns.


         STREGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS AND LOCAL CAPACITY
         PSIA have contributed to strengthening and disseminating tools, processes, and institutions that
         promote evidence-based and inclusive policies. For instance, improved data collection and better mon-
         itoring and evaluation systems support policy makers, development partners, and stakeholders from civil
         society in their efforts to work toward greater equity and more inclusive and sustainable development. In
         the context of the MDTF, efforts to foster PSIA capacity have covered formal and informal technical train-
         ing, standardization of data collection, and support of organizational development and participatory deci-
         sion making. An example is the multicountry engagement to implement the CEQ approach, a diagnostic
         tool for distributional analysis of fiscal policies (chapter 2, Box 2.1).

         The country studies had a special emphasis on capacity building. With the MDTF’s support, technical
         workshops were conducted in Armenia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Jordan, and South Africa between January
         and June 2014. In addition to technical training, in-country workshops were used to present preliminary
         findings of the analysis and to solicit government and stakeholder feedback on the results. In all cases, the
         teams undertaking the analysis included local counterparts who work in think tanks, universities, or on
         country office staffs previously unfamiliar with incidence analysis.7




         7
          	 The final independent evaluation of the PSIA MDTF found that in-country stakeholders considered informal on-the-job training to be the
            most valuable and effective way to build local technical capacity (World Bank 2016a).

Better collaboration and communication among stakeholders enhances capacity to incorporate evi-
dence in policy making. This makes new partnerships (both nationally and with international actors) an
integral part of capacity building. PSIA experiences show that there is considerable scope for better use of
local knowledge and experience in policymaking. For instance, in Bhutan, the PSIA brought together key
government agencies which used to work in isolation. This resulted in improved coordination and facili-
tated the design and subsequent implementation of an integrated approach to cultural assets manage-
ment (see Box 5.1). Capacity building requires careful attention to the local political economy. The techni-
cal trainings and workshops that are frequently conducted as part of PSIAs, tend to be an entry point for
new partnerships and improved communication between various stakeholders.

Part of the challenge in supporting capacity development is that it is a slow process that requires a
long-term vision and continuous engagement. This raises questions about the expectation that PSIA
engenders institutional change through one-shot interventions. There also may be a potential trade-off
between impactful analysis, that informs policymakers in a timely manner, and capacity building, which
generally takes more time to build. Some of the experiences presented here suggest that working with
strong local advocates for PSIA who can engage in decision-making is critical. An approach that is nar-
rowly focused on technical aspects often fails to achieve local ownership and sustainability with regard to
the use of evidence and analytical tools in the national policy process.


A LOOK TO THE FUTURE OF PSIA
Discussions around the 2030 agenda and the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
by the international community have highlighted the need for a new inclusive development frame-
work. There is global consensus that economic growth is not sufficient to reduce poverty; growth needs
to be inclusive. In developing countries especially, large disparities still remain in access to both public
services and economic opportunities, demanding immediate global action. This requires not only political
will for reforms but also initiatives that advance the understanding of how certain policies affect the dy-
namics of poverty and social exclusion. By squarely focusing on policy action, PSIA-type analyses play a
critical role in this regard. The work showcased in this report illustrates how research teams can success-
fully engage with policy makers and other key stakeholders to assess and address the needs of the most
vulnerable and disadvantaged populations.

PSIA is an integral part of the World Bank’s social inclusion agenda and helps the Bank to align its
operations in all sectors with the twin goals of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The
World Bank is committed to the continuity of PSIA work beyond the life span of the MDTF that financed
the work highlighted in this report. Each one of the recently formed Global Practices of the World Bank is
aligning its knowledge and operational work with the organization’s twin goals of eliminating poverty and
shared prosperity. Given their relevance to policy and lending, PSIAs are often financed directly through
the Bank’s budget. This avenue of PSIA financing is going to be all the more important in coming years.8
The Bank has the following specific mechanisms to further enact its commitment to PSIA in the near future:

•	 Development Policy Financing (DPF): DPF products9 are governed by the Bank’s Operational Policy (OP)
   8.60, which emphasizes, among other principles, a systematic assessment of the potential poverty and
   social consequences of policies supported by Bank operations, especially for poor and vulnerable
   groups. The Bank holds itself accountable to its policies through a systematic review of DPFs every three
   years—the Development Policy Financing Retrospective—which includes an assessment of PSIA com-
   pliance (World Bank 2016, 33). Moreover, resources such as the DPF Academy and training materials on

8
 	 According to the independent evaluation, 70 percent of task team leaders (TTLs) cited financial constraints as the biggest challenge to the
   sustainability of PSIA (World Bank 2016a). TTLs also highlighted the considerable scope for further improving the knowledge and learning
   structure for PSIA beyond the MDTF.
9
 	 “The World Bank’s policy for Development Policy Financing was updated in July 2014 to provide a unified framework for all development
   policy operations, leaving room for customizing content and design to country circumstances. DPF is delivered in the form of loans, credits,
   or guarantees to support a government’s medium-term program of policy reforms” (World Bank 2016b).


                                                                                                            PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016         119
            PSIAs are available to support the Bank staff in learning and increasing their capacity to incorporate
            PSIAs in DPF products.

         •	 Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD): The SCD—part of the World Bank’s Country Engagement Model
            (World Bank 2016, 27–29)—is a diagnostic exercise, in collaboration with national authorities and other
            country stakeholders, to identify key challenges and opportunities for a country to accelerate progress
            toward development objectives that support ending absolute poverty and boosting shared prosperity
            in a sustainable manner. This includes conducting upstream PSIA-type work to understand poverty and
            social inclusion issues.

         •	 Environmental and Social Framework (ESF): This is a new progressive framework that was approved in
            August 2016 and will broaden the mandate of environmental and social risk assessments. Under the
            ESF, PSIA-type analyses will also be required for investment lending that is linked to policy reforms. The
            new framework consolidates and clarifies the Bank’s environmental and social policies and harmonizes
            them with those of other development institutions. The ESF strengthens the protection for people and
            the environment, making important advances in areas such as transparency, accountability, nondiscrimi-
            nation, and public participation. The new requirements are expected to take effect in early 2018.

         One of the most pressing constraints to foster evidence-based policy making and the PSIA agenda is
         client and stakeholder capacity in developing countries, particularly in low-income countries and
         fragile and conflict-affected environments. On the other hand, middle-income countries have shown
         great capacity to conduct, mainstream, and use the results of PSIA, as some of the examples from this re-
         port illustrate. There is a need for a global partnership for PSIA focusing on capacity building and knowl-
         edge sharing across the entire development community to improve the quality, frequency, and impact of
         PSIAs across the world.

122   PSIA MDTF BEST PRACTICES 2016
APPENDIX II: METHODOLOGY
This publication is based on a systematic desk review that was followed by consultations with task team
leaders (TTLs) of selected Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs). The overarching question guiding
this exercise was, what lessons can be learned from good practice PSIAs that have informed the policy
dialogue in their respective thematic areas? To account for the complexity of PSIA, the review covered
both (a) the scope and depth of analysis, and (b) the policy relevance and engagement. The selection
process involved four steps (Figure A.1):

I.	 All Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) grants were screened to assess the universe of PSIAs to be consid-
    ered for the review. The review excluded administrative and dropped grants, as well as exclusive knowl-
    edge and learning activities. Moreover, grants that were not formally closed by December 31, 2015,
    were not included to ensure that sufficient documentation and evidence is available to draw conclu-
    sions on the success of the PSIA. 215 PSIA grants met these criteria and were considered for the review.
    Figure A.3 in appendix III presents a complete list of these grants.

II.	 The team reviewed output and monitoring documents for a total of 113 PSIA MDTF grants that have
     been completed between 2010 and 2015. To efficiently allocate time and resources, the review focused
     on PSIAs with sufficient documentation. PSIAs were excluded from the review, if TTLs had not submit-
     ted output documentation by March 2016. Table A.1 and Figure A.2 present the pool of PSIAs with
     available documentation. The types of output documents varied, including PSIA reports (internal or
     published), journal papers, PowerPoint presentations, book chapters, notes in loan documents, and
     sector notes, among others. Additionally, grant monitoring documents (GRMs) were reviewed, particu-
     larly to learn about the operational and programmatic context, as well as complementary activities to
     the analytical work. During the review particular attention was given to PSIAs that had been featured
     previously in learning events, seminars, technical notes, or reports as best practices.

III.	Forty-five PSIAs were shortlisted as potential best practices or because of innovative aspects. The re-
     view matrix template in Table A.2 shows a list of our review criteria, which covered the analytical ap-
     proach and research design; the distributional impacts (who is affected, why, and how); the policy and
     programmatic context; and follow-up actions on PSIA recommendations (contribution to policy design,
     capacity building, and Bank operations). The TTLs of shortlisted PSIAs were asked to provide addi-
     tional inputs and/or missing documentation. These consultations took place either through interviews
     or via email (with TTLs and/or team members).

IV.	Based on the information from available documents and additional consultations, 39 PSIAs were se-
    lected to be included in the report (featured either as case studies, innovative tools and methods, or
    complementary boxes). Draft write-ups were shared with TTLs/team members soliciting their feedback
    to make sure that the information was accurate and complete.
