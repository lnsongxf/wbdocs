 a. Regarding “safely managed” drinking water, the following criteria are stated either in the target or the definition proposed by JMP and its partners: (1) improved drinking
 water source, (2) on the premises, (3) available when needed, (4) free of fecal and priority chemical contamination. For the purposes of this study, data on on-plot water supplies
 were sourced from nationally representative surveys and adjusted by the expected proportion of household connections not providing safe water. Thus criteria 1, 2, and 4 are met,
 whereas criterion 3 is presumed. (On criterion 2, because the question does not ask whether the water source is actually in the household or on-plot, the at-home household
 supply counts any household that answers that the round-trip is less than five minutes.) More detailed surveys will be needed to ascertain the extent to which these are true. On
 criterion 4, estimates were adjusted for water quality using results from the study by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the rapid assessment of drinking water quality
 and from other surveys that report on the proportion of improved water sources (by type) that do not meet WHO guideline for E. coli, fluoride, and arsenic. An assessment of
 cost against income of different wealth groups enables assessment of affordability, which was conducted in this study (see section “Service affordability”). However, the estimates
 of water supply coverage presented here did not take into account affordability. Because estimates are not based on adjustments for all criteria, the estimates used for safely
 managed drinking water services are therefore likely to be optimistic.

                                      costs, and operating costs. These costs cover major
                                      cost categories, but exclude financing costs (interest
                                      charges) and may underestimate the costs of behavior

      10.	Updating pre-2015           First, update costs to 2015 in local currency using                       Moderate uncertainty as costs of services
          cost data to 2015           inflation rate. Second, convert 2015 costs in local                       may increase at different rate from inflation

      11.	Discounting of              Discount rate of 5 percent chosen for baseline results                    Moderate uncertainty. Range: 3 to 8 percent
          future costs                because it falls in the middle of range commonly used.                    used in sensitivity analysis.
      12.	Extrapolation of            Transfer costs using the U.S. dollar as the common                        High uncertainty. Alternative method of
          unit costs for              currency, adjusting for difference in the gross domestic                  adjustment uses differences between
          countries with              product (GDP) per capita at purchasing power parity                       countries in absolute U.S. dollar values of

                                      and locally made materials).
