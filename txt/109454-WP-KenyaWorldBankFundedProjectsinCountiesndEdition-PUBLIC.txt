It is my pleasure to present the 2nd Edition of the ‘World Bank-Funded Projects in Counties—Kenya’ booklet which illustrates World
Bank-financed projects in Kenya. Through this booklet, we aim to provide citizens, national government, county governments, and
other stakeholders with basic information on activities supported by the World Bank in each county. We hope that it will provide
easy access to information for the public to better understand our engagement in Kenya and help in better planning and coordination
of development assistance by both National and County Governments, development partners, and other stakeholders.

As the World Bank Group, we believe that access to information is essential, and has even become more important under the
current devolved system of government.

This booklet is structured in the following way: a summary of estimated total allocation per county, with a presentation from the
lowest to the highest recipient; summary of the projects per county, estimated financing, and activities to which the financing
goes; and project details including project life, line ministry involved and contact details, implementing agencies, World Bank
contact person, and overall project objectives and activities in a bit more detail.

While we have taken all necessary effort, this information is by no means exhaustive or entirely accurate. In the next edition, we
hope to be able to improve on that and to report on results achieved.

Your feedback is valuable to us. We would therefore welcome any feedback from the general public, County Governors, development
partners, the private sector, and other stakeholders. Kindly send your feedback to Kenyainfo@worldbank.org

Garissa to the North; Isiolo to the Northwest; Lamu to the North East; Kilifi to the South East; Taita Taveta to the South;
and Kitui to the West. It has a population of 240,075 with a density of 6.2 people per Km². Tana River’s main economic
activities are farming and nomadic pastoralism. Despite the critical river meandering through it, the county suffers
persistent dry conditions and erratic rainfall patterns. With a poverty index gap of 29.9 percent, Tana River finds itself
in position 42.

Turkana, known as the Cradle of Mankind,is geographically the largest County. Located in North Western Kenya, Turkana,
is the only County sharing international boundaries with three countries. Uganda sits on its Wester side while South
Sudan stands to the North West. Ethiopia share sits North Eastern border. It also borders the counties of; Marsabit
to the East; Samburu to the South East; and Baringo and West Pokot to the South. It has a population of 855,399
with a density of 12 people per Km².The main economic activity in Turkana is pastoralism. However, with the rich
archaeological history, and the deep Lake Turkana, the county has a great tourism potential. The recent discovery of oil
has placed Turkana in good standing locally and internationally. Expectations are high that the county, whose narrative
in the media has been one of famine, insecurity and neglect, will change to that of hope and prosperity. The residents
are also keen that the oil find will catapult their fortunes from the poorest county in Kenya. Its poverty index gap of 67.5
percent places it at the tail end of position 47.

and men. Component 3: Capacity Building and Policy Development (US$1.5 million equivalent). The main objective of this component is to
enhance the capacity of the MoYAS to implement the national youth policy and increase the institutional capacity for youth policy planning.
This will be done through activities under the following main areas: (a) developing and implementing a training program for MoYAS staff
(particularly district youth officers); (b) developing and implementing social audits to improve the transparency and accountability in the
implementation of component 1 and 2 of the Project; (c) implementing communication activities to increase awareness of the Project
amongst the youth; and (d) supporting policy development on youth, through provision of technical assistance to the National Youth Council
and carrying out of analytical work.

Objectives: The overall objective of this two-phased Adaptable Lending Program (APL) Program is to increase private investment in the
Kenya infrastructure market across sectors and to sustain this participation over an extended period of time. This involves three key areas of
development: (a) enabling environment; (b) pipeline; and (c) financing. The specific objective of the APL 1 project is to improve the enabling
environment to generate a pipeline of bankable Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects.
Component 1: Institutional Support and Regulatory Reform. Provide comprehensive support for the establishment and sustainable functioning
of the PPPSC, the PPPS and other entities mandated by the GoK to implement its PPP program. This sub-component will support further policy
dialogue and design on the legal and regulatory. Component 2: PPP Pipeline Preparation. Assist the GoK (particularly procuring ministries and the
Nodes that are to be established as centers of PPP expertise within the procuring ministries) in ensuring that the first projects to come before the
PPPSC and PPPS are well-prepared, “bankable,” and take into account lessons learned from previous PPP projects, the privatization program in
Kenya, and regional and international experience framework for PPPs, including the implementation of the PPP Policy, the PPP Law and regulations.
Component 3: Improvements to Fiscal Commitment and Contingent Liability (FCCL) Risk Management Framework. The capacity of GoK for the
assessment, monitoring and management of fiscal commitments and risks associated with PPPs is limited. Provide support and guidance to the
MoF and other relevant agencies on the fiscal commitment and risk framework associated with infrastructure, with an emphasis on contingent
liabilities from PPPs. Component 4: Support for Program Management. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is established within the MoF that
will provide the fiduciary, safeguards and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) expertise required for the implementation of the IFPPP project in
accordance with Bank policies and requirements. This may include equipment, operating costs, organizational and systems development, training,
capacity building and technical assistance.

Objectives: (i) improve collaborative management of the transboundary natural resources of Lake Victoria basin (LVB) for the shared benefits of
the EAC Partner States; and (ii) reduce environmental stress in targeted pollution hot spots and selected degraded sub catchments to improve
the livelihoods of communities, who depend on the natural resources of LVB.
Component 1: Strengthening institutional capacity for managing shared water and fisheries resources (US22.4 million). This component will
focus on building the capacity of existing regional and national institutions to harmonize policies, legislation, and regulatory standards, and
develop basin-wide management frameworks, to improve cooperative management of the shared transboundary water and fisheries resources
of the Lake Victoria basin. Component 2: Point source pollution control and prevention (US$37.2 million). This component aims at reducing
environmental stresses within the lake and its littoral zone, through the rehabilitation of priority wastewater treatment facilities, promotion of
industrial cleaner production technologies, installation of the lake navigation equipment, and implementation of a contingency plan for the oil
spills and hazardous wastes management in the Lake Victoria basin. Component 3: Watershed management US43.6 million). This component
seeks to reduce environmental stresses from the lake basin through the implementation of sustainable soil and water management practices
and livelihoods improvement interventions, using community-driven development approaches, to improve water use efficiency in the Lake
Victoria basin and generate positive externalities to downstream countries. Component 4: This component will provide resources necessary for
the effective Project coordination, regional and national levels communication, monitoring and evaluation activities, and sharing of information

Objectives: To empower local communities to engage in sustainable and wealth creating livelihood activities and reduce their vulnerability to
flooding.
Component 1: Community Driven Development. This Component will support prioritized investment projects to improve livelihoods and
build demand and capacity development at the community level. It will finance livelihoods-based micro-projects identified by communities
and enhance their capacities to plan, manage and implement them. The critical facilitation and capacity building support for participating
communities will be provided by three Mobile Advisory Teams (MATs). The MATs will support communities in the preparation of Community
Action Plans (CAPS) through a process of Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) that includes a range of community interest groups, especially the
vulnerable. Component 2: Flood Mitigation. This component will address four aspects in the Nzoia River Basins: (a) catchment management
to address catchment degradation which exacerbates flooding; (b) identification and preparation of mid-catchment multipurpose structural
flood protection options; (c) immediate flood plain management options; and (d) establishment of a flood early warning system. Component 3:
Implementation Support. This component will support the identification and development of new opportunities for economic growth in the
region. It will also fund the establishment and running of key project coordination mechanisms.
