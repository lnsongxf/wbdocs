 Sector             Key Points: Mainstreaming Progress
 Water      Climate change has been addressed in recent legislative and strategy documents in the water sector, most notably
 resource   the Law on Water Resources (2012) and the “National Action Plan on enhancing the efficiency of management, pro-
 management tection and use of water resources” (2013), which includes climate change in the objectives. Three regional irrigation
            master plans (north, south, and centre) all capture the climate change issues. The irrigation master plans provide evi-
            dence of the systematic use of the MONRE climate change scenario by MARD (as per Directive 809/CT-BNN-KHCN
            of 2011) to mainstream climate change.

                    However, enforcement of policies and regulations is sometimes weak. For example, the 2006 “National Strategy for
                    Water Resources towards 2020” (Decision No.81/2006/QĐ-TTg) proposes water management master plans at local
                    levels but progress is limited. In addition, the institutional set-up in the water sector is complicated with a number
                    of line ministries involved, including MONRE (overall water resources management and water in the environment),
                    MARD (which manages reservoirs in connection with irrigation and water provision), and MOIT (which manages
                    reservoirs in connection with hydro-power). PPCs also manage some reservoirs, as well as MOT (in connection with
                    water transport). A coordinated CC-response across the water sector is critical and will provide major benefits.
 Agriculture MARD has led a progressive response to climate change in the agricultural and rural development sector. MARD’s
 and rural   first action plan on climate change was in 2008, and in 2011 it issued Decision 543/QĐ-BNN-KHCN on the action
 development plan to respond to climate change in the agriculture and rural development (ARD) sector 2011–2015 with a vision to
             2050; as well as Directive 809/CT-BNN-KHCN on plans, programs and projects in the ARD sector.

                    MARD has also set a GHG reduction target of 20 percent by 2020 compared to 2010 (Decision 3119/QĐ-BNN-
                    KHCN, 2010). Significant GHG emissions are from the agricultural sector (43 percent of total GHG emissions based
                    on 2000 baseline figures41). There are significant opportunities for mitigation in the ARD sector, which is also demon-
                    strated by a recent climate change technology needs assessment.42
 Forestry       The forestry sector is seen as high priority for mitigation through sequestration of CO2. Vietnam is proceeding to
                implement REDD+ and targets to increase forest cover from 40 percent to 45 percent (Resolution 24-NQ/TW). The

 on main-
 streaming      The challenge for the forestry sector is to integrate policy instruments for development of the sector (e.g. the Law on
 the CC-        Forest Protection and Development (2004) and the National Strategy on Forestry Development 2006–2020) with the
 response in    CC-response through REDD+, but also through adaptation benefits from afforestation, sustainable forest management

 see Annex I) as large commercial entities (SOEs or private). The mainstreaming of climate change through the development of the
                forestry sector must consider these diverse interests, but M&E and feedback to strengthen policy and planning should
                be unified and consistent across the sector. Strengthening the linkages between the NFDS, NPFPD and climate change
                related policies will help to deliver both forest development and climate change benefits.

 Sector            Key Points: Mainstreaming Progress
 Energy            Although GHG emissions from the energy sector are rapidly increasing, the sector has the potential to make signif-
                   icant mitigation gains. MOIT developed an Action Plan to Respond to Climate Change (Decision 4103/QĐ-BCT),
                   which is focused on pre-existing programs (e.g. the NTP-Energy Efficiency, Decision 1427/QĐ-TTg, 2012) and mod-
                   ernization of technology. The action plan has generated some successes. However, it does not address the challenges
                   of indirect fossil fuel subsidies and a carbon price. UNDP, the WB, as well as other DPs have analyzed low-carbon
                   energy options. The analysis shows that there is a range of low-cost, affordable options across a variety of sectors
                   in Vietnam to reduce GHG emissions. However, these options are strongly determined by energy price levels, which
                   are very low in Vietnam by international comparison as a result of price controls and indirect subsidies. In addition,
                   there is a need for improved GHG data collection, compilation and publication, improved institutional capacities and
                   enhanced ministerial coordination in the energy/green growth/GHG emissions area.

                   The updated NTP-Energy Efficiency outlines a range of projects to be supported over the period to 2015. The tar-
                   gets in key sectors demonstrate an increase in the aspiration and penetration of energy efficiency when compared
                   to the Decision of 2006 (79/2006/QĐ-TTg), which only sets overall energy consumption targets.

                   Renewable energy has been supported in a range of laws and in later versions of the electricity master plan. For
                   instance, the Power Development Plan for 2011–2020 and vision to 2030 (Decision 1208/QĐ-TTg, 21/07/2011) targets
                   the total power from renewable sources to rise from 3.5 percent in 2010 to 4.5 percent in 2020 and six percent in
                   2030. Non-hydro renewable energy development is behind this schedule, largely because investors’ interest is low
                   given the prevailing power prices. However, the potential for wind power and solar power is substantial, especially
                   in the southern central and coastal regions of Vietnam.
 Construction      National construction standards for buildings, transport infrastructure and rural infrastructure such as dykes must
                   increasingly be modified as climate change effects become more pronounced. This will require technical capacity
                   building in MOC, MARD, MOT and other ministries and agencies. In some cases (e.g. dykes and irrigation) there is
                   a discrepancy between construction standards for domestic-funded projects and ODA-funded projects, suggesting
                   that uptake of global best practice is not yet happening. Discussion with officials indicated awareness of the problem
                   and the need for undertaking a comprehensive review of standards in relation to climate change risks.43 There is a
                   need for construction standards, linked to the MONRE climate change scenario, to be used in governmental, public
                   and commercial works. This may require strengthening of the legal framework.

                   MOC has developed a climate change action plan (March 2014) which includes improving the incorporation of
                   climate effects into construction activities, increasing the capacity to respond to climate change and promoting
                   energy efficiency and green construction. MOC is also working towards a green building strategy, is mainstreaming
                   climate change and sea level rise in urban development planning (especially urban areas in the central coast region
                   and in the Mekong Delta), and is enhancing solid waste planning and management. This is likely to help align MOC’s
                   CC-response with the VGGS.
 Roads and         Existing roads and transport policies, standards and guidelines at the national level are not comprehensively address-
 transport         ing climate change resilience of rural infrastructure, especially roads. Most damage estimates for Vietnam’s roads fall
                   between USD 4 billion and USD 9 billion, mostly from the effects of flooding.44 The predicted changes in temperature,
                   precipitation and flooding present additional threats to Vietnam’s roads. Road standards, determined by meteoro-
                   logical information as well as location, include the Technical Standard for Roads (issued in 2005), standards for urban
                   roads (TCXDVN104-2007), standards for the delta region (e.g. TCVN4054-2005) and bridge standards (22TCN-05). A
                   review of a number of MOT projects in road construction demonstrated that planning and design of road projects do
                   not explicitly mention climate change or the use of climate change scenarios in their planning. However, road design
                   standards were set using the latest meteorological data (last 10–30 years).

                   Building climate change effects into road standards and building practices will require use of the MONRE climate
                   change scenarios to assess the future climate within the lifetime of the road project and then assess the require-
                   ments for a durable design. Development of appropriate regulations and establishment of a climate assessment tool
                   will help increase road resilience to projected climate change. There are similar requirements for including future
                   climate scenarios in the planning of all transport investments and mainstreaming climate change across the various
                   elements of transport planning, infrastructure and management, both in rural and urban areas.

 Sector         Key Points: Mainstreaming Progress
 Disaster risk Mainstreaming climate change in the disaster sector has been significant and extensive. The National Strategy
 management on Disaster Prevention, Response and Mitigation to 2020 (Decision 172/2007/QĐ-TTg) promulgated mainstream-
 (DRRM)        ing of disaster risk reduction in national, sector and provincial socio-economic development planning frameworks.
               The majority of current SEDPs at the national and provincial levels, as well as sector master plans for the period
               2011–2020, have included DRRM. All ministries represented in the Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm
               Control have developed action plans for the integration of DRRM within their sectors. All 63 provinces in the coun-
               try have now also developed DRRM action plans. Some elements of progress status are provided in the first DRRM
               strategy implementation report issued in April 2013.

                In June 2013 the Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (Order 07/2013/L-CTN) was adopted. This law
                identifies natural disaster prevention and control activities, and the rights and obligations of agencies, organizations,
                households and individuals engaged in natural disaster prevention and control activities. However, financing for
                disaster risk reduction does not seem to be prioritized. The use of the MONRE climate change scenarios is not men-
                tioned, even in Article 17 on assessment and zoning of risks, suggesting that the link between climate change and
                DRRM is yet to be fully achieved. Coordination between the joint technical lead of DRRM in MARD with the climate
                change structures in MONRE, and how the NCCC Standing Office ensures and monitors coordination, are critical
                factors to ensure further strengthening of a coordinated DRRM and CC-response.
