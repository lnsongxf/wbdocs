                                                   1.1         Lower oil prices and higher electricity tariffs are the two major price changes hitting South African consumers in 2015. In June

                                                               price drop, which was felt in South Africa from September 2014, although the rand’s depreciation muted the price decline’s
                                                               impact. Domestic gasoline (petrol) prices fell 28 percent from peak (June 2014) to trough (February 2015)—but in Q2 almost
                                                               fully reversed. Electricity tariffs rose 12.6 percent in April 2015 (box figure 1).
                                                                    Household consumption patterns play a major role in how these price changes affect the poor.5 The oil-price shock cut

                                                               hardly moved.

                 How have fuel and electricity price changes affected households in South Africa?4
          Box    (continued)
          1.1              Using the changes in fuel and electricity prices through end-April 2015, we find that the net impact was that budgets of
                      poor households were largely unchanged by the two price changes (box figure 3)—in that period lower fuel prices partly offset
                      higher electricity prices. Across all households, the gains from lower fuel prices (1.8 percent) through the end of April were
                      partially offset by the losses tied to higher electricity prices (–0.8 percent). The poor are disproportionally affected by higher
                      electricity prices (absent changes in the free basic amount of electricity provided to poor households), which cost them 1
                      percent of their consumption and largely offset the temporary gain of 1.1 percent from lower fuel prices.7 Non-poor households
                      gain by 1.1 percent when the net impact of both price changes is considered.
                           Box figure 4 illustrates how the net effects of the two price changes through the end of April impacted different types of                                                                                                                                    17
                      households. It shows that the upper deciles (labeled non-poor in box figure 4) of the income distribution gained the most, along
                      with small and medium households, workers in industry and services, the better educated, and those living in urban areas. But
                      if the higher fuel levy is factored into the calculations, poor households are worse off.

          Box    What do exports mean for jobs and skills demand in South Africa?10
         1.2      Exports are a critical source of growth for South Africa; they are also an important channel for productivity enhancement. But
                  what do they mean for jobs? Drawing on a newly developed World Bank dataset11 on the labor content of exports, we explore
                  the possible implications of exports for employment and skills demand in South Africa, paying particular attention to South
                  Africa’s integration into manufacturing global value chains (GVCs) over the past decade.
                       A critical finding is that manufacturing matters for jobs, but its importance comes mainly through its backward links to
                  the domestic economy (box figure 1). The indirect employment impact of manufacturing exports (jobs in industries providing
                  inputs into manufacturing exports) is nearly 4.5 times greater than the direct employment impact. Indeed, while the minerals
                  sector generates the most direct jobs due to its dominance in the export basket and in relative labor intensity, its weak
                                                                                                                                                          21
                  backward links to the domestic economy stifle its overall employment impact.

                  How have manufacturing exports and GVC integration affected the level and nature of jobs in South Africa? To understand this,
                  we focus on the automotive sector, where South Africa has grown its exports and has become deeply integrated into GVCs over
                  the past decade (box figures 2 and 3). The first point is that while the rapid growth of exports meant that nominal jobs in
                  the sector increased substantially over the decade (box figure 2), the relative labor intensity of South Africa’s exports declined
                  sharply: where automotive exports contributed around $37 of labor per $100 of exports in 2001, this declined to below $30
                  in 2011 (box figure 3). This level of labor in exports is well below that of Brazil where the labor content has increased; and
                  India, where it has remained broadly stable. South Africa’s decline in labor intensity of its auto exports is explained almost fully
                  by declining labor content in direct manufacturing—indeed, the labor content of direct manufacturing jobs fell by almost half
                  over the decade.
                       Still, significant job growth resulted from the automotive sector’s extensive backward links to the domestic economy. While
                  each direct job in the sector was linked to one indirect job in 2001, by 2013 it was linked to three. Most important, this came
                  through services sector links, which is unsurprising. In fact, it is exactly what we might expect in an environment of GVC
                  integration: exports make increasing use of foreign inputs (reducing direct labor demand) but coordinating these inputs requires
                  more intensive use of (mainly domestic) services, including financial services, transport and logistics, and other business
                  services
                       GVC integration also appears to have substantial implications for skills demand. Box figure 3 shows that for direct jobs in
                  the automotive sector, the contribution of unskilled labor per $100 of exports has declined sharply over the decade, while that
                  of skilled labor has remained steady. This is, again, perhaps to be expected in the context of GVC integration, where the require-
                  ments for productivity, quality, and consistency from global lead firms likely contribute to increased capital intensity and
                  demand for higher skills. Coupling this with the strong shift toward indirect-services employment, which also tends to have a
                  higher skills bias, implications for demand for skilled versus unskilled labor may be important, perhaps accelerating the underly-
                  ing skills bias in South African production..

                  83 days (as in Cape Town) and lowering the cost to 0.68 percent of the warehouse value (as in Mangaung) would move South
                  Africa 11 points higher. Enforcing contracts—an indicator where most South African cities fare quite well—and handling court
                  cases as efficiently and as inexpensively as in Msunduzi and Mangaung, respectively, would improve the country’s DTF score by
                  5 points, placing it among the best 25 economies globally on this indicator.

                  are no new spending pressures or initiatives. If growth remains around 2 percent a year, the analysis found that social spending
