      The assessment data were quantified using the following conversion for each Performance Indicator (PI): A = 4, B+ = 3.5, B = 3, C+ = 2.5 C = 2, D+ = 1.5 and
      D = 1. This is based on first calculating the dimension-level average for each country, and thereafter the average for each dimension for each country group.

the MTEF is the budget, and the forward
forecast sets the ceiling for the coming
years. Links between multi-year estimates
and subsequent setting of annual
budget ceilings are clear and differences
are explained in the MTEF document.
Therefore, there exists a clear link between
MTEF and the annual budget.
The previous periodic plans (i.e., the
11thand the 12thplans) were fiscally
anchored by the MTEFs. Disaggregate
sectorial and sub-sectorial ceilings were
also enunciated in the MTEF. However,
there is the provision for crossing the
ceiling allocated for the ministries if
they could mobilize additional external
resources. So there is some flexibility
