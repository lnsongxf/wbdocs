Executive Summary
Romania has the opportunity to benefit from significant EU structural assistance through the Regional
Operational Programme (ROP). In preparation for the 2014 – 2020 ROP, a key task at hand is to
enhance not only the absorption rate, but also the impact of ROP-funded investments. One critical
component in this process is improved project selection models to help boost the quality of ROP
investments, have a stronger linkage to strategic development priorities, and focus on getting the
highest “value for money” projects. The proposed selection models for the ROP 2014 -2020 should build
upon the strengths and correct the weaknesses of the 2007-2013 framework, as well as incorporate best
practices from other EU countries, appropriately tailored to the Romanian context and capacity.

Background
The Regional Operational Programme (ROP) is one of seven operational programs (OPs) financed
through EU funds during the 2007-2013 programming period. The EU dedicated EUR 3.7 billion to the
ROP to support Romania’s regional development in the post-accession period. This amounts to 19% of
the total structural funds available through the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) between
2007 and 2013, making the ROP the third largest program after transportation (23.7%) and environment
(23.5%). In 2011, projects financed under the ROP accounted for nearly 27% of projects financed by
external grants and more than 12% of total public investment. The total allocation of the 2007-2013 ROP
is more than EUR 4.5 billion, of which the EU contributes nearly 82%.

It is important to note from the start that the ROP has been a top performer for Romania in terms of
absorption rates, despite a complex and heterogeneous portfolio of projects. Because of its broad
focus on regional development issues, the ROP addresses a wide-ranging set of needs at the level of
each region, from urban development to transport infrastructure, social infrastructure, business
development, and tourism. In this context, the ROP has achieved the best absorption rates out of all
structural programs (as of November 30, 2013), particularly when it comes to payments from the EC to
Romania, which stand at 44% of the total available ROP allocation.

The ROP has also performed relatively well when compared to similar Operational Programmes from
other Member Countries. As the table below indicates, although absorption rates were relatively lower
compared to the other OPs at the end of 2013, the Romanian ROP had one of the highest commitment
rates. This indicates that the ROP system functions relatively well up to the project implementation
stage, where most delays in absorption are caused by systemic issues (e.g., an inefficient public
procurement system, poor quality technical documentation, property rights issues, etc.).

That said, the commitment and absorption rates should be neither the only, nor the most important
indicators for the ROP’s success. A high rate of absorption may be a sign that projects have been chosen
for financing simply because they were ready to be implemented, rather than for their potential
contribution to development objectives. In Romania and more broadly across the EU, policymakers and
key stakeholders should pay increased attention to the impact of EU-funded investments in terms of
achieving social and economic goals – which, after all, is the ultimate aim of such interventions.

Lessons from other Member States
One of the first steps in elaborating an improved selection model is to assess the approaches of other
Member States. This way, best practices can be collected and improved upon to generate even better
outcomes for the ROP. In the full report, project selection models from 8 Member Countries (Germany,
Poland, Estonia, Italy, Slovenia, the UK, Ireland, and Lithuania) are analyzed to identify potential
suggestions for enhancing the ROP selection model for the 2014-2020 programming period. The
operational programmes analyzed were chosen based on their similarities to the Romanian ROP.

A number of key lessons can be drawn from the analysis of these eight case studies:
   1. Each Member State used unique approaches for project selection, with some focusing on the
      pre-selection of a number of large strategic projects (e.g., Lithuania), some focusing primarily on
      competitive calls (e.g., Ireland, Estonia), and yet others, particularly the larger countries (e.g.,
      Germany, Italy, Poland), deploying a mix of methods.

    2. The evaluation and selection systems used by these countries are by-and-large simpler than the
       system used under the ROP 2007-2013. For example, most countries did not use the Cost-
       Benefit Analysis (CBA) for evaluating projects. Germany was one of the exceptions, and it only
       used CBA for large strategic projects. Similarly, the ROP’s evaluation and selection grids appear
       much more granular and detailed than comparable frameworks in other Member States.

    3. For the most part, the case studies analyzed revealed a keen focus on impact and also used
       weights for individual criteria to differentiate between more important and less important
       evaluation factors.


                                                                                                          x
Recommendations for improving the ROP Project Selection Model
The improvement of the ROP 2007-2013 Project Selection Model, through a stronger focus on impact,
can be achieved in a number of ways, keeping the following recommendations in mind:
1. Do not sacrifice ABSORPTION for the sake of IMPACT. Having projects that generate development
   impact is the main underlying aim of the ROP. Projects that lack actual impact are equivalent to a
   waste of resources and may in fact lead to high operation and maintenance costs that will pose a
   burden on limited local resources. However, having a few impactful projects and low absorption
   rates is not an optimal situation either.
    The ROP should balance absorption and impact in a legitimate and functional selection system

           Absorption                                                     Impact
           • Appropriate focus for 2007-2013 to reduce                    • Higher priority for 2014-2020, after
             the risk of funds decommitment                                 2007-2013 learning curve
           • In hindsight, optimal decision to prioritize                 • Impact and value for money as key
             quantity and speed                                             objectives




                                                                                In addition to absorption and
                                                                                impact, an optimal selection
                                                                                framework also depends on:
                                                                                  • Legitimacy: How credible
                                                                                    is the system?
                                                                                  • Capacity: How functional
                                                                                    is the system?




   Romania showcases the poorest absorption rates of any Member State, as an average across all its
   Operational Programmes. In fact, Romania is some distance away (14 percentage points) from the
   second worst performer – Bulgaria. This is obviously not an ideal situation.

    Low absorption means that substantial and critical resources are not used in a timely, effective
    manner, which also implies that resources are wasted. In some ways, this may be a worse situation
    than having an insufficient focus on impact. For example, even if the funds are not spent on the
    newest, most impactful projects, but on the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure (to a large
    extent, this is what ROP funds have been used for and will continue to finance in 2014-2020), this
    may decrease operation and maintenance costs for current infrastructure. Thus, even though the
    funds may not generate a significant development impact, they will help reduce costs and improve
    the quality of life for people – an important achievement in of itself.

2. There should be a purposeful focus on a number of strategic projects, with an appropriate
   allocation for such types of investments. Currently, the ROP primarily focuses on small and
   medium-sized projects, with a total share of commitments for large projects of less than 4% of
   available funds. Of course, the fact that a project is large does not make it necessarily impactful.
   Also, there are very small projects that can have very large impact (e.g., well-targeted information
   campaigns). However, when it comes to infrastructure development, it is usually the larger projects
   that generate the most significant outcomes.

                  The ROP 2007-2013 primarily focused on small and medium-sized projects
                                       (situation as of August 2013)

    The longer preparation time that large projects entail can be countered by simplified application and
    selection procedures for small projects. For example, the ROP 2007-2013 processed over 1,950 small
    projects, which underwent similar evaluation and selection procedures as larger projects, but
    represented only 5.74% of allocated funds. Simply put, evaluation and selection procedures should
    reflect the value, complexity, and expected risks/costs/benefits of a particular investment. This
    should ensure that the overall evaluation and selection system remains functional and has enough
    capacity to accommodate peak-time demand.

3. Key strategic projects should be drawn from integrated development strategies. Such strategies
   should represent the overall developmental vision for the area covered and should not be drafted
   for the sole purpose of attracting EU funds, but present needs, priorities, and projects regardless of
   the ultimate financing source. New strategies should only be drafted when addressing an area that
   is not already covered by an existing strategy (e.g., new metropolitan areas) and reflect, if available,
   the development vision set in the strategies of constituent administrative units. Where integrated
   development strategies already exist (as is the case of Growth Poles and Urban Development Poles),
   they should only be updated.


                                                                                                                            xii
   To ensure consistency in approaches across development strategies, a number of key items should
   be required (e.g., to have a clear vision and objectives, a list of projects to help achieve those
   objectives, and corresponding funding sources). Also, to ensure a proper prioritization of projects,
   tools such as Capital Investment Planning (CIP) could be used to ensure that limited budget funds
   are targeted at key strategic projects and are not spent in an opportunistic manner, while ongoing
   operations and maintenance (O&M) costs remain reasonable.

          Sub-national entities have limited budgets for capital expenditures and they should spend
                                             these budgets wisely




   Integrated approaches also entail that EU and state-budget-funded projects are not treated
   differently or separately, but that they are part of a single, coherent development vision and help
   achieve the same overall goals. This means that similar evaluation and selection criteria and
   procedures should apply to such investments, regardless of the funding source (i.e., EU funds or
   state-budget financing).

4. The ROP 2014-2020 programmatic document can play a strategic role in steering beneficiaries
   toward a set of core types of investments. While local and county authorities define priorities on
   their own, as they know well the needs of the communities they represent, the ROP can help guide
   them toward the type of investments that are likely to have the highest impact. The Competitive
   Cities report makes a number of recommendations in this respect, taking Romania’s current
   development level into consideration.

   It is also important to keep in mind the main policy aims and thematic objectives set in the Europe
   2020 Strategy. This is a key document that sets the priorities for the EU’s development as a whole,
   but obviously the needs of individual Member States may vary considerably. As such, priorities

5. Principles of fiscal prudence should be applied for the ROP 2014-2020, ensuring that beneficiaries
   do not overburden their financial capacity to support projects. For example, beneficiaries should
   ensure that, once they make capital investments, they also have the necessary budgetary resources
   to cover the associated operation and maintenance costs. The fiscal health of individual
   beneficiaries can be assessed with the help of the Glenday Indicator and/or the Giosan Indicator.
   These two indicators are explained in more detail in the full report.

   For large strategic projects, which also require substantial co-financing from the State budget, it is
   important to have the Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF) involved to ensure that funds are spent in
   an efficient and sustainable manner. The MoPF can ensure that basic fiscal prudence principles are
   followed and it could also set up a system for prioritizing and coordinating the development of large
   projects at the national level.

6. An optimal Project Selection Model should also have a good Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
   system to facilitate continuous improvement. A good M&E system serves several purposes. For

                                                                                                  xv
    one, it helps track the performance of a specific project and the extent to which this project has
    reached its output indicators – this is a mandatory task that the European Commission requires of all
    Operational Programmes. However, in addition to what the EC asks for, a good M&E system can
    help evaluate if projects, and the overall program that finances them, have achieved planned
    outcomes and if they have had an actual development impact. In particular, it can provide
    information on whether the project selection model is appropriate and has delivered on its intended
    goals, making sure that the ROP finances investments that have the biggest impact – the same way a
    farmer selectively breeds crops using the strongest seeds from the last harvest. A comprehensive
    M&E framework can assess not only the degree to which impactful projects are selected and
    prioritized, but also whether the programme delivers optimal absorption rates, a functional system
    with appropriate capacity to process applications, and a high level of credibility among applicants
    and beneficiaries.

7. While keeping in mind the need to ensure a stable and predictable playing field for all applicants
   and beneficiaries, the ROP 2014-2020 should feature flexible approaches, as needed. For example,
   even if most of the available funds will be pre-allocated (for strategic projects) or allocated using a
   First-In First-Out (FIFO) approach, the programme could adopt a competitive selection model for
   one priority axis or one key area of intervention (e.g., business infrastructure). For example, many
   Member Countries use competitive calls for private beneficiaries (e.g., SMEs) or for the
   development of business infrastructure. Another option is to enable the ROP’s shift to a competitive
   approach after a mid-term claw-back (e.g., if some beneficiaries have not used pre-allocated funds
   in due time).

Proposals for Project Selection Models
With the above recommendations as key guidelines, three project selection models are proposed for
the ROP 2014-2020. The development of the scenarios followed a framework for assessing various
options based on six fundamental requirements (efficiency, effectiveness, clarity, fairness, transparency,
and feasibility) and four key objectives (absorption, impact, legitimacy, and capacity).

                     CLARITY: Clear selection procedures and requirements minimize the room for interpretation

                     FAIRNESS: Fair selection criteria apply to all submissions

                F
                     FEASIBILITY: The institutional system is able to properly implement the model


The figure above conveys precisely this message, making the case that an optimal project selection
model for the next ROP will need to accomplish all four targets. Put differently, a model may be great
at promoting quick absorption of EU funds, but it may fail to deliver value for money and resources
could be wasted on low-impact interventions. Similarly, if a model is not legitimate (i.e., with clear and
transparent evaluation criteria and fair selection procedures), not enough ROP applicants will
demonstrate interest in the program, so there will be an inherent limitation on what the ROP can
accomplish. Last but not least, any proposed change needs to be more than just a theoretical framework
that promises to deliver great results in the abstract; indeed, selection models have to work in practice,
keeping in mind the system’s current and expected capacity constraints.

Three scenarios are worth considering in terms of the overall project selection model:
    Scenario 1 (“Status Quo+”): The main characteristics of the system remain unchanged, with a
        few tweaks (e.g., excluding the full Cost-Benefit Analysis from the formal assessment, making
        the Detailed Technical Design optional at the evaluation phase, etc.) to correct current
        weaknesses. This option capitalizes on the ROP system’s accumulated experience and leverages
        the benefits of predictability. Essentially, the two selection procedures remain the same: pre-

                                                                                                                     xvii
       allocation for growth poles and urban development poles (with the potential inclusion of all
       county seats as UDPs); and first-in-first-out for all other projects.
      Scenario 2 (“Semi-Competitive”): This variation applies different selection methods based on
       project size and beneficiary type. Project size tends to be a good proxy for both complexity and
       potential impact. Under this scenario, large regional projects (type 1) would enjoy dedicated
       funding. Medium-sized investments by counties, growth poles, and urban development poles
       (type 2) would be selected in two phases: (1) dedicated funding for a limited period of time; and
       (2) selection based on FIFO for the remaining pool of funding allocated to these types of
       beneficiaries. For other cities, as well as for private and non-profit applicants (type 3), the FIFO
       rule would apply, regardless of whether the project is small (under 1.5 million RON) or more
       significant (over 1.5 million RON). Ultimately, this is a “semi-competitive” model, as a “middle-
       of-the-road” type of option, although applications are not compared or scored against ea ch
       other under either FIFO or the dedicated funding model, regardless of the type of project under
       consideration.
      Scenario 3 (“Competitive”): This scenario maintains the FIFO selection rule for a limited set of
       projects, namely the smallest ones under 1.5 million RON, while also setting aside dedicated
       funding for the largest regional projects. For counties, growth poles, and urban development
       poles, the funding would be allocated in two phases, much like for the previous scenario, with a
       key difference: the phase 2 reallocation could be done on the basis of competitive ranking for
       projects under each axis.

   The three scenarios considered feature a range of different adjustments to the status quo model




The figure above summarizes the main features of the three options for each applicable type of project.
As this report argues, choosing an optimal selection model is a challenging task and may involve several
quintessential tradeoffs: between impact (effectiveness) and absorption (efficiency); between needed


                                                                                                      xviii
changes and predictability/continuity; and between ideal outcomes and practical feasibility given
capacity constraints.

Importantly, the current work does not propose selection models that vary by sector. Instead, the size
of a proposed intervention is the key variable that determines how a project should be evaluated,
selected, and contracted. This is in line with broader thinking on integrated interventions (something the
ROP is uniquely positioned to deliver on because of its focus on the broad field of regional development)
and a move away from sector-specific procedures. In fact, there is value in putting forth standardized
selection models and criteria that allow for easy comparisons across projects, regardless of their
thematic focus.

In the main report, the three scenarios presented above are discussed in more detail. The figure below
gives a quick summary of the key strengths and weaknesses of these scenarios. Some of the main
features of these options are discussed in greater depth in the next sections of the report.

I. Introduction

1.      The Romanian Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism (MRDT) (now the Ministry of
Regional Development and Public Administration – MRDPA) has signed an agreement with the World
Bank for five technical assistance projects. The aim of this technical assistance program is to
determine how cities in Romania can become more competitive, sustainable, and inclusive, and to help
the MRDPA develop its administrative capacity to better manage policy and investment work. The
technical assistance program includes the following five projects, which were designed to be
complementary in nature, with cross-cutting findings and recommendations:
    (1) Enhanced spatial planning as a precondition for urban development;
    (2) Upgrade growth poles strategic planning and economic impact;
    (3) Assessment of the communication and collaboration between the Managing Authority (MA)
        and Intermediate Bodies (IB) of the Regional Operational Programme (ROP) and facilitation of
        proactive and direct support for beneficiaries;
    (4) Technical assistance for the identification of project selection models; and
    (5) Elaboration of integration strategies for poor areas and disadvantaged communities.

2.      This report focuses on the identification of optimal selection models (project #4 listed
above), which is critical for improving the efficiency and impact of the Regional Operational
Programme (ROP) during the 2014-2020 budgeting period. This is a very timely endeavor, as Romania
is expected to finalize in early 2014 the Partnership Agreement with the European Commission (EC). By
summer/fall 2014, key documents like the programmatic ROP 2014-2020 and the Framework
Document for Implementation will also need to be published in their final form, including a definitive
proposal for selection models. The time to act is now in order to avoid subsequent changes to the rules
of the game, which has been one persistent criticism of the current ROP and of other operational
programs in Romania. This principle is particularly relevant for the criteria that lie at the foundation of
how projects are selected: once the first ROP calls for proposals are launched, the selection system
should maintain the same core principles and criteria to ensure a fair and equal treatment of all
applicants.

Objective and Scope
3.      More specifically, the current technical assistance seeks to support the Managing Authority
of the Regional Operational Programme (MA-ROP), part of the MRDPA, with the identification and
recommendation of improved, innovative selection models for the ROP. The stakes are high: selection
models will guide decisions on the types of projects that will receive funding and how they will be
evaluated to ensure optimal scope, objectives, and expected impact. The new selection models have to
align with the strategic development priorities and indicators of the next programming period, but
must also remain clear, simple, and easy to communicate to all interested stakeholders (e.g., potential
beneficiaries, experts, evaluators, MA and IB staff, etc.). Above all, they must guarantee a fair and
transparent evaluation and selection process, with high credibility among ROP applicants.

4.       Optimal project evaluation and selection depend on balancing two priorities: absorption and
impact. Regarding the former, Romania remains, as of January 2014, the weakest performer in terms of
EU funds absorption, although for the ROP in particular the risk of funds decommitment remains
relatively low. Nonetheless, new or updated selection models should not come at the expense of
efficient spending of available funding during the next cycle (quantity of interventions), as Romania
cannot afford to miss out on any non-reimbursable financing in the context of tight investment budgets
and pressing development needs. At the same time, building on the experience accumulated to date,

                                                                                                         1
the country has the opportunity to shift some of the focus toward impact (quality of interventions),
which can come from (a) improved selection of impactful projects that deliver high value for money,
once they are submitted for evaluation (the focus of the current work) and (b) improved programming
and pipeline development to successfully take more impactful concepts from the design through the
application, implementation, and post-implementation phases (a topic covered by the World Bank’s
report “ROP 2.0: Facilitation of Proactive and Direct Support for Applicants and Beneficiaries of the
Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020”). At the EU level, the emphasis on impact is also growing,
often in conjunction with procedural simplifications that are meant to reduce the burden on
beneficiaries and also increase the overall speed of accessing EU funds. In any case, the question of
balancing the two desiderata, quality and quantity of EU-funded interventions, is a key, recurrent
theme of the current work.

5.       This report provides an assessment of the ROP’s current selection models, reviewing strong
points and areas for improvement. The bulk of the current work focuses on the status quo system and
identifies those components that decision-makers should consider adjusting in the near future, as well
as strengths to build upon. The goal is to provide a clearer picture of the degree to which submitted
projects can contribute to the achievement of the Regional Operational Programme’s objectives. This
report also draws on experiences in several other Member States, selected based on their positive
overall performance and similarities to the Romanian ROP, as well as on best practices at the global
level.

6.      The scope of this work covers primarily the evaluation and selection stages in a project cycle,
although broader implications exist in terms of project generation, implementation, and post-
implementation. Indeed, there are significant synergies with the broader portfolio of projects under
the World Bank Regional Development Program in Romania and findings are meant to be consistent
across all analyses performed for the MRDPA. For one, the Competitive Cities report (activity #1 listed
above) defines the main directions and strategic priorities of Romania’s urban and regional

contribute to the country’s inclusive and sustainable growth. Second, the assessment of the growth
poles policy (activity #2) can guide the prioritization of investments – including, for instance, in energy
efficiency – in the seven major cities that are likely to continue to benefit from dedicated financing for
the ROP 2014-2020. Third, the poverty mapping project (activity #5) helps identify where
disadvantaged communities are, as well as optimal ways for integrating them, including through future
ROP assistance. Finally, the report on the MA-IB collaboration and beneficiary support (activity #3) is
arguably the closest in scope to this analysis of selection models. It provides an assessment of the ROP
across the entire project cycle, evaluating how the “backend” systems function between the Managing
Authority and the Intermediate Bodies and how effectively they assist applicants and beneficiaries in
designing and completing ROP-financed projects. As such, the current study includes references to
these complementary work streams, whenever relevant, although an integrated, comprehensive
reading of the full package of analysis is recommended for having a complete picture of the program.

Methodology
7.      The first guiding principle of the current analysis, as for all functional reviews, including the
concurrent assessment of the MA-IB collaboration and beneficiary support, is the following: first do
no harm. The intention is not to provide feedback for the sake of changing the current project selection
models, particularly because the ROP is still, as of January 2014, Romania’s top performing operational
program in terms of absorption. As such, recommendations for adjustment are only useful insofar as
they address the system’s weaknesses, while preserving its strengths. There is also an implicit cost of
making potentially sweeping changes that would derail the currently functioning mechanisms and
generate increased risk of funds decommitment. Put differently, a high level of predictability is
valuable, in of itself, as a way to provide a stable environment with clear rules for all the actors
involved in the financing and implementation of ROP projects, in a general context that has been too
often characterized by repeated changes and variability.

8.      At the same time, in-depth case studies of other Member States (chapter IV) provide a range
of options and ideas for how the ROP evaluation and selection system can be improved. These case
studies cover the whole spectrum of the evaluation and selection cycles, and present different options
for a more efficient and effective management of the ROP. This comparative assessment reviews
operational programmes in Germany, Poland, Estonia, Italy, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and
Lithuania, distilling best practices for the Romanian context and drilling as much as possible into how
other Member States evaluate and select projects (models, criteria, scoring grids, etc.).

9.      Last but not least, in-depth discussions with representatives of the MA-ROP, the Regional
Development Agencies, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders have helped fine-tune the
recommendations made here. Such consultations were organized periodically and included workshops
with the MRDPA and site visits to all eight development regions in Romania. The team presented
preliminary proposals for improved project selection models to MA counterparts, RDAs’ technical staff,
as well as key ROP beneficiaries from around the country. The feedback received has been extremely
valuable and is reflected throughout this report.

The Public Investment Management (PIM) Framework
10.     The analytical part of the report is structured around the Public Investment Management
(PIM) framework developed by the World Bank.1 An efficient PIM system must have the following
eight features for each stage of the project cycle (Rajaram et. al. 2010), with their corresponding
elements:
    (1) Investment Guidance, Project Development, and Preliminary Screening: guidance on national
        and sectoral policy priorities, a formal process for project development, and first-level
        screening for strategic alignment.
    (2) Formal Project Appraisal: quality of proposals presented to justify new investment spending.
    (3) Independent Review of Appraisal: review process of project proposals.
    (4) Project Selection and Budgeting: decision on priority projects to be funded.
    (5) Project Implementation: actual construction of physical assets.
    (6) Project Adjustment: monitoring of project implementation and adjustments, as necessary.
    (7) Facility Operation: use of assets for service delivery.
    (8) Basic Completion Review and Evaluation: ex-post collection of data on actual total cost and
        timeline compared to the proposal, and selective evaluation of project results.

11.      This framework requires adaptation to the ROP project selection model, which covers only
the first four features of the project cycle management. These are as follows: (1) project guidance,
project development, and preliminary screening; (2) formal project appraisal; (3) independent review
of appraisal; and (4) project selection, detailed project design, and contracting. The figure below
synthesizes the eight must-have features of the PIM framework, highlighting the fact that the scope of
the current project, along with the specific context of the Romanian ROP, have called for an analysis
focused on the first four phases (in dark blue), while the subsequent stages (in light blue) are covered in
the concurrent World Bank assessment of the MA-IB collaboration and beneficiary support.

12.     The next paragraphs provide more in-depth explanations of the four aforementioned
features to set the stage for the assessment of the ROP system, which follows in Chapters II and III.
Each of the subsections below includes two main components: the first describes and defines
applicable concepts under the relevant stage in the project cycle, explaining their role in ensuring,
ultimately, that the highest-quality projects are selected for financing; the second lists the key
dimensions that help assess whether a particular mechanism is functional and effective.

1. Project guidance, project development, and preliminary screening
   1A. Concepts:
            Investment Guidance: A high-level, authoritative statement of the government’s
               economic and social vision and priorities can help align investment planning,
               channeling funding to the highest-value areas while weeding out low-priority, low-
               impact projects. This might take the form of a national/regional development plan or
               other medium-to-long-term strategic document. More detailed sector/subsector or
               regional/local level strategies, including some indication of priorities and objectives,
               can provide additional effective guidance for investment planning.
            Project Development: There should be a formal process for project development.
               Governments and agencies initiating projects for public investment should prepare a
               project profile with basic information, including the relevant strategic priority, the
               specific problem to be addressed, the project’s objectives, main activities, expected
               results, and a rough estimated budget. In addition, it is important to weigh different
               options for addressing the targeted problem through the proposed project versus
               other alternatives (e.g., private-sector intervention, etc.) and to also undertake
               thorough demand, supply, and gap analyses.
            Preliminary Screening: First-level screening of all project proposals ensures that they
               meet the minimum criterion of consistency with the government’s strategic goals. A
               project that fails to meet this initial test should be rejected, making it unnecessary to
               subject it to further evaluation and detailed appraisals. An appropriate institutional
               arrangement to ensure preliminary screening of all major project proposals is a critical
               must-have feature to enable the system’s resources (e.g., MA/IB teams, evaluators,
               etc.) to focus only on the promising, eligible applications.
    1B. Dimensions:
            A regional economic and social strategy is in place to help guide the prioritization of
               capital spending decisions, supported by detailed strategies (at least for major sectors).
            Initiators submit a project profile for a central body/line ministry/regional agency’s
               initial review.
            A preliminary screening process is in place for testing project proposals for basic
               consistency with the government’s existing policies and strategic guidance.

2. Formal project appraisal
    2A. Concepts:
             Quality of project preparation and appraisal: The quality of project preparation and
                analysis is a critical ingredient in any PIM system. Weak project preparation is very hard
                to remedy at later stages of the cycle; by contrast, thorough preparation and
                evaluation can make a substantial difference in terms of how smooth the



                                                                                                        5
                   implementation phase goes and how high the project impact ultimately is.2 In many
                   countries, including Romania, project preparation is relatively weak and there is a
                   serious lack of in-line capacity for project appraisal. The more serious problem,
                   however, is lack of demand from decision-makers for better project appraisal. This is
                   illustrated by the current underutilization of relatively large technical assistance
                   funding to improve the quality of project appraisal.
                  Project appraisal: Projects or programs that meet the first screening test should be
                   subject to the appraisal of their viability, which requires a feasibility analysis. Its
                   objective is to answer the essential question of whether the initiator should proceed
                   with a project. At this stage, a proposal will be consistent with the government’s
                   priorities, but that does not necessarily mean that it is feasible and optimal per se. This
                   process may require a regulated set of project preparation steps, such as prefeasibility
                   and feasibility studies, including preliminary design and environmental and social
                   impact assessments, which must be completed before a project can be approved for
                   funding. Projects involving non-standard procurement, such as public private
                   partnerships (PPPs) and bundled “resources for infrastructure” projects should be
                   subject to the same appraisal process as standard public investments, and their costs
                   and benefits should be compared against a public sector comparable project.
                  Cost-benefit analysis: While cost-benefit analysis (CBA) can be complex and involve
                   contentious judgments about the valuation of costs and benefits, it is generally
                   accepted that, because major public investment decisions involve scarce resources and
                   trade-offs between competing claims, decision-makers should be provided with
                   technical advice on the net value of the choices they face. These costs and benefits
                   should ideally be society-wide (i.e., including positive and negative externalities) rather
                   than just focusing on fiscal or financial costs and benefits. At the same time, CBA
                   should be linked to actual project size and also reflect the available capacity of
                   beneficiaries and evaluators to implement and assess such a methodology. Virtually all
                   projects under the ROP 2007-2013, regardless of their size, had to have a CBA
                   submitted along with the formal application, although the EU requires the CBA only for
                   projects over 50 million Euro. No ROP project has passed that threshold in the 2007-
                   2013 programming period and it is likely that this will not change under the next ROP.
                  Prefeasibility/feasibility studies: The prefeasibility study helps identify relevant
                   alternatives before undertaking a full-fledged feasibility study, and enables decision-
                   makers and technical staff to find out early whether a proposed project is worth
                   undertaking. The feasibility study takes the prefeasibility analysis further by compiling
                   relevant data, refining project outputs and outcomes, outlining and analyzing the
                   selected solution for achieving project objectives, and carrying out various background
                   assessments, including environmental and social impact analysis. It helps narrow the
                   scope of a project to identify an optimal option for preliminary design. The table below
                   summarizes the main differences between the two outputs.

 Harberger (2005) argues that improved project evaluation that has a marked impact on the rate of economic productivity
can permanently increase a country’s growth rate.

    Identification of lacking information for             Social impact assessment
     the Feasibility Study

           Portfolio of projects: It is helpful to maintain a portfolio of the appraised projects. This
            can help not only to track how many projects have been selected, but also allows for
            revisiting rejected or lower-scoring projects later on, when underlying circumstances
            change and they are more likely to generate net positive benefits or there are sufficient
            available resources to justify the intervention. Hence, all appraised projects should be
            recorded in a project database ranked by priority for budget consideration.
2B. Dimensions:
        Clarity of roles in project preparation: There should be defined attributions for
           potential beneficiaries, IBs, and the MA.
        Specific procedures for project preparation and appraisal: Properly sequenced and
           disciplined procedures, with formal decisions at key stages (including the decision to
           proceed to detailed preparation) should be properly applied to relevant project types.
        Availability of technical guidance: Clear, comprehensive, and practical technical
           guidance on the substantive requirements for preparing and appraising new proposals
           (e.g., a manual appropriate to the existing capacity of the target audience, with specific
           successful examples) should be widely accessible. The guidance should cover standard
           public investment delivery modes and, where relevant, non-standard modes such as
           PPPs. It should provide practical guidance on proportionality of appraisal.
        Quality of project appraisal: This includes several key questions.


                                                                                                       7
                           o
                           Is the need for the project clearly identified and well justified? Is the project
                           consistent with the role of the government in the economy? Is the
                           investment based on a systematic assessment of future infrastructure needs
                           and a regular assessment of the current condition of existing infrastructure?
                        o Are the project’s objectives clearly specified and fully consistent with
                           national/regional/local priorities, and with sector and sub-sector strategies?
                        o Are alternative options to meet the project’s objectives clearly identified and
                           comparatively examined? Do the project’s outputs meet set objectives? Is
                           the most promising option analyzed in detail?
                        o Are project costs fully and accurately estimated? Are project benefits likely to
                           justify the costs? Have other potential impacts of the project been identified
                           and adequately assessed?
                        o Has all the required financing been identified?
                        o Have relevant stakeholders been adequately consulted?
                  Scope and proportionality of appraisal application: Appraisals should be applied
                   comprehensively as well as proportionally, depending on projects’ scope and sector.

3. Independent review of appraisal
     3A. Concepts:
             Independent review: Optimism bias amongst those developing project proposals –
                under-estimation of costs and over-estimation of benefits – is well-documented. In a
                review of 258 transport projects in 20 countries, Flyvberg et. al. found that nine out of
                ten projects underestimated costs by an average of 28%.3 While project proposing
                units often have the best information on which to base their new project proposals,
                they may have weak incentives to produce high quality proposals aligned with the
                government’s strategies and they may lack technical capacity in project design and
                analysis. It is therefore a necessary good practice for all projects to be subjected to
                “challenge” and careful analysis by an agency that is independent of the project-
                proposing units. However, independent review can also be conducted selectively to
                focus on the most significant (e.g., high value, high risk, high complexity) projects.
    3B. Dimensions:
            Project appraisals: Project proposing units or external agencies can formally undertake
               the development of appraisals (e.g., feasibility studies). An external agency or
               department should carefully assess the quality and objectivity of such appraisals.
            Independent review: All project appraisals, especially for large projects, should be
               subject to independent review. It is also important how this process is conducted and
               by whom.
            Evaluators: The independence of evaluators, as well as their competence, should be
               guaranteed through proper selection and contracting procedures.
            Criteria: The evaluation criteria should be practical and properly tailored to the type
               and size of projects considered and there should also be full transparency around how
               investment proposals are assessed.

 B. Flyvberg, M. Holm, and S. Buhl, (2007). The average cost overruns varied across transport sub-sectors, with rail projects
exceeding estimates by an average of 42%, tunnels and bridges by 34%, and roads by 20%.

                                                                                                                                8
4. Project selection and budgeting
   4A. Concepts:
            Project selection: It is generally much more difficult and costly to halt a project after it
               has started than to redesign, defer, or reject a project prior to initial budget funding.
               Poor project selection is a common weakness in PIM systems, particularly in developing
               countries where the urgent need for public investment can overwhelm the call for
               careful analysis of alternatives. The decision to grant funding represents the last key
               (and sometimes only) selection gateway. While political considerations or genuine
               emergencies (including the need to avoid the decommitment of EU funds) can result in
               pressure to rush a project into contracting and implementation without adequate
               appraisal, these instances should be exceptional.
            Efficient investment: The key factors for efficient investment are good decisions in the
               choice of projects, active management of the asset portfolio (including through
               disposals of inactive or irrelevant projects, as needed), and a budgetary process that
               ensures recurrent funding to operate and maintain existing assets. The latter is
               especially important for donor-funded projects that create assets, while operation and
               maintenance costs are assumed to be borne by the government. Forward costs of
               investment projects and their funding should be reviewed systematically by both sector
               ministries and the Ministry of Finance during the budget’s preparation. The budget
               preparation process should be well structured through a careful interface with the
               project planning cycle, as well as through close coordination among officials
               responsible for capital and current spending. Before new projects are selected,
               sufficient funds provisions need to be made for the costs of ongoing (incomplete)
               projects, so that their efficient rate of physical implementation is not interrupted by
               lack of financing. In some cases, insufficient funding is allocated to ongoing projects
               due to political pressures or due to the lack of information on funding requirements,
               resulting in unfinished investments, high costs, and overall inefficient public spending.
            Multi-year budgets: Given the multi-year nature of most capital projects, provisions in
               the financial management laws and regulations are needed to provide beneficiaries
               with budget authority to commit expenditures beyond the current budget year, so that
               they can enter multi-year contracts (e.g., for construction of large infrastructure
               assets). In addition, larger projects may involve project preparation expenditures that
               span several fiscal years. In some countries, there is a separate central budget line to
               finance the costs of project preparation.
    4B. Dimensions:
            Transparent criteria for project selection
            Capital and current spending fully integrated
            Quality of detailed project design
            Ongoing projects receive sufficient funding
            Multi-year funding authority

Primary and Secondary Sources
13.     Observations and recommendations in this report are based on multiple sources. First, this
work builds on past and concurrent analyses, including the World Bank’s 2010-2011 functional review
of the Romanian Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism, as well as on other technical
assistance work undertaken for the current MRDPA (as referenced earlier). Second, the team
conducted substantial desk review and analysis of available materials: specific to the ROP (e.g.,

                                                                                                       9
programming documents, evaluation grids, applicant guides, progress reports, relevant legislative acts,
etc.); on regional development and structural programs in Romania more generally (e.g., the draft
Partnership Agreement, Regional Development Plans, Integrated Development Plans, etc.); and related
to the broader European framework (e.g., Europe 2020, the Position of the Commission on the
Development of Partnership Agreements, the Common Strategic Framework 2014-2020, etc.). Second,
there was a substantial effort to gather information on the management and implementation of
structural funds in other EU Member States, with a specific focus on selection models, which forms the
basis of Chapter IV. This was supplemented, whenever feasible, by phone conversations with relevant
actors in other countries.

14.      In addition, the team organized several missions to Romania, specifically focused on selection
models, engaging in in-depth conversations with both the central Managing Authority within the
MRDPA and with Intermediate Bodies and beneficiaries across the country. More specifically, in the
first part of the assessment, missions were organized to four of the eight Regional Development
Agencies, covering the following regions: North-West, West, North-East and Bucharest-Ilfov. Annex 9
includes a detailed Interview Guide. In the second phase of the analysis (i.e., after the completion of
the intermediary report), missions were organized to all eight regions and included discussions with the
MA, the RDAs, ROP beneficiaries, and other stakeholders. As part of this effort, and under the broader
World Bank Regional Development Program in Romania, a pool of 200+ counterparts contributed with
insights and suggestions for improving the ROP. Interviews and discussions focused primarily, but not
exclusively, on the MA-IB-beneficiaries triad, also covering key actors like the National Authority for
Regulating and Monitoring Public Procurement (NARMPP), financial institutions, consulting firms,
contractors, etc.

Audiences
15.     The main audiences of the current report are senior managers from the Ministry of Regional
Development and Public Administration (MRDPA), as well as officials from the European Commission
(EC) responsible for the ROP’s oversight. Other key stakeholders who may benefit from this
assessment include IB managers and staff, as the main providers of the ROP’s interface with
beneficiaries (under the program’s current setup), as well as MA and IB teams from other operational
programs. Given its expected role in the 2014-2020 period, the Ministry of European Funds is also a
primary target of the current work, and there is hope that the proposed selection models will also
inspire other operational programs to enhance the mechanisms for project evaluation. A broad
distribution and discussion of the findings is desirable, including among beneficiaries, who should
develop a deep understanding of proposed changes that will affect the selection of projects by the next
ROP, along with the reasons for adjusting the models used for 2007-2013. Last but not least, given that
there is a relative lack of information on optimal selection models for structural funds in Member
States more generally, this work can contribute to broader thinking on how to evaluate and select
projects that receive co-financing from EU funds.

16.     Above all, this analysis will produce positive results if it is accepted, endorsed, and “owned”
by the MRDPA leadership and staff and by decision-makers across the Romanian Government. The
good news is that the MA team has the decision-making power on how the next ROP will look like in
terms of selection models. The hope is that key actors within the MRDPA will continue to discuss the
report’s assessment and internalize recommended actions, pushing for their full-fledged
implementation. As noted earlier, to the extent that lessons from the ROP apply to other structural
programs in Romania and to other EU Member States, and in many cases the principles underpinning
selection models are similar (e.g., drive for impact, efficiency, etc.), the application and/or adjustment

                                                                                                       10
of this report’s observations and recommendations to a broader context would be much welcomed and
encouraged.

Structure of the Report
17.      This report focuses on three key tasks: assessment of the status quo, comparison with other
EU Member States, and recommendations for the ROP’s improvement. It is structured accordingly.
Following this introductory section, Chapter II provides background information on the Romanian ROP,
particularly useful for audiences who are less familiar with the program. Further, Chapter III narrows in
on the ROP’s project selection models for 2007-2013, providing an in-depth analysis of their strengths
and weaknesses. As referenced before, this assessment is based on the public investment management
(PIM) framework developed by the World Bank. Chapter IV reviews practices in eight selected EU
Member States. Applicable lessons from their best practices are recommended for improving project
selection models in Romania. Chapter V discusses some basic principles that should be taken into
consideration when developing an evaluation and selection framework. Chapter VI discusses key
building blocks (e.g., a sound Regional Development Strategy) that need to be in place to enable an
evaluation and selection model to work efficiently and effectively. Chapter VII proposes an overall
framework for project selection models for the 2014 – 2020 ROP, with a discussion around three
potential scenarios (Status Quo+, Semi-Competitive, and Competitive) for the MA-ROP’s consideration.
Chapter VIII goes into detailed recommendations and proposes a number of changes to the current
evaluation and selection system – changes that would apply to all three scenarios discussed in this
report. Chapter IX and Chapter X discuss multiple issues pertaining to the recommendation for pre-
allocating funds for certain types of projects – an issue that is particularly poignant for the Semi-
Competitive and Competitive scenarios. Chapter XI proposes a number of options for a competitive
selection model. Last but certainly not least, Chapter XII tackles a critical issue that is often overlooked
– the proper monitoring and evaluation of the project selection model to establish whether it has
achieved the desired goals and functioned within the set parameters. Chapter XII concludes.

II. Background on Romania’s ROP

18.      Romania continues to face important challenges in regional development, particularly in
terms of “shortening” the distance to the markets in Western Europe, which attract roughly 70% of
the country’s exports.4 At the same time, Romania has the opportunity to benefit from significant EU
structural assistance through the Regional Operational Programme (ROP). In this process, one critical
component is to improve project selection models for the next ROP, including the evaluation process
and criteria, while maintaining strong linkages to the strategic development priorities of the future
programming period. The following sections provide basic information on the structure, strategic
priorities, and implementation of the ROP, for both 2007-2013 and 2014-2020.

A. ROP 2007-2013
19.     The Regional Operational Programme (ROP) is one of seven operational programs (OPs) in
Romania financed through EU funds and its importance for the country’s development can hardly be
overstated. The EU dedicated 3.7 billion EUR to the ROP to support Romania’s regional development in
the post-accession period. This amounts to 19% of the total structural funds available through the
National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) between 2007 and 2013, making the ROP the third
largest program after transportation (23.7%) and environment (23.5%). In fact, based on the draft
Partnership Agreement, its size is expected to increase significantly for 2014-2020, in part due to its
previous success. The ROP involves a diverse portfolio of projects, from urban development to
transport infrastructure, social infrastructure, tourism, and technical assistance. In 2011, projects
financed under the ROP accounted for nearly 27% of investments supported through external grants
and more than 12% of total public investment in the country. Qualitative data from interviews with
local administration representatives (e.g., Mayors, County Council Presidents, etc.) have confirmed that
the ROP plays a key role in supporting Romania’s development needs, particularly at the city and
county level. In fact, many of the local priorities are set to align with the key goals of the ROP.

 GDP/capita data show that regions closer to the EU’s hard development core tend to be more developed. For a more
detailed discussion of these aspects, see the report on “Competitive Cities,” World Bank, 2013.

                                                                                                                      13
20.      The ROP programmatic document defines strategic and specific objectives that are generally
aligned with sound principles of economic growth. The program seeks to support the economic, social,
territorially balanced, and sustainable development of Romanian regions, according to their specific
needs and resources, by focusing on urban growth poles, the business environment, and basic
infrastructure. The vision is to transform Romanian regions, particularly the ones lagging behind, into
more attractive places to live, work, visit, and invest in. Based on this, the following specific objectives
were set: (1) to increase the economic and social role of urban centers, adopting a polycentric
approach, in order to stimulate a more balanced development of regions; (2) to increase accessibility
within regions and in particular the accessibility of urban centers and their connection to surrounding
areas; (3) to increase the quality of social infrastructure of regions; (4) to increase the competitiveness
of regions as business locations; and (5) to increase the contribution of tourism to the development of
regions. Concentration, connectivity, basic institutions and services, quality of life – these are
cornerstone concepts of proper policies promoting sustainable and inclusive economic development
(albeit with spatially uneven benefits in the short term, but faster, stronger growth and overall
convergence in the long term), as noted in the World Bank’s World Development Report 2009 and also
in the 2013 Competitive Cities study.

21.     The ROP’s allocation across Romania’s eight development regions is inver se proportional to
GDP/capita, with lagging regions, which have greater needs and sometimes lack even basic
infrastructure, receiving more funds.5 In addition, the ROP has 6 Priority Axes (PAs) that consist of 15
Key Areas of Intervention (KAIs), as described below. Error! Reference source not found. provides
further details on activities, eligible beneficiaries, target groups and target areas, submission timeline,
submission types of project application forms, and technical and financial evaluation criteria for each of
the ROP’s KAIs. Below is a summary of the ROP’s PAs and their corresponding priorities:
           Priority Axis 1: Support for sustainable development of urban growth poles. This aims to increase the
            quality of life and to create new jobs in cities by rehabilitating the urban infrastructure, improving
            services, including social services, as well as by developing business support structures and
            entrepreneurship. Investments are concentrated in those cities that act as regional and / or local growth
            poles and spread the development into the surrounding areas, giving priority to growth poles located in
            regions and counties with lower level of development in terms of GDP and unemployment. KAIs for PA1:
                     PA 1.1. Integrated urban development plans;
                     PA 1.2 Support for the investments in the energy efficiency of the buildings.
           Priority Axis 2: Improvement of regional and local transport infrastructure . This aims to increase the
            accessibility of regions and the mobility of population, goods and services, in order to foster sustainable
            economic development. There is one KAI for PA2:
                     PA 2.1.: Rehabilitation and modernization of the county roads and urban streets networking
                     including construction/rehabilitation of ring roads.
           Priority Axis 3: Improvement of social infrastructure. This axis aims to create the premises for better
            access of the population to essential services, contributing to the achievement of the European objective
            of economic and social cohesion by improving infrastructure for health, education, social services, and
            public safety in emergency situations. There are 4 KAIs:
                     PA 3.1.: Rehabilitation, modernization, and equipping of the health services’ infrastructure;
                     PA 3.2.: Rehabilitation, modernization, development & endowment of social services
                     infrastructure;
                     PA 3.3.: Improving the equipment of the operational units for public safety interventions in
                     emergency situations;

    See Annex 1 for the ROP’s planned allocation by priority axis, KAIs, development regions, and year.

                                                                                                                    14
                      PA 3.4.: Rehabilitation, modernization, development, and endowment of pre–university,
                      university, and lifelong learning infrastructure.
           Priority Axis 4: Strengthening the regional and local business environment. This priority axis aims to set
            up and develop business support structures of regional and local importance, rehabilitate industrial sites,
            and support regional and local entrepreneurial initiatives, in order to facilitate job creation and
            sustainable economic growth. KAIs for PA4 are:
                     PA 4.1.: Development of sustainable business support structures of regional & local importance;
                     PA 4.2.: Rehabilitation of unused polluted industrial sites and preparation for new activities;
                     PA 4.3.: Support the development of micro-enterprises.
           Priority Axis 5: Sustainable development and promotion of tourism. This aims mainly to promote the
            country’s cultural heritage and natural resources with tourism potential, as well as to improve the quality
            of accommodation and leisure tourist infrastructure, in order to increase the regions’ attractiveness,
            develop the local economies, and create new jobs. KAIs for PA5 are:
                     PA 5.1.: Renovation and sustainable use of cultural heritage sites and set-up/modernization of
                     related infrastructure;
                     PA 5.2.: Creation, development, and modernization of tourism infrastructure for sustainable use
                     of natural resources and for increasing the quality of tourism services;
                     PA 5.3.: Promotion of tourism potential and set-up of needed infrastructure to increase
                     Romania’s attractiveness as a travel destination.
           Priority Axis 6: Technical assistance. The objective is to provide support for the transparent and efficient
            implementation of the program. KAIs include:
                     PA 6.1.: Support for the implementation, overall management, and evaluation of the ROP;
                     PA 6.2.: Support for the advertising and information activities related to the ROP.

22.      The ROP’s importance and relevance in the context of Romania’s pressing development
needs is also obvious in the high rates of applications, far exceeding the available allocation, across
all regions and nearly all axes. The two figures below summarize this information and the ROP Annual
Implementation Report (AIR). As of December 31, 2012, the AIR shows good results: 95% contracting
for a total of 5.67 billion Euros, with all regions exceeding 85%; 1.44 billion Euros paid to beneficiaries,
of which 1.29 billion from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); 1,131 finalized projects,
with 292.5 million Euros as the ERDF contribution; and the positive examples could go on.6

23.      In this light, it is important to note from the start that the ROP has been a superior performer
in the Romanian context, in terms of absorption rates, despite a complex and heterogeneous
portfolio of projects. Because of its broad focus on regional development issues, the ROP addresses a
wide-ranging set of needs at the level of each region, from urban development to transport
infrastructure, social infrastructure, business development, and tourism. In this context, the ROP has
achieved the best absorption rates out of all structural programs (as of November 30, 2013),
particularly when it comes to payments from the EC to Romania, which stood at 44% of the total
available ROP allocation. Of course, this is a quantity-focused indicator and does not mean that the
selection models per se have been flawless (and, in fact, as noted throughout this report, there is room
for improvement) or that the impact of financed projects was maximized. But the principle still holds
true that any changes going forward should not affect the program’s positive results (e.g., absorption,
overall beneficiary satisfaction, etc.).

24.     The ROP’s broad scope and diversity inevitably translate into a complex evaluation and
selection framework, with criteria and grids adapted to each major intervention area. Even so, while
it may be challenging for applicants and beneficiaries to navigate through the process, their satisfaction
with the program is generally very high, as evident in both qualitative interviews and in responses to a
survey conducted in April-May 2013.7 Specifically, out of 470 respondents, 62% qualified the support
received from Intermediate Bodies during the evaluation stage as “excellent” or “very good,” while 12%
were dissatisfied. The numbers related to beneficiaries’ satisfaction with MA support provided during
project evaluation are similar: 68% characterized it as “excellent” or “very good” and only 13% thought
it was “unsatisfactory” or “poor.” Such results are encouraging and tend to reflect beneficiaries’
broader attitudes vis-à-vis the MA and the IB staff, which they routinely characterize as professional,
competent, and helpful. With few exceptions, interviewed subjects praised the fact that selection
models and criteria are transparent and described in sufficient depth in the Applicant Guides, which
helps them design projects that are more aligned with the objectives of the ROP.

25.      At the same time, field research and qualitative survey inputs also point to potential
improvements of current project selection models. The subsequent chapters of this report go into
great detail for each potential shortcoming. As a preview, it suffices to note that in some cases the
current criteria and procedures are considered too elaborate and lengthy (e.g., the cost-benefit analysis
is required even for projects where it is hardly applicable or where the expenses related to
implementing a proper CBA are excessive compared to the total value of the investment); in other
instances, the models tend to prioritize simpler applications that pass a certain threshold and, based on
the first-in-first out rule, receive funding to the detriment of more complex projects that require
substantial time for concept design and application writing. These are precisely some of the issues that
have motivated the current effort to identify and propose improved ROP selection models that would
build on the system’s strong points while addressing its weaknesses.


B. ROP 2014-2020
26.      The ROP for the 2014-2020 budgeting period is, as of January 2014, in the programming
phase, contingent on the conclusion of higher-level agreements between the EU and the Romanian
Government. At the European level, the flagship document guiding the Union’s future development is
the Europe 2020 strategy, which established three priorities around smart, sustainable, and inclusive
growth, each supported by several flagship initiatives (e.g., Youth on the move, European platform
against poverty and social exclusion, etc.). Five fundamental objectives cover employment, research &
development, climate change and energy efficiency, education, and poverty, backed by specific targets
like 3% of GDP invested in R&D and at least 20 million people fewer in or at risk of poverty and social
exclusion. While Europe 2020 significantly shapes EU-level thinking, its objectives remain vague, and it
is not entirely clear how they were selected as critical to the Community’s development at this point in
time. Given the critical importance of Europe 2020 and other related documents, which ultimately
influence how structural funds are managed and what kinds of investments they can support (and,
hence, how selection models look like), there is a need to ensure better consultations at the country
level to bring in the voices of potential beneficiaries and citizens. In other words, there need to be more
bottom-up processes to highlight needs and priorities of different Member States, and ensure that they
are fully reflected in EU-level strategic documents.

 These data come from a survey conducted as part of the “ROP 2.0: Beneficiary Support Mechanisms” World Bank technical
assistance project.

                                                                                                                     17
27.      Mirroring the main priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy, a legislative package was adopted
by the EC on October 6, 2011, establishing 11 thematic objectives. These include: strengthening
research, technological development, and innovation; enhancing access to, use, and quality of
information and communication technologies; enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-
sized enterprises, the agricultural sector (for the EAFRD), and fisheries and the aquaculture sector (for
the EMFF); supporting the shift toward a low-carbon economy in all sectors; promoting climate change
adaptation, risk prevention, and management; protecting the environment and promoting resource
efficiency; promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures;
promoting employment and supporting labor mobility; promoting social inclusion and combating
poverty; investing in education, skills, and lifelong learning; and enhancing institutional capacity and an
efficient public administration.

28.     Based on these goals, the EC presented the Common Strategic Framework (CSF), designed to
enable more impactful and integrated spending of structural funds.8 As noted by the Commission,
“national and regional authorities will use this framework as the basis for drafting their 'Partnership
Contracts' with the Commission, committing themselves to meeting Europe's growth and jobs targets
for 2020.”9 The next steps in the process are the drafting, evaluation, negotiation, and signing of the
Partnership Agreement (PA) with each Member State. This is the document that is meant to replace the
National Strategic Reference Framework 2007-2013 for the next programming period. The PA aims to
set out an integrated approach for territorial development supported by all the CSF Funds and includes
objectives based on agreed indicators, strategic investments, and a number of conditionalities. As of
October 2013, a first draft PA is open for public debate and key stakeholders have been asked to
provide feedback to the Romanian MEF.

29.     Previously, the EC had prepared position papers customized for each Member State,
summarizing the Commission’s views on funding priorities, challenges, and recommendations for
2014-2020. This document has been the best indication of what the EC expects from Romania in terms
of how it will use available structural funds over the next seven years. As it specifically notes in its
introduction, “the purpose of [the] position paper is to set out the framework for dialogue between the
Commission services and Romania on the preparation of the Partnership Agreement and Programmes.”
The paper goes on to say that “the Commission proposes to group and limit EU funding to key
challenges outlined in [the] position paper.” Indeed, the position paper has been rightly cited in
interviews with both MA and RDA representatives as the basis of current programming efforts.

30.     Partly as a result of internal political changes, partly due to delays in the adoption of the EU
budget, Romania has started the programming for the 2014-2020 cycle relatively late, particularly
compared to the 2007-2013 period. In June 2012, the Government approved a “Memorandum on the
Approval of Actions and Documents for the Preparation of Accessing and Implementing European
Funds in 2014-2020.” Based on this framework, the Ministry of European Funds (MEF) created a set of
methodologies that describe the main elements of programming documents, as well as the stages of
the planning process, including methods for analyzing development needs, formulating strategies, and
consulting stakeholders. Like the Ministry of European Integration in 2007-2013, the MEF is responsible

  These include: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Cohesion Fund (CF), the European Social
Fund (ESF), the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund
(EMFF).

for the overall coordination of the programming process, including related technical assistance projects
and, additionally, is in charge of developing the draft Partnership Agreement (PA). The Government has
responded to EC requests in this area promptly: for instance, four days after the EC presented its
position paper, the Government adopted a note on fulfilling ex-ante conditionalities and, on January
31, 2013, it had a first discussion with the EC on the position paper and its implications. This dialogue
has continued over the past months and the PA is expected to be approved by the EC in early 2014,
according to the official schedule. This timeframe is still relatively delayed compared to other Member
States (for example, the Czech Republic, Belgium, Poland, and Slovenia all aimed to finalize their PAs at
the end of 2012).10

31.      The overall consultation system for developing Romania’s priorities for 2014 -2020 is similar
to the previous programming period and involves bottom-up inputs through thematic working
groups. At the national level, an Interinstitutional Committee for Elaborating the Partnership
Agreement (ICPA) draws from the work of 12 sub-groups: 10 thematic consultative committees (TCCs),
spanning topics like transport, environment, education, health, tourism, administration and good
governance, etc.; and 2 committees on regional development (CCRD) and territorial cohesion (CCTC).
Each committee is coordinated by central authorities (i.e., line Ministries). The CCRD is most directly
tied to the future ROP, although some of the other sub-groups (e.g., education, health, tourism,
territorial cohesion, etc.) may well influence the program’s priority axes and strategic directions. The
CCRD is the main link between the national and the regional levels, and MA-ROP ensures its Secretariat.

32.     The two tables below provide further information about the proposed allocations by
operational program and types of investments for 2014-2020, as included in the May 2013
preliminary draft of the PA. The ROP benefits from 6.99 billion Euros, significantly more than for the
current programming period, which would also make it the largest operational program (although the
Large Infrastructure OP is a close second). As for investment types and priorities, it is likely that they
will remain largely the same compared to the 2007-2013 period (e.g., urban development; social and

of the relative split of funding among the various intervention areas. In general, there may be further
changes to the data below, to be determined for the final version of the PA that will be signed between
the EC and the Romanian Government, likely before the end of 2013.

33.     At the regional level, as during the preparation of the 2007-2013 programming period, there
are also eight RCRs – Regional Committees for Elaborating the Regional Development Plans (RDPs).
They maintain consultative roles and are coordinated by the region’s respective Regional Development
Agency (RDA), which also represents the RCR in the Inter-institutional Committee for Elaborating the
Partnership Agreement (ICPA). The main functions of the RCR are to supervise and endorse: the social
and economic analysis used to design the RDP; the strategy and the main objectives for the
development of region; the proposed/planned financial program assigned to the RDP; the draft of the

                                                                                                             21
RDP; the monitoring reports of the RDP; and the list of strategic projects identified at the level of the
development region. For its part, the MA-ROP has issued a Methodology for the Planning of Regional
Development to guide the preparation of regional development plans.11Each RCR brings together a
wide range of social and economic partners, academic experts, and key future beneficiaries (e.g., city
halls, county councils, etc.), organized into working groups. Though there is some variation across the
eight development regions, WGs generally cover the following areas: urban development; energy
efficiency; business environment; disadvantaged communities; and regional infrastructure.

II. Review of ROP Project Selection Models (2007 – 2013)

34.      The ROP selection process includes three main stages: first, the administrative conformity
and eligibility assessment; second, the technical and financial evaluation; and third, the preparation
and analysis of the technical project (if required) and the pre-contracting/contracting phase. A full
graphical description of this relatively complex process is presented in Error! Reference source not
found., covering a hypothetical project that requires a technical project (TP) / detailed technical
design. For some ROP projects, such as those covering the promotion of tourism, there were no actual
infrastructure works involved, so a TP is not needed. The paragraphs below describe in greater detail
the various components of the three-staged ROP selection process:
     The first stage covers the administrative conformity and eligibility assessment, and should
         not exceed 25 working days. The procedure allows for an exceptional extension of no more
         than 5 working days, which means that, in exceptional cases, the maximum duration should be
         30 working days (6 weeks or 1.5 months).
             o Step 1.1: “Checking the administrative conformity and eligibility” should last for a
                 maximum of 4 working days. The expert in charge of this task can ask for 2
                 clarifications, at most, although each round can include multiple questions. The
                 maximum time allowed to finalize this step, including the time for the beneficiary to
                 prepare the answers and for the expert to analyze them, is 15 working days.
             o Step 1.2: “Checking based on the ‘4 eyes’ principle” involves a second expert in charge
                 of the verification, with up to one round of clarifying questions (as before, there is no
                 limit on the total number of questions asked within this round). This step must be
                 complete within 8 working days, which includes the time for the beneficiary to prepare
                 answers and for the expert to analyze them.
             o Step 1.3: “Checking the process” is completed by the head of the unit in charge with
                 the administrative conformity and eligibility verifications. The maximum duration
                 allowed is 2 working days.

       The second stage, the technical and financial evaluation, should last for a maximum of 86
        working days (around 17 weeks or 4.3 months) and has three steps, as described below.
           o Step 2.1: “The Technical and Financial Evaluation” is performed by a team of 3 people
               (2 independent evaluators and 1 thematic expert), typically appointed by MA-ROP and
               endorsed by the RDA. In some cases, the RDA has directly appointed these
               independent experts to speed up the process and surpass certain blockages at the MA-
               ROP level. Specifically, the MA has had difficulties in conducting the public
               procurement procedures related to the selection of evaluators at the national level,
               mainly because of objections formulated by the National Authority for Regulating and
               Monitoring Public Procurement (NARMPP). The maximum duration allowed for this
               step is 35 working days, including, at most, 2 requests for clarification.
           o Step 2.2 (if needed): “The Exceptional Evaluation” is required when during the first step
               the two independent evaluators cannot agree on the final result. In this case, the IB
               asks the MA to appoint a third independent evaluator. The allotted timeline for this
               step is 28 working days, including 1 maximum request for clarification.
           o Step 2.3: The MA-ROP checks and endorses the technical and financial evaluation
               report. The maximum duration allowed for this step is 23 working days, during which
               the MA has the opportunity to clarify any pending issues.



                                                                                                       23
       The third stage has two major steps.
           o Step 3.1 (if required): “Preparation and Analysis of the Technical Project” involves the
                beneficiary submitting this document to be verified by the IB. The TP preparation can
                take up to six months, after which IB experts have to verify the conformity of the TP. In
                exceptional situations (e.g., significant discrepancies between the TP and the feasibility
                study), the IB can request the MA to appoint a technical expert to verify the content of
                the TP and recommend changes. This selection process generally applies to all PAs,
                with several exceptions for some particular PAs such as PA 4.3., where beneficiaries are
                not required to submit technical projects (interventions may not include a construction
                component).
           o Step 3.2:“Pre-contracting/contracting” includes site visits, preparation of contracting
                documents, and the signing of the financing contract by all parties.

35.      In practice, it has taken significantly longer than the required norm to complete certain steps
of the selection process. For example, in 2011, the real duration for the evaluation process took
135.5% versus the planned duration. Most of the delays happened at the stage of technical project
submission and verification, and pre-contracting/contracting. Interestingly, as evident from the figure
below, the actual average duration of the selection process was longer every year. In 2011, it increased
by 21.4% compared to 2010 and by 87% compared to 2008. The duration for the technical and financial
evaluation in 2011 increased by 82.6% compared to 2010 and by 133.3% compared to 2008. This is a
reflection of the number of applications submitted for consideration, but can also suggest an increase
in the complexity of applicable procedures. The only phase for which processing became slightly more
efficient is the conformity and eligibility check, performed entirely by the RDAs.

Analysis of the 2007 – 2013 ROP Project Selection Models
36.     This section presents findings from the analysis of the 2007 – 2013 ROP project selection
models, according to the first four stages of the eight-must-have PIM framework, as described in the
methodology section. It first discusses why the current ROP project selection models were chosen,
then presents a summary table of the findings, followed by a detailed discussion.

37.      Within each region, two primary ROP selection models are currently in use. The first applies
to projects proposed by growth poles (GPs) and urban development poles (UDPs) under Priority Axis
1.1 and its key feature is the dedicated or pre-allocated funding. The second model covers all other
priority axes and types of beneficiaries and involves selection through the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule,
as explained below. There is also a third selection model that applies only to ROP Axis 6 – Technical
Assistance, for which the beneficiaries are the MA and the RDAs, and funds are meant to cover
expenses related to the proper implementation and promotion of the program. Since in practice there
are no evaluation procedures or formal project applications under this axis.

38.      The first selection model (“dedicated”) ensures pre-allocated funding to each GP and UDP.
The choice to rely on predetermined amounts is in line with EU requirements for integrated projects in
large urban settings. The strategy formulation, planning, and identification of integrated projects occur
through the Urban Integrated Development Plans, as prepared by each municipality interested in
accessing ROP funding under the GP or UDP priority areas. The list of GPs and UDPs was determined at
the national level and only cities formally included under each category have been able to apply for
funding available under the corresponding axis/key area of intervention. On the one hand, dedicated
funding has worked well for administrations that needed to rely on a predetermined budget to support
planning and project preparation (e.g., financing of complex technical documentation), and the general
idea of integrated projects is correct and powerful in terms of potential impact. In that sense, the ROP
was an opportunity for local administrations to draft and implement development strategies based on
clear priorities and projects, a process that has been valuable in guiding cities’ growth and in
developing planning capacity at the local level. Indeed, many localities across Romania had lacked
strategic planning documents before they became mandatory as a precondition for accessing EU funds
through the ROP Axis 1.1. On the other hand, dedicated funding also means that there is an extended
period of time available for project submission and completion. There is a risk of delays in realizing
investments if the municipality is not well motivated to pursue the preparation and implementation of
projects. In addition, the model only requires meeting minimum standards of quality, rather than
selecting the highest-impact projects, a broader weakness of the current ROP system, whereby projects
do not compete (and are not scored) against each other.

39.     The second selection model, based on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule, involves potential
beneficiaries submitting applications for funding on a continuous basis, under various axes, until the
budget allocation is exhausted by contracted projects and the respective axes are closed. The reasons
for this FIFO approach have not been explicitly stated as a policy with a formal description of the
rationale, but the benefits of this framework are relatively straightforward. A FIFO-based selection
model encourages the accelerated submission of projects, especially those that are already prepared
and in the pipeline at the beginning of the cycle. It also allows for continuous processing of the
proposed projects, which reduces the risk of peak-time over-burdening of MA/IB capacity. This highly
structured approach to selecting projects also limits external disruptions to quick and fair processing.
Overall, the FIFO approach promises to encourage higher absorption of ROP funds in a given time
period (i.e., 2007-2015, following the n+2 rule). While FIFO processing of projects has some

                                                                                                        25
advantages, it also has a number of weaknesses. First, projects are approved as they come through the
pipeline if they pass the minimum required points on evaluation criteria, rather than selecting them for
the highest expected impact. “Early-risers” may submit projects that meet minimum standards, thereby
implicitly excluding better projects that take longer to design and, thus, are generally submitted later,
after available funds are already depleted. Second, accelerating project preparation and submission can
lead to: (a) lower quality applications and technical documentation; and (b) possible delays in
processing (i) when clarifications and corrections are required for the project to be eligible, (ii) the
project has to be improved to meet minimum standards, or (iii) corrections are required to remove
inconsistencies between technical designs and feasibility studies.

Investment Guidance, Project Development & Preliminary Screening
Investment Guidance
41.    The ROP strategic framework for 2007-2013 consists of a number of key documents:
            The National Development Plan (NDP) is the overall strategic framework on structural
              funds, theoretically also including national policy, but practically driven by EU-level
              policies and the need to absorb EU financing. The NDP was designed by the Authority
              for Coordinating Structural Instruments (ACSI) in the Ministry of European Funds, with
              the support and consultation of other ministries, especially those managing Operational
              Programs (OPs) and the Ministry of Finance. A national development strategy, covering
              the country’s growth vision, regardless of financing sources, is not yet available.
            The National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) details the NDP in terms of
              operational programs, including objectives, actions, resources, and eligibility. The NSRF
              was also designed by ACSI and, for 2014-2020, will be replaced by the Partnership
              Agreement (PA) that is currently negotiated between the EC and the Government of
              Romania. The mandate for developing the PA 2014-2020 has stayed with the Ministry of
              European Funds (MEF).
            The Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013 is the main strategic and
              programmatic document in the current ROP system. It is developed by the Management
              Authority for the ROP in the Ministry of Regional Development and Public
              Administration (MRDPA), with the consultation of Regional Development Councils
              (RDCs), Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), other sector ministries to leverage
              linkages (e.g., the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Ministry of
              Transport, the Ministry of Environment, etc.). This process was supervised by ACSI
              within MEF.
            Regional Development Plans are designed by Regional Development Agencies, in
              consultation with local and county authorities from the region, as well as with other
              socio-economic partners. The RDPs are eventually approved by the Regional
              Development Councils (RDCs).
            The Framework Document for Implementation (FDI) provides details for every ROP
              priority axis in terms of specific objectives, main activities, target groups, resources
              allocated, eligible beneficiaries, and eligibility and evaluation criteria. The FDI is
              developed by the MA-ROP with the consultation of RDCs and RDAs, as well as other line
              ministries, and under the supervision of the MEF and the Certification and Payment
              Authority (CPA) within the Ministry of Finance. The Monitoring Committee of the ROP
              discusses and eventually endorses the evaluation criteria. Eligibility guidance is clear and
              provided through the Implementation Framework Document (See Annex 2). For each
              priority axis and key area of intervention there are clearly defined activities, eligible
              applicants, target groups and target areas, timeline for submission, and technical and
              financial evaluation criteria.
            Applicant Guides (AGs) are designed by the MA-ROP, in consultation with RDAs, and are
              also endorsed by MC-ROP. Based on interviews from the “MA-IB Collaboration and
              Beneficiary Support” World Bank project, beneficiaries appreciate AGs as very useful
              and comprehensive. They include detailed information on the application process,
              procedures, timeline, and requirements, including contact information at the MA and IB
              levels. AGs remain a key instrument for assisting potential and actual beneficiaries.

42.      In the FIFO selection model, a major problem in the strategic guidance for project
development is that neither the ROP’s programming, nor the Regional Development Plans, reflect the
specific priorities and needs of each region. RDPs are driven by EU-funded operational programs (OPs),
including the ROP, for which the strategic directions are set at the national level in the form of financing

                                                                                                         30
axes and KAIs. Indeed, there is little flexibility for regions to tailor the ROP funding to the specific
local/regional context and the only dimension that varies across regions is the absolute monetary
allocation of funds (to the benefit of less developed regions, as noted earlier). Consequently, ROP
projects do not necessarily contribute to the areas of highest value for money and do not always
generate the highest potential impact for their regions. Moreover, RDPs are generally ineffective due to
the following reasons: first, they tend to be vague, with too many priorities and objectives; second,
there is a lack of measurable targets and indicators for outcomes and impact; third, activities are not
always clearly linked to the objectives; fourth, RDPs are not mandatory to implement and there is no
system to monitor their progress; finally, the lack of a formal regional administrative tier implies that it
is hard to hold stakeholders accountable for reaching RDP goals and to ensure the much needed
coordination for successful project implementation. In some sense, project identification appears more
geared toward meeting ROP requirements rather than achieving actual development needs.

43.      As for the dedicated funds model (PA 1.1 for GPs and UDPs), investment guidance relies
primarily on the Integrated Development Plans developed by each city. The pre-determined funds
allocation may encourage planning and integration of investments by applicants. It is also good for
growth poles and urban development poles to have a project pipeline with guaranteed financing.
However, the pre-allocation of funds to each applicant creates incentives for delays in project
submission and lower-quality projects. The idea that money will wait for an applicant for the duration of
the ROP cycle (depending on the “n+2” or “n+3” rule) creates disincentives for quick submission of
project applications. Moreover, guaranteed financing of projects passing a certain threshold may make
applicants focus less on quality. At the same time, there has been a tendency for core cities to absorb
most of the available funding, without properly investing in surrounding localities. In fact, reaping the
benefits of concentrating investments in a few economic engines (i.e., growth poles and urban
development poles) depends on whether planners and local authorities use the funds to further
territorial integration and improve connectivity. But the current ROP selection model does little to
ensure that investments within metropolitan (functional urban areas) are truly integrated.

Project Development
44.     The Framework Document for Implementation (FDI) and the Applicant Guides (AGs) play key
roles in guiding project development, regardless of the applicable selection model. Both documents
are comprehensive and transparent. But when developing proposals, applicants generally tend to focus
more on how to get projects qualified for funding rather than on how to solve specific problems or
address communities’ needs.

Preliminary Screening
45.      Preliminary screening is absent from both the FIFO and the dedicated model. Regarding the
former, the Regional Committee for Strategic Evaluation and Correlation (RCSEC) used to screen projects
in each development region for strategic alignment to local needs, but the role of this body has become
limited due to several flaws in its design. The strategic screening by the RCSEC was conducted only after
the technical and financial evaluation of projects, so it was not a preliminary test per se, meaning that
some projects could go through the whole processing system before the RCSEC’s decision on whether
they should receive financing. The body also lacked: clear criteria and procedures for member selection;
a balanced structure for member composition; clear criteria and detailed procedures for strategic
prioritization. In this context, the RCSEC’s mandate was limited to a purely consultative role; in practice,
this meant that the committees would no longer be functional. Annex 4 provides a more detailed
analysis of RCSECs.


                                                                                                         31
46.     As for the dedicated model applicable to PA 1.1 for growth poles and urban development
poles, projects must be in the closed list attached to an Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) prepared
by each applicant. Generally, however, the IDPs were not well-prepared: problems were poorly defined
and not supported by clear evidence; there were also complicated strategic chains, meaning that it was
hard to transform strategies into actions; finally, as with RDPs, there is a lack of clear prioritization and
integration. Annex 5 is dedicated to a more complete analysis of IDPs and a full analysis of current
shortcomings is available in the IDP study, part of the World Bank’s Growth Poles assessment (2013).

47.     At the same time, coordination at this early stage, albeit of critical importance, is generally
lacking. For one, it is deficient among policymakers at central and local government levels. For example,
local governments in the West development region got funding from the ROP and completed the
modernization of some schools that were later closed by the Ministry of Education. Also, there is little
coordination among OPs and the projects they finance. A road funded under the ROP may be completed
on time and then the pipes underneath may need to be replaced as part of a project under OP
Environment. Such situations are relatively common across all regions in Romania, reflecting the need
for improved integrated planning.

48.      Last but not least, the use of indicators in planning and project development is either lacking
or of poor quality. Applicants are under the impression that the more they include in that section, the
higher the likelihood of their application getting approved. They can then be held responsible for
reaching these goals, even though sometimes they are completely unmeasurable or unrealistic. Instead,
applicants should be encouraged to select from a pre-defined list of indicators, aligned with program-
and axis-level targets. At a minimum, chosen indicators should abide by the “SMART” set of criteria:
specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-oriented. There is also a lack of consistent use of
output and performance indicators that can be used to screen relevant projects.

Formal Project Appraisal
49.     Internationally, there are different meanings and definitions of a prefeasibility study, but the
most common one is that it contains everything in a feasibility study except the level of certainty on
the parameters based on currently available data and estimates. The key issue is identifying major
missing data that need to be acquired and the main risks and design alternatives. Where projects are
more common, such as road rehabilitation work, then there may be no significant difference between a
prefeasibility and feasibility study. In Romania, all investment projects, independently of the financing
source, should have standard technical documentation, set by the Government Decision (GD) 28/2008.
Annex 8 provides further details on the content of prefeasibility and feasibility studies according to
Romanian regulations. The results for comparing this structure with the international practice are
summarized in the table below.

50.       The components of project appraisal in Romania, as defined by Government Decision (GD)
28/2008, are generally similar to international practice, but the major problem is that the quality of
the technical documentation submitted by applicants is general low. At one level, there is a lack of
needed in-house experts within local governments to prepare good projects. Contracting out all the
skills related to project preparation also proves to be problematic. For example, it took much time for
some RDA staff to train consultants hired to assess projects and the value of the training is often lost
because each project has a different consultant. At the same time, local governments lack the capacity
to verify the quality of technical documentation and, what is more, do not hold project verifiers
accountable for approving poor-quality outputs.

  Feasibility Study

51.     If internal capacity is low, high-performing external resources are also hard to access.
Available appraisal consultancy services vary greatly between large cities and small towns, which affects
the quality of the technical documentation. Large cities have a better access to good consultants
because there are simply more consultants with better qualifications available and large cities also have
a higher financial capacity for hiring them. In addition, the market is fairly opaque. There are no easy
ways to determine whether a consultant is good and many beneficiaries get stuck with poor services,
which is the reason behind two recommendation included in the report on ROP beneficiary assistance:
namely, the creation of a transparent, accessible platform for peer reviews of consulting services; and
the publication of the names of consulting firms corresponding to various projects financed by the ROP
by adding these data to the database of beneficiaries currently available on the MRDPA’s website.

52.       A related issue is the underfunding of project preparation costs, which is deeply tied to the
Eligible Expenses Order (EEO) and currently applicable public procurement norms.12 For the ROP, the
list of eligible expenses is defined through a common order (“the Eligible Expenses Order” – EEO) by the
Minister of Regional Development and Public Administration and the Minister of Finance.13 The current
EEO establishes a maximum cap of 5% for expenses related to project design and technical assistance
(Article 3), which has contributed to the low quality of technical documentation and construction work.

12
   The need for appropriate project preparation costs was discussed in more in-depth in the MA-IB Collaboration reports. It was
indicated there that making project preparation costs eligible for EU funding is critical in order to enhance absorption (e.g.
fewer preparation and implementation delays) and to improve impact (though better quality projects).
13
  See, for instance, “Monitorul Oficial al României,” No. 327, from May 11, 2011

                                                                                                                            33
International benchmarking suggests that this artificial cap should be eliminated or raised to at least
approximately 10% of the project’s value. In addition, procurement criteria are mainly based on the
“least cost” criterion and do not include strict standards on minimum qualifications of independent
evaluators. In theory, going beyond the lowest cost for selecting a winning bid is allowed, but in practice
beneficiaries note that the NARMPP has been reticent to accept technical criteria of selection. The
World Bank 2013 report on ROP 2.0: Facilitation of Proactive and Direct Support for Applicants and
Beneficiaries of the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020 goes into greater detail on these issues
and provides specific recommendations for improvement.

53.     Two additional factors influence the quality of technical documentation: first, the FIFO
selection model itself; and second, the failure to incorporate operation and maintenance (O&M)
costs. Under the FIFO rule, applicants rush to submit applications before funds are depleted, so some
projects are of minimum quality, just sufficient to pass the necessary threshold to obtain the financing.
Also, the sustainability of operation and maintenance expenditures is not always taken into account.
Local governments have a limited capacity to assess the impact of operational expenditures generated
by investment projects on the medium and long-term local budgets. There is also a weak capacity of the
local governments to support O&M needs because there is no multiyear local budgeting planning. For
their part, independent evaluators have had difficulties in assessing the real financial capacity of the
applicants and make the connection between financial statements and the actual budgetary situation.

54.      Finally, cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) are required but not relevant for all projects under the
current ROP, and their quality remains generally poor. According to the technical and financial
evaluation grids, all qualified projects must have an internal rate of return (IIR) equal to or above 5.5%
and the benefit-cost ratio equal to or above 1. This requires that all project applications must complete
a CBA, which exceeds both Romanian and EU standards that normally require that only projects of over
25 million EUR in the environment sector and of over 50 million EUR in other sectors have to complete a
CBA. For smaller projects, conducting a proper CBA can take up a significant share of the available
budget. At the same time, CBAs are particularly difficult to conduct for projects in the social, education,
and health sectors; more generally, the data that are often needed to justify assumptions are lacking or
remain hard to access by applicants. Furthermore, CBAs do not include alternatives and, given that both
the FIFO and the dedicated-funding selection models remain non-competitive, the tool itself is of limited
use since there is no prioritization of projects based on CBA results. In some cases, the results
themselves are manipulated to obtain the required ratio to get projects qualified for funding, and few
evaluators really question the calculations and the assumptions behind certain numbers. In principle,
CBAs for small projects should be substituted by a limited number of performance indicators of
outcome, cost-efficiency, and/or cost-effectiveness.


Independent Review of Appraisal
55.     Broadly speaking, the quality and duration of project evaluation depends on evaluation
procedures, evaluators, inputs from the application, and the evaluation criteria. In this sense, the
assessment of ROP project proposals is equivalent to the independent review of appraisal, as
understood within the World Bank PIM framework. The evaluation is done by IB staff and independent
evaluators, and eventually reviewed and approved by the MA. IB staff verifies the administrative
conformity and eligibility. Independent evaluators conduct the technical and financial evaluation. There
are detailed procedures with deadlines, evaluation criteria, evaluation grids, scoring guidelines, and
“audit tracks” (piste de audit). All these are prepared by the MA in consultation with IBs and can be
updated during the ROP implementation, if deemed necessary.

                                                                                                        34
Evaluation Procedures
56.     Regulations on evaluation procedures are detailed, transparent, and published in the
Applicant’s Guide. Therefore, all potential applicants know how their project applications will be
assessed, which is a positive feature of the system and one that should be maintained for the 2014-2020
programming period.

57.      At the same time, there have been significant delays in the evaluation process, as shown
earlier, particularly during the last few phases (technical project verification and contracting).It is true
that much time is lost in administrative arrangements between evaluation steps. For example, a report
by RDA West shows that the average duration for the evaluation process was 272 days, of which 136
days was spent at the MA level, 51 at the RDA, 8 days with independent evaluators, and 77 days with
applicants. This time lost due to administrative arrangements suggests that the further decentralization
of tasks is needed, in line with different project types and sizes (specifically, smaller, simpler projects
should be mostly handled by RDAs, with minimal MA involvement).Delays have also resulted from the
fact that in 2012 the MA could not contract evaluation firms for nearly one year because of NARMPP
concerns about selection criteria. The temporary solution was that the MA delegated this task to RDAs,
which could complete procurement procedures faster and with fewer constraints (per the smaller value
of the contracts put out for bidding). Last but not least, an issue that is widely covered by the “ROP 2.0:
MA-IB Collaboration and Beneficiary Support” reports is the system’s bureaucratization and heavy
reliance on hard-copy documentation. The switch to an e-ROP would generate significant benefits in
terms of lowering costs and increasing processing speed (i.e., reduced need for storage, easier filing and
retrieval, etc.).

Evaluators
58.     There is a lack of good quality evaluators due to the fact that procurement selection criteria
generally emphasize the least cost and lack standards to ensure quality evaluations. Procurement
contracts do not have criteria on minimum expertise and responsibility of evaluators. A complementary
solution for improving the quality of evaluations and holding evaluators accountable for their work
requires stronger contracts with proper incentives. For instance, some part of the payment could
depend on whether the project is successfully implemented and delivers the promised impact.
Unfortunately, there has not been a thorough, systematic analysis of the causes for why ROP projects
fail during implementation. Such a study would hopefully generate a set of clear standards for
evaluators, pointing to specific issues and flagging problematic areas. It would also enable an informal
appraisal of different evaluators, allowing the MA and the IBs to request first and foremost those who
have already demonstrated their competence, while possibly disqualifying evaluators who have made
grave errors in the past. A useful add-on to this recommendation would be to require all firms providing
evaluators to have professional insurance so that any mistakes resulting from evaluation can be properly
sanctioned and a sense of accountability can be fostered among all evaluators of ROP projects. Finally,
there are also complaints that consulting companies sometimes offer low daily fees and thus cannot
attract highly qualified evaluators. This is because the MA is not legally allowed to regulate a minimum
payment to evaluators in the procurement document.

Inputs from application
59.     The quality of project proposals/applications is generally low, as already noted in an earlier
section. The cause is the lack of internal capacity and the inability of some applicants to contract
qualified external experts and hold them accountable for results. Lower-quality applications also imply
more work at the MA/IB level, as many clarifications are often needed to complete the project’s file with

                                                                                                         35
all the required documents, ensure that objectives and timelines are clear and feasible, and generally
reach a point where the proposal can be properly evaluated. One idea is to have simpler procedures for
applicants to update or correct errors or add missing documents to an application, as long as deadlines
are upheld and there are no major changes to the core project objectives and activities.

Evaluation Criteria
60.       The selection process has resulted in a rejection rate of 35% (as of June 14, 2013), which
means that roughly a third of the proposals fail. The highest rejections rates are in PA 4.1 (business
support structures) at 59%, PA 5.2 (tourism infrastructure) at 45%, and PA 4.3 (micro-business support)
at 41%. The breakdown of rejection rates between various phases (e.g., between the first stage of
eligibility and administrative conformity screening and the second stage of selection based on the
technical and financial evaluation) was not available.

61.       One general issue is that the evaluation criteria are not linked to regional development
strategies, but only to overall ROP program objectives. The criteria for administrative conformity and
eligibility verification and for technical and financial evaluation differ among priority axes/key areas of
intervention, but not among regions.

62.       During the first stage of eligibility and administrative conformity screening, the main problem
is related to demonstrating applicants’ ownership, especially through cadaster documents. RDA
officials noted problems with confirming the legal ownership of land and infrastructure, which has been
a major cause for rejection of applications at this stage. Another problem is generated by some overlap
in the criteria used for the eligibility verification and for the technical and financial evaluation, namely
those referring to equality of opportunity, environmental protection, energy efficiency, and public
procurement.

63.    A first area of assessment in the evaluation grids refers to a project’s relevance and
importance – or, put differently, its contribution to reaching ROP targets.
     Strategic screening or contribution of the project to the realization of the ROP goals: For
       regional or urban integrated development projects, there is a lack of sector performance
       indicators for each priority axis to allow for objective screening and evaluation of projects. These
       indicators should be used in screening whether this is in the context of pre-screening of large
       integrated projects (as discussed further below), or in the context of implicit screening through
       points awarded for features of sector-specific urban or local projects. Where applicable, projects
       should be identified in the context of regional development strategies and plans, urban
       development plans, or other sector plans. For example, a specific road project should be
       included in a road development or rehabilitation plan of a particular local/county
       administration, so that the priority of the particular road segment proposed for financing can be
       assessed against that broader strategic framework. The selection of projects to be included in a
       plan should be prioritized in term of the same sets of performance indicators that are used to
       subsequently screen, evaluate, and select projects. Currently, there is no assessment of how a
       project aligns with regional development strategies and plans. Such an assessment would also
       increase the relevance of RDPs and enable greater collaboration and ownership among actors
       involved in the plan’s implementation.
       Importance of the project to the region: The importance of the project is currently assessed by
        an economic CBA criterion based on a discount rate of 5.5%. However, decision-makers may
        consider dropping this, as it is difficult and costly to conduct CBAs in the case of public sector

                                                                                                         36
        health, education, and transportation projects, as well as for a whole range of smaller-size
        investments. Furthermore, the results of a CBA can be manipulated to meet or beat the
        threshold and it is difficult for an evaluator to audit the quality of a CBA without significant
        effort. This evaluation of the quality of any CBA bottom line estimate of net benefits is also
        made more difficult by the lack of detailed guidelines on how to perform an adequate financial
        and economic CBA for specific types of projects. An alternative would be to maintain the CBA,
        particularly for larger projects, while training applicants and holding evaluators accountable for
        assessing CBAs and validating applicants’ assumptions behind the numbers. Finally, the financial
        evaluation of projects is a good feature. However, private and public-sector projects should be
        assessed somewhat differently: for the former, the focus should be on financial feasibility, while
        for the latter it should be based on the need for grant and budget support to achieve viability
        and sustainability (including consideration of O&M costs).
       Project benefits based on technical design: Currently, the quality of the technical solution is
        evaluated separately from the benefits or importance of the project. But, in many cases, the
        actual benefits expected to be derived will depend upon the exact nature of the technical
        solution. For example, for road rehabilitation or improvement projects, the increased speeds of
        traffic flow (or reduced travel times) (Criterion 1.3 for PA 2.1) and the gains in road safety
        (Criterion 1.2 for PA 2.1) depend upon the types of design features of the road included in the
        proposed project. Specifically, the nature of improvements in a particular road (surface, quality,
        camber, width, lane structure and markings, etc.) needs to be assessed first and only then
        should the scores be assigned for expected gains in travel time and safety.


64.     A second area of assessment of selection criteria covers the quality, maturity, and
sustainability of a project. The following four observations stand out:
     Documentation coherence: This criterion is relevant, but the actual method for how the
        documents and data are evaluated should be adjusted. Currently, this criterion focuses on
        whether: the data are sufficient, accurate, and justified; the analysis of alternatives is
        comprehensive; there are realistic operating cost estimates and assumptions related to
        commitments; the corrections (related to externalities and fiscal costs) are correctly applied in
        the economic analysis; the estimates (general and itemized) are clear, comprehensive, and
        realistic; and the design is complete and aligned with the written portion of the application.
        Going forward, it is recommended that this criterion focus on assessing the coherence among
        the Application Form (AF) and its supporting documents, and the technical documentation (e.g.,
        pre-feasibility/feasibility studies). Any changes to the main documents should be finalized at this
        stage to avoid adjustments – and possible penalties/corrections – during the stage of detailed
        technical design or worse, later on, during implementation.
       Relevance and quality of the technical solution: Currently, this criterion is analyzed in terms of
        technical documents’ correlation and completion. It is recommended that the analysis
        concentrate on the proposed technical solution and its alignment with available sustainable and
        innovative solutions. The technical solutions should focus on the material and financial
        requirements for maintenance and operations over the future, and avoid merely replicating old,
        outdated designs. As proposed later in this report, as well as in the “ROP 2.0: MA-IB
        Collaboration and Beneficiary Support” reports, the evaluation of technical solutions by an
        expert should include feedback on ways to improve the technical aspects of the project. In
        addition to a field visit, this may also require granting bonus points to applications that have
        already identified improved solutions that are known to be cost-effective in specified

                                                                                                        37
          circumstances (e.g., types of road rehabilitations suitable for major urban roads versus minor
          urban roads versus major intercity highways versus minor rural roads). Extra points could also
          be available for other innovations that are expected to be cost-effective over the long run, with
          clear guidelines for evaluators on how to grant these additional rewards.
         Capacity to implement projects: The current criteria focus on the technical and staffing capacity
          of an applicant organization to implement and manage a project over its life cycle. There is also
          a focus on the adequacy of the budget plus grants to cover both the ineligible and eligible costs
          of the investment. These are all positive features that should be maintained. The one area for
          improvement relates to giving proper consideration to operation and maintenance (O&M) costs
          to ensure continued service delivery over an investment’s lifecycle. In the case of private
          commercial projects, a business plan is required and should include a clear reasoning for why
          the project is financially feasible over a specified time horizon based on the net present value of
          projected cash flows. In the case of public sector projects, the cash flows costs of operations and
          maintenance over a specified time horizon need to be identified and the source of the available
          funds demonstrated. For example, the public entity needs to show that it can currently fund the
          operation and maintenance of its existing investments and is either running fiscal surpluses or is
          expected to have revenue growth or expenditure savings in future years to cover the added
          costs required to sustain a proposed investment. Chapters VIII and X provide further details
          related to this point.

65.     All in all, there is a lack of differentiation of evaluation procedures and criteria applicable to
different project types and sizes. Smaller projects should go through more straightforward evaluation
procedures and less demanding criteria to avoid unnecessary burdens and delays in selection and
contracting. Larger investments need more rigorous strategic screening and quality check to ensure
their effectiveness and to avoid delays in implementation due to errors in project preparation and
design.


Project Selection, Detailed Technical Design, and Budgeting

Project Selection
66.      A project’s actual selection in the 2007 – 2013 ROP occurs when the MA decides whether a
particular proposal gets funded. At this stage, the MA approves or rejects applications based on one
clearly established criterion: a project with an overall score equal to or greater than 3.5 out of 6 points
total for the technical and financial evaluation qualifies for ROP co-financing. Importantly, the current
selection process is non-competitive, i.e., projects are not compared nor compete against one another
based on their relative quality. The non-competitive selection has both advantages and disadvantages,
as noted below.

67.       On the one hand, the non-competitive selection has the following advantages:
         It helped reduce outside interference with project selection by minimizing political bargaining
          over project portfolios. No project entered the selection stage without proper evaluation and no
          application was approved if it failed to pass the agreed 3.5 threshold.
         In the absence of clear and effective regional development strategies and plans, the non-
          competitive selection was suitable for non-strategic projects because there was no pressing
          need to compare them against one another in terms of their impact.


                                                                                                          38
         It helped with the rapid, efficient selection of small projects where the competition in terms of
          relative quality is not cost-effective. Because of self-imposed constraints, the ROP has funded
          projects under 20 million EUR. Moreover, the ROP has many priority axes and key areas of
          intervention, and thus financial resources are divided into small fixed amounts. The existing 13
          PAs/KAIs within 8 development regions have resulted in 104 fixed small allocations.
         The non-competitive selection avoided deadlines in project submission and evaluation, which
          facilitated central management of human resources by reducing the variance in workload and
          minimizing the risk of over-burdening capacity during peak demand. It also reduced the
          selection workload by avoiding comparison among projects, i.e., the same evaluators did not
          have to review the full batch of proposals to compare them against each other.
         It speeded up project applications by allowing projects to be selected on a first-in-first-out (FIFO)
          basis. This was suitable for getting ready-to-go projects closer to implementation more quickly.
          These are the projects that were already prepared before the launch of the 2007 – 2013 ROP,
          partially through the PHARE pre-accession program. Increased speed also resulted from
          incentivizing applicants to send their proposals before funds were at risk of depletion.
         This selection type also gave priority, in some ways, to the applicants who were most proactive,
          engaged, and efficient, ceteris paribus. In other words, for projects of equal complexity and time
          needed for preparing the application, the beneficiaries who moved faster got funding first.

68.       On the other hand, the non-competitive selection has the following disadvantages:
         It did not allow for a selection of projects based on regional development priorities, which
          limited the effectiveness and impact of the ROP. This is because the selection did not compare
          projects against one another in terms of alignment with regional development goals. Moreover,
          the technical and financial evaluation criteria did not include points for fit with regional strategic
          priorities.
         The model did not ensure the highest value for money of funded investments, which limited the
          efficiency and impact of the ROP. This is because the selection did not compare projects against
          one another, meaning that, in principle, a project of lower impact and quality could get funded
          at the expense of better ones coming through the pipeline later on, simply because the former
          submitted the application before the latter. This scenario is particularly likely given that lower-
          quality, lower-impact projects tend to take less time to prepare and submit.
         Projects were only required to pass a relatively low threshold (i.e., 3.5 out of 6 points), so the
          key differentiating criterion was often the duration of putting together an application. As such,
          there were few incentives to submit high-quality projects. Actually, projects rushed into
          application submission were often of low quality due to a higher risk of errors and weaker
          technical solutions. Consequently, the current ROP has funded a relatively large number of small
          projects of lower quality, which slowed down the effectiveness and efficiency of the selection
          process, and caused delays and other issues in later stages, including project design and
          implementation.

Detailed Technical Design
69.     After projects are approved for funding, they enter into the detailed technical design (DTD)
stage, also called “the Technical Project.” The applicant is required to prepare the DTD within a
maximum of six months and then submit it to an IB for verification, including site visits. There have been
delays in DTD completion due to the low quality of projects at the feasibility study stage. The quality of
DTDs is also generally low, which has caused further delays in project implementation, slowing down the
ROP’s absorption rate. The low quality of DTDs is due to a number of reasons. First, there is a shortage


                                                                                                             39
of highly qualified designers (civil engineers). Second, designers are not held accountable for design
flaws, although increasingly beneficiaries have learned to draft stronger contracts that penalize mistakes
by designers, including by requiring professional insurance schemes. Third, local governments generally
lack in-house technical capacity to verify the quality of a DTD, and “project verifiers” (external technical
experts) who are supposed to be contracted by the beneficiaries themselves are often paid by the
designers, so they have little incentive to perform a thorough review. For their part, evaluators typically
check only the administrative conformity of the DTD.

Budgeting
70.     After the DTD’s verification, the financing contract is prepared and signed by the MA, the IB,
and the ROP beneficiary. The MA has had the good practice of over-contracting available funds for
particular axes or KAIs. The total value of funded projects can exceed available funds by up to 20%. This
is because there is a high probability of savings/corrections during the implementation of projects. The
adjustments come from financial corrections, non-spent project budgets, and under-contracted
procurement.

71.      As another area for improvement, it is worth noting that the budget for each project is
typically too detailed, using segmented quantities of materials and prices (“indicatoare de norme de
deviz”) versus the more common consolidated items (“articole comasate”). This, together with
generally low quality DTDs, has resulted in too many budget amendments during the project
implementation phase, along with frictions between project beneficiaries and their contractors, which
caused further delays in project completion and slowed down the absorption rates for the ROP. The
“ROP 2.0: Beneficiary Support Mechanisms” report discusses this issue in greater detail.




                                                                                                         40
IV. ROP Practices in Select EU Countries

72.      As part of the current study, several EU Member States – Germany, Poland, Estonia, Italy,
Slovenia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Lithuania – were chosen for the purpose of reviewing
comparable models for project selection and summarizing best practices and replicable lessons for
Romania. These countries were selected because of various reasons: (1) they have a good absorption
rate and are among the star performers among new Member States (e.g., Estonia, Lithuania, Poland,
and Slovenia); (2) like the ROP, they have well-developed programs targeted at cities (e.g., Italy, Poland);
or (3) they use innovative approaches to project selection (e.g., Germany). The UK was chosen because
its project identification, appraisal, and selection tools within the overall PIM system are often
considered to represent international good practice. Ireland has been a long-term beneficiary of EU
funding, is regarded as a star performer, and it has used the opportunity to consistently improve its PIM
system, enabling it to take greater advantage of opportunities available. It is also consistently
referenced as a success story for its recent, enduring growth and speedy recovery after the crisis.

73.     The purpose of this case study analysis is to do a wide sweep of available models within the
EU and identify lessons and best practices that may be applied in Romania. The idea is not to patch
together proposals and recommendations from models used by other countries, but to identify
solutions that are more efficient and better suited for the Romanian Regional Operational Programme.
For example, most of these countries have project selection models that are much simpler and more
streamlined than in the case of Romania. They also provide examples of how more strategic and
impactful projects could be selected.



                                                                                                               41
74.      Individual case studies are discussed in more detail in Annex 10. To the extent possible, a
similar analysis structure was followed for all case studies, although data availability in some countries
did not always permit this. A synthesis discussion on these case studies is included below and references
to these case studies are made throughout the rest of the report. Annex 25 includes an interesting
analysis on the new European Commission requirements regarding project selection for the 2014-2020
Programming Period.

Synthesis of Case Studies
75.     One of the first things to notice from these case studies is the fact that all countries analyzed
here take different approaches for selecting EU funded projects. There are as many evaluation and
selection systems as there are countries. There are, however, many common points as well. For
example, most analyzed countries use a combination of competitively selected projects, pre-selected
projects, or projects selected on a first-come-first-serve basis. Some countries, such as Lithuania or
Poland, have leaned stronger toward pre-allocation and a focus on strategic projects, whereas countries
like Germany or Slovenia place more value on competitive selection. It is important to note that
strategic frameworks (at the level of geographies or sectors) are in several cases a defining feature of
the selection model, notably in Italy (Lazio), Poland (Śląskie) and the UK (Wales). All of them provide
lessons regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of project selection models that could be useful for
Romania as it plans the next programming period.

76.     Another thing to note is that Member States have different priorities for funding and this is
reflected in the make-up of what comprises the Operational Programs (OP) within each NSRF. For
example, in Ireland, environment projects are included in the ROP, whereas in Romania there is a
separate OP Environment. In Slovenia, the OP Environment also includes Transport. And Lithuania does
not have an ROP at all, due to its relatively small size, as explained earlier. Therefore, true “apples to
apples” comparison is almost impossible. The paragraphs below cover the most relevant themes
emerging from this comparative assessment.

Project Size and Relevance to PIM
77.      The relevance of the PIM approach varies when it comes to the different selection models and
project types under review. In most cases, there is a close thematic link with the activities undertaken
under the Romanian ROP, notably regarding major (pre-selected) projects in the field of urban
development and infrastructure investments. However, some activities within programs, such as
training initiatives or business support, would certainly fall outside the scope of what might normally be
defined as PIM, and can be more properly considered to be service contracts requiring advanced skills in
procurement practices. Much of the contemporary PIM lexicon such as the ‘PIM eight must-have
framework’ does not fit comfortably with these small-scale activities given that it refers to processes
that are more commonly deployed on major projects. This is also why, for the purpose of this study, the
PIM framework has been adapted to fit the specific context of the Romanian ROP.

78.      Regardless of project size, ultimately the same basic principles apply: need and justification,
objective setting in outcome terms/measurable indicators of success, option appraisal, and a
comparative selection methodology. In fact, it should be noted that the UK government’s Green Book,
which is commonly thought to refer to capital projects alone, actually refers to all spending decisions by
government departments. The caveat is that, simply put, smaller-size projects should go through
simplified procedures. In particular, running a required Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) would be an
unnecessary burden for all but the larger projects. Given the often highly devolved nature of spending

                                                                                                       42
EU funds (except Estonia, Lithuania, and Slovenia), the skills and capacity needed for complex appraisals
would be either missing or relatively expensive to hire on a consultancy basis, as the example of the
2007-2013 ROP has shown.

79.     The most common form of value assessment in smaller projects is cost effectiveness,
ultimately tested through a free and open procurement process. There have been significant
challenges in this area in the Romanian context, but the country is not at all an exception. For example,
in a report commissioned by the European Commission in 2012 regarding Lithuania’s use of Structural
Funds, the authors stated: “The public procurement process remains the main risk factor for the
financial implementation of OPs.”14 It should be stressed that, in the case of these smaller projects, the
phrase “procurement practices” does not refer only to the administrative process of tendering, but
should specifically include the careful alignment of objectives and outcomes, and contribution to the
option appraisal. A useful indicator of how many interventions using EU funds are major public works
versus smaller projects is to investigate how many were awarded as “works contracts” and how many
were “service contracts.”

Evolution not Revolution
80.     It should be noted that whereas the UK’s modern PIM system has evolved over at least 30
years and Ireland’s over around 20 years, and other countries (e.g., Germany, Italy) also have well-
established project selection systems, Romania’s PIM system is still in an early development stage.
The need for reform has been recognized through a series of interventions, not least of which is the
current engagement with the World Bank. That said, many of the basic components of a modern PIM
system (with some notable exceptions such as performance-based ex-post evaluation) are already in
place in Romania. This begs the question: why is the system not working as efficiently as in other
countries, particularly Lithuania and Poland that have had more or less the same reform lead time as
Romania, but have performed much better in terms of funds absorption? The portfolio of projects
within the World Bank’s Romania Regional Development Program, along with other technical assistance
work (including, recently, for the Ministry of European Funds, the World Bank report on “Improving the
National Framework for Preparing and Implementing Public Investment Projects”), seeks to provide
answers and solutions to precisely this issue.

Motivations behind State-Budget-Funded PIM Projects vs. EU-Funded Projects
81.     The motivations behind projects differ depending on the source of funding (i.e., EU vs. state
budget). There is one important reason for this: at least in Member States that recently joined the EU,
nationally funded PIM projects often have to compete for funding – there are more projects than funds.
However, the persistently slow absorption of EU Structural Funds by (newer) Member States suggests
that there are sometimes more funds than readily achievable projects. This might suggest that the
competitive tension between projects competing for limited funds that should drive quality in project
appraisal and selection might not be as effective in EU-funded projects. Applicant behavior is also likely
to be distorted when the driving motivator is to “absorb” funds (see below).

Short-Term Measurement of Success
82.     The capacity to deliver or ‘readiness to go’ appears to be a key determinant in selecting
projects. For example, in the case of Wales (UK), one of only two high-level selection indicators is known
as “Certainty Factors.” For the 2014-20 period, Welsh authorities consider to identify key ‘backbone’

projects to ensure certainty, but with scope to select more innovative and risky projects later in the
period. In the Italian region of Lazio, a higher score is assigned to Local Development Plans that include
projects with available or expected authorizations and certificates. This might be seen, on the one hand,
to be a sensible measure to ensure that good projects that may incur potential delays (e.g., permits,
land acquisition) do not crowd out other projects. On the other hand, this may also motivate officials to
approve projects that broadly fit the criteria in order to improve the seemingly all-important absorption
rate, as argued in greater depth below. Generally, short- or long-term indicators can be used to measure
success. During a program period – of whatever source, EU, national-budget, or otherwise – the most
common short-term performance measures are “on time” and “on budget.” While these are important
considerations, of more significance is the longer-term measure of success: Did the project achieve its
intended goals? Or, more realistically: To what extent did the project achieve its intended goals? For
projects under implementation during a program period, those questions remain to be answered until
an ex-post performance evaluation can be conducted based on a suitable period of stable operation or
even after the completion of the operation. Therefore, the EU uses absorption rate as a form of on-time,
on-budget measure to assess short-term achievements.

83.      Absorption and impact are not the same. While in the short term a country program with an
absorption rate of 40% might be seen as a poor performer relative to another country with a 50%
absorption rate, a longer-term measure might show that the 40% was invested more wisely than the
50%. Caution should therefore be exercised in exaggerating the importance of absorption as a measure
of success. The rush to spend before the money tap is turned off at the end of a programming period is
clearly a risk factor in considering how well public money is invested. But the potential for distortion in
the selection criteria because of this incentive structure, along with associated behavioral dynamics,
should also be carefully considered. As of now, there is no readily identifiable correlation between the
quality of public investment systems and the rate of absorption of EU Funds.

Initiative Overload?
84.      Notable in the Operational Programmes looked at in this study is an overwhelming array of
policy initiatives, both at an EU and national levels. Correlation is challenging, if not impossible. Also,
the high number of programs may act as a deterrent to would-be applicants and cause delays by those
who prepare projects so that they can adjust them in order to “tick the boxes.” The question should be
considered: Do too many policy initiatives ultimately choke-up project preparation and encourage a
culture of box ticking in order to improve the chances of selection? As a case in point, below is a list of
policy initiatives mentioned in the policy context in one of the Irish ROPs – and Romania faces a similarly
long list for 2014-2020:15

In less centralized settings such as the UK and Ireland, this is not a major issue but can still be seen as an
obstacle to overcome. Alignment with policies may also be used in the scoring / selection grids, although
the degree of alignment with policies is more important than full compliance on every count.

85.     It is important to note that project selection is not always particularly closely linked to
strategic objectives and that identifying strategic projects of high quality is not always an easy task.
Looking at individual case studies, the competitive call approach used in Nordrhein-Westfalen has not
allowed for sufficiently strong strategic alignment – it has been recommended that criteria should
already be defined at the planning stage in order to make them more strategic. In other cases, targeted
project selection can be hampered by objectives that are not clearly defined; also, the hierarchy of
strategic documents is not always obvious (e.g., Estonia). In the case of Wales, it was found to be
challenging to implement strategic targeting without becoming too prescriptive; and equally
problematic was to find a balance between eligibility and strategic criteria. There is therefore scope to
select more strategic projects no matter which selection approach is used.

Top-Down, Bottom-Up
86.      These policy initiatives and other high level strategies such as the Lisbon Agenda, as well as
national government policies, can incentivize potential beneficiaries to look for projects that fit the
bill. While some notable major projects such as roads or broadband infrastructure can be readily
identified as national or regional priorities, many of the smaller projects take time to move through
various stages of the process (from concept to implementation and post-implementation) due to the
often bewildering web of interwoven policies. Therefore, good communications and, in particular,
strong stakeholder consultation regarding the opportunities available and the strategies which they
must address, are key for guiding potential beneficiaries. What follows is a strong bottom-up approach
to project identification. It might be reasonable to assume that although stakeholder consultations can
add time to the process, they can ultimately lead to better targeted and more relevant projects. This
reasoning might not be as obvious in some countries where the pressure to absorb the funds is the
dominant influence.

87.      Across the EU, there appears to be a strong desire to delegate responsibility for project
selection and implementation to local bodies. Spain is a typical example in that it devolves around 66%
of capital expenditure to subnational bodies. Germany and Italy take a similar approach based on the
decentralized management and implementation of Structural Funds programs. Even in the UK, where
devolved capital expenditure is less notable, there is practically no involvement from any department of
the central government in any of the decision-making regarding the identification, appraisal, and
selection of projects financed from structural funds. Matching funds also come from devolved budgets.
In Ireland, despite its relatively small size, other than nationally significant projects, the identification,
appraisal, and selection are entirely the responsibility of a devolved regional body with the national

                                                                                                           45
government taking almost no role other than laying down the strategy and ensuring legality in the way
the money is spent. Therefore, the institutional distance between a particular problem and the
proposed solution is a short one, an argument that is often made in favor of decentralization (including
in Romania in the context of the government’s regionalization initiative). Poland has already taken steps
toward greater regionalization with delegating the management of ERDF OPs to the regions, although
the center still retains a significant degree of control. The exceptions to this observed norm in case study
countries are Estonia, Lithuania (with the highest rate of absorption) and Slovenia, but the small size of
the countries makes them more analogous to a region in any case.

88.      In the case of Lithuania, a top-down approach is more common. 75% of funds are targeted at
state and regional projects contained in national strategy documents. Other funding areas with a top-
down approach to project identification demonstrate how easy it is to weaken the link between
objectives and desired outcomes. For example, some 10% of the funds are targeted at R&D, despite the
fact there is no institution (such as a National Research Council) with the required competencies to
grant such funds on an objective basis. None of the local universities or institutes scores well in
international rankings. This raises the question: are some priorities selected in order to achieve a certain
input-based target, such as “amount of money spent on R&D,” rather than on the effectiveness of the
program itself, expressed in outcomes/impact? If the priorities are overstated in a way that diminishes
the possibility to properly appraise and implement them, this may imply that the projects proposed: are
likely to be fewer in number; are likely to be weaker due to the lack of capacity to review and challenge
them; and/or are likely to be weaker due to the pressure to select inadequate projects to meet an
otherwise artificial or unrealistic target.

89.      Lithuania also shows a keen tendency to rely on projects with dedicated, pre-allocated
funding. In early 2007, the Lithuanian government had already pre-approved the implementation of
some public projects whose planned expenditures would be reimbursed from structural funds. 65 such
projects were in the implementation phase and two projects (the development of the Vilnius and
Palanga airports) were already completed by 2008. This shows the willingness of the Lithuanian
Government to begin using new EU assistance as soon as possible and it is has probably been a factor in
its high absorption rate to date. In 2007-13, a large share of EU funds has been used strategically for pre-
selected state and regional projects. This is in sharp contrast to the previous programming period, when
almost all assistance was considered “opportunity financing” available to many types of applicants
through open calls for proposals. This shift from opportunity financing to strategic delivery entails the
risk of politicization at various levels and requires strong delivery bodies in the public sector. In order to
respond to this new challenge, the Lithuanian authorities created a Central Project Management
Agency.

Simplifying Appraisal and Selection Techniques
90.      There are different approaches to project selection in terms of involved procedures and
criteria. Weighting and scoring techniques are, for example, used in the German Land of Nordrhein-
Westfalen, Estonia, and Slovenia. In the Polish Śląskie Voivodship and the Italian Lazio region, projects
are selected following mainstream procedures after they are “pre-identified” in the framework of urban
development strategies. The systems usually involve several categories of criteria (program-level,
priority-level, measure-level and, if applicable, call-specific). If projects achieve the same scores, they
can be further prioritized in line with domestic objectives (e.g., in Estonia, preference is given to the
project that receives the highest score for impact on the relevant measure objective; in Nordrhein-
Westfalen, the project with the best score for sustainable development wins, etc.). Care needs to be


                                                                                                           46
taken that the complexity of the appraisal system is kept as low as possible, in order for criteria to be
properly applied. Put differently, the system should not be and it should not feel “over-engineered.”

91.      The World Bank Working Paper No. 161, which discusses PIM in new Member States, argues
that “the quality of project appraisal practices is difficult to assess accurately.” 16 The current
assessment confirms this view. Of the countries analyzed, only the UK and Ireland have clear,
transparent, nationally applicable, and consistently applied appraisal guidelines. With the exception of
Lithuania, the actual selection of projects is most often left to local authorities, including the choice of
selection criteria. There appear to be two broad categories of selection criteria in use: the capacity of a
project proposal to contribute to the achievement of strategic objectives or policy initiatives; and the
degree to which the project is ready to be implemented. As Working Paper 161 found, it is unclear what
impact the use of various selection tools has on the actual choices made – they still leave plenty of room
for discretion.17

92.      Some countries apply different selection criteria for various project categories in the program.
In Poland, strategic and administrative criteria (including drafting necessary documentation and the
readiness for implementation) are identical for all potential beneficiaries of a given type of project. This
means that selection criteria will differ from program to program and from priority area to priority area,
but the rules within each category will be the same. While this allows the possibility of targeting precise
criteria to meet specific requirements and objectives, it reduces overall transparency. Poland is also one
of the countries that encourage a competitive approach to projects through calls for proposals with pre-
announced criteria. Such exercises are highly comparable to procurement competitions and the skills
required to run them effectively are similar. It should be stressed that this refers to the “good practice”
interpretation of procurement rather than the heavily administrative-focused version practiced in
Romania.

93.      Wales offers one of the more interesting ideas for selection good practice. Since it also
operates a competitive-based call for projects (except for the larger, pre-identified infrastructure
projects), it finds that it has more proposals than funds, therefore a more managed system is used to
guide proposals through the process, starting with informal discussions between the interested
applicant and the MA. This can be useful in terms of ensuring that projects are first of all of general
interest and that they are prepared in a high-quality, compliant manner. Support is provided throughout
the process by the MA, which has created a position called the “Priority Controller” – an official whose
job is to prioritize and rank proposals using a relatively simple selection matrix that allows for assigning a
numerical score. Priorities can be ranked before a final decision, reducing the risk of interference.

The challenge to achieve both absorption and effectiveness
94.      Ensuring absorption requires active management through a range of possible techniques.
Examples include a two-stage (pre-qualification-type) procedure applied in the German Land of
Nordrhein-Westfalen, the Polish Śląskie Voivodship, the Italian Lazio region, and (as an option) in
Estonia. This helps target interventions better and can lead to time-savings later in the project cycle,
although care has to be taken that this does not become a cumbersome and time-consuming process (a
one-stage procedure may be preferable for small projects or certain target groups, e.g., SMEs). Also, it is
crucial to avoid overlap between the initial and the full assessment stages, making sure that nothing is

missed out that might jeopardize project selection / contracting at a later stage. There are also examples
of using sanctions, for example in Śląskie where unused funding was to be reallocated to other project
types, or of rewarding performance by setting aside a reserve for the best-performing Local
Development Plans in the Italian Lazio region. In general, there is often a negative correlation between
absorption and effectiveness, with high-impact projects often having long lead-times (e.g., Śląskie).

95.      A crucial aspect in enhancing program effectiveness is linked to the quality of regional
strategies. As discussed, a number of case study regions under review work in a federal / decentralized
administrative setting (Germany, Italy, UK) or at least with a decentralized Structural Funds
management (Poland), which means that their domestic strategies and OPs usually capture regional
priorities and needs. Additional efforts to enhance coherence have been made in Śląskie (pre-selected
projects for integrated urban development were found to have been more effective than other project
selection approaches) and Lazio (where there has been a strong link between Local Development Plans
and OP objectives).

96.     Lastly, it is important to note that none of the countries analyzed have identified “perfect”
evaluation and selection systems, and many face difficulties in the management of EU funds even
after many years of experience. While there are no silver bullets, there is always scope for
improvement, even if systems and procedures work smoothly. Also, in order to introduce or apply
certain approaches or criteria the necessary pre-conditions need to be met in order for them to be
successful.

Recommendations on EU Good Practices Relevant for Romania
97.     Romania needs to perform better than in the 2007-2013 funding period if it wants to increase
effective spending of structural funds and, at a minimum, get closer to the EU average absorption for
2014-2020. However, political pressure from Brussels to improve its poor absorption rate will
undoubtedly translate into some temptations to rush into projects that appear to be good options
simply because they are “ready to go.” Classic effects of this include unqualified assumptions in the
appraisal and the deferral of issues until the implementation phase. As argued repeatedly throughout
this report, effective public spending is not necessarily the same as effective public investment.
Adequate management controls with appropriate capacity to understand and implement them are the
best way to prevent abuses.

98.      There are a number of areas for improvement to the system of identifying, appraising, and
selecting projects that can be drawn directly from the practices of better performing EU Member
States. Although these can be mimicked in guidance, policy, and through regulation, they may amount
to very little in substance if the implementing capacity is sufficient. The following recommendations are
important to highlight:
     Assess the nature of the projects in existing and future OPs – selection procedures will need to
         be appropriate to the nature of the intervention. It has become clear that there are essentially
         two types of interventions financed by structural funds:
              o The first type can be referred to as PIM-style projects: infrastructure-based projects that
                   require prefeasibility studies and feasibility studies and need to address complex issues
                   such as construction permits, environmental permits, land acquisition, and the like.
                   They also need complex financial and economic appraisals. They can take years to
                   develop, followed by a similarly lengthy period of implementation. Contractual and
                   payment conditions can also be complex. The entire process requires a skill set that is

                                                                                                         48
            not always found in public administration. The projects are often pre-identified at a
            national or regional level and EU funding offers an affordable way to implement them.

        o   The second type of intervention, typically involving a much larger number of projects,
            can be referred to as service contracts. These are projects that are more short-term and
            typically smaller in value (e.g., sometimes under 10,000 USD). They are much more
            likely to be based on an opportunity funding model where public authorities issue a call
            for proposals based on certain criteria. The respondents are generally smaller entities
            without the skills to engage in complex exercises, and therefore require close support in
            order for them to fully understand and comply with (ideally, simpler) regulations.

   The selection methodology should be more aligned with the nature of envisaged projects, i.e.,
    PIM-style investments or service contracts. Larger projects should be subject to a CBA
    appraisal, while smaller ones should rely more on cost effectiveness assessment. It therefore
    becomes difficult to compare, contrast, and therefore prioritize between the two types of
    projects. A way of comparing the relative values of all projects, regardless of their type, would
    be useful.

   The nature of the institutions that support different types of interventions needs to be
    carefully considered. The skills required, although complementary, are quite different. The
    Romanian Government needs to consider options for achieving this significant capacity
    improvement. Selection techniques are only as good as the capacity to implement them. Some
    of the options for accomplishing these goals are discussed at the end of this section.

   The overwhelming tendency is to delegate identification and preparation of projects to
    regional bodies. The institutional distance between problems and solutions is thus becoming
    shorter. Regional or local bodies are much more aware of the issues they face than distant
    central institutions. Projects initiated and developed at the local level are far more likely to have
    relevance and win the support of local beneficiaries and affected citizens than those promoted
    by centralized bodies. Having said that, regional and local entities need technical support to
    enable them to achieve their projects. Again, some of the options to do this are discussed
    below.

   Romania should put project achievability at the heart of the appraisal and selection process.
    The Bank’s May 2013 Report, “Romania - Improving the National Framework for Preparing and
    Implementing Public Investment Projects,” identified this as an issue to be addressed and
    further pointed out that those charged with reviewing and challenging proposals seem to not
    take the issue seriously enough. The Gateway Review system in the UK shows that this
    consideration is core to the appraisal process itself, rather than a separate issue to be dealt with
    in the run-up to implementation or even further down the road. However, this can be a double-
    edged sword: on the one hand, it might be seen as a tool for rushing through projects that are
    easy to achieve but are of little value; on the other hand, when done within the context of a fully
    effective system, good projects should be assessed to check whether the necessary permits,
    licenses, approvals, governance arrangements, and skills are in place in order so that the
    project, if approved, can proceed smoothly.

   The Romanian Government should also review the number of policies and initiatives that
    require compliance with in order to make a proposal acceptable. It should focus on essentials.

                                                                                                      49
    Also, there should not be pass/fail indicators, but the degree of compliance should be assessed
    and used as part of an appraisal and selection methodology. At the same time, policy initiative
    overload should be avoided. Too many high-level policies may simply lead to a culture of box
    ticking. The Bank’s May 2013 Report, “Romania - Improving the National Framework for
    Preparing and Implementing Public Investment Projects” found that the Romanian PIM system
    is burdened with a control rather than an enabling culture among regulatory bodies, a
    conclusion supported by the research undertaken as part of the “ROP 2.0: MA-IB Collaboration
    and Beneficiary Support” evaluation. This makes many officials focus on dogmatic compliance.
    In such an environment, a plethora of strategies and policies, which officials feel obliged to
    fulfill, is likely to lead to delays in preparation in order to make the projects “fit” the policies.
    The more policies a project must comply with, the greater the risk of conflict; it is not possible
    for all of them to be compatible.

   Develop a good communications strategy that encourages the generation of good project
    ideas. In order to put as many minds to work on thinking up good project proposals (a form of
    innovation in of itself that is much aspired to by all), the strategies and objectives of an OP
    should be explained openly to as many stakeholders as possible on a regular basis, particularly
    at the start of a programming period. The possibilities opened up by the availability of funds
    should be understood by as wide of a range of stakeholders as possible. Some critics suggest
    that EU communications strategies are overly focused on marketing the benevolence of the
    Union instead of explaining how people themselves can be part of the process. A good
    communications strategy, if implemented well, should engage people at the local level to create
    and submit their own proposals. The more people are involved in this process, the more project
    ideas will be brought forward, and the more likely it is that good projects will be selected in a
    competitive setting.

   Decision-makers in Romania should consider instituting the role of a Priority Controller,
    following the Welsh model. Certainly in the case of smaller interventions where a competitive,
    opportunity funding system might be proposed, the need for a standard selection methodology
    would indicate the need for an arbiter, possibly at the level of the MA, to ensure consistency of
    application and fairness in the assessment scores. The Priority Controller (PC) would also assess
    priorities in terms of overall affordability within the OP and, where there are more proposals
    than funds, the PC could select project proposals on the basis of best fit. The PC would also
    ensure that project proposals do not compete with, duplicate, or contradict any other
    interventions in the OP or elsewhere in the public domain in the regional or local area.

   Where evaluation panels or juries are used (e.g., Estonia, Nordrhein-Westfalen), the
    transparency of selection processes is perceived to be high. Evidence from case studies shows
    that, in order to guarantee high-quality funding decisions, a number of conditions need to be
    fulfilled, including: careful composition of panels (members need to cover technical, economic
    and strategic aspects, any bias must be excluded, (some of the) members need to know the local
    context); and detailed guidance for panel members (scoring methods to be used, clear definition
    of indicators). In addition, the availability of all necessary documentation through web portals
    has promoted transparency and certainty with respect to selection procedures (e.g., Estonia,
    Italy).

   Prepare projects in advance of the beginning of the programming period and approve match
    funding. Lithuania made a good start to 2007-2013 by having a number of strategic projects

                                                                                                      50
       already prepared and approved for match funding at the national level. This meant that once
       the program was underway, only the approval of the allocation from Brussels was required
       before beginning the actual implementation phase. This seems to be a logical and practical step
       to improve absorption rates in Romania too, particularly when larger PIM style projects are
       envisaged. It is worth noting that Romania tried to do something similar, preparing technical
       documentation funded by the central MRDPA in the pre-accession period – this backfired in
       some cases, as the technical designs were of poor quality and sometimes did not fit the reality
       on the ground. As a concept, advance preparation is desirable, as long as it is properly
       implemented and aligned with actual needs and priorities at the local level; otherwise, it will
       only lead to lengthy delays during the implementation phase.

Options for Building Capacity
99.      In particular, there are several options worth considering for strengthening the capacity of
Romanian stakeholders to manage projects and especially PIM-style investments. Three in particular
are worth considering: (1) create a Program Implementation Unit with appropriately skilled and
experienced staff on a “task and finish” basis to provide support to beneficiaries in preparing and
implementing projects; (2) hire more staff in the Managing Authority to fulfill the same role as in (1);
and (3) hire external capacity at the level of beneficiaries and focus efforts on them becoming an
intelligent customer of external providers, instead of trying to achieve all tasks internally. The
paragraphs below summarize the pros and cons of these various options.

       1. Program Implementation Unit (PIU)
           o Advantages / Benefits:
                      A dedicated unit focused on one main task;
                      Additional skills, not always found in the government sector such as project
                        management, can be brought in.

           o   Disadvantages / Risks:
                       Remoteness from beneficiaries;
                       Potential lack of focus that would otherwise be present if the tasks were the
                          responsibility of the beneficiaries;
                       Perceived lack of ownership among beneficiaries and ultimate operators of
                          the project;
                       Potential for resentment if remuneration is greater in a separate PIU (which
                          it may well need to be);
                       Resistance to create additional institutions unless PIU would be already part
                          of the MA, in which case it would be hobbled by existing pay-scales making
                          recruitment difficult.

       2. Hire more Staff in the Managing Authority
           o Advantages / Benefits:
                        Centralized human capital resource that can supplement the skills and local
                            knowledge of the beneficiaries.

           o   Disadvantages / Risks:
                       Remoteness from the beneficiaries;
                       Lack of ownership of beneficiaries / ultimate operators;


                                                                                                     51
                         Difficult to pay additional staff outside normal pay-scales would make
                          recruitment difficult and may also generate conflicts.

       3. Hire External Capacity in direct support of the beneficiaries
           o Advantages / Benefits:
                         Where funds are available – good quality advice;
                         Direct and targeted support to specific projects;
                         Can be planned so that availability matches requirement.
          o   Disadvantages / Risks:
                      Requires a procurement process that may delay the availability of that
                         capacity, particularly in the event of legal challenges against award
                         procedures;
                      High cost.

Service Contract Projects
100. As for service contract style projects, the six alternatives presented below should be
considered as options for strengthening the system’s capacity:

       1. Employ procurement specialists in a PIU
           o Advantages / Benefits:
                       A one-stop shop for the preparation and implementation all projects related
                         to EU structural funds;
                       Single point of reference for the MA, allowing greater and simpler
                         management control.
          o   Disadvantages / Risks:
                      Pre-supposes the existence of a PIU;
                      Would be seen as remote and out of touch with regional and local issues;
                      May face a lack of co-operation from regional entities;
                      Difficult to engage with local stakeholders in order to understand the
                         requirements, possibly leading to weaker projects.

       2. Employ (more) procurement specialists in the MA
           o Advantages / Benefits:
                      MA is able to exert full management control over the process and take
                         responsibility for errors;
                      PIU would need procurement experts anyway in order to fulfill its role in
                         PIM style projects.

          o   Disadvantages / Risks:
                      Would be seen as remote and out of touch with regional and local issues;
                      May face a lack of cooperation from regional entities;
                      Difficult to engage with local stakeholders in order to understand the
                         requirements possibly leading to weaker projects.

       3. Employ procurement specialists in regional entities
           o Advantages / Benefits:
                      Brings the solution closer to the problem;

                                                                                                52
                          Full engagement at an operational level.

           o   Disadvantages / Risks:
                       Requires a recruitment exercise;
                       Requires additional funding;
                       Difficulty in sourcing appropriately skilled people in the regions.

       4. Train existing officials in the required procurement skills
           o Advantages / Benefits:
                        No need to hire extra people.

           o   Disadvantages / Risks:
                       Temptation to simply add the responsibility to other existing duties, leading
                          to unsatisfactory service and lack of focus;
                       Possible lack of interest in the subject matter among appointed staff;
                       Pre-conceived ideas may lead to subjective treatment of proposals;
                       Takes time and money to engage in a training program that could be
                          meaningful;
                       Lack of previous experience means that mistakes in the early days would be
                          inevitable, despite training.

       5. Engage NARMPP to act as an agent
           o Advantages / Benefits:
                      Existing pool of knowledge on procurement rules and procedures;
                      Readily available institution with established authority on the subject.

           o   Disadvantages / Risks:
                       It is not clear whether NARMPP has the legal authority to act as agent;
                       Relatively poor reputation of NARMPP may lead to local bodies refusing to
                          work with them;
                       Suspicion of motives due to the existing ‘control’ mentality of some
                          NARMPP staff.

       6. Hire consultants to provide support when required
           o Advantages / Benefits:
                        Where funds are available – good quality advice;
                        Direct and targeted support to specific projects;
                        Can be planned so that availability matches requirement;
                        Largely insures against the risk of making errors that lead to legal
                            challenges.

           o   Disadvantages / Risks:
                       Costly;
                       Requires a procurement process that may delay the availability of capacity,
                          particularly in the event of legal challenges to tender procedures.

101. In sum, one of the most important issues to address in designing a suitable appraisal and
selection model for Romania is to quantify the nature of proposed interventions. As noted repeatedly

                                                                                                  53
throughout this chapter, there are two types of intervention in ROPs across the EU: strategic level, PIM-
style projects; and opportunity funding projects based largely on service contracts. The relative balance
between the two types needs to be understood in order to operate effective programs.

102. It seems clear that, for larger projects involving infrastructure, support may be required either
through hiring consultants or from a centralized support institution. But this should not imply
centralized bodies taking on the responsibility for preparation and implementation. This was a situation
found in the environment sector in Romania in the early part of the 2007-2013 programming period that
led to institutional conflict, misunderstandings, and poor preparation leading to delays and low
implementation rates.

103. For the smaller service contracts, there is no reason why, provided that the right tools and
training are available, local entities should not be capable of identifying and implementing solutions
to their own problems. This is a system that appears to serve well other EU Member States. The degree
to which they require external support and the nature of that support remains to be determined in each
case.




                                                                                                      54
V. Basic principles for an efficient project selection model

Balancing impact and absorption
104. It is obvious that while the impact of EU funded projects should play a bigger role in the next
programming period, basic absorption considerations should not be ignored. More specifically, it does
not matter much that projects are designed to be more impactful if funds are not properly absorbed to
fund these projects. It is therefore important to start the discussion on absorption before talking about
impact.

105. Romania has had, consistently, the poorest absorption rates of any Member State. In fact,
Romania is some distance away (14 percentage points) from the second worst performer – Bulgaria. This
obviously brings to the fore the need to improve absorption capacity in tandem with improving the
impact of selected projects. Among other things, this means that better selection criteria cannot be
designed without also thinking about streamlining processes and improving institutional capacity to
implement projects. As was shown in the MA-IB Collaboration report, this also means dealing with a
number of systemic issues (e.g., the public procurement system, technical documentation quality, etc.),
which are not necessarily linked to the ROP.

              Figure 9. Percentage of EU funds paid by the European Commission, in June 2013




                     Source: http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/thefunds/funding/index_en.cfm

106. As such, the decision to focus on higher impact projects should not be taken without ensuring
that the right mechanisms are in place to ensure proper absorption of EU funds. In the Romania
Functional Review: Regional Development and Tourism, the World Bank argued that there is a need to
balance abortion and impact within every programming period, while ensuring the adequate legal and
institutional frameworks are in place to prevent systemic issues from affecting either proper absorption
and/or impact (see figure below).




                                                                                                      55

107. Consequently, for the 2014-2020 Programming Period, Romanian authorities, and Managing
Authorities in particular, will have a hard task ensuring that absorption quota are met, while also
selecting investments that will have the most significant possible impact. It is hard to make a strong
case for higher impact, when absorbed funds sometimes do not even cover the country’s contribution to
the EU. This also means that new project selection models have to not only enable a more strategic
selection of projects, but also ensure that funds are absorbed at a fast enough rate. This may also mean
that project selection models have to be adjusted according to the make-up of individual operational
programmes. For example, OP Transport finances primarily large scale projects with a significant impact,
while the Human Resources OP focuses primarily on smaller scale projects. The Regional Operational
Programme, the focus of this analysis, finances a mix of large scale (strategic) and small scale projects.

108. For the 2007-2013 Programming Period, the Regional Operational Programme (ROP) was a top
performer in terms of absorption rates, in the Romanian context. Of the 7 operational programmes it
had received the highest level of reimbursements from the EC by July 2013 – both in absolute and in
relative terms. Reimbursements had reached around 30% of allocated funds by July 2013 and continued
to growth throughout the rest of the year, reaching 44% (nearly 50% higher) by the end of November
2013.

109. Not only did the ROP have the highest absorption rates of all OPs, but it also had a high
contracting rate. Basically, of the EUR 3.72 billion allocated for 2007-2013, ROP contracting reached
over 110% of allocated sums. This is critical information when discussing the importance of project
impact. Focusing on impact requires a competitive selection of projects, but a competitive selection is
possible only if there is actual competition between projects. If the value of submitted projects is
smaller than allocated sums, or if the quality of submitted projects is low, selecting impactful projects is
a futile undertaking.

Defining impact
110. Many reports and books have been written about “impact” and the topic would merit a
separate treatment. Depending on what type of impact is sought, there are different approaches that
may be considered for efficient project evaluation and selection. Economic impact may warrant a more
pecuniary approach (e.g., Cost Benefit Analysis, Internal Rate of Return, annual cash flows, etc.); social
impact may be focused more on the benefits accrued by poor people or communities in general;
environmental impact may try to estimate net environmental benefits (e.g., green-house gas
reductions). At a more general level, development impact can be measured through a number of
standard indicators and methods (e.g., GDP per Capita, Human Development Index, Input-Output
Analysis, Computable General Equilibrium Models, etc.).

111. The level at which impact is measured also plays an important role, both in the method
chosen to measure impact and in terms of the effort spent on measuring impact. Obviously, more
sophisticated methods and more time should be spent on the selection of large projects with a

                                                                                                                 57
proportionally large expected impact. For example, deciding which highway to finance requires that a
proper transport and regional development strategy/plan is in place. For medium-sized projects, it may
be more expedient and efficient to have a standardized evaluation and selection method, which allows a
boiler-plate analysis for a number of projects – this could involve both batch evaluation (e.g., looking at
Cost Benefit Analysis or financial sustainability over the expected life of the project), or evaluation by
project type (e.g., separate analysis done for transport projects, for educational infrastructure projects,
for business development projects, etc.). For small projects, which usually have a low anticipated impact
and tend to come in large numbers, it may be most efficient to simply look at basic qualification criteria
(e.g., eligibility and basic technical and financial evaluation) and to select them for financing based on
the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle, rather than through a competitive selection.

112. Thus, depending on the level of impact expected, evaluation and selection methods can range
from the elaborate and sophisticated to the rather simple. All in all, it is important that selection
models apply different selection criteria depending on the size and anticipated impact of the project. As
indicated earlier, large-scale high-impact projects would ideally have a local/regional/national
strategy/plan at their foundation, which would clearly evidence how the proposed strategic project can
help achieve local/regional/national objectives. For medium-sized projects, a competitive selection
process would have to apply a standard evaluation and selection method, as there may be more
requests for funding than actual funds. For small projects, a FIFO method may be the best option, as
small projects tend to come in high numbers, they tend to have a low overall impact, and complicated
evaluation and selection methods may simply slow the process down – and, by extension, reduce
absorption rates.

113. A discussion about impact should also touch on the type of impact that is expected. Generally,
economic theory talks about direct impact, indirect impact, and induced impact. A direct impact accrues
directly in the sector addressed. For example, a new investment in connective infrastructure may
shorten travel times between two cities by 50%. An indirect impact has a positive or negative effect on
other related sectors. Thus, an improvement in transport infrastructure could help improve the business
environment in the two cities by enabling firms located there an easier access to a larger labor pool.
Finally, the induced impact relates to the positive or negative effect on non-related sectors. For
example, the fact that the economy is doing better as a result of new infrastructure means that people
in the region will have more disposable income, and they will spend it in local businesses (e.g.,
supermarkets, cinemas, restaurants, bars), which will provide another positive economic boost.

114. Of course, measuring direct, indirect, and induced impact in practice is easier said than done.
In the US, there are companies that have specialized in measuring the direct, indirect, and induced
impact of growth in particular economic sectors. The total impact usually tracks revenue growth and
growth in employment. Such models are based on the Input-Output framework and are quite data
intensive and cumbersome to put together. They also have a number of shortcomings that are relatively
well-known. For example, such models cannot track negative effects of growth in one sector (e.g., the
growth of the CD market has led to the virtual disappearance of the audio cassette market). Also, such
models need to be calibrated on a regular basis to properly respond to changing economic conditions –
an undertaking that is usually quite expensive and technical in nature.

115. Given that impact is so hard to assess even with the help of complex and well-established
economic models, it becomes clear that assessing the impact of public investments is no easy task
either. In fact, there are no foolproof models (at least none that the authors know of) for correctly
assessing the impact of public investment projects, and the reason for this is quite simple: public

                                                                                                        58
investment projects usually hope to achieve social, economic, and environmental outcomes that are
usually provided sub-optimally (or not at all) by the private sector, and that usually are hard to quantify
and measure. For example, it is hard to put a number on the economic and social benefits (as well as the
negative side-effects) of a new road project. One could not tell with certainty how much of the
economic growth the road project was responsible for, how many new jobs it helped create, of how
many poor people managed to rise out of poverty because of it. One can look at concrete outcomes
such as the improved travel time between two places, or the effective output of such an effort (i.e., a
new road has been developed), but when it comes to impact per se it is challenging to isolate the pure
effects of such investments from all other possible variables.

116. Indeed, outside factors (e.g., global economic performance, the performance of neighboring
countries) are strong determinants of internal performance. The fact that the global economy, or the
EU economy, is doing well, may be the chief factor in triggering a positive impact of a road investment
project. Similarly, with the global economy is performing poorly, most public investment projects may
have just a modest developmental impact.

117. The difficulty of assessing the impact of a particular project can easily be assessed by looking
at development data for Romania. In the Competitive Cities report, the team made use of a Local
Human Development Index (LHDI), developed by Romanian sociologist Dumitru Sandu. The LHDI maps
below show the development performance of individual localities in Romania from 2002 to 2011. As can
be seen, there is a strong geographical pattern to development in Romania (as in most other countries
in fact). The localities that have developed the most are those that are close to the West (where 70% of
Romanian exports go), those that have large demographic and economic mass (e.g., București), and
those that are close to places with large demographic and economic mass. Annex 24 (and 24A, 24B, and
24C) describe in detail the LHDI methodology and, moreover, how it could be deployed as part of the
ROP’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system.

118. A quick glance at road investment projects indicates that there is no real correlation between
the areas where new roads have been built and the areas that have registered the most significant
development in the past decade. Moreover, as the maps below indicate, some of the areas that would
benefit most from investments in road infrastructure (e.g., Timiș County) still have a relatively low
density of roads, whereas some counties where market dynamics are less strong (e.g., Botoșani) have
both a high road density and have benefited from significant investments in road infrastructure.

       Figure 13. Investments in road infrastructure do not seem to have a real developmental impact

119. This is the first lesson in devising proper project selection and evaluation models: public
investment projects should attempt to enhance positive market externalities, while mitigating
negative market externalities. If we were to use the example presented above, market dynamics seem
to indicate that the highest need for road investment projects is in the West of the country and around
the larger cities in Romania. Consequently, one prioritization factor for new road development projects
could be the ease of access they enable to Western markets and the markets of large Romanian cities.

Understanding the entire complexity of a project selection model
120. When devising a project selection model, it is important to keep in mind that every project
has a particular impact. The construction of a new road may not necessarily generate an economic
boost in the area where it is implemented, but it may have a positive impact nonetheless – even if just a
modest one. A new road project employs a number of local people and generates additional revenues
for some local companies (e.g., concrete manufacturers). The key task for the effective selection of
projects is to assure that not only the direct impact is maximized, but also the indirect and induced
effects (which are often harder to measure).

121. It is also important to be mindful of the potential negative impact of a project. Not every new
investment is necessarily an economic boon. For example, a new road project, like the one we talked
about above, may in the long-term prove to be a drain on local public resources, requiring high
maintenance costs. As such, a project that was expected to have a positive development impact may in
fact have a negative effect in the long run. This is why it is critical for new public investment projects to
be mindful of existing market dynamics. And this is why the elaboration of a project selection model
requires a good understanding of the entire complexity of project selection models.

122. Every good project selection model needs to have a good strategy at its foundation. The
purpose of a strategy is to identify ways of harnessing positive market externalities and addressing
negative market externalities. A good strategy will provide the back drop for preparing a program (e.g.,
an operational programme), with a set of clear objectives and a specific action plan. The latter would
include a concrete list of desirable projects, each with a list of necessary inputs attached to them. Inputs
would in turn generate a number of outputs (e.g., a new road of a number of kilometers), which in turn
aim to achieve a number of outcomes/results (e.g., faster travel time between two economic centers).
Finally, the achieved outcomes/results would help generate a strong impact (e.g., local/regional/
national development).

123. Moreover, this chain of actions should be provided with appropriate feedback loops to
determine what has worked and what has failed. These feedback loops are also essential for
continually improving evaluation and selection models, as further explained in Chapter XI. Thus, the
objectives defined should be relevant for the needs/problems identified in the sector strategy. The
inputs should be devised efficiently (e.g., with the lowest possible costs for the highest possible benefits)
to achieve quality outputs. In turn, the achieved outcomes/results would be a measure of the
effectiveness of set objectives, while the achieved impacts would serve as a measure for the utility and
relevance of the sector strategy. Obviously, a weak link in this chain of actions may negatively affect the
whole system.

124. The implications for the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020 are that a sound regional
development strategy should be in place before devising the programme itself. As of October 2013,
the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration was still working on its regional
development strategy. Consequently, there is no back-drop to use in this analysis. Given that there are

                                                                                                          61
no clear objectives defined for the new programming period, for the purpose of this analysis we will
draw on a number of key strategic documents, prepared by the World Bank, the European Commission,
and the Romanian Government. The next chapter focuses specifically on these issues.

VI. Setting the foundation for improved project selection models in Romania

Strategic Priorities for Romania’s Economic Development
125. There is wide agreement that Romania has a unique potential for achieving sustainable and
inclusive growth, but there is no consensus on a specific set of strategic priorities for the country’s
development. In fact, particularly in recent years, policymakers at both the EU and the national level
have prepared an overwhelming number of plans, strategies, position papers, memoranda,
communications, and other “key documents”. In many ways, thorough planning is a positive feature of
the system and results from a justified desire to achieve the most impact with the least resources
committed or, in the spirit of a recent concept promoted by the EU and the broader international aid
community, “maximize value for money.” This inclination very much applies to the European
Commission, as the party accountable for how structural funds are spent and for the results they
deliver. It also holds true for the Romanian Government, which has limited budgetary resources relative
to the country’s development needs at this point in time. Nevertheless, having too many strategies can
backfire in the absence of close coordination and prioritization of objectives, making it harder to design
and implement a coherent vision for development based on actual needs on the ground and expected
impact of potential interventions. In addition, enforcing accountability mechanisms and carrying out
proper monitoring and evaluation can be challenging without clearly defined strategic directions, goals,
activities, and indicators.

126. As it relates to the current work on project selection models for the Regional Operational
Programme (ROP), the issue of defining and operationalizing Romania’s development priorities is
quintessential. Indeed, it would be impossible to decide on a typology of projects or to recommend a
particular set of evaluation and selection criteria without agreeing, ex ante, on the overall policy
directions. To limit the scope of this engagement to a more manageable task, it is useful to note that the
Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA) focuses on a specific range of
issues – they are critical aspects of Romania’s development, but do not cover every single sector that
may contribute to this endeavor. More specifically, based on Government Decisions (GDs) 1 and
512/2013, the MRDPA coordinates policy in the following areas: regional and urban development,
territorial cohesion, cross-border cooperation, public works, housing, national and local administration,
public services, industrial parks, and “programming, coordination, monitoring, and control of non-
reimbursable EU assistance for relevant activities under its mandate.”18 For its part, the ROP naturally
covers some of the same key areas, as is to be expected of a program administered by the Managing
Authority under the MRDPA. As noted throughout this report, the ROP finances a range of complex
infrastructure projects, primarily in urban settings, as well as smaller investments for strengthening the
private sector’s development.

127. More specifically, the ROP seeks to support the economic, social, territorially balanced, and
sustainable development of Romanian regions, according to their specific needs and resources, by
focusing on urban growth poles, the business environment, and basic infrastructure. The program’s
vision is to transform Romanian regions, particularly the ones lagging behind, into more attractive places
to live, work, visit, and invest in. Based on these goals, as spelled out in the ROP’s programmatic
document, the following specific objectives were set: (1) to increase the economic and social role of
urban centers, adopting a polycentric approach, in order to stimulate a more balanced development of

                                                                                                       63
regions; (2) to increase accessibility within regions and in particular the accessibility of urban centers
and their connection to surrounding areas; (3) to increase the quality of social infrastructure of regions;
(4) to increase the competitiveness of regions as business locations; and (5) to increase the contribution
of tourism to the development of regions. Concentration, connectivity, basic institutions and services,
quality of life – these are cornerstone concepts of sound policies aimed at promoting economic
development, as explained below and as noted at length in the World Bank’s 2009 World Development
Report and also in the 2013 study on Romania’s Competitive Cities.

128. In this context, this brief summary reviews the potential strategic directions for Romania’s
economic development, as reflected in a series of flagship documents, with the aim of orienting the
conversation toward a set of clear, consistent criteria for the prioritization of interventions. First,
keeping in mind powerful synergies with the World Bank’s broader ongoing Regional Development
Program in Romania, the initial sections below summarize the framework presented in the Competitive
Cities report, prepared for the MRDPA as part of the advisory services on “Enhanced Spatial Planning as
a Precondition for Urban Development.” This is based on a well-known World Bank methodology
presented in the 2009 World Development Report and adapted to Romania’s context. Second, this
chapter presents EU-level priorities that apply to Romania as one of the 28 Member States, focusing
most notably on the Europe 2020 strategy, which is often cited as the main document guiding the
Union’s development path. Third, a review of the national-level dimension, as reflected in the draft
Partnership Agreement (PA) that will shape how Romania spends structural funds available for the 2014-
2020 budgeting cycle, helps put things into perspective. The hope is that this effort will begin to shed
light on a unified, coherent framework for looking at Romania’s development priorities and the
MRDPA’s role in supporting them, including through the next phase of the ROP. Keeping in mind this
goal, this chapter’s final section draws parallels between the various key documents assessed and
presents a set of priorities that can further guide the strategic prioritization of investments at local,
regional, and national levels.


The World Bank’s Recommendations on Nurturing Romania’s Competitive Cities
129. The 2013 World Bank report on “Competitive Cities” makes an extensive case for enabling
Romania’s sustainable and inclusive development by allowing all people to pursue opportunities and
maximize their productive potential. In particular, the role of cities, as an economy’s primary engines, is
fundamental to this endeavor. The key argument goes back to an understanding of economic growth as
a product of two factors: population and productivity. Since Romania’s demographic decline leaves little
hope for an economic growth based only on rising population figures, boosting individual productivity is
the key task at hand. The history of advanced economies teaches that a country’s development goes
hand in hand with urbanization – a process that involves, essentially, the concentration of human and
economic resources around various centers of activity. The greater the mass of a country’s cities and the
closer they are to each other and to other large markets abroad, the better the prospects of high and
sustainable economic growth. But beyond regions, cities, and economic sectors, the fundamental
premise of this work is that an economy is the sum of its people. A successful economy is therefore one
that enables people to be the most productive they can be or, in simpler terms, to fulfill their individual
dreams and potential for their own benefit and for the good of society at large.

130. The types of optimal measures needed to promote economic development vary based on the
type of targeted area. On one end of the spectrum, there are leading areas that experience strong
growth and an accelerated concentration of resources. These generally form around major cities (per
the arguments presented above, leading areas are inherently and increasingly urban) and are growing,

                                                                                                        64
typically in every sense of the word: their economy is dynamic; unemployment is low and, moreover,
human capital is in high demand; incomes rise and people have an increasing ability to spend more on
goods, services, and leisure; new residential neighborhoods and industrial areas push the city’s
boundaries, often along existing infrastructure (e.g., roads and railroads). This virtuous cycle of
prosperity continues to draw in more competitive people and companies, expanding the local economy,
at least until the costs of further concentration (in specialized jargon, also known as diseconomies of
scale) begin to outweigh the benefits of this process. Data show that in Romania the urbanization
process is in full swing and will likely continue for some time before it reaches a turning point and,
indeed, a new hierarchy of cities is emerging.19

131. At the other end of the spectrum, there are lagging areas, which struggle to break through a
vicious cycle of poverty, low economic competitiveness, lack of education and skills, and possibly
marginalization. Such places have few professional opportunities, public institutions and services often
function poorly on account of a crumbling infrastructure (e.g., lack of running water, inadequate
sanitation, poor healthcare services, low-quality schools, etc.), and many people struggle with poverty
and, in special cases, discrimination and isolation. Even the best-qualified people have a hard time in
finding adequate employment because there are few profitable firms, if any, so they often move away in
search of better opportunities. People who are less mobile (e.g., children, the elderly, other vulnerable
groups, low-skilled workers, etc.) are left behind, often struggling with poverty and the lack of basic
necessities. Needless to say, those who are born and grow up in a lagging area typically have a much
weaker shot at fulfilling their potential and boosting their productivity, which ultimately represents a
cost for the entire society. As noted above, the challenge is to create the conditions for all people, in all
areas, to fulfill their aspirations.

132. While most policymakers easily understand the differences between various areas as
presented above, there is little consensus on the best solutions for supporting development. Indeed,
most of the time, the tendency is for governments to artificially redistribute resources from growing
cities to less developed ones, along with top-down incentive schemes for people and firms to relocate to
lagging areas. In practice, such interventions run the risk of slowing down a country’s overall growth by
weakening precisely the engines that push the national economy forward, while redirecting scarce
resources toward projects with improbable benefits. Again, what is needed is a careful look at the
historical evolution of advanced economies: in short, uneven development is inherent and smart
policymakers learn to embrace and enable the process, rather than try to oppose or alter it. While in the
short term some degree of internal divergence is inevitable, with some areas growing faster than others,
eventually the benefits of development extend across the country and lead to similar standards of living
regardless of location, which is the essential key to unlocking increases in productivity and overall
economic growth. In other words, if the desideratum is a growing, sustainable, and resilient economy,
where all people have the opportunity to realize their potential and maximize their productivity, there is
a proven path to get there the fastest. The World Bank’s 2009 World Development Report and the 2013
work on Competitive Cities, specific to Romania’s context, make these arguments persuasively and at
length.



19
  Essentially, data from the 2012 Census confirms predictions based on the Zipf rank-size rule: Bucharest is emerging as a clear
primate city in terms of economic and demographic mass, followed by Cluj-Napoca and Timișoara, which have pulled ahead of
other growth poles. This has happened as a result of free market dynamics, after the seven growth poles came out of the
centrally planned system at similar development levels in 1990. This argument and its implications are presented at length in
the two 2013 World Bank reports on Competitive Cities and Growth Poles: The Next Phase.

                                                                                                                              65
133. In the context of the current project, this framework has direct implications on the optimal
types of ROP-financed interventions at the local, regional, and international level, as illustrated in the
figure below. At the local level, lagging regions should invest in fostering good institutions, ensuring that
all people have access to the range of basic public services (e.g., running water, sewage, gas, electricity,
trash collection, education, health, etc.) that allows them to focus on productive activities, as opposed
to spending time on securing essential needs. This is in line with the desideratum to create similar living
standards across the country, which also often resonates with political decision-makers. Leading cities,
for their part, should channel resources toward improving connectivity with surrounding areas to
continue to increase their economic mass and strengthen the virtuous concentration economic and
demographic mass. At the same time, these areas should invest in increasing the quality of life for
residents, so that they can attract and retain the qualified human capital to fill the innovation jobs that
the local economy needs to prosper. Finally, both leading and lagging areas should invest in local
interventions targeted at enabling and empowering marginalized groups to pursue educational and
professional opportunities, reducing discrimination and allowing them to share in the broader benefits
of Romania’s development.

134. As for the regional and international levels, the main aim of ROP-financed interventions
should be to improve the connectivity between different areas within Romania and between
domestic and foreign markets. Regionally, investments in connective infrastructure between leading
and lagging areas can enable more people to relocate in growing areas, where feasible, adding to the
mass of growing cities and strengthening their potential for growth. At the same time, less developed
areas share the benefits of development through spillover effects and, on account of better connective
infrastructure, get to retain some of their residents and limit the demographic decline, even though
people may be commuting to work in bigger cities in the region.

135. The same principles apply internationally, where improved connectivity essentially means
that people, capital, services, goods, and ideas can travel more easily between different markets.
Better infrastructure means lower costs for Romanian exporters, as well as cheaper imported goods for
those products that cannot be produced competitively on the domestic market. At the same time,
Romanians can explore opportunities on global markets that are more closely aligned with their career
preferences, while local companies can potentially expand their labor pool and attract qualified
employees from abroad. In particular, migration is not necessarily a bad thing. As argued extensively in
the Competitive Cities report, Romanians abroad contribute to the country’s development with money
transfers (in the form of remittances), direct capital investments (e.g., starting new businesses, based on
practices learned elsewhere), and sharing of knowledge and ideas (e.g., studying/working abroad and
returning home to apply the lessons learned). There is one caveat to the arguments above: in strategic
sectors such as healthcare, a massive exodus of qualified labor can create problems, particularly in the
short term, and in such exceptional circumstances government intervention may be needed to motivate
people to continue to work in Romania to preserve the quality of public services rendered. Generally
speaking, however, improved mobility and connectivity are positive features and should be nurtured by
addressing potential obstacles through appropriate measures (e.g., improved infrastructure, better
airline connections, lower trade barriers, etc.).

136. The Regional Operational Programme (ROP) is an essential instrument for achieving the
development vision laid out above. It can fund a range of infrastructure projects that improve
connectivity at both local and regional levels (e.g., roads, bridges, metropolitan public transport, etc.),
particularly when coordinated with the EU-level TEN-T network and investments from the OP Transport.
At the same time, the ROP can support various quality-of-life projects, from the rehabilitation of public
parks and historic buildings to the creation of pedestrian areas, bicycle lanes, and parking infrastructure.
In lagging areas, the program can be fundamental in revamping available social infrastructure (e.g.,
schools, hospitals, retirement centers, utility networks, etc.), particularly in conjunction with OP
Environment. Last but not least, the ROP has the potential to empower marginalized groups by
connecting them with opportunities (e.g., updated schools, better spatial integration of Roma
neighborhoods, etc.), while keeping in mind the need to combine hard and soft measures to effectively
combat discrimination and promote true empowerment of disadvantaged communities. The table
below provides a few additional examples of potential ROP projects that contribute to Romania’s
development by promoting urbanization, bringing people closer to opportunities, and lowering barriers
against labor and capital mobility.

137. Importantly, all decisions to fund a particular project should be based on actual needs and
expected impact on the ground, which will vary on a case-by-case basis. In other words, the framework
above does not justify investments in any project that, say, connects any city to its neighboring area.
Clear, persuasive data are needed regarding demographics and the mobility of people across localities,
along with trends across time, economic flows, etc. This observation holds for all types of proposed
investments, across all axes and priority areas: just because a particular idea/project fits under a general
heading in the abstract does not necessarily mean that it actually generates significant impact and
contributes to the country’s development more than other available opportunities.

138. Equally important, regions can have different needs, even within the broader categories of
leading/lagging areas. The Competitive Cities report shows, for instance, that the economy of Cluj-
Napoca is much more localized than that of Timișoara, so the former may benefit from more quality-of-
life investments in central areas, while the latter could prioritize enhancing connectivity with

                                                                                                         67
neighboring areas. Ultimately, local communities know best what their most pressing needs are, and the
selection of ROP projects for 2014-2020 should ensure, at a minimum, that: (a) proposed projects have a
significant development potential; and (b) there is a sufficient justification of need, based on accurate
data and in-depth analyses.

139. The priorities above are aligned with a vision of public institutions catalyzing Romania’s
sustainable and inclusive development, in line with the country’s current stage of development. To
summarize: a first priority is to improve connectivity and accessibility, enabling people to identify and
take advantage of opportunities in Romania and abroad; second, the government should nurture good,
functioning institutions for the provision of basic public services, as a measure that enables a similar
living standard for people in leading and lagging areas, ensuring that everybody has proper access to
good schooling, well-functioning land and housing markets, affordable healthcare, and basic public
utility services like running water, sanitation, solid waste management, heating, etc.; in addition, special
measures should target marginalized and minority groups to mitigate the persistent factors that limit
their mobility (e.g., discrimination, ethnic and language barriers, etc.).

The Europe 2020 Strategy: Priorities for Romania’s Development
140. At the European level, there are a range of key documents that guide the Union’s short -,
medium-, and long-term development, across several different areas. Other reports that are part of
the World Bank Regional Development Program, particularly the assessment of Romania’s current
growth poles policy, provide a review of the EU’s applicable framework in the area of regional
development and spatial planning. This section focuses on a more limited, well-defined spectrum,
looking at the fundamental EU-level thinking that has a direct bearing on how Romania’s ROP should
evaluate and select projects for the 2014-2020 programming period – the core focus of the current
report.

141. The primary framework guiding the European Union’s future development is the Europe 2020
strategy, adopted in March 2010, with the direct aim of promoting smart, sustainable, and inclusive
growth. From the get-go, this document describes three interconnected and mutually reinforcing
priorities:
     Smart growth: an economy based on knowledge/education, innovation, and a “digital society”
         with performing information and communication technologies;
           Sustainable growth: a green, competitive, and energy-efficient economy that is well-equipped to
            respond to climate-related challenges;
           Inclusive growth: an economy characterized by higher employment rates, a competitive labor
            force with adequate qualifications, and effective poverty-reduction measures.
Several flagship initiatives support each of these objectives, ranging from “Innovation Union” (as a way
to refocus R&D efforts on emerging challenges) to “Youth on the Move” for promoting the mobility of
students and trainees. Other examples include: “A Digital Agenda for Europe,” “Resource Efficient
Europe,” “An Industrial Policy for the Globalization Era,” “An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs,” and the
“European Platform against Poverty.” Each initiative defines a specific set of aims, as well as a list of
actionable to-do items for both the Commission and the Member States, ensuring a basic reporting
system to strengthen accountability and measure progress.

142. Based on the same three overall directions described above, EU-level policymakers have set
several quantitative indicators for the Union as a whole and for each Member State. The table below
summarizes information on the agreed targets, including Romania’s current “gap” along various
dimensions.20 The country has already exceeded requirements on one dimension, renewable energy,
thanks to a generous incentive scheme based on green certificates, which was actually softened in 2013
as a result of pressure from industrial groups claiming that the high energy prices, in part on account of
the subsidies granted to renewable technologies, were hurting their competitiveness and created the
risk for bankruptcy and massive layoffs. On all other Europe 2020 targets, Romania still has some way to
go, including in critical areas like research and development (R&D), education, income, and
employment, though there is still time to reduce the recorded gaps.

143. The reasons behind the adoption of the Europe 2020 priorities are complex. The first section of
the strategy, entitled “a moment of transformation,” summarizes the main challenges that the Union
faces in the current context, particularly in comparison with other global competitors: a structurally
lower economic growth rate, pointing the need for improved R&D and innovation; low employment
rates, particularly among the older segments of the population (i.e., 46% of the 55-64 years-old group
has jobs, compared to over 62% in Japan and the United States); accelerated demographic decline,

putting pressure on social security systems; relatively frail post-crisis global finances; and the evolution
of climate change, which requires drastic adjustments. The strategy, however, also points out a number
of key strengths specific to the EU, including the fact that Member States’ economies are deeply
interconnected (and Romania’s makes no exception to this, with over 70% of exports heading to
Western Europe) and that collective coordination has already proven its functionality and added value
during the recent crisis.

144. These observations are certainly pertinent, although it is not entirely clear how the specific
objectives of Europe 2020 were selected as the most critical to the Community’s development for this
point in time. The mechanisms through which EU decision-makers narrowed in on this particular list of
priorities appear to have been more top-down than participatory, despite the fact that Europe 2020
significantly shapes EU-level policy design and implementation, including structural funding. At the same
time, the strategy’s operationalization ultimately depends on stakeholders on the ground (e.g., ROP
beneficiaries) generating high-impact projects and completing them, which suggests that they should be
closely involved from the beginning of the process. Of course, higher participation can come at the cost
of lower efficiency, but as the EU moves forward it will pay off to bring into the wider conversation
stakeholders at all levels, not just to create stronger ownership but also to ensure that the agreed
priorities actually reflect the most pressing needs on the ground. This would also help orient applicants
and beneficiaries of EU structural funds in a space that often seems overly complex, in terms of both
policy programming (i.e., there are many EU and national-level documents, with their own priorities)
and application/implementation procedures related to accessing funds.

145. Because the Europe 2020 priorities are relatively broad, operationalizing them at the level of
structural funds like the ROP is not an easy task. One may argue that ROP-funded projects contribute
across the board toward all seven targets, from employment to energy efficiency, school attendance,
and poverty reduction. There are of course other OPs that seem more directly aligned with particular
themes, including OP Environment, OP Competitiveness, and OP Human Resources Development. By
design, the ROP targets multiple components of Romania’s regional development: for example, updated
school infrastructure can contribute to a reduction in early school leaving and an increase in energy
efficiency; similarly, a business purchasing a new equipment to expand its offering can translate directly
into more and better jobs, in conjunction with a reduction in poverty rates; and targeted projects for
business infrastructure development can also promote R&D spending and the growth of new, innovative
ventures. The point of these examples is that the ROP may not fit neatly under distinct categories of the

                                                                                                                70
Europe 2020 framework, which is to be expected from a program that is meant to promote regional and
urban development through different available means (i.e., it does not have a pure “thematic” focus).
That said, the ROP is still a very powerful instrument for supporting Romania’s smart, sustainable, and
inclusive growth and has an advantage in the possibility to support integrated investments as part of
broader local development strategies.

146. Mirroring the main priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy, a legislative package was adopted
by the EC on October 6, 2011, establishing 11 thematic objectives. These include: strengthening
research, technological development and innovation; enhancing access to, use, and quality of
information and communication technologies; boosting the competitiveness of small and medium-sized
enterprises, the agricultural sector (for the EAFRD), and fisheries and the aquaculture sector (for the
EMFF); supporting the shift toward a low-carbon economy in all sectors; promoting climate change
adaptation, risk prevention, and management; protecting the environment and promoting resource
efficiency; promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures;
promoting employment and supporting labor mobility; promoting social inclusion and combating
poverty; investing in education, skills and lifelong learning; and enhancing institutional capacity and an
efficient public administration. Again, ROP-funded projects have the potential to positively impact many
of these areas.

147. Ultimately, the Europe 2020 strategy provides broad guidelines for what Member States
should prioritize in their development, while openly noting that it does not seek to promote a “one -
size-fits-all approach,” given that countries have particular needs.21 It would be hard to compare the
German and the Romanian economies, for instance, and generally there are still structural differences
between new EU members in the East and advanced economies in the West. The next section turns to
the national-level framework that helps identify the strategic priorities guiding Romania’s development
broadly and, in particular, the ROP’s programming, evaluation, and selection.


National-Level Priorities for Romania’s Development
148. Within the large set of strategic documents guiding Romania’s development, the draft
Partnership Agreement (PA) plays the fundamental role in the programmatic and institutional set-up
of the 2014-2020 budgeting period. Another useful resource on spatial planning and territorial
development is the World Bank study on “Enhanced Spatial Planning,” which argues in favo r of
improved coordination and reduction of duplication among various strategic frameworks developed at
the local, county, regional, and national level, while reviewing the various elements of these plans. For
the purpose of the current work, the main focus remains on the PA and particularly on its sections
dedicated to sustainable urban development.

149. In general, the draft PA follows the logic and structure of the Europe 2020 strategy, drawing
explicitly on its thematic objectives and commitments, as recommended in a template put forth by
the EC. Accordingly, the PA summarizes the main types of investments that are expected to be funded
through the Regional OPs: local road, railway, and harbor infrastructure; urban/local development
(including public transportation and related infrastructure, cultural heritage, sport facilities,
multifunctional facilities); energy efficiency (including rehabilitation of networks); education and social
infrastructure; health infrastructure; and competitiveness and business environment for SMEs. In
particular, the draft document notes that a prioritization of investments – and the corresponding

funding allocation – follows from Romania’s specific needs at this point in its development, although it is
not entirely clear (at least in this early draft) how the various areas will rank against each other and how
the limited funding allocation will look like eventually.

150. The PA’s sections on territorial development include a number of concepts also reflected in
the World Bank’s Competitive Cities framework, as well as in multiple EU-level documents. Common
themes include: the importance of economic geography (e.g., Romania’s peripheral position in the EU);
polycentric development and spill-over effects facilitated by strong urban-rural partnerships;
connectivity between people, goods and services, and capital, with special efforts to overcome natural
barriers (e.g., the Carpathian Mountains); the protection of natural and cultural resources as ingredients
for sustainable development; and equitable access to public services (“services of general interest”) that
are vital for citizens’ welfare. In particular, the PA highlights this last area, i.e., ensuring equal access to
public services, as a “fundamental right” and “the most important component” in the fight against
poverty.

151. The PA also includes a brief sub-section dedicated to the key topic of sustainable urban
development, listing a number of guiding principles for 2014-2020 investments. There is a notable
focus on two elements: (1) customization of investments based on the type of urban settlement (e.g.,
growth poles, development poles, small towns, and tourist resorts); and (2) the need to design and
implement integrated interventions that go beyond a particular physical objective (e.g., a historical
building, a public park, etc.) and create multiplier effects within a broader vision for local and regional
development. The May 2013 draft version is still relatively vague on priority areas, noting several
potential criteria for selection of intervention/project sites: concentration of historical buildings for
downtown areas; concentration of population and age of buildings for residential neighborhoods;
quality of buildings, crime rates, and lack of public utilities for deprived neighborhoods; and former
industrial or military sites for brownfield redevelopment. The idea of customizing interventions to the
specific type of urban settlement is sound and policymakers should expand it even further: as argued in
the 2013 analyses on Competitive Cities and Growth Poles: The Next Phase, optimal investments may
vary even within a single category of urban settlements (e.g., growth poles). As for the focus on
integrated investments, this is very much in line with EU-level thinking, manifested most prominently
through the introduction of the Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) instrument for 2014-2020. This is
also consistent with World Bank recommendations, which repeatedly call for designing projects within
coherent, comprehensive development strategies, irrespective of the source of financing (i.e., as a
response to the community’s needs, not simply as a precondition for accessing EU funds).

152. Equally important, the document lists several priorities for promoting sustainable urban
development, many of them well aligned with recommendations put forth by the World Bank in the
Competitive Cities report. The PA mentions the following:
    Support the development of cities’ economies by increasing their economic and demographic
       mass. This can be accomplished by shortening distances between major cities and their
       surrounding areas to ensure dynamic flows of people, capital, and ideas. A few other priorities
       mentioned under this heading cover the strengthening of the business environment through
       support for the services and manufacturing sectors, as well as through the redevelopment of
       former industrial sites (a major intervention area for 2007-2013 as well) that often enjoy a
       central location and are usually already connected to utility networks. The recognition of the
       importance of nurturing cities’ economic mass shows a deep understanding of urbanization
       dynamics and is also the main message promoted by the 2013 World Bank reports on Romania’s
       regional development.

                                                                                                             72
       Improve urban areas’ environmental quality. This covers increasing the energy efficiency of the
        dwelling stock, but also adopting measures to promote additional green spaces and a reduction
        in car traffic. Enhanced non-motorized mobility goes hand in hand with pedestrian- and bicycle-
        friendly areas, although the need to build more parking spaces (particularly around residential
        areas) is also featured prominently. The document does not fully address the tension between
        facilitating private vehicle use (through improved roads and parking, the target of many ROP
        projects between 2007 and 2013) and promoting non-motorized transportation for improved
        quality of life and health of the population.
       Support the development of basic infrastructure for Romanian cities. Without going into
        specifics, the PA rightly notes that the availability of public infrastructure is key for the optimal
        functioning of cities, influencing their accessibility and their attractiveness for investment,
        tourism, and other productive activities. Still, it is unclear what types of investments would fall
        under this broad category and where they would apply the most (e.g., in a small, mono-
        industrial town with crumbling infrastructure vs. a large, booming economic center).
       Promote social inclusion and urban mobility (including for disabled persons). This covers
        integrated and coordinated interventions in neighborhoods struggling with poverty and
        marginalization, both in downtown areas (e.g., historical centers) and in peripheral, isolated
        neighborhoods. The draft PA does not describe specific interventions, but merely highlights the
        need to design integrated strategies in the area of social inclusion. It also specifically mentions
        the need to support the mobility of disabled people to enable their access to opportunities. A
        potential gap in this draft version – and a primary area of focus in the World Bank reports – is
        the need to involve marginalized communities in how investment needs and projects are
        defined, designed, and implemented, focusing not just on physical infrastructure but also on soft
        measures to promote engagement and empowerment of these groups.
       Increase the quality of the public space and ensure an attractive urban landscape. Much like the
        Competitive Cities report, the PA notes that quality-of-life investments (for example, in the
        waterways crossing Romanian cities) are fundamental to retaining talent in growing urban
        areas. This is related to the above-cited priority on the environmental quality of urban areas.

153. Overall, there is almost full convergence between the draft PA and World Bank
recommendations, as they apply to urban settings and the future Regional Operational Programme.
This, along with the fact that the PA is, by design, well aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy, means
that it is easier to agree on a list of regional development priorities that would form the basis of the next
set of ROP selection criteria. At least at a macro level, it is safe to say that there is an emerging
consensus around the need to support: connectivity around major economic centers and between
leading and lagging areas; basic functioning institutions, meaning equal access to public services for all
Romanians, regardless of where they live; integration of marginalized groups; and quality-of-life
investments for continuous improvement of urban environments and retention of a talented worker
pool.

Adjusting selection models according to project size
154. Not all projects are created equal. Some projects are likely to have a larger impact (usually, but
not necessarily, the larger projects), while others will have more limited effects. Consequently, it is
important to distinguish between different types of projects when project selection models are devised.




                                                                                                          73
155. For the purposes of this analysis, and for the ROP 2014-2020, we propose that three types of
projects be considered: large projects, medium projects, and small projects. Large projects will be
those that exceed in value 100 million RON (this is the cut-off used to distinguish strategic projects in
the recent Government Emergency Ordinance 88/201322). Medium-sized projects will be considered
that have a value between 1.5 million RON and 100 million RON. Given that medium-sized projects
cover a large spectrum, a further refinement is proposed, to include: lower-middle-sized projects (with a
value between 1.5 million RON and 30 million RON) and upper-middle-sized projects (with a value
between 30 million RON and 100 million RON). Small projects have a value below 1.5 million.

156. In an ideal, best-practice scenario, selection methods would be tailored for projects based on
both size and complexity level. Thus, large projects, of a strategic nature, would ideally be included in a
comprehensive sector development strategy and would receive pre-allocated funding. Upper-middle
sized projects (e.g., those of strategic importance at the regional/local scale) would ideally be featured
in regional/local level strategies (for example, local or county development strategies in the case of
Romania) and may be subject to competitive selection (especially if many such projects are submitted).
Lower-middle sized projects may or may not be part of regional/local development strategies, and could
be subject to competitive selection, depending on the objectives that are hoped to be achieved. Small
projects usually come in very large numbers and have a limited local/regional impact, so it would be
optimal to apply simplified selection procedures in their case.

157. For the ROP 2007-2013, the largest share of contracted projects included medium-sized
investments – 90.5% of the total value of contracted ROP projects. Among those, it was the upper-
middle-sized projects (with a value between 30 million RON and 100 million RON) that dominated, with
274 contracted projects, an average value of nearly 57 million RON, and around 55% of the total value of
the contracted projects. There were only 9 large projects, with an average value of around 120 million
RON, and a 3.75% share of the total value of contracted projects. 5.74% of contracted funds were
allocated to small projects, with an average value of around 841,500 RON.

158. Overall, there seems to be an under-representation of large, strategic projects within the ROP
2007-2013. Given the amounts that were allocated to the ROP, and given the issues this operational
programme is supposed to address, it is surprising that only 9 large projects, with a share of 3.75% of
total funds, were selected. Moreover, none of these 9 projects were truly regional in nature. As the
table below indicates, all of these large projects were implemented by individual county councils and
local authorities. All of the 9 projects were road rehabilitation and/or modernization projects (under
Axis 2 of the ROP) – primarily because the Applicant’s Guides only permit Axis 2 projects to receive
funding of over 100 million RON.

159. For the 2014-2020 ROP, it will be critical to also focus on truly regional, strategic projects. For
the 2007-2013 programming period, there was no formal administrative body at the regional level,
which could act as a beneficiary and implement regional projects. For the 2014-2020 programming
period, this situation will likely endure although there are plans to move forward on the regionalization
process in 2014 (adopting these potential changes to the EU funds’ management framework will take
some time). In either case, it is important to think early on about solutions to implementing large
regional strategic projects. Even if the regionalization process will not be complete, it is important to
enable the development and implementation of cross-county projects (either by means of Inter-
Community Development Associations, partnerships, or through other administrative vehicles).

160.    Medium-sized projects, particularly upper-middle-sized projects, would ideally be part of
local/county development strategies. These are projects of considerable value, and it would be
important to provide a sound justification for their financing. Funds may be pre-allocated for such
investments (the way it was done for Growth Poles and Urban Development Poles under the 2007-2013
ROP), or the projects may be selected on a competitive or non-competitive (as currently) basis –
provided a number of eligibility, technical, and financial requirements are met. As the table below
indicates, the average project value financed through Integrated Urban Development Plans for the
2007-2013 Programming Period was below 30 million RON – 29 million RON for Growth Poles, 16 million
RON for Urban Development Poles, and 14 million RON for Urban Centers. In part, these low averages
are explained by the relatively low maximum project value thresholds set by the ROP Applicant Guides.

161.     Small projects should be selected following a simplified procedure. Currently, the largest
number of small projects is funded under KAI 4.3 (Support for micro-enterprises), with the average

1.5 million RON threshold.

162.     Finally, focusing on large, medium, and small projects, the way they are defined in this report,
may require the MA-ROP to revise the caps it currently imposes on individual projects. As the table
below indicates, the ROP 2007-2013 is primarily geared toward medium-sized projects, with the
maximum cap for small projects set at 1,700,000 RON, and with the minimum cap for large projects set
at around 85,000,000 RON. These minimum and maximum caps are just as good as the one proposed
above (the differences are relatively small). However, the MA-ROP may consider adjusting the minimum
threshold for large projects to 100,000,000 to follow the Ministry of Finance’s classification, and to
facilitate a coherent, unified approach at the government level. The threshold for small and upper-
middle-sized projects may also be adjusted, depending on the needs of the MA-ROP and depending on
the structure of the ROP 2014-2020.

Tailoring projects to regional needs
163. For the 2007-2013 programming period, all eight regions in Romania were treated the same.
All of them had a GDP per Capita that was below 75% of the EU average and, as such, all fell in one
category, without any further differences based on their relative development level. As the analysis in
the Competitive Cities report has shown though, there are stark differences between regions in
Romania. The most notable “outlier” is the Bucharest-Ilfov Region, which before the 2014-2020
programming period has registered significant growth and is now considered to be a developed region.
The other seven regions are considered to be less developed, and there are no transitioning regions yet
(the third category). Even so, there are important differences between the seven less developed regions.

164. The West Region, the Center Region, and the North West Region have higher overall economic
development levels than the North East Region, the South Region, or the South West Region. As such,
they have a different set of needs and priorities. Consequently, it may pay to have an additional level of
refinement when looking at regions and regional priorities. For example, Spain has four types of regions
for the 2007-2013 Programming Period (as defined by the EU): Convergence, Phasing out,
Competitiveness, and Phasing in. This, along with a national level commitment to decentralize
responsibilities and customize interventions based on local/regional needs, has allowed Spain to
approach EU funds’ priorities in a more nuanced way. Even if the same does not apply to Romania, it will
be important to take regional differences into consideration when designing the ROP 2014-2020.
Importantly, this does not presuppose the existence of a formal administrative level; even under the
current set-up, the ROP can be designed as a national-level programme with interventions and priorities
customized to fit the profile of each region.

165. As noted in the earlier section, the Competitive Cities report identified four key priorities as
critical for Romania at its current development stage:
     - Connective infrastructure for the country as a whole (particularly around urban centers and
          between leading and lagging areas);
     - Investments in basic living standards in less developed regions;
     - Targeted measures for marginalized communities; and
     - Quality of life investments in the most dynamic and competitive cities.

166. The Competitive Cities report further argues that while connective infrastructure is needed in
the country as a whole, it is of utmost importance in the more developed regions in the West of the
country. This would allow the dynamic cities in those regions to have better access to the rich markets
in the West, while at the same time connecting a larger population to the opportunities that these cities
offer, promoting urbanization and long-term growth.

167. To take the discussion from the Competitive Cities report a step further, we propose that a
different funding approach be taken for less developed regions (mainly the North East, South West,
South East, and South) and for more developed regions (mainly the West, Center, and North West).
București-Ilfov already is in its own category as Romania’s most developed region, and will most likely
have its own operational programme. Therefore:
     In lagging regions, priority should be given to:
             1) Investments in basic standards of living (e.g., 40% of available funding);
             2) Connective infrastructure (e.g., 30% of available funds);
             3) Measures targeted at marginalized communities (e.g. 20%); and
             4) Investments in quality of life in cities (e.g., 10%).
       In leading regions, priority should be given to:
             1) Connective infrastructure (e.g., 40% of available funds);
             2) Investments in quality of life in cities (e.g., 30%);
             3) Measures targeted at marginalized communities (e.g., 20%); and
             4) Investments in basic standards of living (e.g., 10%).
The main premise of this proposal is that lagging regions in Romania have an under-endowment of basic
services infrastructure (e.g., water, sewage, sanitation, education, health, social care) and also have
fewer funds at their disposal for investments in basic needs (see, for example, the maps below). At the
same time, the more developed regions in the West have both a better basic public services
infrastructure endowment and larger local/regional budgets for investment in such infrastructure. What
they lack, however, is a proper transportation network that could further benefit their growing
economies – e.g., by improving access to the rich markets in the West and by improving accessibility to
the most dynamic cities in the region. Of course, regional allocations also need to match Europe 2020
objectives and Romania has to hit the national-level targets in an effective and timely manner; that said,
there are no fundamental incompatibilities between the proposed framework and the country’s
commitments at the EU level.

168. The way funds were allocated and spent for the 2007-2013 programming period indicates that
little attention was paid to different regional needs and priorities. This would have allowed the most
developed cities in those regions to have better access to the rich markets in the West, while at the
same time connecting a larger population to the opportunities these cities offer. To allow us to better
compare investments made under the ROP 2007-2013 to actual regional needs, in Annex 11 we have
tried to assign to each type of activity funded a code corresponding to: connective infrastructure (CI),

                                                                                                       80
life standards (LS), marginalized communities (MC), and quality of life (QL). Most activities funded by
ROP fall neatly in these categories, with the mention that there was only a limited focus on marginalized
communities, and there was also an extra category focused on business development (primarily under
Axis 4), which will not be discussed here in great depth.

169. To simplify matters and help focus the analysis, we have primarily looked at Axes 1, 2, and 3
of the ROP 2007-2013. Axis 1 generally falls under the Quality of Life Investments category; Axis 2
focuses squarely of Connective Infrastructure; and Axis 3 primarily deals with improvements of Life
Standards. We have then compounded total contracted ROP funds under these three axes and have
mapped them at different administrative levels.

170. Quality of life investments show a clear pattern and a focus on the counties with the strongest
economic centers within the region. This is the result of targeted measures under the Growth Poles
policy, which has pre-allocated funds for the most dynamic cities in Romania. This approach, although it
may be viewed as top-down, has enabled a more strategic allocation of funds to the cities that have the
strongest polarization potential at the regional level.

171. Nonetheless, some inefficient allocation of funds does exist under Axis 1. For example, the
counties of Sibiu, Mureș, and Bihor are quite urban, have strong economic engines (Sibiu, Târgu Mureș,
and Oradea have larger economies than growth poles like Iași and Craiova, although they have a smaller
population), and would most likely have benefited more from urban investments than counties such as
Maramureș, Mehedinți, or Botoșani. Part of the reason for this occurrence is that while growth poles
and urban development poles had pre-allocated funds, urban centers (basically all other cities) had to
compete for funds. Inevitably, some cities have been more adept at accessing funds under Axis 1 than
others.
Figure 20. Quality of Life investments show a concentration of investments in the most dynamic cities regionally




                                                                                                              81
172. When it comes to investments in roads, there also seems to be a mismatch between needs
and investments. Less developed regions in the East and South have been more adept than more
developed regions at attracting funds for the rehabilitation and modernization of their roads (Axis 2 is
also the axis with the fastest absorption rate). However, good connective infrastructure is likely to have
the strongest positive effects in the more developed regions of the West, banking on the positive
market dynamics there. And, as we have seen earlier, these more developed regions in the West seem
to paradoxically have a less dense road infrastructure endowment than less developed regions.

173. For the 2014-2020 programming period, it will be important to identify strategic regional
infrastructure projects, which will enhance existing positive market dynamics. These projects should
have a comprehensive strategy at their base – e.g., the Regional Development Plans – and should clearly
indicate how they could help enhance positive regional market dynamics (e.g., better connecting people
to centers of growth and better connecting centers of growth to the rich markets in the West).

Figure 21. Less developed regions have benefited more from investments in roads than more developed regions




174. Life standard investments do seem to follow the expected pattern, with a higher
concentration in less developed regions and counties than in the more developed ones. As in the case
of road infrastructure investments, this may reflect the fact that less developed regions have received a
more generous funds allocation, and the fact that local/county authorities in less developed regions may

                                                                                                        82
have been more proactive at accessing EU funds. In any case, for 2014-2020, it may be worth
considering a more generous funds allocation for life standard investments in less developed regions
(which have a net deficit in this respect over more developed regions), and a lower allocation for more
developed regions.

     Figure 22. Life standard investments seem to follow the expected pattern (higher in lagging regions)

VII. Proposals for Project Selection Models

ROP 2014-2020 Project Selection Models: Comparative Scenario Assessment
175. In choosing improved project selection models for the ROP 2014-2020, there is value in
comparing the main features, strengths, and weaknesses of multiple potential scenarios. The starting
point is, naturally, the previous analysis of the current system, which has exposed both positive features
and areas that require adjustments. But before looking at each scenario individually, this chapter
proposes a framework for assessing the various options based on six fundamental requirements
(efficiency, effectiveness, clarity, fairness, transparency, and feasibility) and four key objectives
(absorption, impact, legitimacy, and capacity).

176. The figure below conveys precisely this message, making the case that an optimal project
selection model for the next ROP will need to accomplish all four targets. Put differently, a model may
be wonderful for promoting quick absorption of EU funds, but it may fail to deliver value for money and
resources could be wasted on low-impact interventions. Similarly, if a model is not legitimate (i.e., with
clear and transparent evaluation criteria and fair selection procedures), not enough ROP applicants will
demonstrate interest in the program, so there will be an inherent limitation on what the model can
accomplish. Last but not least, any proposed change needs to be more than just a theoretical framework
that promises to deliver great results in the abstract; indeed, selection models have to work in practice,
keeping in mind the system’s stringent capacity constraints.

177. Based on these general principles, three scenarios are worth considering in terms of the
overall project selection model per se:
    Scenario 1 (“Status Quo+”): The main characteristics of the system remain unchanged, with a
        few tweaks (e.g., excluding the full Cost-Benefit Analysis from the formal assessment, making
        the Detailed Technical Design optional at the evaluation phase, etc.) to correct current
        weaknesses. This option capitalizes on the ROP system’s accumulated experience and leverages
        the benefits of predictability. Essentially, the two selection procedures remain the same: pre-
        allocation for growth poles and urban development poles (with the potential inclusion of all
        county seats as UDPs); and first-in-first-out for all other projects.
       Scenario 2 (“Semi-Competitive”): This variation applies different selection methods based on
        project size and beneficiary type. Project size tends to be a good proxy for both complexity and
        potential impact. Under this scenario, large regional projects (type 1) would enjoy dedicated
        funding. Medium-sized investments by counties, growth poles, and urban development poles
        (type 2) would be selected in two phases: (1) dedicated funding for a limited period of time; and
        (2) selection based on FIFO for the remaining pool of funding allocated to these types of
        beneficiaries. For other cities, as well as for private and non-profit applicants (type 3), the FIFO
        rule would apply, regardless of whether the project is small (under 1.5 million RON) or more
        significant (over 1.5 million RON). Ultimately, this is a “semi-competitive” model, as a “middle-
        of-the-road” option, although applications are not compared or scored against each other under
        either FIFO or a dedicated funding model, regardless of the type of project under consideration.
       Scenario 3 (“Competitive”): This scenario maintains the FIFO selection rule for a limited set of
        projects, namely the smallest ones under 1.5 million RON, while also setting aside dedicated
        funding for the largest regional projects. For counties, growth poles, and urban development
        poles, the funding would be allocated in two phases, much like for the previous scenario, with a
        key difference: the phase 2 reallocation is done on the basis of competitive ranking for projects
        under each axis, based on either quantitative (scenario 3A) or qualitative (scenario 3B) criteria.
Figure 24. The three scenarios considered propose a range of different adjustments to the status quo model




                                                                                                             86
The figure above summarizes the main features of the three options, for each applicable type of project.
As this report argues, choosing an optimal selection model is a challenging task and may involve several
quintessential tradeoffs: between impact (effectiveness) and absorption (efficiency); between needed
changes and predictability/continuity; and between ideal outcomes and practical feasibility given
capacity constraints.

178. Importantly, the current work does not propose selection models that vary by sector. Instead,
the size of a proposed intervention is the key variable that determines how a project should be
evaluated, selected, and contracted. This is in line with broader thinking on integrated interventions
(something the ROP is uniquely positioned to deliver on because of its focus on the broad field of
regional development) and a move away from sector-specific procedures. In fact, there is value in
putting forth standardized selection models and criteria that allow for easy comparisons across projects,
regardless of their thematic focus.

179. Using the PIM framework, this report offers an assessment of the current ROP’s selection
model based primarily on a project’s typical cycle (from preparation through implementation). This
chapter builds on these insights and organizes them under two primary headings: (1) minimum
recommended improvements, which apply horizontally to all three scenarios (including the “Status
Quo+”); and (2) comparative strengths and weaknesses of each of the three project selection scenarios,
taking into account the specific features of non-competitive vs. competitive selection, FIFO vs. pre-
allocation, etc. Under both sections, this assessment applies the same overall PIM approach to show
corresponding changes for each different stage in a project’s cycle.

180. A complementary way of segmenting recommendations in this section is separating “the
WHAT” from “the HOW” and “the WHO.” Specifically: the selection model and criteria per se (i.e., “the
WHAT,” as covered more extensively through the three different scenarios presented under the second
section); the process and procedures through which the model delivers on its objectives of choosing
optimal projects (i.e., “the HOW,” covered primarily in the next section on minimal adjustments); and
the key stakeholders who essentially spin the wheels of the project selection model in practice (i.e., “the
WHO,” covering the MA, IB, and beneficiary staff working on ROP projects). The figure below provides
several examples that fit under each category.

Scenario 1- “Status Quo+”
181. Scenario 1 starts from the premise that one should not change a system that is working well.
The Regional Operational Programme is the best performing OP and the project selection system that is
currently in place has been continuously improved and has been adapted to challenges, needs, and
problems that have arisen throughout the process. As such, the current system is well known by all
parties involves (the MA, the RDAs, and the beneficiaries that have accessed ROP funds). Continuing
with the current selection system basically means that there will be no lost time trying to learn and
adapt to a new system. This, as well as the accumulated experience in previous years, will save time in
the implementation of the selection system, and will ultimately help drive up absorption.

criteria: absorption; impact; legitimacy; and feasibility.
 CRITERIA                        ADVANTAGES                          DISADVANTAGES

                    This scenario may help drive absorption,                     Two key systemic issues which significantly affect
                     maintaining the strengths of the actual system and            absorption rates are not addressed: public
                     the capacity that has been built in 7 years of                procurement and the administrative/management

                     implementing a new system.                                   The pre-allocation system can reduce absorption

                   value-for-money principle, and since it is easier and     with significant potential to boost development
                   cheaper to use than the CBA approach, it may              regionally.

184.   A general scheme of Scenario 1 is provided in Annex 12.



Scenario 2 - “Semi-competitive”
185. Scenario 2 starts from the premise that a significantly higher impact can be achieved if funds
are pre-allocated for a number of strategic projects. To achieve maximum impact, it is proposed that
funds be targeted at regions, counties, growth poles, and county capital cities. The decision to extend

                                                                                                                           90
the list of cities with pre-allocated funding form urban development poles to county capitals came out of
the analysis for the Growth Poles projects, which indicates that in economic terms there are often small
differences between cities of smaller size. Moreover, there are county capitals, such as Slatina, which
have a higher economic output than urban development poles like Brăila, Satu Mare, Bacău, or Suceava.
County capitals also serve as administrative centers and centers of service provision. We have also
decided to include county councils among the administrative units that receive dedicated funding, as a
way of helping them target investments in a more strategic way – i.e., projects should be drawn from a
comprehensive county development strategy.

186. Four types of projects are envisaged within this framework. The four types were designed to
allow a balance between impact and absorption – i.e., allow some smaller projects to move faster
through the system, while also trying to select a number of larger, more strategic projects. The
individual types are described below.

187. Type 1: Large Regional Projects. This type is specifically designed to enable the funding of truly
regional projects of over 100 million RON. Due to a number of limitations (e.g., lack of an administrative
tier at the regional level), there have been only a few truly regional projects that implemented under the
ROP 2007-2013. For the ROP 2014-2020, it would be important to consider targeting a number of
strategic regional projects within each region. Such investments can be drawn from the Regional
Development Plans and would be strategically screened by the Managing Authority of the ROP. It is also
important to consider that the newly passed Government Emergency Ordinance 88/2013 indicates that
the Ministry of Finance will do an additional vetting for projects of more than 100 million RON, leaving
open the possibility that this additional filter would apply to EU-funded interventions. The criteria for
the prioritization of large projects (over 100 million RON) that receive state budget funding are included
in Annex 13.

188. Type 2: Integrated Development Strategies. This type targets growth poles, county councils,
and county capitals, primarily aiming for large projects and upper-middle-sized projects. The idea is to
have pre-allocated funding for all major sub-regional administrative units, but with an important twist:
given that in the 2007-2013 programming period absorption has been rather sluggish under Axis 1 (as
funds were guaranteed for growth poles and urban development poles), this scenario proposes a two-
staged approach. Thus, each county, each growth pole, and each county capital would receive dedicated
funding, but it would have to contract allocated sums within a set timeframe (e.g., no longer than 2-3
years). All funds that are not contracted go into a competitive pool and can then be accessed on a First-
In-First-Out basis by other similar administrative units (counties can access un-accessed funds from
other counties, cities can access un-accessed funds from other cities, all within the same region). In
addition to pre-allocated funds, growth poles, counties, and county capitals, will be able to access an
open pool of funds (the way it is done currently) on a First-In First-Out basis, after contracting pre-
allocated funds.

189. Type 3: FIFO Selection of Medium-Sized Projects. Type 3 follows the current selection model, as
it is applied to Axes 2, 3, 4, and 5, with the improvements that were mentioned before the scenario
discussion. All types of beneficiaries can apply for funding under Type 3: public authorities, private
companies, NGOs, and Local Action Groups (LAGs) (which would implement CLLD projects).

193. A general scheme of Scenario 2, as well as a discussion around the PIM framework of each
type of project, is provided in Annex 12.

Scenario 3 - “Competitive”
194. Like Scenario 2, Scenario 3 proposes that projects be selected differently depending on their
size. Projects of smaller size follow simplified selection procedures and less demanding selection criteria.
There are four types of projects. Type 1 projects, “regional-impact projects”, are large investments, with
values of at least 100 million RON. Applicants are associations of counties or potential future regional
administrative entities. Type 2 projects, “county/growth pole/urban development pole projects,” are
upper-medium-sized projects of more than 30 million RON, proposed by counties, growth poles, or
county capitals. Type 3 projects are medium-sized projects of more than 1.5 million RON and less than
100 million RON, put forth by local administrations, private sector entities, NGOs, or Local Action Groups
(LAGs) (who would implement Community Led Local Development – CLLD – projects). Type 4 projects
are small, under 1.5 million RON, submitted by local administration, private sector firms, NGOs, and
LAGs. The table below provides a summary of the four project types proposed.

195. The budget allocation for the next ROP will be more flexible within and among project types.
The central Managing Authority (MA) will allocate funds to each region. Within this regional allocation,
the MA will set a certain percentage for each type of project and a percentage range within which each
region can decide how much funding it will allocate for each type of project. For example, the MA
decides that 25% of the total funds allocated for each region will be used for Type 1 projects and that
each region can allocate between 20% and 30% of the total funds based on the region’s priorities and
availability of project proposals for Type 2 projects. Within this range set by the MA for each type of
project and requirements set by the EU, each region can decide on the fund allocation among project
types. This flexibility in budget allocation would ensure that it still meets the main objectives of the ROP
and, at the same time, it remains tailored to the regional priorities and capacity in ROP implementation
of each region, for enhanced absorption of ROP funds.

196. Pre-determined funds allocation to applicants through Integrated Development Plans may
encourage planning and integration of investments, but also create incentives for delays in project
submission and low quality projects. In order to promote the strengths and reduce the weaknesses of
the current pre-allocation model, this report proposes a “semi pre-allocation” model. Thus, total funds
allocated for Type 2 projects would be divided into two phases: the majority of the total funds would be
pre-allocated to applicants in Phase 1; and a smaller share would be entered into a competitive pool in
Phase 2. For example, 50% of funds could be available for contracting within the first three years, and
50% for the last four years. The funds for Phase 2 will comprise the competitive funds allocated at the
beginning of the period, as well as un-contracted pre-allocated funds from Phase 1. The competition will
be within priority axes and between similar types of applicants. Specifically, competitive funds for Phase

                                                                                                                  95
2 and non-committed dedicated funds from Phase 1 for counties are available in Phase 2 for
competitively selected projects among all counties within a region. Competitive funds for Phase 2 and
non-committed dedicated funds from Phase 1 for growth poles and urban development poles are
available in Phase 2 for competitively selected projects among all growth poles and urban development
poles within a region. This semi-competitive model, i.e., non-competitive among applicants in Phase 1
and competitive among applicants in Phase 2 will ensure that no applicants are left behind and it will
also reward more engaged and capable applicants.

197. Type 3 projects would be selected competitively based on a thorough technical and financial
evaluation or by using a more qualitative assessment method. There would be a restricted call for
proposals embedding strategic criteria, after which evaluators will rank projects against each other
within each priority axis. It will be important to have sufficient capacity available to properly process all
applications at this stage, particularly during peak times.

198. Finally, type 4 projects will maintain the current FIFO rule. In this case (i.e., smaller investments
with reduced strategic impact), it makes sense to preserve the status quo system and its inherent
benefits, including an accelerated absorption rate. In addition, there should be simplified forms and
procedures to reflect the smaller value of these types of projects.

199. Applicants will have opportunities for improving projects at the feasibility study stage.
Independent evaluators, upon conducting the technical and financial evaluation/desk review, and after
the site visits, will not only give scores but also recommendations for project improvements. Applicants
would then enhance projects according to the recommendations and evaluators would verify the
adjustments made and give final evaluation scores. Projects will be selected based on these final scores.

200. Strategic screening is one of the key determinants for the success of the proposed selection
models. Therefore, strategic screening criteria, procedures, and committees require very careful design.
Strategic screening can be done by a RCSEC-like strategic screening committee comprising both central
and regional representatives and based on objective measurable criteria and clear procedures
(proposed by the MA and approved by the Monitoring Committee of the ROP). The new strategic
committees must have the following features: clear criteria and procedures for member selection; a
balanced structure for membership composition; and clear criteria and detailed procedures for strategic
prioritization. Annex 4 includes a more complete proposal for a new strategic committee. Screening
criteria will be based on strategic documents, among which Regional Development Plans currently
drafted for the 2014-2020 period are some of the most important guidelines. The draft RDPs put an
emphasis on comparative and competitive advantages specific to each region, ensuring a better link to
strategic program-level objectives. Annex 6 includes an analysis of the 2014 – 2020 RDPs.

202. Lastly, it needs to be mentioned here that, while the suggested move toward more
competitive selection models is generally positive, there are certain downsides of competitive
approaches (e.g., related to capacity needs when preparing and processing calls, narrowing the
range of beneficiaries, longer waiting times on decisions). Obviously, as with all systems, trade-
offs need to be made, but it is important to keep in mind potential capacity-building needs.
Capacity building should be an important consideration in response to problems, which are
likely to arise due to the introduction of new and complex systems.

203. The advantages and disadvantages of this scenario are discussed below, looking at
four key criteria: absorption; impact; legitimacy; and feasibility:

                   (i.e., regions, counties, and cities will have to have

204. A general scheme of Scenario 3, as well as a discussion around the PIM framework of
each type of project, is provided in Annex 12.




                                                                                                              100
VIII. Improving the Current Evaluation and Selection System

205. The purpose of this section is to propose a series of improvements to the ROP’s
current evaluation and selection model – these recommendations would apply to all three
scenarios described above. The discussion will be split into two sections: the first part of the
discussion will cover general aspects of the evaluation and selection system; the second part will
focus more on the mechanics and proposed marginal changes to the current evaluation and
selection system, particularly the Technical and Financial evaluation grids. This will be followed
by a number of other chapters, which will discuss in more detail distinct proposals made for
individual scenarios, with a particular focus on the “Semi-Competitive” and “Competitive”
options. Annex 25 discusses some of the new requirements of the European Commission when
it comes to project selection, with a stronger emphasis on project outcomes and impact.


Recommended adjustments for all proposed selection models
206. Regardless of the scenario ultimately chosen, there is a set of changes that promise to
deliver improved outcomes relative to one or several of the key objectives – absorption,
impact, legitimacy, and capacity. Recommendations span multiple stages in the PIM
framework, from project preparation through actual evaluation and contracting, and they are
meant to apply all possible scenarios under consideration. In that sense, these are minimal
changes that the status quo requires in order to ensure better project selection under the ROP
2014-2020.

Strategic assessment of Integrated Development Plans
207. Integrated development plans have been the main tool used by the ROP 2007-2013 to
fund more strategic and impactful projects, by focusing investments on the largest regional
urban centers. To achieve their objective, it is important to have high-quality Integrated
Development Plans. This means that proper application guides are needed, requiring critical
information, along with proper screening procedures to ensure that IDPs meet quality
requirements.23

208. The screening procedures used currently focus primarily on administrative issues and
do not really permit a strategic assessment of these documents. The figures in the Annex 14
indicate how IDPs are screened for Growth Poles, Urban Development Poles, and Urban
Centers. The interesting thing is that screening procedures vary for these different types of
cities, and screening criteria do not necessarily encourage the elaboration of good documents.

209. The table below provides an overview of actual evaluation criteria for growth poles
and urban development poles, and ways in which these criteria could be improved:




23
  It is important to note that this discussion on IDPs is done considering that IDPs will continue to be the main tool
used to assess pre-selected projects. Later on, this report discusses the option of doing pre-allocation based on
existing development strategies and a Capital Investment Plan.
                                                                                                                    101

                                             be sufficient fiscal/budgetary space in the future for these
                                             expenditures? How this budgetary space will be
                                             created/covered?

                                             J. Management arrangements are clear and credible to

210. Such criteria should not be used only for IDPs developed for cities, but also for IDPs
developed for other administrative units (e.g., counties). Similar evaluation criteria may be
used by the MA-ROP to vet Regional Development Plans and ensure that these meet quality
standards.

211. Below we have provided a number of key strategic categories and evaluation
criteria/questions, which could form the basis of the assessment of a development strategy:

       STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT :
           o Does the project align with ROP objectives? (If not, remove from pipeline / redirect to
               other)
           o Is the project needed by the community?
           o Does it align with existing strategies at various levels (e.g., regional, county, sectoral,
               etc.)?
           o If not already captured in an existing strategy, is it aligned with the people's needs and
               expectations? What proof do we have of that (e.g., surveys, petitions, consultations,
               etc.)?
       CAPACITY
           o Two critical sub-components: Human and Financial Resources
           o Will this project be carried through by a qualified team?
           o Does it have sufficient resources for its timely completion, from project preparation
               through implementation and post-implementation?
           o Bonus points if project is already partly implemented, if they already have a technical
               project, etc.
       QUALITY
           o Technical and financial
           o Does the project put forth the most effective technical solution for achieving its
               objectives?
           o Does the project propose the most efficient financial solution?
           o Or, put differently, in balancing efficiency and effectiveness, is the solution proposed
               optimal?
       SUSTAINABILITY:
           o Is the project self-sustainable in the long term? If yes, how?
           o If not, are there resources allocated to cover the net deficit post-completion?

Introduction of Applications for Pre-Qualification (APQ)
212. Particularly for programs where many submissions are likely, the introduction of an
application for pre-qualification (APQ) phase would help improve the system’s efficiency and
reduce duplication for both beneficiaries and MA/IB staff. Essentially, the goal of the APQ is to
provide a first filter of applicants who intend to submit an application for ROP financing. For
applicants, the APQ provides the opportunity to validate their project ideas and required
documentation before actually investing all the required resources into preparing an entire
application. This would avoid instances of potential beneficiaries who find out late in the
process that the fact that they are missing a certain property document means that their project
is not eligible for ROP funding. Moreover, an effective APQ would not simply turn applicants
away from the program, but rather it would try to guide them into the right direction, either
toward additional recommended steps before an actual application can be submitted or toward
another Operational Programme, as needed. In this sense, the APQ is part of the broader

                                                                                                      103
support and guidance mechanisms available to interested applicants, who can leverage the IBs’
points of contact to exchange preliminary ideas on various possible interventions and their
likelihood to succeed. At the same time, it is important to consider that there may be some
restrictions for using APQs for Competitive Calls. The Germany case study in Annex 10 indicates
that a balance has to be found between support and preferential treatment of applicants.

213. An APQ can also be a relatively easy and cost-effective way to reduce the burden on
MA and particularly IB staff, who have to go through all applications submitted for the
administrative and eligibility check. It would mean that critical resources actually focus more of
their time on those viable project ideas that actually have a shot at receiving ROP funding,
provided they receive a favorable evaluation. This would help reduce the pressure, particularly
during peak times (e.g., before a submission deadline), and promises to also lower the average
processing time for all applications that end up entering the pipeline and passing the initial APQ.
At the same time, it is important to keep in mind that adding this new filter will require some
additional resources, especially at the IB level, where specialists should be available to discuss
with interested applicants and provide both formal and informal feedback throughout the APQ
process.

214. A February 2012 report on “Comparative Study of the Project Selection Process
Applied in Cohesion Policy Programmes 2007-2013” recommends the introduction of APQ
under certain conditions. In particular, the assessment praises the Czech Republic and Germany
for instituting such a process with relatively good results. The authors conclude: “APQ
procedures effectively filter out projects that are not eligible and do not fit into the funding
scheme, at an early stage of the process. Hence, early feedback is provided to applicants on
their chances of success, which reduces uncertainty and the administrative burden […] at the
first stage, which is less extensive and time consuming than the second (formal application).”24
For example, in both the Czech Republic and Germany, the APQ form is brief and simple, and it
is also available online. In fact, a staggering 90% of applications in Germany are submitted
electronically, which is another recommendation of this report and of the concurrent World
Bank work on MA-IB collaboration and ROP beneficiary support. The same report cited earlier
introduces the idea of an online self-check tool that would allow interested applicants to receive
instantaneous feedback on whether their idea is eligible under a particular program. This
solution would not only create an easy way to guide applicants at a very early stage in the
project preparation process, but it would require very little resources on the part of the IBs/MA,
and could also be scaled up relatively easy.

215. Importantly, the current help desks established at the RDA level effectively fulfill a
similar role, although their intervention is limited – i.e., demand-driven. In other words,
helpdesks intervene only when an interested applicant comes forward with a question related
to the procedures/criteria/etc. It is required that all projects go through this initial check, which
is why some applicants make it further into the process than necessary. An expansion of the
helpdesk functions to cover the full set of applicants, in a more formal pre-qualification phase,
remains a recommendation worth considering for the future ROP – certainly, it would be
preferable to build on the already existing infrastructure (i.e., helpdesk specialists, where
available and where properly trained). The figure below synthesizes the arguments presented in
this sub-section.

         •     The introduction of an application for prequalification (APQ) phase would redirect projects that
               are unlikely to succeed under the ROP toward more suitable opportunities
         •     This would enable beneficiaries to save time and look for eligible opportunities
         •     IB/MA would face more manageable workloads by putting only eligible projects through a formal
               evaluation



Elimination of Cost-Benefit Analysis for Small and Medium-Sized Projects
216. The requirement to include a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) for ROP projects submitted
during the 2007-2013 cycle has generated a range of negative unintended consequences. In
effect, the initial push toward using this instrument derived from a desire to ensure that ROP-
financed interventions are truly impactful, with benefits outweighing costs. In theory, the CBA is
indeed a powerful tool used around the world to determine whether a particular project is
worth undertaking and, ceteris paribus, it provides more complete information than a simple
Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA). In practice, however, the introduction of the CBA did not align
well with the current capacity constraints specific to the Romanian context of structural funds
management and implementation.

217. As noted earlier in this report, the reasons for why the CBA did not deliver on its
intended goals are multiple-fold. First, the data needed to substantiate various assumptions
about anticipated costs and benefits are often hard to access and, in some cases, do not exist at
all. Ironically, the costs incurred with running a proper CBA (e.g., collecting, processing, and
interpreting data) often exceed the anticipated benefits – put differently, the CBA of a CBA, for a
typical ROP project, would likely result in a negative net present value. Second, even if this
endeavor was worth it, most beneficiaries do not have the internal capacity to implement a
comprehensive CBA, while external consultants with adequate experience in deploying this tool
are too few and in high demand.

218. In addition, evaluators who are supposed to determine whether a CBA is accurate
have not always taken the time to validate the assumptions behind calculations presented
within submitted proposals. As part of the field research for this project, a range of interviews

                                                                                                                  105
with RDA representatives revealed, once again, the lack of accountability mechanisms for
ensuring quality evaluations. In other words, there are no strong incentives for evaluators to ask
clarifying questions to unveil how applicants determined a project’s costs and benefits. This,
coupled with the lowest-cost selection criterion for evaluators, opened the door to cutting
corners and simply “checking the box” if the internal rate of return was above the agreed
threshold, even in instances where the calculations were based on unrealistic assumptions (e.g.,
increase in customers by an order of magnitude, underestimated operations and maintenance
costs for the long term, etc.). For such reasons, the CBA is a good example of a powerful and
useful concept (in theory) that has generated significant challenges in practice, sometimes
failing to promote better impact projects, while often slowing down absorption, further
burdening the system’s capacity, and reducing the credibility of evaluation results.

219. In addition to its practical shortcomings, the CBA is not legally mandatory for ROP
projects. On the national level, Government Decision 28/2008 and the more recent Government
Emergency Ordinance 88/2013 note that CBAs should be included for major projects, i.e., over
100 million RON (22.2 million EUR). As noted earlier in this report, the current caps on ROP
project sizes exclude de facto the requirement for a CBA. At the European level, the EU Guide to
Cost Benefit Analysis of Investment Projects notes: “Cohesion Policy regulations require a cost-
benefit analysis of all major investment projects applying for assistance from the Funds. The
legal threshold for the definition of the ‘major’ investment is 50 million EUR in general, but for
environmental projects it is 25 million EUR and for IPA assisted projects, 10 million EUR.” None
of these criteria apply to ROP projects for the current budgeting cycle and it is likely that this will
not change during the next programming period, i.e., no ROP project would exceed 50 million
EUR.

220. In sum, a full economic CBA is not recommended as a selection criterion for small and
medium-sized projects given the lack of detailed guidelines and lack of a proper quality
control process to audit the CBA analyses. CBA should be required where it is mandatory under
EU guidelines based on project size. Instead of CBA, project selection could instead rely on: (a)
the participatory political planning process undertaken by local authorities to identify local
priorities, develop strategies and plans, and select/vote on projects; and (b) results-based
indicators of project outputs or services according to the sector/project type. Where feasible,
these indicators should focus on the primary beneficiaries or users and degree of benefit (for
example, traffic flow on a road and the time saving per trip.) Indicators of outputs or service
delivery from a project can be used as a selection criterion. A full CBA includes consideration
and valuation of all the externalities generated by a project. Many externalities can be assumed
to be achieved if the project is consistent with national standards for safety, pollution, etc.,
rather than attempting to estimate their value for each project. For example, a road should be
technically designed in terms of national standards that reflect safety standards in terms of lane
width, camber, drainage, signage, etc. The selection criteria should be limited to the
determination that the design standards have been achieved.

221. One alternative to the full Cost-Benefit Analysis is the Cost Effectiveness Analysis
(CEA), which can maintain a rigorous focus on achieving the desired outcome through the best
possible means, while entailing simpler procedures and a lower burden on the ROP system’s
capacity. Cost-effectiveness focuses on measuring the unit cost of producing key outputs
(services, results or “effects”) or possibly final outcomes in the economy. Generally, it is
expected that projects with lower unit costs of production should be selected as promoting

                                                                                                  106
technical efficiency. Alternatively, when comparing two projects of similar type and scale, for
example, two county rural roads, the project with the higher expected “effects” should be
selected, assuming they have similar underlying designs and costs per kilometer. In the case of a
road, the effects could be measured at minimum as the highest daily traffic flow or better as the
highest total time saved per day. The formal calculation of unit costs of an “effect” is covered in
Annex 21.

222.     The table below compares the CBA to the CEA, noting the comparative advantages of
the latter, as well as some instances where the former may still be appropriate to use . All in
all, the CEA is easier to implement by ROP applicants and also easier to evaluate by experts
contracted at the MA/IB level, thereby the expectation is that the quality and timing of both
project preparation and evaluation will improve. At the same time, the CBA does not need to be
completely excluded from the selection model. In some cases, it can still provide useful inputs,
particularly for more complex, larger projects that involve a set of different integrated
interventions (e.g., Type 1 projects, Integrated Territorial Investments – ITI, etc.).

223. For all its benefits, the CEA is not a foolproof method either. Some of its limitations
include:
         a. A project can deliver multiple services or affect a range of outcomes in an
            economy either directly or indirectly. The CBA aims to put a value on each of these
            effects or outcomes and aggregate the benefits and costs of these into a total net
            benefit – the CEA does not. In some cases, a weighted average index of effects can
            be used to measure the project effect – for example, a grade point average could be
            used to measure the overall improvement caused by the upgrading of an
            educational institution providing training in a number of disciplines.

        b. The effect of a project typically has at least two dimensions –an indicator of the
           number of users and the change in value per user (basically, the impact of a project
           on quantity and price of a service). For example, a road improvement can benefit
           existing users as well as induce an increase in road users. At the same time, the
           most of the gain to the road users arises from time saved per trip. Other gains also
           come from savings in fuel efficiency, wear and tear on vehicles, decreased
           accidents, etc. The measurement of the impact of a project will be limited only if the
           traffic flow is known (but this is clearly better than not knowing the traffic flow.) The
           effects are better measured if the time saving can also be estimated from improved
           average speeds. These two measures can be combined into a better measure as the
           total amount of time saved by users of the road. In a CBA, this gets converted into a
           value based on the marginal values of labor market time of the types of road users.

        c. In some sectors, the immediate output effects are not good indicators of the
           ultimate economic impact; outcome measures are preferred measures of project
           effects. While in the case of road improvements the effects on traffic flows and

                                                                                                     108
             speeds captures most of the economic gains,25 in other sectors such as health the
             outcomes are more important indicators of benefits. Given the impact of medical
             treatment can have a wide range of impacts on different populations in various
             environments and sometimes with delayed effects or over long periods of time (a
             vaccination today may protect someone over a long period, but also have no impact
             if the person is never exposed to the infection), the preferred approach is to focus
             on outcome measures. While the unit cost of medical service delivery is important
             for budgeting or contracting purposes, for economic decision-making purposes, the
             unit cost of the outcome of a medical service is more important. Hence, estimates
             of the unit cost of saving a life (preventing a death) or adding a year to the life of a
             patient is the preferred approach. This preferred approach demands extensive
             epidemiological data to be able to estimate the impact of different treatments on
             different target populations over time.

224. While the CEA is a simpler and more straightforward method compared to the CBA, it
is not always a good replacement. Of the eight Member Countries that were analyzed in the
Case Study section, none used a full CEA approach, and only a few used the CBA for larger
projects. For example, in Germany, a CBA analysis has to be carried out for strategically
important projects (even if their value is below 50 million Euro) and for infrastructure
investments of over 10 million Euro. Moreover, the CBA can be used to show the overall
strength of an individual project, but it cannot be used to compare projects (i.e., in a
competitive approach). Annex 22 provides an elegant mathematical explanation for why the
CBA cannot be used in comparative selection systems.

Introduce, promote, and build capacity for the adoption of the FIDIC contract forms
225. In particular, the FIDIC standard contract forms would help beneficiaries manage
complex projects better, while protecting the interests of all stakeholders involved. FIDIC,
which stands for the International Federation of Consulting Engineers, is an international private
organization that has developed since the 1950s various contract forms to facilitate the
implementation of infrastructure and construction projects. Gradually, the superior quality of
these proposed forms has translated into more and more people adopting them around the
world. The main benefits of the FIDIC contracts revolve around a balanced sharing of risks
between the beneficiary and the contractor and a greater degree of familiarity of international
investors with the specific conditions and procedures mandated by these contracts. Indeed, the
FIDIC contracts have already demonstrated their usefulness by covering those situations that
may arise during the project’s implementation and having clear mechanisms for resolving them
in a fair and transparent manner. Since both beneficiaries and service providers benefit from
adopting the FIDIC contract (compared to other formats that may expose one of the parties to
greater risks), this practice has taken deep roots in the vast majority of developed countries, as
well as for projects implemented by multilateral development banks.

226. Recognizing the benefits of the FIDIC forms, the Romanian Government has made a
previous attempt at institutionalizing this practice. A 2007-2008 PHARE project was meant to
translate the FIDIC framework into Romanian and adapt it to the local context, which further led

  Alternative approaches to measuring the economic impacts of road improvements are through the measurement
of the present value of the profits of businesses (including farms, mines, hotels, etc) affected by the road
improvement or by measuring the changes in land values that capitalize the gains to owners of residential and
commercial properties affected by a road improvement.
                                                                                                           109
to a common order by the Ministers of Finance, Transportation, and Regional Development in
June 2008. This act made the FIDIC form required for beneficiaries of EU-funded projects, in one
of three versions: red, for executing construction works based on a technical project provided by
the beneficiary; yellow, for design-and-build contracts; and green, appropriate for projects
under EUR 500,000 and subcontracting work. By May 2009, it became clear that the application
of FIDIC was not optimal and another order by the three aforementioned Ministries eliminated
the requirement of using FIDIC. The following key reasons were responsible for the ultimate
failure of this first attempt at expanding the use of the standard contract forms:

        The initial order making FIDIC required was issued in June 2008 and began applying in
         July of the same year, leaving virtually no room for proper training of beneficiaries on
         how to use this complex instrument.
        The order made the application of FIDIC extremely rigid, stipulating both “general” and
         “specific” conditions. Normally, the latter type should be customized by beneficiaries for
         each project under implementation, but this was not possible given the order’s format
         at the time, which included an actual contract template. As JASPERS noted in a recent
         study, “it is recommended not to impose special conditions by law but to provide
         guidance and leave contracting authorities adapt special conditions to each project
         particulars.”26
        The order was insufficiently aligned to applicable legislation and, moreover, it was
         superseded by legislative acts with superior power – including Government Decisions.
         Some of the terminology was poorly translated from the common law system, without a
         proper equivalent in under Romanian law. This created significant confusion among
         beneficiaries, who did not always know which rules to follow.
            Figure 27. Selecting the right type of contract (i.e., FIDIC color) is relatively simple

227. This brief analysis suggests that the reintroduction of FIDIC for ROP-financed contracts
should be much more carefully planned and delivered. First, there should be ample time for
public consultations and trainings regarding how to apply and enforce different types of FIDIC
contracts. Second, the process should be officially launched only after fully aligning the FIDIC
contract form to the current Romanian legislation and, moreover, there should be a
Government Decision mandating the use of FIDIC (as opposed to a Minister order, which is
superseded by any government decisions that are at odds with the standard contract form). This
was the solution adopted by the Ministry of Transportation in order to facilitate the use of FIDIC
for the Transport Operational Programme. Last but not least, only the general FIDIC conditions
should be specified by law, leaving the specific conditions flexible enough to be customized to
the needs of each project. Undoubtedly, aligning FIDIC fully with Romanian legislation is a
precondition of any efforts to promote beneficiary use of this contract form, and indeed this will
not be an easy task. As noted by interviewed experts in this field, the FIDIC system was
developed based on the UK’s legal system (common law), which is markedly different than the
Romanian one (civil law). In the past, there have been challenges in translating certain terms
(e.g., “reasonable profit”) and in making sure that Romanian courts can understand and uphold
FIDIC. As noted earlier, extensive preparation will be needed in some areas (legal, capacity
development, etc.).

Evaluation Recommendations
228. Three additional recommendations concern the technical and financial evaluation:
making the technical project submission and assessment stage optional, depending on the
type of contract chosen by the beneficiary; adding a field visit to the evaluation process; and
limiting the number of situations that require clarifications from the IBs to the MA. On the first
suggestion, many beneficiaries prefer the design and build form of contract, which allows them
to nominate a construction company that takes full ownership over the technical project (TP).
This would largely solve the problem of unpredictable expenses; if any discrepancies arise
between the TP and the execution stage, it is the contracted company’s responsibility to cover
them. This could be backed up by the adoption of a stronger, standardized contract like the
yellow FIDIC. Of course, design and build is not possible under the current ROP structure, which
requires technical projects to be submitted for evaluation. In practice, requesting this
documentation during evaluation may push beneficiaries to move on a faster timeline, but the
technical project is not really evaluated on content; rather, it is more of a check-list-type of
verification to ensure all required documents are included. For this reason, for certain types of
projects, the ROP should allow beneficiaries to resort to “design and build” yellow FIDIC (as OP
Transport and OP Environment, axis 1, currently do).

229. Second, a field visit included in the evaluation stage would help correct major
technical errors early on for all ROP projects that require some construction components and
corresponding technical documentation. It could take place in the presence of the evaluator,
the beneficiary, an RDA representative, and possibly an MA expert (if there is capacity and the
sum of the project is particularly large). During the visit, the evaluator would compare the
feasibility study (required for evaluation, even when “design and build” is chosen) against the
situation in the field. The evaluator would be able to recommend corrections, and beneficiaries
would have a defined period of time to make the adjustments and resubmit the feasibility study.
This practice is currently implemented for axis 1 (with the exception of the urban centers
intervention area), but it would benefit the ROP system to expand it to all projects that rely on
technical documentation (feasibility study, technical project).

                                                                                              111
230. Also, the MA should ask for clarifications on the technical and financial evaluation
only if there are solid grounds to believe that the evaluators’ decision needs to be overturned.
If independent evaluators and the evaluation commission are entrusted with the responsibility
to recommend projects for approval, the MA should consider requesting clarifications only
under special circumstances – i.e., glaring errors in evaluation, contradictory reports, etc.
Otherwise, delays can result from repeated clarification requests exchanged between the MA
and the IBs. The 2013 World Bank report on “ROP 2.0: MA-IB Collaboration and
Communication” provides an in-depth assessment of ways to increase the efficiency of
exchanges between the main components of the ROP system.

Selection and Contracting
231. In general, selection should not be done simply based on an average score, which may
“hide” very weak areas in an application (e.g., technical aspects), and the introduction of
weights for individual criteria should be considered. The next section elaborates on these
recommendations. In any case, changes to the selection framework should be carefully
considered and weighed against currently available data on how the pipeline of projects is likely
to evolve. Put differently, a system that is too strict runs the high risk of slowing down
absorption due to the fact that too many projects will not make it with a high-enough score. The
good news is that the ROP can now draw from its previous experience and – by looking at the
data on applicants and beneficiaries for different axes – it would be possible to determine those
areas that require stricter selection criteria.

232. As for contracting, full transparency and accountability are required to ensure the
system’s legitimacy, and such measures would also help reduce delays. Based on the
Procedures Manual, contracting should take a maximum of 27 working days, which are required
for collecting all necessary approvals at the MRDPA level. An issue that affects the efficiency of
both evaluation and contracting stages relates to the fact that the MA maintains the
responsibility of approving reports at every step, but only sees the complete project right before
the contract is due to be signed. As such, the MA routinely has a range of questions at the
contracting phase that have been addressed, in one way or another, by the RDA and the
evaluation commission during the evaluation phase. This procedure creates delays and should
be optimized by either having an MA representative look over the complete file from the
completion of the administrative and eligibility check through the contracting phase, or trusting
the IBs to have properly handled each request. While having the MA approve every step in the
process may make sense for high-value, strategic projects, or for some other projects flagged as
particularly risky, better triage is recommended for less complex financing proposals, with the
delegation of as much authority as possible to the regional level.

233. Beneficiaries understand procedural steps and overall selection models and criteria,
but they have less visibility into the timeline and progress of their application throughout the
process and particularly once their documentation is sent to the MA-ROP. A solution with
benefits on all sides would be to increase the transparency of the flow of documents,
developing a simple online tracking system. Applicants would be able to access the platform to
determine where their application is at any one point in time, how long the process is expected
to take, and who the main point of contact is at each step in the process. This could increase the
timeline’s predictability and transparency, mitigate concerns among beneficiaries, and free up
capacity in the MA and RDAs helpdesks, which could quickly refer applicants to the online

                                                                                              112
system. It would also help improve accountability up and down the process chain within the MA
and the IBs, ensuring visibility around bottlenecks and capacity constraints. In addition, special
care should be devoted to increasing the transparency of the contracting process. Some
interviewed beneficiaries have noted that it is not clear how applications get prioritized for
contracting once they pass the evaluation phase. Again, the “ROP 2.0: Beneficiary Support
Mechanisms” provides further details pertaining to this recommendation.

Electronization: A Functional e-ROP
234. There are several important advantages of an e-based system: speed, cost savings,
and accuracy. First, everything is faster because information can move almost instantaneously
between beneficiaries, IBs, and the MA, which reduces delays and contributes to the broader
goal of efficient absorption of EU funds.27 Second, overall costs are lower because there is less
need for expansive storage and physical transfer of documents. Third, an electronic system
allows for more automated verifications and filters to ensure that information sent by applicants
and beneficiaries is accurate and complete. This would eliminate some of the back-and-forth
between the IB, the MA, and applicants/beneficiaries, and generate additional time and cost
savings. At the same time, some managing authorities argue that e-cohesion may create
additional work and cause the loss of direct, personal contact with beneficiaries.

235. Recognizing the potential of “e-cohesion,” the EC has pushed strongly in this direction
in recent years, as part of the effort to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries and
streamline the implementation of the ERDF, the ESF, and the CF. The most prominent example
is in Article 112 from the EC proposal on common provisions regulation for cohesion funds. This
covers Member States responsibilities in the area of management and control systems, and
mandates under Section 3: “Member States shall ensure that no later than 31 December 2014,
all exchanges of information between beneficiaries and managing authorities, certifying
authorities, audit authorities and intermediate bodies can be carried out solely by means of
electronic data exchange systems. The systems shall facilitate interoperability with national and
Union frameworks and allow for the beneficiaries to submit all information only once.”28 In April
2013, the EC published an implementing act on the rules concerning “e-cohesion,” including the
definition and minimum requirements of electronic data exchange, the “only once” encoding
principle (the same data shall be submitted only once by a beneficiary of a particular OP), and
other details on how these e-systems are expected to work.29

236. Importantly, this proposal would require Member States to enable beneficiaries the
option of electronic exchange – this is not an obligatory provision for beneficiaries, but

27
   It is important to ensure that the beneficiaries have the proper infrastructure (e.g., broadband internet) at their
disposal to submit large documents (e.g., detailed technical projects). Some more information on these issues can be
obtained from these two sources: http://www.rejournal.eu/Portals/0/JE%2049/Y%20Ciocoiu,%20Cristina.pdf and

countries are specifically allowed to make it a firm requirement. This is in fact the path that
this report recommends for the Romanian ROP; otherwise, if the “paper” option remains a
possibility, changing the mentality of some beneficiaries and MA/IB staff will become extremely
difficult and the new system may not gain ground. The EC proposal further clarifies the term “all
exchanges of information” to refer to information requirements applicable to the beneficiary
“once a grant has been awarded, [which] includes reporting on progress, declaration of
expenditure and exchange of information related to management, verifications and audits.”30
Moreover, it notes that documents available through the computer system should suffice and
beneficiaries shall be requested to provide original copies only through on-the-spot verifications
and ad-hoc controls (for exceptional, risk-based situations). Again, this report goes further and
recommends the implementation of e-documentation throughout the project cycle, i.e.,
covering the application phase as well (as the UEFISCDI Direct Manager example provided
above).

237. For its part, Romania has launched a process for developing a “mySMIS” applic ation,
which would serve as an interface with beneficiaries, complementing the current SMIS
backend database. MySMIS has already been contracted by the Ministry of European Funds
using technical assistance funding, although the exact details on when it will roll out and what
functionalities it will actually include are still lacking, despite the fact that the project is
reportedly complete as of December 2013. The quality of the request for services used in the
public procurement procedure was very good and included a comprehensive list of
requirements. What remains to be determined is the quality of the actual product and its
implementation, which would benefit from ample time for consultations, beta testing, and
piloting. Learning from the experience of developing SMIS, it is recommended to maintain
service agreements with the software developer for a longer period of time, including assistance
on demand for any issues that need to be addressed. Since the finalized form of mySMIS is not
known at this point in time, the observations below remain relevant and summarize the main
benefits of an e-ROP at various stages of the project cycle. What is more, if the mySMIS launch
will be delayed further, the MA within the MRDPA should strongly consider developing its own
components of a future electronic system.

238. As a first step, the introduction of electronic forms for the application period would
reduce bureaucracy and associated costs, and help prevent beneficiaries from making
mistakes, ensuring smoother completion of projects further down the line. A relatively simple
system can be implemented, whereby the applicants would fill out an electronic form and
attach supporting documentation. All forms should be foolproof, meaning that they should have
predefined sets of acceptable values and required information. For example, beneficiaries would
not be able to enter project indicators that fall beyond the acceptable program-level set and
they also should not be able to submit the final form until all required documents are attached.
Not only would this process reduce the amount of paperwork generated, but also it would
significantly reduce the time needed for eligibility and verification checks, which could be partly
automated. Smart software could analyze applications received and flag potential areas of
concern for RDA staff, which would need to spend even less effort on this first verification.
Depending on pilot results, the principle of four eyes may also be eliminated if the system
proves to be sufficiently rigorous with an automated computer check doubled by one RDA
expert verifying all submitted documents.

     Ibid.
                                                                                               114
239. The evaluation process should also take place on an easily accessible electronic
platform. Under this new setup, there is no need to pay the extra costs of transporting
evaluators to the RDA headquarters for the desk evaluation phase. An e-based ROP would mean
that evaluators could analyze submitted documents remotely, so a larger proportion of the
budget dedicated to covering evaluation-related costs could go toward actual fees, supporting
the goal of higher-quality evaluations. All interactions between evaluators, beneficiaries, and IB
staff could take place through electronic channels during the desk evaluation phase, and the
evaluation software could connect all these parties quickly and securely. It would also be easy to
track when documents were submitted, including initial and updated versions, reasons for any
changes, as well as how long a process is taking to identify bottlenecks and take corrective
measures. A fully integrated system would also mean that evaluation results can be quickly
organized and communicated to applicants, and procedures for contracting those qualifying
proposals could also begin in a timely manner.

240. During the implementation phase, all required exchanges of information, including
reimbursement requests and supporting documentation, would be submitted and verified
electronically. This would avoid duplication of tasks for beneficiaries. For instance, by
submitting the public procurement documents one time, they would no longer need to upload
them again with every reimbursement request. If further verifications are needed, the
documents could be easily found in the system by all verifying officers who are granted access
to a particular project. As in earlier stages, formal communications between beneficiaries and
MA/IB staff could be e-based to save time and ensure proper records of all exchanges.

241. In addition to adequate capacity, a change in mindset is needed to ensure the success
of switching to an e-based system. There is still a strong bias toward relying on stamped, hard
copy documents. A common understanding is required at all levels (MA, IBs, and especially
beneficiaries) that an electronic document endorsed with an e-signature is as valid as a hard-
copy version. Given that both EU and Romanian legislation allow for the use of electronic
documentation and e-signatures, there are no obvious legal barriers against the switch to an e-
ROP. Habits and mentalities can be tough to change, but the alternative of maintaining the
status quo is a lot worse for stakeholders struggling through overly bureaucratic procedures. If
the switch to an electronic platform is decisive, meaning that the hard-copy option is only
allowed in exceptional circumstances, people within the system will gradually accept the
advantages of electronic exchanges and rely increasingly on this type of communication.


Proposed Improvements to the ROP 2007-2013 Evaluation and Selection System
242. The following discussion proposes a number of changes to the current evaluation and
selection system. The discussion starts from the premise that the MA-ROP may chose not to
stray too much away from the current evaluation and selection system, which has proven its
efficacy within the Romanian context, and one should not necessarily change something that
works well. In practice, this means that for the 2014-2020 programming period the MA-ROP
may chose to continue with a selection system largely based on the FIFO system, and pre-
allocation of funds for urban development (i.e., the Status Quo+ scenario). This analysis goes
through all the key steps of the evaluation and selection process (administrative evaluation,
eligibility evaluation, and technical and financial evaluation), but discusses the technical and
financial evaluation in more detail, as this is the part of the process that carries the most weight
in the evaluation and selection process.

                                                                                                115
Administrative evaluation grid
243. The administrative evaluation is a simple and primarily bureaucratic process, and
there is not a lot of scope for innovation in this area. Nonetheless, this stage can be simplified
by introducing an electronic application system, which would also cut down on overall
processing times and encourage higher absorption rates. Some key issues to be considered for
this stage include:
      The key question should be: Does the application for funding contain all the required
         documents, in the required format, with the required information?
      Many of the current criteria can be verified automatically under an electronic system
         (e.g., whether a project summary is attached). In fact, an e-ROP would mean that an
         applicant cannot send a file through if required sections are missing. This would
         facilitate communication, document handling, and storage. A more in-depth discussion
         on this issue is included in the “ROP 2.0: MA-IB Collaboration and Beneficiary Support”
         reports.
      All documents can be in soft copy, within a secure system (encrypted PDF files with
         digital signatures and authorized users). Budgets should be in the form of spreadsheets.
         Hard copies should be required only in exceptional circumstances and for verification
         purposes.
      Also, some criteria become irrelevant / can be eliminated under an e-ROP (e.g., whether
         the envelope was sealed, whether there is a label on the envelope, etc.).
      Essentially, every line in this grid can be included in an automated verifications system.

Eligibility evaluation grid
244. Several of the key issues to be considered for this part of the process are discussed
below:
      Key question should be: Does the project meet all legal requirements related to the
          nature of the applicant and the project, the implementation process, and the expected
          impact?
      Under an e-ROP, many of the eligibility verifications can be automated / simplified/
          ensured at the time of the submission (e.g., checking a box regarding the type of
          beneficiary organization, submitting electronic copies of ownership documents, etc.)

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grids
245. This is the most important part of the evaluation and selection system and the section
where there is the greatest scope for improvement. Some of the key issues to be addressed are
discussed below.
     Key questions should be: Are there sufficient economic, social, and environmental
        benefits from the project? Is the applicant capable of successfully implementing and
        operating the project?

A. General observations:
     The grids do not clearly separate between technical and economic criteria, even
       though the evaluation itself is based on two evaluators, one for technical, one for
       economic aspects. While it is clear that the two evaluators should collaborate in the
       process, the technical engineer should not score economic aspects and the economic
       analyst should not assess technical issues.
        One recommendation is to split the grids into:
             o    Technical and financial evaluation:
                      Question: Is it feasible for the applicant to implement and operate the
                         project?
                      Categories: technical feasibility and features; adequacy of
                         implementation plan; administrative and financial capacity to operate
                         and sustain the project
                      Scope of criteria: Feasibility and operation
                      Scoring: Minimum threshold (“passing grade”)

             o    Economic benefits (impact) assessment:
                      Question: Are the economic benefits of the project’s operation worth
                        the costs?
                      Categories: Benefits and costs
                      Scope of criteria: Expected outputs
                      Scoring: Absolute (competitive selection)
        Criteria that refer to basic fulfillment of current regulations should be moved to the
         “eligibility check” phase. Project features that add to these minimum requirements and
         deliver enhanced impact (beyond what the law mandates) should be evaluated under
         the economic benefits assessment.

        Project financial sustainability during operational phase should be assessed. Aside
         from the applicant being able to show its current financial capacity to meet its share of
         the project implementation budget where certain costs are not covered by ROP funds,

                                                                                                  117
    under this criterion it should be required to show that (a) it can fund the operation and
    maintenance of its existing investments and (b) is either running fiscal surpluses or is
    expected to have revenue growth or expenditure savings over the future years sufficient
    to cover the added costs required to sustain the operations of the new project. To
    simplify this exercise, some basic indicative O&M costs per unit of capital invested can
    be developed for different types of project based on sector experience in Romania or
    countries in the region with similar cost structures. For example, the annual expected
    costs of O&M for different types of road could be in the range of 5% to 15% of the initial
    capital outlay, whereas that for an educational facility could be in the range of 30% to
    70% (or even higher) of the capital cost. Cost information can be gathered from
    different sector ministries on the typical range of annual O&M per unit of capital assets
    of different types in different sectors. Subsequent chapters go into more technical
    details on how to assess an applicant’s financial capacity to undertake a particular
    investment, proposing specific thresholds to watch for.

   Weights for individual criteria should be introduced to reflect the fact that some
    factors are more important than others. For example, for axis 2, the fact that a road
    project connects to the TEN-T network (criterion 1.1) should weigh more heavily than
    “improved road safety” (criterion 1.2). Similarly, the technical solution (criterion 2.4)
    should weigh more heavily than environmental safety and energy efficiency (criterion
    2.7), and in any case the two are somewhat related/overlapping. By adjusting the
    weights, one can prioritize certain aspects like absorption (e.g., project maturity or the
    stage of the technical documentation’s preparation). Most countries analyzed in the
    case study section use weights for the individual selection criteria.
   Separate horizontal criteria could be introduced. Currently, social and environmental
    criteria are clustered under the “Project Maturity and Sustainability” section. The EU
    recommends the use of horizontal criteria such as social equity and environmental
    sustainability, encouraging beneficiaries to indicate how their projects will bring benefits
    to society and the environment. In Germany, these horizontal criteria are placed in a
    separate category from economic, financial, and technical criteria. Moreover, when two
    projects receive the same score under the Nordrhein-Westfalen ROP, the project that
    received the higher scores on the horizontal criteria moves forward.
   The idea of describing 2-3 “situations” for each category (corresponding to 1, 3, or 6
    points) is helpful as a best practice for both evaluators and applicants. In some
    instances, though, there should be less room for bias in assigning a score (e.g., “solid”
    vs. “relative” monitoring capacity). Estonia provides a good example of a relatively
    simple evaluation and selection system, but with clear “situations” outlined for
    individual scores under each selection criterion.
   A score of zero for any category means that a project is disqualified, which makes
    sense and should be maintained going forward. However, it is important to identify
    selection criteria that are clearly defined and clearly important. For example, it may not
    always be easy to show how a project contributes to social equity.
   In some cases (e.g., emergency equipment) the current criteria overlap. At a minimum,
    criteria for a particular intervention should follow the “MECE principle”: mutually
    exclusive, collectively exhaustive.


                                                                                            118
   Evaluators should be required to test assumptions behind CBA numbers and not
    merely check the box that the value is over/under the required threshold (if the CBA is
    kept as part of the evaluation requirements).
   Given that the CBA technically includes a myriad of economic impact indicators, it is
    important to discuss if other evaluation indicators should be used if the CBA is
    required. Also, if only the CBA is required, then for smaller projects the CBA could be
    replaced with the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (which would be particularly useful for
    competitive project selection).
   The MA-ROP could also consider replacing the use of CBA (or expected NPV >0) with
    measurable key performance indicators that would be inputs into a full CBA
       o Generally the indicators would be scored and weighted approximately as
          follows: indicators of direct benefits to users, 60%; indicators of indirect
          benefits, 10% and external economic benefits, 30%. It is critical for the project
          to score at least 50% on the benefits to the direct users to qualify for selection.
          Indirect and external benefits only boost the scores.
       o Types of key indicators therefore include: existing/induced demand for a public
          service (number and growth rate of users/beneficiaries); direct gains to users
          resulting from the project (better service, reduction in costs of use, lower access
          prices, etc.); indirect effects on users (substitute and complementary effects on
          user demand); positive/negative economic externalities.
       o Critical need: assess the availability of key indicators in the Romanian context,
          existing gaps, and potential of applicants to fill gaps through their own data
          collection efforts.

        o   Example of how to apply the key performance indicators approach to a roads
            project:
                 The indicators of the direct economic benefits gained by the project
                     users can be assessed in a two-way grid that includes the key sources of
                     benefit: the number of users and the gain per user.
                 For example, for a road project, the grid could look like the two-way
                     table below, where the estimates are made of the daily traffic flow on
                     average over the project life and the time savings per trip-kilometer.

        Two-way table giving points weighting based on average daily traffic flow and time saved
                                         per 1000 vehicle-km
                                              Average time saving (hours per 1000 trip-km)
                                          Under 3       3-6 hours       6-9 hours        Over 9
                                           hours                                          hours
      Average daily Below 600               0%              0%               0%            50%
        traffic flow  600-1200              0%             50%              50%           100%
       (std vehicles  1200-2400             50%           100%             100%           100%
          per day)    Above 2400           100%           100%             100%           100%

                   The time savings could come about because of rough surface
                    improvements and lane widening in a road rehabilitation project, or
                    because of additional lanes provided, or because of improved traffic
                    signaling, or because of a new connecting road shortening the distance
                    or because of congestion relief, etc., or some combination of these. The
                                                                                             119
                               traffic flow would be the current traffic flow from the Traffic Study
                               adjusted for growth and the induced flows as the cost of a trip declines
                               with time saving.
                              This selection grid would reject projects with low traffic flows unless a
                               major saving in trip times could be achieved by the project. The
                               percentage score in the grid would be multiplied by the direct user
                               benefit weight of 60%, say, in determining its contribution to the
                               economic benefit score. This type of grid needs to be calibrated based
                               on the costs of construction per kilometer of different types of road
                               project in Romania.

           Consideration could also be given to requiring the applicant to submit sector
            development plans that show how the proposed project ranks in the sector priorities
            in the plan. For example, a region should have a regional road development,
            rehabilitation and maintenance plan or plans that show the prioritization and scheduling
            of projects within a region. This plan should ideally have some selection criteria for
            prioritizing the projects. The nature of the ROP selection methods will influence the
            regional plans and the regional plans should also educate the ROP allocations and
            selection methods. Another option is to use a Capital Investment Plan to prioritize
            investments over a set period of time – e.g., 9 years. This option will be discussed in
            more detail later in the report.

           The criteria and methodology for evaluating projects should mirror the framework
            used for assessing regional/county/local development plans. This will ensure a
            coherent, standardized approach and will also enable the ROP to better track and
            eventually reach its program-level targets.

           There is an insufficient focus on evaluating indicators and ensuring post-
            implementation monitoring of performance. Indicators should be SMART and there
            should also be clear mechanisms for monitoring if targets are reached, in line with the
            EC’s increasing focus on impact / value for money. Ideally, some of the evaluation and
            selection criteria should be tied to the program performance indicators, clearly showing
            how the project will contribute to helping the ROP achieve its objectives.



B. A better understanding and use of quantitative technical and financial criteria
246. Under the current ROP, the analysis of the expected cash flows of a project appears in
the Technical and Financial Assessment Grid under three criteria:

            a. Under section I covering the “Project contribution to the achievement of ROP
               goals,” typically a cost benefit analysis (CBA) criterion is included to assess the
               economic impact or “importance of the project for the region.” This criterion is
               variously stated as ERR >= 5.5% and/or B/C >=1 and/or ENPV>0, where ERR =
               economic rate of return, B/C = benefit-cost ratio, and ENPV= economic net present
               value at a discount rate of 5.5% (real).31 These criteria follow EU guidelines.32


31
     Acronyms and technical terms are explained in more detail in Annex 21 and Annex 22.
                                                                                                    120
         b. Under section 2 covering the “Project quality, maturity and sustainability,” two
             criteria are included, covering:
           i.     “The project’s need for grant co-financing” or the verification that the project is
                  not self-financing, and hence, needs a grant in order to be financially viable.
                  This is typically stated as FRR(C) < 5% and/or FNPV(C) < 0, where FRR = financial
                  rate of return to total investment capital, and FNPV(C) = Financial Net Present
                  Value to Total Investment Capital at 5% (real). This is based on EU guidelines.33

            ii.   “Project sustainability after grant cessation,” which always includes a criterion
                  for financial sustainability over the lifecycle of the project, but may include
                  criteria that the beneficiary needs to demonstrate the support structure or
                  human resources and technical capacity (or equipment) to sustain the project.
                  In some cases a separate criteria is included specifically requiring “financial
                  sustainability of the investment” be demonstrated by showing either that the
                  cash flows of the project are positive in every year or the cumulative cash flows
                  are positive. In the grids for some priority axes, the project sustainability
                  criterion is expressed the same way as the financial sustainability criterion.

247. These three criteria all depend upon the financial and economic feasibility studies . A
review of the Technical and Financial Assessment Grids across the various Priority Axes,
however, shows that these criteria are expressed in often inconsistent and unclear fashions.
This section aims to clarify the meaning, use and specification of these criteria.

Basics of project appraisal: financial and economic analysis
248.     Any investment project supported from the government budget needs to be
subjected to two basic appraisals or analyses: financial and economic appraisals . Each can be
further refined to reveal the financial interests of different parties or stakeholders involved in,
or affected by, the project.

249. Financial appraisal is an investigation of the cash flows of a project from the
perspective of the sponsors (or owners or equity holders) of a project, as well as other
financial investors in a project (typically, the debt holders). The appraisal can be conducted
both from the perspective of the combined financiers or total investment perspective and from
the perspective of the sponsors or owners of the project or the equity capital perspective. The
sponsors receive loan disbursements from the debt financiers and then service this debt.
Financial appraisal of projects with public involvement is conducted for two purposes.

         a. If the project is expected to earn revenues from its services and be self-financing
            (as may be the case with a price regulated utility or public private partnership such
            as toll road), then the main objective is to assess whether the financial
            attractiveness of the project to sponsors (given the debt financing they can raise) in
            order to assess whether the sponsor will proceed with the project. In this case the
            basic criterion is FNPV > 0 where the cash flows from the sponsor’s perspective are

              discounted by the supply price or the minimum rate of return required by the
              sponsors to invest equity capital in the project.

         b. If the project is not expected to earn revenues or to earn insufficient revenues to
            cover the project costs, then the main objective of the financial appraisal is to
            determine the amount of public revenues required to make the project financially
            viable. The public revenues could be some combination of the own revenues of a
            public agency plus a grant from an external agency to fill in remaining financial gap.
            Clearly, this role of financial appraisal addresses both criteria in the current grids
            noted above, namely the need for a capital grant and the financial sustainability of
            the operational phase of the project. These issues are addressed further below.

250. Economic appraisal of a project aggregates the benefits and costs of all persons or
stakeholders affected by an investment project. It includes the already internalized benefits
and costs of the sponsors and debt financiers of the project plus all the external benefits or
costs of other affected persons. These other affected persons include importantly the direct
users of a project that are receiving services without full payment such as users of a public road.
They also include all other persons in their roles as consumers, suppliers, workers, property
owners, etc. that experience changes in the prices they pay or receive for their services or
products as a result of the project. For example, a new road may reduce the congestion on
alternative routes to the same destination as the new road, but the road may have resulted in
some property owners having their properties expropriated and others suffering added noise
and air pollution from the traffic on the new road. At the same time, the government
experience changes in tax revenues or subsidies from the changes in market supply or demand
induced by the project. All these external costs and benefits are aggregated into an economic
appraisal and discounted by the social discount rate to calculate the economic net present value
(ENPV) of the project. At the same time, all the net gains and losses to all the affected parties or
stakeholders can be assessed to identify the distributional impacts on the net winners and
losers.

251. The conduct of economic appraisal or CBA is core to assessing the true nature of net
benefits derived from a project, but it is also extremely demanding in terms of the
information required and the efforts required by the appraisers. These costs are relatively
fixed such that the conduct of CBA is typically cost-effective if the scale of the project is large,
such that the net benefits (or net costs avoided) are large relative to the costs of conducting a
full CBA. In the absence of conducting a full CBA on a small project, the project should
nevertheless have some estimate of the number of beneficiaries and expected gain per
beneficiary to know that a positive result would be expected to arise if a full CBA had been
conducted. For example, that a rehabilitated road would result in high enough value of time
savings to a large enough volume of traffic to justify the capital expenditure.

Investment criteria
252. The basic or primary investment criterion is the net present value (NPV) criterion . The
NPV includes the discounted net cash flows from the perspective of a group of stakeholders in
the investment where the discount rate reflects the opportunity cost of funds of those
stakeholders.34 For example, the NPV could be calculated for sponsors of a project or for the

34
  Discount rates can be adjusted for risk premiums or transaction costs specific to the type of investment being under
taken. In such cases the term supply price of capital or minimum required rate of return is typically applied.
                                                                                                                 122
aggregate economy. The NPV of a project represents the change in wealth (or capitalized net
cash flows) that the stakeholders expect as a result of the project. Hence, the requirement for
NPV >0 or choosing investments with the highest NPV forms the basic criterion for investment
selection. All other criteria are derived from the NPV criterion, but have shortcomings in
different situations. The two major complementary measures are the internal rate of return
(IRR) and the benefit-cost ratio (B/C).

253. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate at which the NPV equals zero.
Typically, the investment criterion becomes IRR > discount rate of stakeholders, which implies
NPV >0. The IRR has a number of shortcomings such as (a) it does not exist for some cash flows
or gives multiple results and (b) it cannot be used to compare projects unless they are have
similar scales, timing, lengths of life, and hence cannot be used to optimize an investment
project. The IRR does provide some useful information when compared to discount rate in the
sense that gap between the two shows the margin for fluctuations in performance of the project
without the NPV going negative. For limitations in the use of the IRR as a project selection
criterion also see Annex 22.

254. Benefit-Cost Ratios measure the ratio of the present value of the benefits to the
present value of the costs. NPV measures the present value of benefits minus the present value
of costs. Hence, the criterion of B/C > 1 is exactly the same as NPV > 0. While B/C >1 is a valid
investment criterion, making comparisons or choices between projects based on B/C suffers
from similar shorting comings as IRR as well as being open to manipulation. For example,
reclassifying a cost as a negative benefit (or a benefit as a negative cost) does not change the
NPV but does change the B/C value. Accordingly B/C provides no added value to NPV. Annex 22
a simple mathematical explanation of some of the limitation of the Cost-Benefit Analysis.

255. Annex 21 includes a synthetic discussion on economic and financial appraisal and
selection criteria.

                                     delays in completing public procurement procedures. This is
                                     already happening for OP Enviroment and even the ROP, and
                                     could be further incentivized by awarding higher scores to
                                     applicants who have started public procurement procedures

       reachable                        be superfluous / self-evident from the type of intervention
     Activities: clear,                planned. Under a simplified grid, superfluous criteria should be
       correlated to                    dropped. The key test is: does asking for some particular

       correlated to activities,        separate from the implementation timeline? This has caused

                                       Project results and performance indicators have to be
                                        correlated to goals/activities, but there should also be some
                                        kind of requirement to select SMART indicators. This will avoid
                                        current situations where a beneficiary cannot prove that
                                        he/she reached the targets because of lack of data, inability to
                                        measure targets, etc. Evaluators should penalize/eliminate
                                        indicators that are not SMART (specific, measurable, attainable,
                                        relevant, and time-bound). This is in line with the broader EC
                                        trend to focus on performance indicators for 2014-2020.
Coherence of documentation             Operations and maintenance costs should both be factored in

     Data: sufficient, correct,       Decide on proper economic analysis (CBA vs. CEA, etc.)

     Bill of quantities               Consider separating the technical analysis from the economic
          (“devize”): clear,            analysis. The two evaluators looking at these financing requests
          complete, realistic, and      are generally only specialized in 1 area (technical or economic),
          tightly correlated to         so it does not make sense for the economist to score technical
          designs                       aspects or for the engineer to score economic aspects

        standards in the field         analysis of the technical solution
        (innovation)                  A new approach is needed for assessing this criterion: instead
                                       of verifying mostly the correlation among various technical
                                       documents, evaluators should focus on the technical solution
                                       itself (level of innovation, sustainability, etc.)
                                      This criterion does not seem to look at whether the chosen
                                       technical solution is the most efficient in terms of costs. In
                                       other words, many solutions could fulfill the project goals and
                                       even the latest standards in the field, but there is probably one
                                       solution that is most efficient and straightforward (technically)
                                      Need to better define what the “latest standards” refer to:
                                       national, international, EU? If national, the risk is that the
                                       formal/de jure standards are outdated

                                       because it does not typically get revenues for such investments
                                       (for most projects under the ROP)
                                      Evaluators should be required to look behind the numbers and
                                       evaluate the assumptions made by applicants (not simply check

                                             The sub-criterion on accessibility is a good practice and

                                             Criterion 1.17 requires positive cash flows for the entire

                 Improved road safety         This should not be part of the evaluation. Legal
                                                requirements beyond the ROP imply that road

                                                That said, an express road with an extra lane will have a
                                                greater impact on travel times compared to single-lane
                                                road rehabilitation. Different scores could be assigned
                                                to, say, 10% reduction, 20% reduction, etc.

                                                investment is worth it in of itself. These measures do
                                                not reflect whether a project is important for the region

Proposals for new evaluation and selection grids
256. Annex 26 includes proposals for two types of evaluation and selection grids: 1)
StatusQuo+; and 2) Semi-Competitive / Competitive. The StatusQuo+ grids follow the
recommendations made above and propose a set of marginal changes on the grids that are
currently used by the ROP. The Semi-Competitive and Competitive proposals bring a number of
new elements and put a stronger focus on impact. Some of the key changes include:
     “Financial Sustainability” is a separate criterion to underscore the need for beneficiaries
        to prove that they can cover both investment costs for planned projects and the
        subsequent operation and maintenance costs;
     The evaluation of the quality, maturity, and overall sustainability of the project keeps to
        a large extent the criteria used in the current evaluation and selection grids, as these
        were found to be generally sound. Only a number of changes were made to make the
        individual criteria clearer;
     Impact indicators were separated into three categories (Economic Impact, Social Impact,
        and Environmental Impact) to assess the potential gains enabled by an individual project
        in these three categories. Different weights were allocated to impact indicators
        depending on the type of project assessed (e.g., a higher economic impact score for a
        SME project and a higher social impact score for a health project).
     To the extent possible, impact indicators tried to look both at desired outcomes and to
        also assess the extent to which an individual project helped achieve the output
        indicators proposed by the European Commission.

257. The Semi-Competitive and Competitive proposals can be used both for the Semi-
Competitive Scenario and the Competitive Scenario. In the first case, the grids can be used to
select the projects that have scored above a certain threshold (e.g. 5 points), while in the second
case they can be used to triage projects that are received with competitive calls for proposals.




                                                                                               134
IX. Identifying Strategic Regional Projects (Type 1)
258. Only a few regional projects were implemented through the 2007-2013 ROP. For
example, within Axis 3 and the Key Area of Intervention 3.3, emergency equipment was
acquired to service each individual region, although these were obviously projects with
relatively low budgets. There have also been attempts to do cross-jurisdictional projects, such as
the Sibiu-Alba inter-county road project. Additionally, the Growth Poles policy and the project
implemented through Axis 1 and Major Intervention Area 1.1 can be considered to be regional
in nature.

259. Overall, however, despite the elaboration of Regional Development Plans, there has
been little thinking around defining regional priorities. Without a regional administrative tier
that could implement regional projects, the focus has been predominantly on county-level and
local-level projects. And indeed, it is hard to draw regional priorities when the implementation
of these strategies hinges on national decisions – e.g., the rehabilitation of a national road of
critical importance for the region, administered by the National Company for Highways and
National Roads.

260. For the most part, Regional Development Agencies have tried to define regional
priorities in the Regional Development Plans for 2014-2020 and they have started compiling
priority projects lists.35 Some of the RDAs (e.g., Bucharest-Ilfov and the West Region) are quite
advanced in identifying a limited number of regional strategic projects and several regions
(Center, West, and South) have drafted criteria for selecting project of regional importance.
Other regions, however, have not moved significantly beyond compiling a general list of projects
submitted by different public authorities.

Why Regional Strategic Projects are important
261. Before setting out to implement regional strategic projects, it is important to first
clarify why such projects are important. Doing large projects just for the sake of doing large
projects can be counter-productive and even harmful. Large projects take longer to prepare and
implement and can slow down absorption rates; they require larger budgets and can lead to a
greater wastage of resources if they fail to achieve set targets; and large projects require
stronger institutional frameworks (e.g., for inter-jurisdictional cooperation).

262. Large projects also come with many benefits. For one, as discussed earlier, large
projects can achieve a higher impact, and bring greater benefits for each Euro invested. While a
larger size does not necessarily translate into a higher impact (one can have a very high impact
with very small projects), it is usually the large public investments that bring the strongest
development benefits. These investments usually address challenges faced by a higher number
of people and cover a wider territory. For the ROP 2014-2020, one of the key ways of achieving
a higher impact is to focus more and allocate more funding to large, Type-1 projects. For the
2007-2013 programming period, only around 3.75% of the ROP’s allocated funding went to large
projects. As such, it is not clear how the projects financed through the 2007-2013 ROP
contributed to regional-level development in Romania.


35
     A more detailed analysis of the Regional Development Plans is included in Annex 6.
                                                                                              135
263. Second, from a conceptual point of view, it does not make sense to have a Regional
Operational Programme without really having regional projects. The purpose of the ROP
should be to enable regions in Romania to come closer to and surpass average EU productivity
levels. What Bucharest-Ilfov has achieved in the past years can also be achieved by other
regions. One of the most important ways of achieving higher development rates is through the
identification of regional priorities and securing funds to achieve those priorities. As discussed in
the Competitive Cities report though, it is important to carefully define regional priorities.
Hoping to achieve balanced economic development with smaller discrepancies between
individual regions is a strategy that is doomed from the start. As the history of developed
countries clearly shows, development means that in an initial stage some regions (the economic
engines) will take off faster than other regions (the lagging areas). Over time, however,
differences in living standards tend to disappear though. The 2013 World Bank report on
“Competitive Cities” presents the full reasoning behind this argument.

264. Third, thinking about regional projects now can help set the foundation for the future
regionalization (in 2014 and beyond). The process has commenced in 2013 and from the start it
became clear that it would not be an easy task. Among the challenges faced was the question of
what regions will be actually be responsible for. In this respect, developing strong regional
development plans and trying to identify regional needs and priorities could go a long way in
identifying what should fall within the purview of regional administrations, helping bolster the
case of stakeholders who push forward the regionalization agenda.

How to define regional priorities
265. Without the regionalization process complete, it is hard to define what is truly
“regional.” However, rather than seeing this as a weakness of the process and a hindrance to
defining regional projects, RDAs, local authorities, county authorities, the MRDPA, and other
vested stakeholders should see this as an opportunity to lay the foundation for the
regionalization process. More specifically, in trying to define regional priorities for the 2014-
2020 programming period, RDAs and public authorities can identify early on what some of the
regional-level competencies should be.

266. The current Growth Poles policy is a good foundation upon which other regional
initiatives could be developed. This has helped define the economic capitals of each region.
While the future administrative capital for each region may not necessarily correspond to the
economic capital, each region has a city that serves as the growth engine for the respective
region. The Growth Poles report has shown that Growth Poles tend to be responsible for at least
20% of a region’s economic output, and bring the largest absolute contribution to a region’s
economic growth.

267. Using the Growth Poles as the starting point for defining regional priorities, RDAs will
be able to identify a number of projects physically located in the Growth Pole, but with impact
on the region as a whole. Some critical areas to consider include:
     Higher education. Growth poles usually house the largest universities in the region and
        they provide higher education opportunities for people in the region. Strengthening
        these university centers (e.g., by creating a regional network of campuses, as was done
        in Spain, or by creating academic curricula that follow regional economic strengths)
        would benefit not only the Growth Poles, but the region as a whole.

                                                                                                 136
        Health infrastructure. Growth poles tend to have a higher density of medical facilities
         and provide a larger variety of treatments. As such, the growth pole is where people in
         the region go for treatment they cannot find in their own locality. Regional hospitals
         could be placed in these hubs, attracting patients not only from across the region, but
         possibly also from international segments.
        Economic infrastructure (e.g., business/industrial parks). As the most important
         regional economic centers, Growth Poles tend to be the main employers in the region.
         Developing economic infrastructure in the growth pole, in accordance with clear
         dynamics, would ultimately bring benefits not just for the growth poles themselves, but
         for the region as a whole.
        Airports. Each growth pole should have an airport that serves people in the region36.
         Airports are now managed by county councils, but given the fact that they are of
         regional importance, they may be passed over to regions once the regionalization
         process is complete. The development of airport infrastructure can go beyond the
         airport itself (e.g., landing strips, hangars, terminals) and also focus on improving
         accessibility to these airports (e.g., through intermodal transport centers) and improving
         their functionality (e.g., by developing cargo handling capacity to better service the
         regional economy). Ideally, each region should have easy accessibility to the outside
         world, and airports are critical in this respect.
        Cultural infrastructure. Growth poles often amass the largest number of cultural sites in
         the region and include several heritage sites that are exemplary for the culture of the
         region. Consequently, the conservation and rehabilitation of these sites may be of
         critical importance for the region. Of course, cultural patrimony may also be strewn
         throughout the region, such as the painted monasteries in the North-East Region, or the
         fortified churches in the Center Region, which – albeit harder to coordinate at the
         institutional level – are good candidates for projects with a regional impact.
        Environmental infrastructure. Water and wastewater companies, which now often
         extend their service at the regional level, are usually housed within the growth poles.
         Similarly, large industrial rehabilitation and brownfields redevelopment projects are
         most needed in the growth poles themselves, but may have an impact way beyond the
         urban center itself.

268. In addition to growth poles and their immediate surroundings, there are a number of
sectors of regional importance:
     Regional connective infrastructure. The large majority of connective infrastructure
        projects that are of regional importance (e.g., roads and rail links) are now the purview
        of national authorities. As discussed in the Competitive Cities report and the Growth
        Poles report, some of the economically most critical investments are in connective
        infrastructure, which allows dynamic economic centers (e.g., the growth poles) to
        enlarge their economic and demographic mass. Economic mass and urbanization are
        critical for the development of a region, and regions should have the power to define
        and implement connective infrastructure projects of regional importance. Currently, the
        ROP can do nothing more than finance county roads, while the majority of large
        infrastructure projects are financed through OP Transport. Even so, investments in
        county roads can be done in an integrated and strategic fashion to enable more people

36
  With the exception of Brașov and Ploiești (which are close to Bucharest), each of the other Growth
Poles has a functioning airport.
                                                                                                       137
        in the region easier access to opportunities (e.g., jobs, healthcare, education, culture)
        and to enable dynamic economic centers access to a larger labor pool.
       Public services infrastructure. For several regions (e.g., North-East and South), the
        development of public services infrastructure is one of the most important priorities. In
        these regions, a large share of the population continues to have poor access to running
        water, sewage, gas, heating, or even electricity. The large majority of people with poor
        access to public services live in small urban areas and in rural areas. Most of the time
        these localities lack the funding to finance/co-finance much needed public utility
        investments. These costs are now covered by county councils, but even they, as the next
        chapters will show, lack the financial strength to finance such projects. It may pay off
        therefore to think about whether it would not be more appropriate to prioritize these
        investments at the regional level, based on: available funds, well-defined needs, and
        actual viability and sustainability of such investments.
       Environmental investments. The environment has different scales (local, regional, and
        national) and tackling environmental issues (e.g., forestation of an area, improving
        access to a natural park, etc.) is often a responsibility of regional governments. Within
        the current administrative set-up, one or more county councils could take on
        environmental projects of regional importance.
       Cultural infrastructure. Several cultural sites of regional, national, and international
        importance require integrated regional approaches. For example, the painted
        monasteries in the North East, the fortified churches in the Center, the Dacian sites in
        the West, and the wooden churches in the North-West would all benefit from
        integrated approaches, which would help rehabilitate and preserve these sites, make
        them more accessible, market them better, and create regional tours for tourists.
       Tourism infrastructure. Tourism is another area with a regional dimension and could
        include, for example, integrated tours on the sea-side (e.g., sea resorts and the Danube
        Delta) or integrated circuits of mountain resorts.

269. The gamut of potential regional priorities can go well beyond what was presented
above. It should ideally be the responsibility of regional authorities and vested stakeholders to
define regional priorities, not only within the framework presented by EU programmes, but
based on a clear analysis of regional needs, strengths, and opportunities. There are often
regional needs that cannot be financed from EU funds and they should not be disregarded
because of this.

270. RDAs have already started developing frameworks for identifying and prioritizing
strategic regional projects. This is a good approach and indicates a push from the regional level
for more impactful projects. Annex 7 provides an overview of some of the selection (or rather
pre-selection) criteria that were developed by several RDAs. These do need to be refined
further, but it is important that a start in this direction has taken place.

Addressing some of the shortcomings of large projects
271. While large strategic projects can certainly generate higher regional impact, there are
also a number of shortcomings that need to be kept in mind. Some of these dangers are well
known, some could be uncovered only when such projects are implemented. In what follows,
this report discusses some of the key challenges of large projects in more detail.


                                                                                             138
Risk of slowing down absorption
272. First and foremost, large projects can be responsible for slower absorption rates.
Almost by definition, they take longer to prepare and longer to implement. Given that Romania
has had the worst performance in terms of absorption rates in the EU, and given that some of
the worst performing OPs are those that deal with large infrastructure projects (i.e., OP
Transport and OP Environment), it is normal for the Managing Authority of the ROP to shy away
from large projects, just as it did for the 2007-2013 ROP.

     Figure 28. ROP 2007-2013 Financing Requests and Commitments by Axis, by then end of 2012




273. And indeed, when looking at the ROP 2007-2013, the worst performance on
absorption was registered by Growth Poles and Urban Development Poles, which received
pre-allocated funding and focused on larger integrated projects. The figure above shows that,
by the end of 2012, Growth Poles and Urban Development Poles (under Axis 1.1) had the worst
performance in terms of financing requests and commitments. The relatively poor performance
can be explained by the fact that Axis 1 was the last one to be added to the ROP 2007-2013 and
it took some time before the Integrated Development Plans were finalized. Overall, the lower-
value projects (e.g., Microenterprises, Educational Infrastructure, or Social Infrastructure) had a
better performance in terms of commitments and absorption. However, this is not necessarily
the rule. Some of the largest projects implemented through the ROP (e.g., Business
Infrastructure or Road Infrastructure) were also some of the best performing ones.

274. However, when comparing the share of financing requests to actual commitments,
one can see that everything that was submitted for financing under Axis 1 was also
contracted. This is based on the pre-approval process of the Integrated Development Plan,
which extended the overall project selection for Axis 1 projects, but also ensured that these
projects would eventually receive financing. More importantly though, the projects selected
under Axis 1 are the projects considered to be truly strategic by the respective cities, rather than
proposals opportunistically submitted to access funds quickly.

275. Moreover, when it comes to commitments, the ROP 2007-2013 performs better than
many similar operational programmes in Member Countries with a much higher overall
absorption rate. As the table below indicates, the Romanian ROP 2007-2013 made

                                                                                                139
commitments that were higher than those of the OPs in other Member Countries. This in effect
indicates that the MA-ROP and the RDAs have done have done a good job in the pre-contracting
stage, but the problems with absorption actually happen in the implementation stage – a stage
of the process over which the MA and the RDAs have relatively little control. In fact, the MA-IB
Collaboration reports have shown that several of the most significant absorption problems in
the current programming period were system-wide issues that did not depend on the ROP itself
(e.g., the public procurement framework, drawn out legal battles and challenges from
companies that lose bids for EU funded projects, or delays in the construction phase).

                      Table 20. Performance of different OPs at the end of 2012
                                                                  Commitments
                                                                                    Payments by
                  Operational Programme                             by end of
                                                                                    end of 2012
                                                                      2012
ROMANIA – Regional Operational Programme                              96%              34.5%
GERMANY – Nordrhein-Westfalen ROP                                    95.1%             47.3%
ESTONIA – OP for the Development of Living Environment               87.7%             54.3%
SLOVENIA – Strengthening Regional Development Potential              86.6%             69.5%
UK – West Wales and the Valleys Convergence Programme                 103%              34%
POLAND – Slaskie Regional Operational Programme                      88.4%             48.5%

276. Overall, it seems that the MA-ROP could process larger investments without affecting
absorption rates too much – at least in the pre-contracting phase, which it has the most
control over. Even if the commitments for Growth Poles and Urban Development Poles were
relatively low at the end of 2012, the overall performance of the ROP was quite good in the pre-
contracting phase. Commitment rates were higher than those of other OPs in the EU, and it is
likely that the MA-ROP could handle larger projects in the 2014-2020 Programming Period
without jeopardizing absorption too much. At the same time, it is important to be aware of
institutional and capacity limitations. As the Italy case study shows, the implementation of
complex integrated projects can lead to substantial delays in the process and even to the
suspension/cancelation of such projects.

Risk of wasting resources
277. Large projects also imply large sums of money and significant allocations of limited
funds for a limited number of interventions. As such, if these projects do not succeed, or if the
strategic projects chosen turn out to be the wrong ones, there is a higher risk of wasting
resources. Basically, if 25% of regional funds are allocated for 2-4 large regional projects, and if
these projects are not chosen properly, than the 25% of the funds will have limited/no impact
(and worse even, they will come with significant operations and maintenance costs).

278.     Allocating a large share of the funds for the wrong projects usually happens when
there is a poor strategy/plan in place. If the needs/challenges of the region are not properly
identified, then the funds could be spent for projects that would not necessarily help the
development of the region and may come with large O&M costs. In this respect, it is critical that
national/regional/county/local strategies are not only well crafted, but also well-coordinated
with each other.

279. At the same time, a poor strategy will lead to unwanted consequences regardless of
the size of the project. More specifically, if the strategy calls for the wrong type of investments,
                                                                                                140
it does not matter if they are big or small. It is true that a small project bears a smaller risk, but
several projects compounded together are a different story.

Risk of lacking the proper institutional frameworks and adequate capacity
280. It is also very important to clearly identify who will implement large projects and if
they have sufficient capacity to do successfully. While regional strategic projects do not
necessarily have to cross jurisdictional boundaries, they often do. In the absence of regional
administrations, cross-jurisdictional projects will have to be implemented by inter-community
development associations (e.g., several counties, several localities, or several counties and
localities).37

281. Inter-community development associations in Romania have a number of limitations.
For one, such agreements require that the member jurisdictions work together over an
extended period of time (e.g., up to 9 or 10 years in the case of EU-funded projects). There is
often the risk that political shifts in one or more of the jurisdictions will lead to changing
priorities or even the dissolution of the inter-jurisdictional agreement. Even if the agreement
holds over the entire duration of the project’s implementation, there are other risks involved.
For example, individual jurisdictions would have to coordinate expenditures and budgets – i.e.,
given annual budget cycles, each jurisdiction would have to allocate the necessary funds in
tandem. This is quite a difficult task in a context where systemic challenges (e.g., drawn out legal
battles) can make it tough to do proper budget planning even for one jurisdiction given the lack
of cash flows’ predictability.

282. Should the regionalization process be completed, then regional projects would
naturally be implemented by regional governments. In this case, the problem is that of
capacity. Projects would most likely have to be implemented by administrative bodies with no
experience of operating at the regional level, and potentially with little administrative
experience generally. This could then lead to prolonged preparation and implementation
periods and long delays, involving higher risks in terms of financial corrections.

283. While Inter-Community Development Associations do have their limitations, there is
also evidence that they can in fact be functional. One of the best examples in this respect
comes from the Local Action Groups that had to be constituted under the LEADER Program to
attract funds from the National Rural Development Programme. The LEADER Program did
indeed focus on projects of smaller value (that are often easier to implement), but the
institutional frameworks that implemented these projects proved functional. This suggests that
Inter-Community Development Associations could work at a larger scale too.

284. If regional governments will implement regional projects, their potential lack of
capacity and experience could be outweighed by the RDAs. As the MA-IB Collaboration reports
have recommended, RDAs should keep their status as intermediary bodies and public utility
NGOs, because they have proven their effectiveness in this capacity. As such, they could
continue with their current role and attributions, but work with a regional MA instead of a
national MA. There is also scope to recruit staff with experience in Structural Funds

37
  According to Law 215/2001, inter-community development associations are cooperative structures with legal
status, established by territorial administrative units to jointly implement development projects of zonal or regional
importance.

                                                                                                                    141
management from other levels, as tends to happen in other Member States when
administrative changes take place. Until regional governments gain experience, the RDAs could
take on more responsibility and provide technical assistance to the newly created authorities.




                                                                                          142
X. Pre-allocating Funds for County Residences and County Councils (Type 2)

285. The pre-allocation of funds for county residences and county councils is one of the key
ways for implementing strategic and impactful projects at the sub-national level. County
residences and county councils are the largest sub-national public authorities, and they are also
the public authorities that are most likely to implement projects with a significant impact.

286. Type 2 projects build on the experience of Axis 1 (Integrated Urban Development)
under the ROP 2007-2013. Through Axis 1, seven Growth Poles and thirteen Urban
Development Poles had access to dedicated funding for integrated urban development projects,
provided that they presented an Integrated Development Plan (IDP) to justify the choice of
projects submitted for financing. In addition, a pool of funds was made available under Axis 1 for
Urban Centers – cities with a population of over 10,000 people that were neither Growth Poles,
nor Urban Development Poles. Urban Centers had to compete for funding and funds were
received by those cities that submitted Integrated Development Plans first (and, of course,
provided that the IDPs responded to the guidelines from the Applicant’s Guide).

287. This report recommends building on the experience of Axis 1 and expanding pre-
allocations to all county residences and all county councils. Some of the reasons for this
expansion were discussed in the Growth Poles report. In short, it was relatively clear why the
Growth Poles were chosen (they are the key economic engines in their respective region), but it
was less clear why the 13 Urban Development Poles were chosen. The team indicated that
county residences play a key polarizing role within their respective counties (e.g., they are
administrative centers and most often the key hubs of opportunity – in terms of jobs, education,
healthcare, etc. – in the county). For their part, county councils can provide a set of
complementary investments, which could help strengthen the polarizing role of county
residences (e.g., they could build connective infrastructure, which would allow county
residences to expand their economic mass). Counties could also complete a number of
investments that are critical for their development.

Why pre-allocation for county residences and county councils is important
288. The pre-allocation of ROP 2014-2020 funds for key sub-national projects requires a big
financial commitment and comes with several risks. It is therefore important to have a clear
reasoning for why this approach should be taken. This section discusses some of the advantages
of pre-allocating funds for county residences and county councils, while later we will assess
some options for addressing the risks that come with pre-allocation for strategic sub-national
projects.

289. First and foremost, pre-allocation ensures that a number of major sub-national
projects and priorities will be undertaken. This also helps overcome the dilemma between
competitiveness and cohesion, and may increase the legitimacy of Structural Funds based on a
fairer distribution of funds. In essence, this is a key way of ensuring that more impactful projects
are implemented at the sub-national level. So far, with the exception of Growth Poles and Urban
Development Poles, all other public entities had to compete for limited funds on a project-by-
project basis. Given that projects were selected using the First-In First-Out method, public
authorities had an incentive to submit simpler, quicker projects for which the technical
                                                                                                143
documentation could be completed quickly. This meant that they usually focused on projects
they knew how to do well and on projects with a lower complexity level. This does not
necessarily mean that these were not impactful (most were usually part of a development
strategy), but it is likely that public authorities paid more attention to bringing up the projects
quickly for financing rather than focusing on the projects that were needed the most. This
seems to be corroborated by the data, with the highest commitments and the quickest
absorption registered for road improvements and school rehabilitation work – investments that
public authorities were already quite familiar with.

290. Pre-allocated funding means that the most important sub-national public authorities
in Romania have the opportunity to take the time and prepare for financing what they
consider to be key priorities. Basically, these public authorities will be given the opportunity to
think about what they would want financed above all, and have sufficient time to prepare these
strategic projects for financing. This would also enable a more integrated approach, allowing
public authorities to submit complementary packages of projects, rather than trying to access
funds one project at a time, before the total allocation is depleted.

291. Another reason for pre-allocating funds is to ensure that all major public authorities
have an opportunity to finance projects that they consider to be strategic. As the map below
indicates, the counties where most funds were attracted by public authorities in Romania are
not always the counties that needed these funds the most. There is no clear pattern between
richer and poorer counties, between counties with higher and lower infrastructure
endowments, or between counties with a larger or smaller population. The same pattern holds
when looking at individual axes (see Annex 5), with no obvious trends behind the location of
investments for road infrastructure, social infrastructure, business infrastructure, or tourism
infrastructure. The only axis where there is a clear, discernable pattern is Axis 1, where funds
have been purposefully pre-allocated for the largest and most dynamic cities to help them fuel
strategic investments.

292. Using the project-by-project FIFO approach can leave behind many unmet public
needs. This can happen because some public authorities cannot submit viable projects quickly
enough, because they lack the capacity to design and implement projects, or because they have
other priorities. What this means in practice is that some people in Romania will be
shortchanged because the public authorities representing them did not move fast enough on
absorbing EU funds. Allocating funds to all major public institutions can ensure that sub-national
priority needs are addressed and that EU grants (instead of limited local and national budget
funds) are used for this purpose. The allocation of funds to different sub-national entities can
follow the same principles used to allocate funds to individual regions, to growth poles, and to
urban development poles.

293. Moreover, tying pre-allocation to the need for having multi-year operational plans can
help improve public authorities’ capacity at the sub-national level. That is, EU funds should not
only be used to help meet key sub-national needs, but they can also act as an incentive to
improve public administration. For example, public authorities may get better at: long-term
planning, organizing around multi-year budgets, prioritizing projects, and spending limited funds
in a more efficient way.


How to pre-allocate funds at the sub-national level
294. The implementation of Axis 1 under the ROP 2007-2013 already provides plenty of
evidence on how pre-allocation could be handled in the 2014-2020 programming period. To
access pre-allocated funds, Growth Poles, Urban Development Poles, and Urban Centers had to
submit Integrated Development Plans (IDPs), which were drafted according to a pre-defined
structure and had to justify the choice of projects submitted for ROP funding. This approach
could be continued for the next ROP, with a slight change.

295. To access pre-allocated funds for the 2014-2020 programming period, public
authorities should be allowed to make use of the strategies/plans they already have in place.
More specifically, if county residences and county councils have development strategies that
meet a number of criteria, they should be allowed to use those development strategies rather
than be requested to develop new strategies just for accessing EU funds. As the 2013 World
Bank report on “Enhanced Spatial Planning” argues in depth, strategies should not simply serve
the purpose of attracting one type of financing, but should include projects that are vital for the
community, regardless of the anticipated funding source.

Strategy and planning framework in Romania for cities and counties
296. The planning system in Romania contains statutory plans and non-statutory plans.
Both types usually include a list of proposed projects, which are organized by sector (e.g., social,
economic, environment). For cities, the General Urban Plan (GUP) is statutory – a territorial
development plan, combined with zoning regulations. The GUP is valid for 10 years. Counties
use the County Spatial Plan (Planul de Amenajare a Teritoriului Județean – PATJ). Both the
General Urban Plan and the County Spatial Plan have a methodological framework and an
approval procedure.

297. Cities and counties also use non-statutory plans. The most frequent non-statutory
plans are the development strategies, which are usually crafted for 15-20 years, and cover
                                                                                                145
sectors that support the development of the community. While there is no clear methodological
framework guiding the elaboration of these development strategies,38 they usually encompass a
number of standard sections: vision and strategic development objectives, general analysis,
multi-sectoral analysis, policies, programs, and the list of projects that respond to identified
problems, as well as potential sources of funding.

298. Since development strategies do not follow any guideline/methodological framework,
they are approved by the city/county council. Most often, because of lack of capacity at the
local/county level, statutory and non-statutory plans are subcontracted out to private or public
entities. In the end, the quality of the strategy is influenced by the experience of the selected
entities.

299. For the most part, individual projects submitted for ROP 2007-2013 financing were
drawn from such development strategies. Integrated Development Plans were used under Axis
1 of the ROP 2007-2013 to enable cities to access pre-allocated funds for integrated projects. If
the IDPs did not cover a new territory (e.g., a metropolitan area), they often duplicated
development strategies that were already in place. Even when the IDPs covered a new territory,
they were not always correlated with the development strategies of the constituent jurisdictions
– lack of correlation and integrated thinking is a broader issue in Romania – across both
territorial (at various levels) and sectoral strategies.

300. If a pre-allocation approach will be used for the ROP 2014-2020, it would be more
efficient for the MA-ROP to ask participating public beneficiaries to draw on existing
strategies, rather than request that new ones be developed from scratch. The only situation
when new development frameworks should be requested for accessing pre-allocated funds is
when these strategies are missing completely, or when addressing a territory that is not limited
to one jurisdiction (e.g., metropolitan areas). Even in the case of metropolitan areas, most cities
in Romania that have a metropolitan dynamic now have Integrated Development Plans in place,
which were used to attract 2007-2013 ROP funds. For the most part, and to the extent that the
territory of the metropolitan area did not change dramatically, these strategies could simply be
updated. The vision and objectives would normally remain unchanged, but there would be a
need to update parts of the socio-economic analysis and the list of priority projects.

301. The large majority of county residences and county councils already have a
development strategy in place, which they could draw on to access EU funds. Annex 16 gives a
detailed picture of the situation among county residences and county councils, looking at some
key issues that a development strategy should have, and the degree to which these are included
in individual strategies. The good news is that out of 40 county residences, only 3 lacked a
development strategy (and it is possible that one was pending), and 9 had development
strategies with one or more key components missing. The other 29 county residences had
development strategies in place with key information available. The situation was generally
positive for the county councils too, with only 5 counties missing a development strategy
altogether, and with 12 counties having a development strategy that missed one or more key
elements. This indicates that the large majority of county residences and county councils could


38
  There are of course exceptions in this respect. For example, the Integrated Development Plans crafted under Axis 1
of the ROP 2007-2013 need to be developed a standard format. The same is valid for standard strategies such as the
Local Agenda 21, or the Covenant of Mayors Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAP).
                                                                                                                146
take on integrated development projects without a substantial additional upfront effort (i.e., the
elaboration of an integrated development strategy).

302. The MA-ROP could use existing development strategies as a given, but require that
some basic elements be taken into consideration. When these elements are missing, the MA-
ROP could withhold the release of EU grants until they are incorporated in an updated version of
the strategy in question. Some recommendations for how the implementation of development
strategies could be improved include:

        1. Establishment of an inter-department steering group at the beneficiary level, led by
        one department/project implementation unit to coordinate the process and ensure
        ownership of the development strategy. Political back-up of the strategy is also crucial in
        order to facilitate success.

        2. A stronger focus on investment-type plans, as a base for future project proposals in
        line with available funds. A priority setting process and corresponding instruments need
        to be identified in this respect. To make this instrument effective, it is important to
        efficiently assess the beneficiary’s capacity to co-finance the project/projects.

        3. The strategy should have an integrated approach. This will assure the concentration
        and coordination of resources to solve a mix of problems for a specific area, fulfilling the
        principle that “the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.”

        4. The strategy should focus on key problems and trends rather than concentrate on
        statistical data. In this context, it is crucial to deploy mechanisms for measuring user
        demand and needs. The strategy should focus on the coordination between identified
        community problems/needs and the proposed projects which aim to respond to them.

        5. The strategy should demonstrate/provide information regarding the involvement of
        the community and interested stakeholders in the design process. It should be
        mandatory to have public consultations – at a minimum: one for the existing situation
        analysis; one for the SWOT analysis, vision and development objectives; and two
        meetings for programs and project formulation/prioritization.

303. From the list above, one area that needs strengthening the most relates to
investment-type plans. More specifically, there is a need for a mechanism that helps public
authorities prioritize investments over a set period of time – e.g., 5-9 years. While public
authorities may have well-defined objectives and comprehensive lists of projects, they should
also clearly indicate the priority projects they will focus on, given fiscal and financial constraints.
Only a limited numbers of projects can be financed within one programming period and public
authorities should have an instrument at their disposal to help them properly prioritize projects
that can be realistically undertaken given available resources.

304. Capital Investment Planning (CIP) is a tool that is often used in developed countries to
prepare multi-year investments plans. Given that many capital investments span several years
and given that available budgets can usually cover only some of the priorities included in a
development strategy, the CIP comes to help public authorities prioritize investments over a set
period of time. Romania also has some experience with CIP and a comprehensive toolkit was

                                                                                                  147
developed with USAID assistance in 2004. This could be used as such by public authorities in
Romania to plan their capital investments over a programming period (e.g., 2014-2022). The
next sections will discuss the CIP in more detail.

Capital Investment Planning as a tool to help formulate and implement projects
305. As discussed above, development strategies are not always enough for proper
investment planning for multiple years – e.g., 5-9 years. Most often, they do not provide
reliable information about the financial capacity of the beneficiary, the project costs, and
particularly operational and maintenance (O&M) costs.

306. Capital Investment Planning (CIP) can help fill this planning gap . The Guidebook on
Capital Investment Planning (CIP) for Local Governments, issued by World Bank in October 2011,
places the CIP in the following context:

                            Figure 30. Putting the CIP within the local context

307. USAID has funded several CIP toolkits and guidebooks throughout the world and one
was done for Romania too. The Romanian “Capital Investment Planning and Budgeting Toolkit”

                                                                                                         148
was developed in 2004, with technical support from the Governance Reform and Sustainable
Partnership (GRASP) Program. The methodology proposed for the implementation of the CIP
could be used by both cities and counties, following 12 straightforward steps (see image below).
The toolkit also comes with a number of methodological annexes and case studies, which can
guide public authorities through the process.

308. Ideally, the CIP should be seen as a complement to development strategies, and to the
extent possible it should be kept simple. More than anything, the CIP should not be seen as a
burden, but as an aid for better planning and improved decision making. Some of the key
elements that could be included in the CIP are:
         1. Introductory Comments - Summary comments about the project category
             /sectors.
         2. Funded CIP Projects - CIP Plan numbers, project names, project status, and
             project costs for the 2014-2020 CIP Plan.
         3. Project Map - Physical location for each project in the category/sector.
         4. Cost and Resource Summary - Project costs and resources by year for the project
             category/sector.
         5. Project Description Pages - Detailed project information, including the budget and
             schedule for each project in the category/sector.
         6. Completed Projects - List of projects that were in included in the 2007-2013
             programming period and are completed or anticipated to be completed by the
             end of 2015.
         7. Operating Costs - New operating costs funded by the CIP.

                                                                                            149
309. There are distinct benefits to using the CIP. In brief, it is an ideal tool for linking physical
development to a local government’s urban development and strategic plans. It has the
following advantages:39
      Coordinates physical and financial planning and relates public facilities to other public
        and private development plans;
      Prioritizes current and future capital needs and helps balance needs with ability to pay;
      Coordinates the activities of other public and private agencies in project planning,
        scheduling, financing, and construction, thereby reducing duplication, conflict, and
        costs;
      Facilitates coordination with the operating budget;
      Enhances credit worthiness and ensures financial stability by helping control tax rates,
        avoiding unanticipated borrowing, and maximizing alternative financing options;
      Identifies the most efficient and economical means of financing capital projects;
      Increases opportunities for obtaining funding from EU funds, private partners, donors,
        etc.;
      Works well as a communication tool, keeping the public informed about capital needs
        and projects, and assists in building public support.

310. The CIP could become a strategic tool for the MA-ROP in the next programming
period. It can provide critical information within a reasonable timeframe – after the CIP’s
formulation (in maximum 12 months) and evaluation (in maximum 2 months) – on the number
of projects and their values, in all regions. In addition, there is no possibility to change projects
within CIP after the evaluation process. The USAID CIP Toolkit developed for Romania includes a
detailed example of the implementation of the tool in Giurgiu. Annex 17 provides another
summary example from the Toolkit from Nis, Serbia.

311. At the same time, it is important to be aware of some of the risks that the CIP tool
brings with it. While it is usually easy to comprehend and implement, it often requires technical
and financial data for individual projects (which may not be readily available), and demands a
commitment from local authorities to see the process through. Also, in evaluating and selecting
projects, it is important to engage a wide stakeholder base rather than leaving this process to be
completed a small group of local/county staff.

Proposed framework for evaluating development strategies
312. A development strategy should be the cornerstone for pre-allocating funds to distinct
sub-national governments. It should clearly spell out the key priorities and needs of the
respective administrative territorial unit. Moreover, a tool such as Capital Investment Planning
could be used to prioritize projects and focus on the most stringent needs within the available
fiscal space.

313. Of course, it will also be important for the ROP 2014-2020 to have an evaluation
system in place that enables the proper vetting of development strategies. There already is
some experience with evaluating integrated development plans for the 2007-2013 Programming

  See for example USAID. 2004. “Capital Investment Planning and Budgeting Toolkit” [done with t echnical support

Period and this could be built upon going forward. Within the framework presented above,
there are three major approaches for evaluating development strategies:
     Option 1: Evaluate only the CIP;
     Option 2: Evaluate only the development strategy and individual projects; and
     Option 3: Evaluate both the development strategy and the CIP.

              Figure 32. Option 1 for evaluating city/county development strategies




                                                                                      151
314. Option 1 starts from the premise that the development strategies prepared by county
residences and county councils are good as they are (reflecting the priorities and needs of
those communities), and there is only a need to evaluate the CIP. In essence, in line with the
subsidiarity principle, it is assumed that local/county authorities know best what their own
priorities/needs are, and there is only a need to evaluate the CIP to see if the respective public
authority has the fiscal space to complete the proposed investments. The figure above gives a
snapshot of how this process could look.

315. Basically, pre-allocated funds (i.e., for Type 1 and Type 2 projects) will be made
available only if the targeted public authorities show that the proposed projects are part of a
comprehensive Capital Investment Plan. The Plan should include not only the projects
submitted for ROP financing, but all the projects that the respective public authority plans to
complete over a specific time period – e.g., 5-9 years. Individual projects would be evaluated
using existing evaluation and selection grids.

316. Option 2 follows to a significant degree the current evaluation approach, with an
assessment of the development strategy and individual projects. The basic change to the
existent approach is to not request a new integrated development strategy unless: a) there is no
strategy in place; or b) the strategy addresses a new territory for which no integrated
development strategy was crafted. Where development strategies do not meet basic quality
criteria, a request should be made to incorporate updates/improvements. Individual projects
would be evaluated using existent evaluation and selection grids.


 Option 2 – Evaluation of development strategies and individual projects


 Phase 1a - Evaluation as part of the administrative assessment phase:
 The evaluation process covers projects in coordination with the content of strategy documents.
 At this stage the beneficiaries have to submit projects listed in the following document:
       1. City or County Development Strategy (Request: The strategies have to be updated if
       out of date)
       (Evaluation Yes/No or PASS/FAIL)

 The beneficiaries should present the City/County decisions that prove that the community
 strategies have been approved by city/county councils (Request: Decision of the City/County
 council).

 Phase 1.b – Project evaluation within the strategy context
 The project performance is rated, linked with strategies, as follows:

        1. Project responds to local needs/demand. The project is rated highly if it has a large
        number of users and negatively if the number of users is insignificant (from -1 to +1).

        2. The project supports the community to achieve development objectives. These can be
        rated from a very low level to a very high level (from -1 to +1).

        3. Project complements other public facility. It can be rated negatively if duplicating an
        existing facility, and positively if it complements an existing one (from -1 to +1).

                                                                                              152
 Phase 2 – Project evaluation
 After phase 1b, the project is evaluated from a technical point of view (feasibility study, etc.),
 using the appropriate evaluation and selection grids.40


317. Option 3 is the most prudent one, but also the most time consuming. It involves both
an evaluation of the content of the development strategy, and a technical and procedural
evaluation of the CIP. The key steps of this evaluation option are listed in the box below.

 Option 3 – Evaluation of development strategies and CIP

 Phase 1a - Evaluation as part of the administrative assessment:
 The evaluation process covers the projects, in coordination with the content of strategy
 documents. At this stage, the beneficiaries have to submit projects that are listed in the
 following:
       1. City or County Development Strategy (Request: The strategies have to be updated as of
       2013-2014)
       (Evaluation Yes/No or PASS/FAIL)

 Beneficiaries should present the City/County decisions proving that the community strategies
 have been approved by city/county councils (Request: Decision of the City/County council).

 Phase 2 - Evaluation of the Capital Investment Plan41
 The evaluation criteria encompass aspects presented in the 12 steps described before.42
 Example for evaluators:

 A. Evaluate technical aspects:
        Cost recovery of the project from taxes and user fees may be used to rate projects. Full,

   This option risks promoting projects without a clear image about the impact on the local budget, the estimation of
the operational costs of the proposed interventions, and of the projects already implemented during 2007-2013.

   This plan should be presented as a model within the applicant guide. The CIP takes from 6 to 9 months to
complete. The evaluation is accomplished by a team of 2 – 3 professionals (public finance specialist, urban planner,
infrastructure engineer). The evaluation normally takes 7-10 days.

   A model of detailed rating of the CIP may be developed if the MA-ROP decides to use the tool in the next
programming period.

 After phase 2, the project is evaluated from technical point of view (feasibility study, etc.),
 using specific grids.



What should be the pre-allocation for each county residence and county council
318. Doing pre-allocation for sub-national entities will naturally bring up the thorny
question of how much money each of these entities should receive. This will be, in part, a
question of available funds and of MA-ROP policy. For the ROP 2007-2013, the allocation per
region was decided upon according to population and development level (with more funds
going to the less developed regions). Similarly, the allocation for Growth Poles and Urban
Development Poles was determined primarily based on their development level, with more
funds going to cities from relatively poorer regions. A similar approach may be taken for the
financial exercise and it is ultimately the decision of the MA how it will split the money, should it
decide to do pre-allocations.

319. This section attempts to provide a potential estimate of allocations, based on the
fiscal space for each of the sub-national entities under consideration. In essence, we look at
the financial performance and strength of all the county residences and county councils, for
three fiscal years – 2012, 2011, and 2010. The data are available in full in Annex 20. In what
follows, we will go step by step through the process of trying to estimate pre-allocations for
county residences and county councils.

320. A prudent approach for public authorities is to not spend more than 30% of their non-
earmarked revenues for capital expenses. Earmarked revenues are those revenues that have to
be spent with a particular purpose. EU funds for example, are earmarked funds, as they can only
be spent on certain issues. Capital expenses generally represent non-recurrent expenses, such
as investments in infrastructure. Non-earmarked revenues are revenues that can be spent by
public authorities at will, within the boundaries of the law. For our purposes, non-earmarked
revenues were calculated using the following formula (Annex 20 includes all the detailed data):

      Non-Earmarked Revenues = (Own Revenues) + (Shared Personal Income Tax) +
                               (Non-Earmarked Grants) + (Other Revenues)

321. Next, we estimated the non-earmarked revenues that would be earned during 2014-
2022 (the entire financial exercise). We used three estimates in this respect. We considered
that the economy would grow at different compound annual growth rates: 1%, 3%, and 5%. For
each of these compound annual growth rates, we estimated how many non-earmarked
revenues would be earned by each subnational entity. As a starting base, we used the average
non-earmarked revenues earned in 2012, 2011, and 2010. This offers a better base than just
taking the data for a single year. However, to get a more reliable base, it would help if the
average would be calculated for 5 consecutive years.



                                                                                                 154
322. Once the sum of non-earmarked revenues was calculated for the 2014-2022 period,
we took 30% of that. Again, it is considered prudent to not spend more than 30% of non-
earmarked grants on capital expenses. Each capital expense, such as the development of a road,
also entails operation and maintenance costs once the investment it is completed. If capital
expenses amount to more than 30% of non-earmarked revenues, sub-national entities run the
risk of not having enough revenues to pay for the operation and maintenance of the investment,
once it is finished. Of course, different capital expenses will come with corresponding operations
and maintenance costs once they are completed. For example, the planting of a forest will
require lower recurrent costs than the development of a road (i.e., a forest does not need a lot
of maintenance once it is planted). The 30% threshold is, all things considered, a threshold that
would ensure fiscal prudence for public authorities.

323. The table below indicates the Prudent Fiscal Space for Capital Expenses over 2014-
2022 for all 40 county residences and all 41 county councils. This is basically the upper
threshold that these sub-national entities should have in mind when they plan their
expenditures for 2014-2022. In this calculation these beneficiaries should include not only the
expenses they expect to make from EU funds, but also the expenses from other sources (e.g.,
local budget, national transfers, other donors, etc.).

324. To take the analysis a step further, we also looked at the percentage of capital
expenses that went to EU investments. These are averages that can provide a better
understanding of the dependence on EU funds for county residences and county councils. As
can be seen in the table below, for county residences around 30% of capital expenses are
represented by EU investments, whereas for county councils a staggering 60% of capital
expenses are done with EU grants. As such, county councils are likely to be more dependent on
EU funds to finalize needed investments within their territory, whereas county residences and
municipalities in general seem to have more varied funding sources. This could also be a useful
criterion to use if funds will be pre-allocated to county residences and county councils.

325. Lastly, it helps to look at the overall revenues of county residences and county
councils, and at their degree of dependence on earmarked grants to have a better idea of their
capacity to absorb EU funds in the future. The maps above show cities and counties that have
larger overall revenues, and others that remain more dependent on earmarked grants. Overall,
it is safe to assume that the sub-national entities with larger budgets will also be able to handle
larger pre-allocations than the entities with smaller budgets. Similarly, the sub-national entities
that have a high dependence on earmarked grants may have a more limited fiscal space during
the next programming period.

What kind of projects should receive pre-allocations under Type 2
326. Pre-allocating funds for county residences and county councils offers the MA-ROP an
opportunity to guide sub-national investments in a particular direction. More specifically, the
programme can use pre-allocations to help county residences and county councils focus on
some key development priorities, defined at three distinct levels:
    At the EU level, it is the Europe 2020 strategy that draws the major areas of
       intervention.
    At the national level, it is the Partnership Agreement and the ROP 2014-2020
       Programmatic Document that will provide major guidelines.
    At the local/county level, it is local and regional priorities that matter the most.

327. Looking at these three different tiers, one can come closer to identifying a number of
local/county priority areas for the 2014-2020 Programming Period. The Europe 2020 Strategy
is in place and was discussed in more detail in an earlier chapter; most county residences and
county councils have development strategies in place, with outlined objectives and lists of
projects (see Annex 16); the Partnership Agreement is still under negotiation as of January 2014,
but a first draft of proposed axes for the ROP 2014-2020 is used for planning purposes by the
MA-ROP.

328. Annex 18 lists the draft proposed axes for the ROP 2014-2020 and indicates areas that
could be financed through pre-allocation for cities and counties (Type 2 projects). The
proposed axes respond to the demands of the Europe 2020 Strategy and include a number of
additional priorities in addition to the areas covered during the 2007-2013 programming period.
Some of the key areas that could be financed under Type 2 interventions (i.e., projects of over
30 million RON) include:
     Connective infrastructure;
     Health and social infrastructure;
     Energy efficiency in public buildings;
     Public transport;
     Brownfields redevelopment;
     Natural and cultural heritage; and
     Business incubators.

329. The next step in identifying potential Type 2 projects is to look at the ROP 2007-2013.
For one, we can look at what was financed under Axis 1. Annex 11 provides a detailed overview
of the main areas and key types of projects financed. Thus, we have urban infrastructure (e.g.,
rehabilitation of buildings, public transport, cultural heritage), business infrastructure, and social

                                                                                                  158
infrastructure. But Axis 1 provides only a partial picture, as cities and counties have also applied
for funding under Axes 2, 3, 4, and 5.

330. Annex 19 highlights some of the key investments undertaken under all ROP 2007-2013
axes by cities and counties in Romania. They cover a wide gamut of investments and, based on
the funds allocated for such interventions, some of the key areas include:
     Integrated urban development:
             o Urban infrastructure;
             o Business infrastructure; and
             o Social infrastructure.
     Road infrastructure;
     Education infrastructure;
     Cultural heritage;
     Health infrastructure;
     Tourism infrastructure;
     Business infrastructure;
     Social infrastructure;
     Tourism promotion;
     Emergency equipment;
     Brownfields redevelopment; and
     Energy efficiency in buildings (pilot call, launched in December 2012).

331. More than providing a glimpse of what types of investments were pursued by cities
and counties under the ROP 2007-2013, the data collected for the current programming
period also provide an idea of the preferences of cities and counties. Thus, the share of
financing requests out of the total allocation by Key Area of Intervention indicates what cities
and counties cared about the most. Of course, these numbers are an imperfect measure, as the
FIFO approach often worked as an incentive to focus on things that public authorities could do
well (e.g., roads rehabilitation). Nonetheless, it is interesting to see which Key Areas of
Intervention were most sought after by cities and councils. Consequently, we have, in order of
preference (in parentheses we have included the allocation for that particular key area of
intervention to add another dimension to the analysis – i.e. an area with a high share of
financing requests may have had a low allocation):
     Business infrastructure (247 mil Euro)
     Educational infrastructure (242 mil Euro)
     Road infrastructure (748 mil Euro)
     Tourism infrastructure (294 mil Euro)
     Social infrastructure (85 mil Euro)
     Cultural heritage (242 mil Euro)
     Health infrastructure (174 mil Euro)
     Integrated Urban Development Plans for Urban centers (~301 mil Euro)
     Brownfields redevelopment (27 mil Euro)
     Tourism promotion (128 mil Euro)
     Emergency equipment (85 mil Euro)
     Integrated Urban Development Plans for Urban Development Poles (~195 mil Euro)
     Integrated Urban Development Plans for Growth Poles (~621 mil Euro)


                                                                                                159
332. If the actual allocation for each key area of intervention is multiplied by the actual
financing request rate, one gets a better sense of the key priorities for cities and counties
under the ROP 2007-2013. This simple Priority Index (PI=Allocation*Financing Request Rate)
gives a more rounded picture than just the commitment rate. The top priorities are:
     PRIORITY 1: Road infrastructure (PI=1960)
     PRIORITY 2: Business infrastructure (PI=805)
     PRIORITY 3: Tourism infrastructure (PI=714)
     PRIORITY 4: Educational infrastructure (PI=711)
     PRIORITY 5: Cultural heritage (PI=462)
     PRIORITY 6: Health infrastructure (PI=289)

333. Of course, the numbers above present just one side of the coin. The projects that cities
and counties preferred under the ROP 2007-2013 are limited to the gamut of project types
financed by the ROP. To get a fuller picture, it would help to also see what cities and counties
prefer to finance from other sources (e.g., local/county budget, national transfers, PPPs).
Unfortunately, there is no centralized database that would allow such an analysis.

334. Nonetheless, scanning a number of local and county development strategies does
provide a glimpse of other preferences, apart from those expressed under the ROP. Project
types were assigned different priorities depending on the frequency with which they appeared
in those development strategies and the estimated financial investment. Thus, for county
residences we have the following priority list, in order of listing:

335. The picture painted above is not that much different, from the priorities listed under
the ROP. As such, one could propose a number of priorities to be covered under Type 2 pre-
allocations. For county residences, the priorities could be kept largely the same as they are now
under Axis 1 Integrated Development Plans, which would also make things easier for the MA-
ROP and RDA staff – i.e., the approach used in 2007-2013 could be continued for 2014-2020.
The one priority that could be added is energy efficiency, which is a large pillar under the Europe
2020 Strategy.

336. For county residences, priority investment areas under Type 2 pre-allocations could
include:
     URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE
         o Connective infrastructure – roads rehabilitation; new metropolitan access ways;
            under-ground or over-ground passage ways.
         o Public transport – rehabilitation and extension of tram and bus lines; acquisition
            of energy efficient rolling stock; metropolitan transit lines; multi-modal transit
            stops.
         o Energy efficiency in public buildings.
         o Rehabilitation of educational and health infrastructure.


43
   Some of the investments were partially covered by other OPs, but in most cases LPAs were not eligible for funding
(e.g. highways).
44
   Very limited coverage
                                                                                                                 161
            o  Development of new education and health infrastructure where a distinct needs
               exists.
       BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE
       SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

337. For county councils, priority investment areas under Type 2 pre-allocations could
include:
     CONNECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE
         o Rehabilitation/development of county roads, with a focus on improving access
            to opportunities in the dynamic centers of activity in the county.
         o Development of ring roads for important centers of activity or for busy road
            section.
     HEALTH, EDUCATIONAL, and SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE
     BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE
     CULTURAL HERITAGE

338. To a large extent, the priorities above correspond to the list discussed in the
Competitive Cities report: connective infrastructure; public services infrastructure; quality of
life investments; and targeted measures for marginalized communities. Some of these areas,
however, particularly measures for marginalized communities, should have dedicated funding
lines (e.g., through a CLLD approach), ensuring that public authorities also pay attention to
issues that are often overlooked. The way pre-allocations will be designed could also encourage
a focus on more forward-thinking measures (e.g., climate change).

339. Ultimately and most importantly, however, local and county priorities under the ROP
should be discussed with local and county authorities, as well as with communities and vested
stakeholders. It is important to understand directly from the grassroots level what they consider
to be of priority for the 2014-2020 Programming Period. Closely listening to the needs of local
and county authorities could also ensure faster absorption rates, as beneficiaries will apply more
quickly for projects that they truly need.


Addressing some of the shortcomings of pre-allocating funds to sub-national entities
340. While the pre-allocation of funds for sub-national projects can ultimately lead to a
more efficient and impactful distribution, it does not come without risks. Therefore, this
section will address some of the most important risks identified by the team in the discussion
with the MA-ROP, the IBs, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders. For each identified risk, the
team will discuss ways to address it.

Risk of slowing down absorption
341. As with the regional interventions (Type 1), local and county strategic projects (Type 2)
may help make the ROP 2014-2020 more impactful, but they can also negatively affect
absorption. This is particularly poignant if we consider that Type 2 pre-allocations would require
that 82 development strategies be in place, and that these strategies and/or the corresponding
Capital Investment Plans would have to be evaluated under the ROP. There is also the risk of
having major sub-national public authorities know that they have pre-allocated funds they can
count on (unlike a competitive approach, where they would have to compete with other
authorities to access funds). Particularly relevant in this respect is the relatively poor
                                                                                              162
performance of the Growth Poles and the Urban Development Poles under axis 1 of the ROP
2007-2013, which have the lowest commitment rates and the lowest absorption rates of all the
axes, while also having the largest financial allocation.

342. Fears with respect to how absorption will be affected by such a large pre-allocation
are absolutely valid and it is ultimately the MA’s decision on how it will design the ROP 2014-
2020. Given that Romania has the worst performance on absorption for the current
programming period makes these fears that much more poignant. It is important, however, to
also look at the bigger picture and at available evidence, as well as at new approaches, to see
how a balance between absorption and impact could be struck. As Annex 15 shows, it is only
under Axis 1 (the one with the slowest absorption now) that the ROP shows more strategic
outcomes – i.e., allocating funds where they are most needed from a strategic point of view. The
performance of Axes 2, 3, 4, and 5 indicate a haphazard pattern, with funds going to those
beneficiaries that moved the quickest, without a clear indication that this was the best use of
limited EU funds and that actual pressing needs on the ground were targeted first.

343. To avoid a situation where county residences and county councils “sit” on the funds
pre-allocated, the approach for Type 2 is to impose a realistic and credible deadline by which
these authorities have to contract their projects. If a county residence or a county council does
not move quickly enough on contracting out those projects, then the funds go to a competitive
pool and the more active local/county authorities can access those funds. This also ties in with
one of the strongest principles to come out of behavioral economics, the Loss Aversion
Principle. According to this, people are more averse to losing something they already have than
they are happy about gaining something new. Moreover, county residences and county councils
that will not be capable of accessing allocated funds in time will face the opprobrium of their
electorate. It is bad from a political point of view to lose pre-allocated EU grants, particularly to
a “rival” city. Thus, rather than slowing down absorption, this measure may in fact speed-up
absorption, while also assuring a higher impact of used funds. It is important still to build from
the start mechanisms that ward off against political interference (e.g., sub-national authorities
that come and plead with the MA-ROP to get an extension for contracting out pre-allocated
funds). The moment an extension is granted to a county residence or a county council, the
whole system risks falling apart, as everybody else will feel entitled to receive at least the same
extension.

344. The slow absorption of the Growth Poles and the Urban Development Poles can be
explained by the slow start they had in the beginning of the 2007-2013 programming period.
Not only was Axis 1 the latest one to be added to the roster, but it also took some time before
Growth Poles and Urban Development Poles managed to finalize their integrated urban
development plans. Moreover, as the discussion on regional strategic projects has shown, the
MA-ROP, when compared with other (and similar) Operational Programmes in the EU, has a
very high commitment rate – more than double the commitment rates registered by other OPs.
This indicates, on the one hand, that absorption issues can largely be attributed to systemic
issues, such as the inefficient national public procurement framework. On the other hand, it
suggests that the MA has performed quite well and, provided that systemic issues are resolved,
it could achieve absorption rates similar to better performing countries, while at the same time
also ensuring a higher impact.



                                                                                                 163
345. It will also be important to look at the experience of the OP Environment 2007-2013,
which pre-allocated funds to all county councils for water, wastewater, and solid waste
management projects. While absorption under the OP Environment is quite low (22.31% in
December 2013), the commitment rate is well above 100%. This indicates that the large majority
of projects have been contracted, but it is during the implementation stage where things move
slower.

346. As for the capacity of county residences and county councils to produce good
strategies and/or capital investment plans, the experience with Axis 1 provides some solid
evidence. The most important thing to note is that in addition to the 7 IDPs submitted by
Growth Poles, and the 13 IDPs submitted by Urban Development Poles, there were over 70 IDPs
submitted by Urban Centers. Moreover, there are relatively small cities like Alba Iulia, Slatina, or
Bistrița, which have managed to attract a more significant share of available funds than larger
cities and Urban Development Poles, such as Oradea, Satu Mare, Baia Mare, or Deva. Moreover,
in terms of the amount of funds attracted by August 2013, they were on par with much larger
cities, such as Timișoara, Constanța, Galați, Brăila, or Bacău.

347. The fact that relatively small cities in Romania have been capable of generating good
Integrated Development Plans, and the fact that many have managed to perform quite well
on absorption, is an indication that the same can be achieved in 2014-2020. Overall absorption
and commitment rates for urban centers are above the performance of some individual axes,
although the start was much delayed and they had to complete integrated development plans.
The relative good performance of urban centers can be explained by the competition they had
to face for limited funding. The same competitive spirit can be instilled among county residences
and county councils for 2014-2020, but the competition should be primarily with themselves,
not with other sub-national entities. Only when they lose the competition with themselves (i.e.
they fail to contract projects in the set timeframe) should they enter in a competition with other
public authorities.

348. Of course, the MA may choose to keep the current Urban Centers approach for the
2014-2020 Programming Period – i.e., have a dedicated funding pool for smaller cities (the
cities that are not a county residence). The experience of the ROP 2007-2013 shows that even
smaller cities have the capacity to generate and implement projects. It will be important
however to open up the competition for all cities, not just the ones with a population over
10,000. Many of the smaller towns have complained that they were cut off from EU funding
because they were not eligible for either ROP funding or for Rural Development Funding.
Moreover, given that smaller cities and towns would not be able to finance more than a few
projects under an Urban Centers approach (i.e., dedicated pool for smaller cities, which can be
accessed by the cities in a competitive fashion) and because they typically have a limited
administrative capacity, they should not be required to submit an integrated development plan.
A simpler approach, such as a Capital Investment Plan, could be encouraged instead.

349. To avoid a situation where all Type 2 projects come in for evaluation at the same time,
these could be staggered depending on the size and importance of the respective county
residence and county council. The map below gives an overview of the budget situation for
these sub-national entities. An easy way of staggering the calls for Development Strategies
and/or Capital Investment Plans could be done following the allocations for Axis 1 (under ROP
2007-2013) and would look as follows:
     Growth Poles and counties where Growth Poles are located – 3 years from the start of
       the corresponding axis;
     Urban Development Poles and counties where UPDs are located – 2.5 years from the
       start of the corresponding axis;
     Other county residences and respective counties – 2 years from the start of the
       corresponding axis.

350. An important thing to keep in mind is the collaboration and coordination between
county residences and county councils. Ideally, county residences and county councils should
coordinate the elaboration of their development strategies and capital investment plans, and
they should submit their proposals together. This will allow independent evaluators to gage the
extent to which priorities are aligned within the same county, and to award bonus points when
there is clear evidence of joint planning and common strategic thinking. Again, pre-allocated

                                                                                             166
funds could be used as incentives for encouraging smart planning and efficient spending of
public resources.

351. Another argument against a potential slowing down of absorption under the pre-
allocation model is offered by the current performance under Axis 1. As the figure below
indicates, Growth Pole and Urban Development Pole projects went much faster to evaluation
and eventual contracting than the projects under the other axes. Thus, although the preparation
of the integrated development strategies took longer, the individual projects submitted moved
through the system much quicker than on the other axes. At the same, urban centers had one of
the worst performances on this measure, for causes discussed elsewhere (the report on “ROP
2.0: MA-IB Collaboration”) and primarily related to the system’s capacity to process a large
batch of applications received at the same time.

                Figure 38 How fast (in days) ROP projects move through the system




                 Data Source: Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration

352. Indeed, the poor performance of urban centers can be explained by the high number
of cities (around 70) that have submitted integrated development plans under this Key Area of
Intervention. The evaluation of these IDPs took considerably more time than the evaluation of a
simple project. At the same time, it is important to remember that at the end of 2012, Urban
Centers had the highest commitment rate (143%) of any other Key Area of Intervention (KAI).
This means that Urban Centers were among the best performers on absorption.

353. Projects submitted under Axis 1 also received from independent evaluators the
highest scores on the Technical and Financial grids. Growth Poles received the highest average
scores than any other KAI, while Urban Development Poles and Urban Centers received scores
above the ROP 2007-2013 average. Some of the poorer performing KAIs included
Microenterprises, Road Infrastructure, and Touristic Infrastructure – two areas where a
significant number of applications were received. Brownfields Redevelopment, which scored
poorly on almost every criteria related to absorption, also scored poorly on the technical and
financial evaluation – primarily because such projects tend to be complicated and there is not
enough experience in Romania in having the public sector seal with such investments.
                                                                                           167

354. The discussion above brings a number of important points to the foreground. One:
although Type 2 projects take a lot of time to prepare, there are significant time savings in the
subsequent phases of the process. Two: when a competitive element is introduced (e.g., cities
competing with each other for funds, or cities competing to finalize submission of strategies on
time), absorption rates are increased, while at the same time ensuring that funds are allocated
to strategic priorities.

Risk of not having enough funds for 40 county residences and 41 county councils
355. Another issue that comes up is the lack of sufficient pre-allocated funds for all 81
entities. Moreover, it is rightfully argued that the ROP 2014-2020 may become too one-
dimensional and may jeopardize absorption by putting all eggs in one basket. Some of these
fears can easily be addressed if we simply look at the ROP 2007-2013 experience and if we
consider the future planned funds for the ROP.

356. The allocations for the ROP in the next programming period are slated to more than
double (to around 8 billion Euros). This means that the ROP will have more than 4 billion Euros
extra for investments at the sub-national level. Simple math shows that even this extra
allocation will be more than enough to cover the pre-allocation for county residences and
county councils. Thus, if we consider that for the ROP 2007-2013 Growth Poles received around
90 million Euros each, and if we consider that Urban Development Poles received around 15-20
million Euros each, we can have a starting basis for estimating potential allocations for Growth
Poles and County Residences. We can go with the upper limits of the above figures and consider
that Growth Poles will continue to be allocated around 90 million each, and that each county
residence would get around 20 million. This means 630 million Euros for Growth Poles and 720
million Euros for the other county residences, for a total of 1,350 million Euros for all county
residences. If we assume that each county council will receive on average of 30 million Euros
(for around 2-4 major projects), then we have a total pre-allocation of 1,230 million Euros for


                                                                                             168
county councils. In total, this means that around 2,500 million Euros will be allocated for Type 2
projects – around 30% of the total estimated allocation for the ROP 2014-2020.

357. To take the argument a bit further, we looked at the Prudent Fiscal Space for Capital
Expenditures for county residences and county councils. If we take these numbers as the upper
threshold for prudent capital spending over 2014-2022, then county residences as a whole
should not spend more than 4-5 billion Euros over 2014-2022 on capital expenditures. If we
consider that between 2010-2012 they spent around 30% of their capital expenditures on EU
investments, than we can assume that they will not spend more than around 1.5 billion on EU
investments (close to what we have estimated in the paragraph above). If we look at the
Prudent Fiscal Space for Capital Expenditures over 2014-2022 for county councils, than we will
see that it will be prudent for them to not spend more than 2-2.5 billion Euros on capital
expenditures in this time period. If we consider that over 2010-2012 around 60% of capital
expenditures made by counties represented EU investments, then we can assume that counties
will not be able to spend more than around 1.6 billion Euros on EU investments over 2014-2020.

358. In essence, county residences and county councils will likely not be able to spend
more than around 3 billion together on EU investments, and not more than around 7.5 billion
on capital expenditures in general. They simply do not have the prudent fiscal space for more.
As such, it pays for the MA to think about as many beneficiaries as possible (including beyond
the public sector), as there is likely to be limited fiscal space among these key sub-national
entities. Thus, the ROP with pre-allocations for Type-2 projects may not create a problem of too
little money, but likely one of too much money.


Risk of lack of fiscal space for further capital expenditures
359. A look at the financial data in Annex 20 indicates that many sub-national entities,
particularly county councils, have a relatively tight fiscal space. More concretely, several
counties have spent more on capital investments than they normally should have, given their
current and expected revenues. As such, they should be very careful assuming even higher
expenditures in the following years. Also, it is interesting to see that the evolution in real terms
(when you adjust for inflation) of sub-national revenues has been negative, almost across the
board. This has significant implications for how prepared sub-national entities will be to
continue to absorb EU funds in the future. To give a better picture of which counties are facing
fiscal constraints, we will go through a step-by-step analysis.

360. First, we introduce two financial indicators that were developed by members of the
team – Graham Glenday and Victor Giosan. These financial indicators are dubbed, for simplicity
and easy reference, the Glenday Indicator and the Giosan Indicator. They provide thresholds of
fiscal prudence, which should be used by beneficiaries, the MA, and the RDAs, when EU funds
are contracted. As we will discuss later, these indicators could also be used to assess financial
sustainability when evaluating ROP projects.

361. The GLENDAY INDICATOR calculates the ratio of Capital Expenditures on Total Non-
Earmarked Revenues. For this purpose, using data from the MRDPA, non-earmarked revenues
include Own Revenues, Shared Personal Income Tax, Non-earmarked Grants, and Other
Revenues. The Glenday Indicator was explained in more detail earlier. It basically measures the


                                                                                                169
extent to which public authorities will be able to pay in the future the operation and
maintenance costs for the capital expenditures they are making today.

362. The GIOSAN INDICATOR calculates the ratio of Non-Earmarked Revenues for Current
Expenses on Total Revenues. The indicator tries to assess how much budgetary flexibility exists
at sub-national government level to cover the co-financing and the cash flows of future
investments. Non-earmarked revenues for current expenses include Own Revenues, Shared
Personal Income Tax, Non-earmarked grants, Other Revenues, Reimbursements from EU funds,
minus Capital Expenses. The GIOSAN INDICATOR assumes that a public authority is fiscally
prudent when the Ratio of Non-earmarked Revenues for Current Expenses on Total Revenues is
larger than 30% - basically, when a large enough share of the revenues a public authority makes
go to cover recurrent costs.

363. An outlook on the Glenday and the Giosan indicators by year, region, and county
residence/county council is presented in the table below. Particularly worrisome is that many
sub-national entities seem to face fiscal constraints, particularly in the poorer regions of
Romania.

364. The two figures below indicate a clear deterioration of budgetary flexibility over 2010
– 2012, especially at the county level. There is an obvious move from the bottom-right of the
graph area to the top-left one, which means a simultaneous increase of the capital expenses
ratio, with reduced fiscal space for covering the current expenses, expressed by the absolute
and relative decrease of the Giosan Indicators. However, an important difference exists
between the situation of county residences and the situation of county councils, with the former
in a much better fiscal position than the latter. Some county councils have entered in the
negative (red) area when it comes to the Giosan Indicators. This phenomenon is confirmed also
by the Glenday Indicator. In fact, there is a negative correlation between the Glenday and the
Giosan indicators.

365. Many county councils seem to be facing a tight fiscal space, with less and less room for
further capital investments. This should be something the MA should keep in mind when
designing the ROP 2014-2020. Should it decide to implement a Type 2 approach with pre-
allocations for county councils, then the analysis above provides some good estimates on how
much individual counties can handle. In the same vein, going for the pre-allocation route allows
the MA and the RDAs to control the process much better, deciding from the get-go how much
funding individual counties can receive. If pre-allocation for county councils will not be
considered an option, then it is important to carefully vet financial sustainability in the project
evaluation and selection phase.
                                                                                               173
366. It is important to note however, that the analysis above only looked at data for three
consecutive years: 2010, 20111, and 2012. To fully analyze the full budgetary impact of the ROP
2007 – 2013 on sub-national government budgets, it would be necessary to complete an overall
assessment for the whole period. Given actual data availability, this may not be possible at this
point in time, and one would also have to consider the effect of the global crisis on local and
county budgets, as the crisis made its presence felt in Romania particularly in 2009 and 2010.

367. Another point to mention here refers to the nature of capital expenditures from EU
funds. For the most part, these expenditures focused on the rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure rather on the development of new one. As such, these investments may have
helped reduce future recurrent costs because O&M costs are lower for upgraded infrastructure
than they are for old infrastructure. Most of the ROP expenditures fell under the category of
infrastructure rehabilitation, but there were other Operational Programmes that focused more
on the development of new infrastructure – e.g., OP Transport and OP Environment. Particularly
expenditures made through the OP Environment may be a burden for county councils, because
they focused to a large extent on the development of new solid waste management, water, and
wastewater infrastructure.

368. It is also very important to assess the impact of the last changes to the local
government fiscal framework effective 2014. These changes have a direct impact on the
revenues generated by sub-national entities, and by consequence on the Glenday and Giosan
indicators. Some of the more dramatic changes include the extension of the fiscal base for the
property tax levied on companies and the elimination of the limit for sub-national governments’
discretion to increase/decrease all forms of property tax. The first change will have an inherent
and significant effect on own revenues of first-tier local governments, and the second a
potential but limited one, only if local authorities decide to increase the property tax ratio very
significantly. Both changes will not have any impact on county councils’ budgets.

369. In conclusion, we can say that most sub-national governments face a tightening fiscal
space for funding the operational and maintenance expenses of actual, large investments, and
to cover the co-financing and the cash flow for new investments. The situation got worse in
past years when many of the investments that were contracted in earlier years have come to
fruition. Nonetheless, the situation in not homogeneous among different types of sub-national
governments. County councils seem to particularly be in a tight spot, many of them being at the
limit in terms of their overall capacity to support new investments. County residences are in a
better position, with more space to continue investing, as long as they do so in a moderate
manner.

370. Going forward, if this pattern of spending will continue, with a lot of capital expenses
accompanied by a narrowing budgetary capacity to finance operation and maintenance costs,
it is possible to witness a number of perverse and unwanted side-effects. Some of these could
include:
      a) Open arrears under the form of non-paid invoices for investments, services, or goods at
         the sub-national level;
      b) Hidden arrears under the form of provided works, services or goods, but without any
         invoices issued;



                                                                                               174
    c) The lack of maintenance and abandon of new infrastructure, assets, or services
       developed by the investment projects. There are already some instances of PHARE and
       SAPARD investments abandoned after the end of monitoring period.

371. There are of course solutions for this tightening fiscal space, both on the revenue side
and on the expenditure side. First of all, it is important to allow the fiscal base at sub-national
level to expand, both with regard to Own Revenues and with regard to the Shared Personal
Income Tax. Second, it is important to increase non-earmarked transfers from the central level
to enable a larger fiscal space for sub-national entities. On the capital expenditure side, some
helpful measures could include:
    a) Improve the selection of EU-funded projects (as well as projects funded from
        local/county budgets), focusing on those that promise to have strong economic impact,
        and which in turn could help the fiscal base grow. Estonia, for example, uses a criterion
        in the selection of EU projects to assess the degree to which a particular project would
        have a beneficial effect on the fiscal base.
    b) Prioritize EU investments over investments made from the local/county budget to
        ensure that, whenever possible, capital expenditures use EU grants. This will
        significantly improve the fiscal space for sub-national authorities. Basically, a higher
        priority should be given to EU-funded investments and to the financing of operational
        and maintenance expenses generated by these investments, and only when sufficient
        fiscal space has been created for new investments from the local budget, should these
        be undertaken. This can be done as a best practice exercise or using some rules
        attached to the allocation of non-earmarked grants.

372. Last but not least, it should be noted again that a large share of EU investments is
used for rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, not for the development of new
infrastructure. As such, many of these investments incur, in essence, lower maintenance costs.
This means that many EU-funded investments will in fact help reduce recurrent costs rather
than increase them.




                                                                                               175
XI.     Monitoring and Evaluation
373. Upon reviewing the different scenarios for project selection models, the current
report turns to the question of ensuring adequate monitoring and evaluation (M&E), at
multiple levels. For one, M&E has important implications for how an evaluation system is
designed in the first place. There are also a range of key criteria that should define how
indicators are chosen, both in the application preparation phase and in subsequent stages of
implementation and post-implementation. Second, it is useful to review the highlights of the
ROP’s program and project-level M&E, drawing from ongoing World Bank work on the MA-IB-
beneficiary relationships. The last section under this heading turns to the need for devising a
dedicated M&E component specifically for assessing the performance of project selection
models and proposing adjustments, as needed and when possible.

374. As an introduction, it is useful to set the current report into the right overall context of
a strong turn toward more rigorous monitoring and evaluation. Interestingly, this appears to
be a global trend in the international aid community, with donors increasingly preoccupied with
selecting interventions that deliver the most “bang for the buck” or, in technical jargon,
maximize value for money. This may be a consequence of less flexible budgets in the aftermath
of the recent economic crisis, but also a reflection of a general perception that the aid
community should know, after decades of mixed results, which investments actually deliver the
most positive, tangible impact relative to the needs on the ground.

375. The EU makes no exception to this global discourse that has brought new force behind
the idea of responsible, efficient spending. In fact, after years of placing only a marginal
emphasis on tracking impact, the Commission has significantly bolstered the case for rigorous,
evidence-based monitoring and evaluation, particularly in light of preparations for the 2014-
2020 budgeting period (Annex 25 includes a more detailed discussion on this issue). Romania’s
ROP, along with the other Operational Programmes that pump EU funds into the national
economy (although the important nuance of negative net gains post-accession should be kept in
mind, per the earlier discussion), have to adapt to these key trends and ensure functional M&E
mechanisms. The aim should not be to simply persuade the EC that these programs are serious
about delivering impact, but they should genuinely seek to understand which types of
interventions generate more positive change per EUR or RON spent.

The Performance of the ROP 2007-2013
376. As all Operational Programmes, the ROP had to put a Monitoring and Evaluation
system in place. This system is meant to assess at fixed intervals (usually mid-way through and
after the completion of the program) the degree to which the ROP has actually achieved its
objectives. The system is primarily designed for the staff of the ROP, but it is made public and
others can assess its effectiveness too.

377. The Romanian Institute for Public Policy has done just such an exercise, and has
assessed the performance of the different Operational Programmes in Romania in October,
2013. At a rate of absorption of 39% in August 2013 and at a rate of contracting of 110%, the
ROP managed to realize 23% of its stated indicators. While this is not a stellar performance, it
was higher than that of other Operational Programmes. The only OPs that realized a higher
share of their performance indicators were the OP for the Development of Administrative
Capacity (with 71% of project objectives realized) and the OP for the Development of Human
Resources (26%).

378. As the table above shows, the ROP 2007-2013 performance indicators are primarily output-
based. As such, they provide only a facet of the extent to which the ROP has actually managed to
encourage regional development. Some of the indicators have not been properly filled in. For example,
the first indicator measures the number of accepted Integrated Urban Development Plans. The
proposed target was 30 IDPS. The ROP’s M&E system indicates that 0 IDPs have been accepted, whereas
in reality over 90 IDPs were accepted for financing. There are of course indicators where performance
was actually weak (e.g., the number of rehabilitated polluted sites) and there are also indicators where
the baseline has been surpassed (e.g., kilometers of rehabilitated road or number of pupils who benefit
from rehabilitated schools).

379. Overall, it is clear that the ROP still has some way to go before it has a functional and efficient
M&E system. There still is need for a more realistic development of baseline indicators; more efficient
monitoring of performance indicators is also required; and it would be helpful to also introduce a system
that will help assess the actual impact of ROP investments (more specifically, a system that would help
determine if the ROP actually made a development impact). The next sections discuss some of these
issues in more detail.


Best-Practice Elements of a Functional M&E Framework
380. To begin with, a functional M&E system requires proper alignment with the project selection
model of choice. In other words, the same principles that underlie the methods for selecting the
projects to be financed should apply to how the same interventions are subsequently monitored and
evaluated. A mismatch between the selection model and the M&E mechanisms would lead to
suboptimal situations where a project receives a high score in the evaluation stage but performs poorly
thereafter because the tracked indicators do not measure the relevant performance components. As
such, the link between the two frameworks – project selection and M&E – should be strong and explicit.

381. Equally important, indicators should be easily accessible to all key stakeholders . This is
ultimately the main aim of any M&E mechanism, namely to provide continuous updates on the
performance of a particular program and the intervention it finances. A simple, but powerful metaphor
compares the M&E system to a “dashboard.” On a plane, very few people can understand what every
gauge and light mean, and even fewer know what to do in case something goes wrong. By contrast, on a
car, dashboards are simple enough for everyone to be able to read how the vehicle’s performance is
evolving and whether any special interventions by the driver may be needed. In addition, the indicators
used – both in evaluation and later on for M&E activities – should follow the “SMART” set of criteria:
specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-oriented.
               Figure 42. An effective M&E system is like a good dashboard: simple and easy to read

Program and Project-Level M&E
382. The ROP’s monitoring mechanisms are based on specific articles and provisions of EC
Regulation 1083/2006.48 Chapter II under Title VI (Management, Monitoring, and Controls) is entirely
dedicated to monitoring requirements for structural funds, in broad terms, mandating the
establishment of a Monitoring Committee governed by its own rules of procedure and tasked with
ensuring the effectiveness and quality of the program’s implementation. For Romania’s ROP, as noted
elsewhere, the MC-ROP is presided by the Minister of Regional Development and Public Administration,
and its members come in equal proportions from among: presidents of RDCs; central ministries with
other MAs; and socio-economic partners (labor unions, private sector associations, academia, etc.).
Importantly, an EC representative participates in a consultative capacity to all MC-ROP meetings. The
main task of the MC-ROP is to monitor and report on progress toward set targets for each priority axis.

383. MC-ROP meetings are highly valuable for fine-tuning the program. The MA has provided
timely, complete, and very professional information on the program’s status for each axis, which has
allowed the Committee to reallocate funding and correct certain emerging problems. For example,
when it became clear that the money allocated for intervention area 4.2 – brownfield redevelopment –
would not be spent (primarily due to property rights issues concerning old industrial platforms), MC-ROP
promptly moved part of the financing to other areas, where necessary. Importantly, in line with EC
1083/2006, MC-ROP focuses a lot on tracking program-level targets, but has also dedicated important
time to discussing specific implementation challenges (e.g., public procurement legislation, measure to
accelerate absorption, etc.).49 RDA representatives routinely voice their concerns and describe actual
obstacles faced by beneficiaries on the ground, albeit at a technical level that is appropriate for the
format and time constraints of these meetings. Because more constant institutionalized mechanisms for

feedback and program adaptation are not always present, MC-ROP has served the ROP system very well
by bringing key stakeholders at the same table, twice every year. This has also become the key
instrument for ensuring a direct communication channel from regions to the EC (and vice-versa) and
should be maintained going forward, regardless of the program’s future structure in the context of the
regionalization proposal.

384. As for the ROP’s evaluations, these are highly centralized and mostly handled by MA-ROP.
Chapter I under Title IV (Effectiveness) includes article 48, which clearly mandates Member States to
“provide the resources necessary to carry out evaluations, organize the production and gathering of
necessary data, and use the various types of information provided by the monitoring system.”50 Several
types of evaluations include ex-ante (performed by an external consultant for the ROP), continuous, and
ex-post (performed by the Commission). Per the ROP 2007-2013 (June 2007 version), an Evaluation Unit
functions within MA-ROP from the beginning of the program and is responsible for drafting the
Evaluation Plan and for leading the continuous evaluations (permanent, intermediary, and ad-hoc).
There is also a Central Evaluation Unit (CEU) under the Authority for the Coordination of Structural
Instruments (ACSI). The CEU ensures the development of administrative capacity for the AM-ROP’s
evaluation unit, as well as specific horizontal evaluations that cover several or all OPs in Romania.
Finally, MC-ROP approves the program’s evaluation plan for each year and reports on its progress and
key findings.

385. All in all, the ROP has derived significant value from having institutionalized M&E mechanisms
from the very beginning. There are many investments and foreign aid programs that still get launched
without proper consideration for the importance of M&E in understanding, at all times, what is going
well, where adjustments are needed, and what impact is generated. Going forward, building on the
accumulated experience in the system, the ROP has the opportunity to further strengthen M&E
mechanisms along with moving from a predominant focus on output-type indicators (e.g., absorption
targets) to a more refined outcome-based indicators that makes refined judgments on the level of
impact generated by ROP-financed projects on the ground.

386. At the project level, the ex-post monitoring for project durability entails two annual
components: a beneficiary report and a field visit. The ROP Procedures Manual on Monitoring provides
complete details around both processes, which are meant to verify that projects have not suffered
major changes and indicators defined during the application stage are still fulfilled. RDA/IB staff is
responsible for annual monitoring visits, along with representatives of the Directorate for Coordinating
Field Activities (DCFA) within the MA, who follow the same procedure as the IB. The templates for
beneficiary reports and for the visit reports by monitoring officers are brief but clear, allowing
beneficiaries to explain any special circumstances, if needed, and should be maintained going forward.
The final decision on whether to impose any penalties belongs to the MA, based on the reports
received.

387. Improvements to the status quo are needed particularly when it comes to the types of
acceptable project-level indicators and the methodology and standards used in assessing them after
the completion of an ROP investment. There is a lack of clarity regarding how monitoring officers are
evaluating whether projects have delivered on their indicators and how potential financial corrections
may be decided for beneficiaries who fall short of the targets. The first problem is that there were no
adequate controls on the set of indicators defined by beneficiaries. The applicant guides and the

     Council Regulation (EC) No. 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006.

                                                                                                    184
financing request template instruct applicants to carefully select indicators correlated with program or
axis-level ones. In practice, however, overzealous or inexperienced beneficiaries (and/or their
consultants) often included a wide set of targets, believing that this increased their chances to receive
financing. Some of the indicators chosen were either unrealistic or impossible to measure and attribute,
particularly with respect to the indirect impact of particular investments.

388. For their part, evaluators did not call attention to this problem and a number of projects
ended up receiving financing and committing their beneficiaries to achieving the indicators they had
chosen. Further down the line, particularly in the post-implementation phase, these beneficiaries have a
hard time (a) reaching particular targets; and/or (b) demonstrating that those targets were reached. This
is not always the direct fault of those who put together the application. In a few instances, there are
objective reasons for failing to get to a particular number, as in the case of public-sector beneficiaries
who promised to create new jobs but cannot fill them because of hiring restrictions imposed through
GEO 34/2009. Such cases should have a clear, objective, and fair resolution.

389. On the choice of indicators, applicants should be encouraged to select from a pre-defined list
aligned with program- and axis-level targets, which would be easy to implement particularly through
an e-application form. An electronic application system would not allow users to submit a financing
proposal with indicators beyond the pre-defined set. As an alternative, applicants could be free to
choose their own targets, but evaluators should be allowed and instructed to correct these based on the
principles enunciated above. These solutions would avoid instances of beneficiaries over-promising on
the impact of their projects and would also save time when preparing the monitoring reports. Currently,
beneficiaries have trouble proving that they are reaching set targets and either need to invest additional
funds into this, or hope that they do not get penalized.

390. There is also need for a detailed methodology on how project-level indicators are monitored
and evaluated throughout the implementation and post-implementation phases. For instance,
beneficiaries do not know what point in time counts for which indicator; if they promised to hire, say,
five additional people, it is unclear whether they are required to keep these positions filled for the entire
monitoring period or under what conditions there could be exceptions to this rule. While generally
simpler is better when it comes to regulation, in this case there need to be more details provided
around what is evaluated and how, along with potential applicable sanctions in those cases that fail to
reach set objectives. Whatever is decided, it should be fully aligned with EU-level and national legislation
to make sure that if any corrections are imposed they are upheld by courts in potential legal actions. For
projects that fail to reach their targets, corrections should be applied only in relation to those program
and axis-related indicators and remain proportional to the calculated gaps between target and actual
values.

An M&E Dashboard for ROP 2014-2020
391. Despite some of the shortcomings mentioned earlier, program and project-level M&E is
generally functional and appreciated as valuable by parties involved, but the same is not true of the
monitoring and evaluation of project selection models in particular. It is beyond doubt that selection
models play a most critical role in the success of any EU-funded program, including the ROP, because
they fundamentally shape which interventions receive financing, through what process, and to what
effect. This is the reason behind the proposal below – i.e., a simple dashboard for monitoring and
evaluating the ROP’s project selection models based on the four key objectives described earlier:
absorption – is the model delivering a satisfactory absorption rate?); impact – are the selected

                                                                                                         185
interventions generating positive impact?; legitimacy – is the model (still) credible among applicants and
beneficiaries?; and capacity – are all key components of the system (MA, IB, beneficiaries, and
evaluators) able to perform well and deliver on the tasks required by the selection model?

392. Of course, to provide answers to such questions there is a need to collect, easily access,
process, and assess an extensive database with information related to project and program-level
performance. If SMIS is not the answer to this need, the MA-ROP could consider developing its own
internal system for tracking essential indicators such as: evaluation scores and the “quality” of project
implementation; rejected projects, including a typology of reasons (particularly to fine-tune the
proposed pre-qualification filter and “catch” ideas that are unlikely to succeed before they enter the
pipeline as full applications); evaluation scores and success in reaching set targets; etc.


Better Performance Management for the ROP
393. As indicated throughout the report, performance management, or the concept of successful
operational delivery for the Regional Operating Programme (ROP), must focus on balancing the dual
objectives of absorption and impact. While a high absorption rate is a characteristic of a strong
programme, absorption rates by themselves do not ensure success for the ROP. Absorption is
necessary, but the ultimate objective of the ROP is to create high-impact development. Furthermore,
successfully measuring programme impact is not something that can be left only to ex-post evaluations,
which may be useful for future planning, but will not improve the current performance of the ROP



                                                                                                                                                                        186
programme. With these objectives in mind, successful performance management for the Regional
Operating Programme will require three core elements:
   1. A clear understanding of the broader European Commission performance framework that the
       ROP operates under;
   2. A strategic decomposition of the top-level goals of the ROP, building toward the development of
       the right objectives and indicators for success; and
   3. A performance management structure for ongoing ROP operations across regions, with a clear
       understanding of sub-level objectives and indicators by region and a plan to engage Regional
       Development Agencies (RDAs) to achieve these targets.

394. This section addresses these three elements and then goes a bit further with a final section
suggesting long-term improvements to the operational structure of the ROP that builds on these
elements and could further improve ROP operations in the future.

The Performance Framework for the Regional Operating Programme
395. At the highest level, the performance review of ROP activities falls under the performance
framework for European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds).51 The performance framework,
which consists of selected financial, output, and result indicators as well as key implementation steps for
each priority, is intended to ensure that programmes such as the ROP deliver what is under their
control. This means that priorities are implemented as planned and the programme is kept on course to
achieve its objectives. In particular, a successful programme operating under this framework should
anticipate any expected shortfalls to overall programme performance and take mitigation actions as
soon as possible.

Milestones and Targets for the ROP Performance Framework
396. The performance framework includes two key phases through 2025, with set deadlines at which
top-line programme performance will be assessed: 1) Milestones and intermediate targets achieved as
of 31 December, 2018 – Assessed in 2019; 2) Final performance against targets as of 31 December, 2023
–assessed at the closure of the programming period in 2025.

                                 Figure 44. Two Phases for ROP Performance Framework




397.        According to Annex II of the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR), milestones and targets shall
be:
           Realistic, achievable, relevant, capturing essential information on the progress of a priority;
           Consistent with the nature and character of the specific objectives of the priority;
           Transparent, with objectively verifiable targets and the source data identified and, where
            possible, publicly available;
           Verifiable, without imposing a disproportionate administrative burden; and
           Consistent across the programmes, where appropriate.

                                                                                                                       187
Performance Framework Indicators
398. There are four categories of indicators reviewed under the performance framework, as
described below:

    Indicator                                     Recommended Usage
    Financial   There should be one financial indicator per priority. The financial indicator should relate to
    Indicator   the total amount of eligible expenditure incurred by beneficiaries and paid through the ROP.
                This is the actual absorption rate.

    Output      The output indicators are selected from among the indicators already chosen for the
    Indicator   programme. The aim is to relate the selected indicator(s) to operations representing the
                majority of the resources allocated to each priority axis (e.g. kilometers of road built). The
                number of indicators selected per axis should be kept as low as possible, however, as further
                indicators will raise the risk of failing the milestone set in performance review.

    Result      Result indicators describe specific and measurable outcomes which are delivered at the
    Indicator   review points and are closely linked to the supported policy interventions. All result
                indicators relate to priority axes which are aligned with thematic objectives. These are, in
                turn, aligned with the Europe 2020 objectives. Result indicators are critical aspects of
                performance management, but may not be appropriate for inclusion within the
                performance framework as reviewed because of the timing when results can be achieved in
                the ROP and the need for evaluation to disentangle the effects of the policy from those of
                factors external to the program. Result indicators are primarily used for internal review
                purposes. In the current EC framework, you need to primarily meet financial indicators
                (absorption) and output indicators (e.g. km of built roads).

    Key         Key implementation steps can be an important stage in the delivery of a priority, whose
    Implemen    completion is verifiable. Their achievement could be expressed either in the form "yes" or
    tation      "no" (for example, "All major projects for building waste water treatment plants submitted
    Steps       to the European Commission") or by a number or percentage (for example, "Works have
                started on 80% of selected locations to eliminate level crossings"). In a situation where no
                measurable output is expected by the end of 2018 (for example, due to the lengthy
                implementation of infrastructure projects, kilometers of new railroad will not be
                completed), a key implementation step should be used to set a milestone (for example,
                award of contracts for laying rail tracks). Since by 2023 outputs must be delivered and can
                be demonstrated by an appropriate output indicator, key implementation steps should not
                be used as end of programme targets.

The Performance Framework and the Partnership Agreement
399. Each Member State outlines in the Partnership Agreement the methodology and mechanisms
to ensure consistency in the functioning of the performance framework across programmes and ESI
funds, while the actual performance framework (indicators and their respective milestones and targets)
are included in the programme for each priority. The guidance provided in the draft template of the
Partnership Agreement calls upon the Member States to give an overview of how consistency in the
selection of indicators and the setting of milestones and targets is ensured across programmes and
priorities. Monitoring mechanisms designed to ensure early detection of potential performance issues
and the system for the follow-up of detected issues should be included.




                                                                                                                 188
Selecting Indicators for the ROP
400. Financial indicators for the ROP will simply be the total funding expenditure to date compared
to the overall target rate. Selecting the correct output indicators and/or key implementation steps,
however, requires an analysis of the overall goals and thematic objectives relating to the programme. In
addition to determining the correct output indicators, considerable care must be put into setting
milestones and targets for these outputs that will put the ROP in a reasonable position to be successful
in meeting the targets. All performance indicators and milestones will be presented in the following a
framework similar to the example presented in the table below. Note that this example includes one
financial indicator, one output indicator, and one key implementation step, respectively.

Monitoring the Performance Framework
401. The European Commission (EC) and the Monitoring Committee for the ROP will monitor
performance regularly, and additionally conduct formal reviews following the two phases of the
performance framework, scheduled for 2019 and the closure of the programing period in 2025,
respectively. The MA will include information on progress in achieving the milestones and targets in the
Annual Implementation Reports (AIR), beginning from the reports submitted in 2017. The data
transmitted will relate to values for indicators for fully implemented operations. Following this
examination, the EC may make observations to the MA concerning issues that significantly affect the
implementation of the programme. In such a case, the MA should provide all necessary information with
regard to those observations and, where appropriate, inform the EC within three months of the
measures taken.

402. The monitoring committee reviews the implementation of the programme and progress
toward achieving its objectives, taking into account the milestones defined in the performance
framework. The monitoring committee may also make observations to the MA regarding the
implementation of the programme and its evaluation, and monitors actions taken as a result of its
observations. Romania may propose the revision of milestones and targets in duly justified cases, such
as a significant change in the economic, environmental, and labor market conditions in the country or a
specific region, or in the case of changes in allocations for a given priority.52

Setting ROP Goals
403. Setting correct goals and indicators for the ROP must be done in line with the top level
development goals as set in the Europe 2020 Romania development targets, as well as the investment
priorities for the European Regional Development Fund.

Top-down Goals vs. Bottom-up Project Selection
404. These top-level goals set the strategic alignment for ROP priorities, but the reality of
development under the ROP is that project selection will be largely developed at the regional level.
Therefore, it is important to develop a common understanding across all ROP stakeholders of these top-
level goals, while allowing for local action to self-align with the overall goal areas. Top-level goal
development must also take into account the realities of development in regional areas, where differing
budget and operational realities will affect the level of absorption possible by various strategic projects,
and the level of demand for transportation, education, and other projects in each of these regions.
Finally, the specific needs of people in these regions (to include at risk populations and sub-populations)
will greatly shape the impact that can be derived by seemingly similar projects in different regions.
These local considerations are the purview of the local cities and county councils, and the RDA’s must be
able to inform goal selection and ongoing measurement of goal performance with these considerations.

405. The top-line development targets relating to the ROP come from the Europe 2020 Romania-
specific targets, as indicated in the table below.

Investment Priorities for the European Regional Development Fund
406. The starting point of programming is the identification of development needs or challenges to
be addressed, which should help to identify the funding priorities . This is followed by: 1) selection of
thematic objectives and investment priorities as set out in the CPR and Fund-specific rules; 2) definition
of at least one specific objective per investment priority to target the latter appropriately in the specific
national or regional context; 3) definition of result indicators linked to specific objectives

                             Figure 47. The Programming stages the ROP has to go through




407. Only after the development needs, objectives and the result sought have been clarified,
should one consider the types of actions to be supported, choosing (a mix of actions) which best
achieves the objectives defined. Output indicators should be logically linked to and reflect the types of
actions planned. Outputs generated by actions should also contribute logically toward the results that


                                                                                                                     192
one aims to achieve.53 The table in Annex 23 decomposes the investment priorities for the European
Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and the ROP priorities for funding as set in the current Partnership
Agreement. The Annex also shows how the US has set performance indicators for similar programs.

Managing for Performance across the Regional Operational Programme
408. Understanding that the MA-IB structure depends on both strong coordination at the MA level
and mature operations at the RDA level, the MA and the RDAs should cultivate an ongoing
understanding of the level at which each RDA is operating. This maturity model framework would
define the organizational features (both current and future) of a successful RDA. With this model, MA
operations can better take into account what is capable at present across RDA operations as well as
identify key intervention areas to support developing new RDA capabilities.

                                   Figure 48. Maturity Model View of RDA Operations




409. Through this maturity model approach, the MA can understand how effective its new
strategies for regional development may be by region. The MA should also use this framework to
understand what capabilities it should work to encourage at each RDA within the ROP.

Setting Sub-goal Targets and Milestones by RDA
410. In working toward the overall goal objectives of the ROP as set in the EC performance
framework, the MA should be able to clearly break out sub-goal targets and milestones for each RDA.
These sub-goal targets and milestones should collectively contribute toward success for the overall ROP
objectives. In setting appropriate sub-goal targets and/or milestones, the MA should work with each
RDA to set specific, time bound targets across each investment axis that:

       a) Reflect the local needs within the region, and
       b) Are believed to collectively deliver the outcomes on each axis which the MA is responsible for as
          part of the performance framework.

Data-Driven Performance Reviews with RDAs
411. On at least a quarterly basis, the MA should conduct data-driven performance reviews with
the RDAs to monitor and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ROP programme across each
region and as a whole. These data-driven reviews, also referred to as PerformanceStat – or just STAT
programs, bear a close resemblance to other types of program reviews that government officials
traditionally hold with members of their staff to identify emerging trends and discuss key program issues
and problems. However, the process described here is distinguished by the frequency and regularity of
its meetings, the focus on the latest performance indicators, and the somewhat structured format.54

     What is PerformanceStat?

     “PerformanceStat programs employ regular meetings between the chief executive (chief, principal, mayor, or
     governor) and agency directors where performance data is used to analyze each agency’s performance,
     establish performance objectives and accountability for those objectives, and schedule follow-up to ensure
     these objectives are met. Each of these elements is important to the integrity of the program. Stat programs
     without regular meetings, accurate and timely data, clear direction, and rigorous follow-up will rarely
     accomplish much.”

     —Thornburgh et al., 2010, p. 1

     “A jurisdiction or agency is employing a PerformanceStat leadership strategy if, in an effort to achieve specific
     public purposes, its leadership team persists in holding an ongoing series of regular, frequent, integrated
     meetings during which the chief executive and/or the principal members of the chief executive’s leadership
     team plus the director (and the top managers) of different subunits use current data to analyze specific,
     previously defined aspects of each unit’s past performance; to provide feedback on recent progress compared
     with targets; to follow-up on previous decisions and commitments to produce results; to examine and learn
     from each unit’s efforts to improve performance; to identify and solve performance-deficit problems; and to
     set and achieve the next performance targets.”

     —Robert D. Behn, The PerformanceStat Potential: A Leadership Strategy for Producing Results (forthcoming
     2014).



412. The use of regularly scheduled, structured, data-driven meetings to review project data with
MA and RDA staff will:
    Encourage attention to the need for continuous improvement
    Help identify policies and practices that are working well and ones in need of improvement
    Increase awareness of unforeseen 2nd and 3rd order impacts of regional ROP activities (such as
      broader environmental and energy efficiency trends or raising local government operations and
      maintenance expenditure loads due to increased investment)
    Promote cross-regional collaboration and the dissemination of best practices
    Improve ROP effectiveness (in terms of absorption) and efficiency (in terms of impact)
    Provide ongoing assessment of success under the performance framework and a more
      convincing case to Romania and the EC that the ROP is using its funds wisely and that its budget
      requests are justified
    Increase accountability of ROP projects under review.

A Data Dashboard for Reviewing RDA Performance
413. A data driven performance review of RDAs must begin with a standardized dashboard to
facilitate comparison across all RDA operations. However, regions across Romania have vastly different
needs, and as such the different RDAs should have a variety of focuses. With this in mind any successful
data-driven review across these regions must be capable of diving deeper into more specific activities to
expose the unique successes, challenges, and needs of each RDA.

Long Term Maturation of the ROP Capabilities
414. This section addresses long-term considerations for improving ROP operations that are not
necessarily feasible in the short-term, but which should be considered in planning and developing
current and future ROP operations.

Priority Goal Setting across Cross-Cutting Thematic Challenges
415. There are a number of thematic challenges faced by all regions of the ROP, as exhibited in the
table below.
                  Social Challenges                            Environmental Challenges
    Marginalized communities                              Energy efficiency
    Equal opportunity and non-discrimination              Environmental impact and rehabilitation

416. In working toward achieving objectives across the priority axes, the MA should consider
designating a small number of related cross-cutting goal targets along these thematic challenges,
which would prioritize specific outcomes in these areas across all national, regional, and local projects.
These outcomes would be aggregated nationwide as an additional output of the data-driven
performance review process across the regions, and would be managed by designated goal leaders for
these areas operating at the MA, and potentially the ROP level.

Measuring the overall performance of the ROP
417. In addition to internal ROP performance indicators, it is important to also look at how the ROP
performs using external indicators. Most importantly, it is important to see if ROP has met its overall
objective –generating development at the regional level. Overall development performance is computed
through GDP per Capita, which is now calculated at the country, regional, and county (județ) level. There
is however no standardized measure assessing development performance at the local level. Given that a
large majority of ROP investments are done by localities, or directly and indirectly affect localities, it is
that much more important to also gage the efficiency of the ROP by measuring the economic
performance of localities.

418. One of the best measures for measuring developmental performance was elaborated by
Dumitru Sandu, a leading sociologist in Romania. Professor Sandu has adapted the UNDP Human
Development Index methodology and has computed a Local Human Development Index (LHDI) for
localities in Romania. Given restrictions pertaining to data availability, the LHDI was computed only at
Census moments (as some of the data required for its computation only gets released with the Census).
Annex 24 presents, in detail, the LHDI methodology and how it could be adapted so that the index can
be calculated every 2-3 years. This will allow an assessment of whether the ROP, and public investments
in general, manage to have a discernable development effect at the local level. Using the LHDI at regular
time intervals can help give a better picture of where public money was spent wisely, and where it was
wasted.

                                                                                                         195
XII. Conclusions
419. Based on this analysis and many others – both by the World Bank and other stakeholders –
Romania faces a major challenge in managing and implementing the Cohesion Policy in the 2014-2020
programming period. In order to improve the quality of spending, the new regulatory framework at the
EU level has created more demanding requirements for managing authorities and intermediate bodies
with respect to strategic direction, performance, and results-based implementation. This added layer of
complexity – i.e., looking at the impact of investments beyond just output measures – is as needed as it
is challenging to adopt, particularly for a country that has struggled to deliver on simpler absorption
targets. Now Romania is rightfully asked to adopt a more nuanced, balanced approach that takes into
account both the absorption and the expected impact of EU funds. This new direction comes against a
background still dominated in Romania by important system-wide issues that affect the implementation
of EU-funded interventions (and public investments more generally): cumbersome public procurement
procedures; poor quality technical documentation; and insufficient beneficiary capacity, both internal
(own human and financial resources) and external (unreliable service providers, inadequate contract
forms, etc.).

420. The good news is that the Regional Operational Programme has been a constant top
performer in terms of absorption and commitment rates, in the Romanian context and even beyond,
as this report has shown. If there is one OP in Romania that can handle an enhanced, dual focus on
absorption and impact and can be expected to deliver on set targets, it is likely the ROP, with its strong,
hard-tested MA-IB relationships and beneficiary support mechanisms. This optimistic expectation will
likely be fulfilled even in the context of a financial allocation that is expected to double for the ROP,
putting additional strain on the system’s capacity to deliver. One thing is certain: the selection model
and criteria will remain key components of the ROP’s performance during the 2014-2020 programming
period.

421. The ROP has hitherto relied on two main mechanisms: pre-allocated funds and FIFO. Both
have their advantages, but they also suffer from important weaknesses in relation to the quality of
projects coming through the system’s pipeline. In part, weaknesses are due to the current strategic
approach to the ROP’s management and Romania’s institutional framework (lacking a regional tier),
which do not provide sufficient flexibility for interventions to be targeted to the development needs and
challenges of regions and places. There are also operational constraints, notably inadequate
administrative capacity in applicant organizations, along with shortcomings in the appraisal and
evaluation of projects. The current analysis is motivated by an honest and essential admission that the
current system is improvable, although expectations of radical changes are likely unreasonable, not in
the least because a whole range of core issues do not even depend on the ROP and its key players, let
alone on how individual projects are evaluated and selected for financing. That said, maintaining the
scope of the current analysis within reasonable parameters, the aim has been to identify ways of
improving the status quo system.

422. A primary conclusion of this extensive analysis is that there is no silver bullet in the endeavor
to craft the perfect selection model. Each of the options explored has both advantages and drawbacks,
and the MA-ROP is ultimately the main actor accountable for its choices. The figure below is a simplified
attempt at assessing the various scenarios discussed based on: corresponding presumptions that would
need to hold to justify a particular choice; and, perhaps more importantly, the four key dimensions that
help characterize a project selection model – absorption (how quick?), impact (how effective?),

                                                                                                       197
legitimacy (how credible?), and capacity (how feasible?). As this snapshot shows, there is no perfect
option – in simple terms, none of the scenarios presented feature four fully black circles. All in all,
scenario 2 seems to have a slight edge over the alternatives, as a “middle of the road” solution that
combines a focus on large, strategic projects with pre-allocated funding with the need to introduce
some competition among all beneficiary types, even in the form of competing against tighter deadlines
and facing the risk of “losing” money set aside for them. Scenario 2 is also consistent with the principle
that less risky, smaller projects should benefit from simplified evaluation procedures and criteria, and
the FIFO rule would help accelerate absorption without reducing the quality of proposals received (since
at this level of funding applications are expected to be relatively standard). By preserving some of the
elements of the framework applicable during the 2007-2013 ROP, scenario 2 is also able to fare
relatively well on the capacity dimension, in the sense that it does not completely revolutionize a largely
functioning system.

Note: A larger black-fill in the pie-charts indicates the degree to which each individual scenario fulfils a specific criterion

423. The purpose of the current analysis, however, is not to promote one option ahead of the
others, particularly given that tradeoffs between the four essential desiderata – absorption, impact,
legitimacy, and capacity – cannot be avoided. Instead, this report has provided the following, in logical
order:
        1) Adaptation of the PIM framework to the ROP, making the distinction between public works
            and service-based projects;
          2) Analysis of the 2007-2013 project selection models, including areas for improvement;


                                                                                                                                  198
       3) Collection of best practices from other EU Member States, both to inspire ROP decision-
          makers and to make the point that there is no perfect system to be adopted by Romania;
       4) Definition of several core principles for an optimal project selection framework: balancing
          absorption and impact; facilitating high-quality development strategies that respond to
          regional needs; and adjusting selection models based on project size/complexity;
       5) Proposal of three different scenarios for the 2014-2020 ROP project selection models, going
          from marginal changes (“Status Quo+”) to more significant adjustments of current systems
          (“Competitive”), while emphasizing that the greater the changes, the harder it will be for the
          system to adapt to them in a timely and effective manner;
       6) Horizontal recommendations applicable to all project selection scenarios (e.g., strong
          development strategies, FIDIC contracts, ROP electronization, etc.);
       7) Step-by-step and grid-by-grid suggestions for improvement, at the level of: the entire
          process (from a potential pre-qualification phase through evaluation and selection); overall
          selection grids (e.g., the order of criteria, corresponding weights, etc.); and individual
          criteria, suggesting very specific ways of enhancing the definition and measurement of
          various project characteristics;
       8) Arguments in favor of promoting strategic projects at the level of regions, based on clearly
          identified priorities and new/innovative institutional set-ups for the management of such
          interventions;
       9) Arguments in favor of pre-allocating funds (in an initial phase of 2-3 years) to counties and
          county residences (including Growth Poles), with pre enhanced opportunities to better
          prepare projects, while recognizing and properly responding to the risks of pre-allocation –
          especially the potential lower absorption of funds; and
       10) Framework for optimal monitoring and evaluation of the ROP, with a special focus on the
           actual project selection model and feedback loops for ensuring constant improvement.

424. Beyond doubt, the assessment of ROP project selection models does not and should not stop
with the completion of the current analysis. The first year of the new programming period (2014) is
fundamental for setting the right foundations for the new ROP, particularly when it comes to how
projects are evaluated and selected. While generally it is not advisable to change the rules of the game
after the first “whistle,” this principle should hold even stronger with respect to project selection
procedures and criteria. Keeping in mind the need to ensure a high degree of legitimacy for the system,
applicants and beneficiaries should remain confident that they are judged based on the same rules,
ensuring fair and equal treatment. Regardless of subsequent political pressures for tweaking the
applicable framework, the chosen selection model should remain relatively consistent across time, while
also ensuring functional M&E mechanisms to make critical adjustments (if needed and if possible) and
capture learnings for the coming programming periods.

425. Regardless of the MA’s ultimate choices in terms of the 2014-2020 ROP’s selection model and
criteria, the fundamental aim of the programme should remain front and center – to promote
Romania’s sustainable and inclusive development. In that endeavor, the importance of the ROP, both
as an indispensable source of funds and as a unique catalyzer of administrative capacity building, can
hardly be overstated. Some of this impact will continue to be very visible across the country, changing
people’s lives in very concrete terms: a new road; a better equipped, modern hospital; a proper school

                                                                                                    199
with comfortable temperatures year-round; a new business center employing hundreds or thousands of
people; a renovated museum, etc. Other types of impact, including the motivation of countless public
servants, the shift in mentalities, and the improved capacity to deliver key services to citizens, may be
harder to quantify, but no less important. Ultimately, this is the power of EU convergence at its best,
and Romania’s ROP will continue to play a key role in this historic effort.

Annex 4. Analysis of Regional Committees for Strategic Evaluation and Correlation (RCSECs)

Government Decision 764/2007 initially assigned the strategic screening role to the Regional Committees for
Strategic Evaluation and Correlation (RCSEC), organized at the level of the eight development regions, under the
supervision of Regional Development Councils. Each RCSEC comprises two representatives of Local Government
Units from every county in the Development Region and an equal number (with LG representatives) of
representatives from professional associations, business association, trade unions, and other NGOs. The Regional
Development Council approves the appointment or replacement of the RCSEC members. The Regional
Development Agency acts as the secretariat for the RCSEC.

Initial main functions of the RCSEC, according to the Government Decision 764/2007, were as follows:
     1) Strategically evaluate projects proposed to be financed under the ROP in the RCSEC’s corresponding
          region – the RCSEC made a prioritized list of projects after these individual interventions had been
          evaluated in the technical and financial evaluation phase;
     2) Provide opinions and recommendations regarding the regional correlation of projects financed by public
          resources;
     3) Make recommendations to the MA-ROP on potential needed changes in evaluation and selection criteria
          and funds reallocation among priority axes and key area of interventions within ROP; and
     4) Make recommendations to the MA or IBs on improving the coordination of structural instruments at the
          regional level.

Under this regulation, function (1) was essential. However, the strategic evaluation was conducted only after the
technical and financial evaluation, as noted above. International good practice suggests that strategic screening is
conducted before project appraisal and selection evaluation. A project that fails to meet the strategic consistency
test should be rejected, making it unnecessary to subject it to further evaluation. An appropriate institutional
arrangement to ensure that all major project proposals are screened is a critical must-have feature so that
resources are not wasted in more detailed project appraisal.

In 2008, Government Decision 1383/2008 stipulated that the RCSECs would henceforth have only a consultative
role and function (1) was eliminated. The reasons for this significant change are presented by the 2008 Annual
Implementation Report of the ROP, prepared by the MA, and are summarizes below:
     a) In the comments of the EU Commission on the audit report prepared by the National Audit Authority:
               - The role of RCSECs is unclear and duplicates some of the evaluation criteria (used for the technical
                 and financial evaluation).
               - The strategic prioritization by the RCSEC is not properly justified. Some members of RCSECs (e.g.,
                 in the West Development Region) did not provide objective reasons for their choices;
               - The actual structure of RCSECs generates delays and even restricts some beneficiaries ’ access to
                 financing;
               - The actual structure of RCSECs reduces the transparency of the whole project selection process.
     b) There were many difficulties in organizing RCSECs, which obstructed the selection process after the
         technical and financial evaluation (e.g., in the Bucharest-Ilfov development region);
     c) Monthly meetings required by GD 764/2007 did not always take place, which created delays in the
         selection process in some regions (e.g., in the South-East and North-East development regions).

During field interviews conducted by the team in June 2013, participants emphasized that having an RCSEC was a
good idea, but it was not well-designed to achieve the desired functions. The main reasons for the RCSEC failure
are as follows:
     a) The strategic screening was organized after the technical and financial evaluation and not before;
     b) Many RCSEC members, essentially the representatives of Regional Development Councils, were in conflict
          of interest because they were also applicants under the ROP;
     c) The RCSEC activity was not well defined: there were no clear criteria and procedures for strategic
          prioritization;


                                                                                                                227
    d) RCSEC failed to coordinate projects financed through different Operational Programs (OPs) due to the lack
       of clear procedures regarding data collection. There are no clear requirements and enforcement
       measures on who should send what information to the RCSEC, when, and how.

In the future ROP, a RCSEC-like strategic committee can be reorganized with the following essential conditions:
     1. Clear criteria and procedures for member selection;
    2.   Balanced structure between elected officials and representatives of business and economic environment,
         civil society, and academic institutions;
    3.   Clear rules and procedures for the coordination of projects financed through different OPs, especially on
         data collection and reporting;
    4.   Clear criteria and detailed procedures for strategic prioritization: pre-defined grids that will emphasize the
         relevance and opportunity of submitted projects;
    5.   The strategic committee will assess the project proposals based on a limited technical documentation:
         project fiche, ownership documents, application form, and prefeasibility study;
    6.   Limited number of members to maintain efficiency of procedures;
    7.   Clear code of conduct in dealing with potential conflicts of interests;
    8.   Regarding the sustainability of O&M, any detailed assessment of O&M needs and the ability of the
         government to support these will generally be prepared at the feasibility study stage. At the point of
         strategic screening, the focus should be on the potential outputs or services of the project relative to
         regional needs.

Annex 5. Analysis of Integrated Urban Development Plans (PIDUs)55

Integrated Urban Development Plans (PIDUs) are strategic documents specifically required to be produced by
growth poles (GPs), urban development poles (UDPs) and urban centers seeking ROP financing under priority axis
1.1. For GPs and UDPs, there is a list of projects attached to each PIDU based on a pre-determined ROP fund
allocation. Therefore, the quality of the PIDUs is critical for the identification of projects and their impact.
These strategic documents were seen as integrated approaches that focus on a few key areas for the long lasting
development of cities: infrastructure improvement, economic development, environmental protection, and social
inclusion. It was for the first time that Romanian local governments had designed such complex strategic
documents dealing in an integrated way with cross-sector issues. In this context, the experience of PIDUs can be
seen as a positive one, supporting a multi-area integrated approach, completely different from the narrow and
isolated sector approach, usually used by local governments in Romania. This exercise was very complex and
challenging for the local government institutional capacity, even for important cities that fall under the GPs and
UDPs classification. Due to the importance of these strategic documents, this short analysis will underline the main
issues that require special attention and improvement in the future. It is also important to note that the World
Bank conducted in 2013, as part of a technical assistance project focused on “Growth Poles,” a full assessment of
PIDUs, including recommendations for their improvement.
In our analysis, we looked at eight PIDUs from various development regions (except for Bucharest-Ilfov, since it
does not have a GP or UDP). The GPs/UDPs in the sample are: Brasov (DR-Center), Cluj-Napoca (DR-North West),
Iasi and Bacau (DR-North East), Ploiesti (DR-South), Arad (DR-West), Constanta (DR-South East) and Ramnicu
Valcea (DR-South West). Our sample covers 40% of all GPs and UDPs. Our analysis focuses essentially on strategic
planning issues: the relevance of the actual situation analysis; the quality of SWOT analysis; the logic of the
strategic chain: main goal leading logically to specific objectives/priority domains for intervention, which in turn
lead to measures/actions/projects; performance measurement, budgetary sustainability, especially on operation
and maintenance costs for projects with almost free capital costs. The following findings apply to all the PIDUs in
the sample, unless otherwise indicated.

Section on General Features of the Growth Pole/Urban Development Pole
This section in the PIDUs is an exhaustive actual description of the cities from many perspectives: geographic and
demographic, economic and social, education and health, urban and infrastructure. This part is the longest in the
PIDU, always taking up more than a half of the entire document. There are a lot of descriptive data, maps, and
graphs on all subjects. There are a number of issues in this section that affect the following sections of the PIDU:
     a) The scope of the section is too large (at least 100 pages), exceeding the needs of a PIDU. There are many
         interesting but unnecessary data;
     b) There is no clear connection between the descriptive data in this section and the list of problems
         underlined. The data generally do not help define and provide evidence for the problems listed. The
         problems are not defined based on evidence or performance indicators;
     c) There is no prioritization of the main problems to make a direct link with the objectives and actions
         detailed in the PIDU. The analysis in this section does not focus on a limited number of areas. The analysis
         should have been not only documented with gross data but also with impact indicators to help develop
         subsequent action plans in later sections of the PIDU;
     d) Other higher-level strategic documents are only enumerated and the connections in terms of objectives
         and actions are not detailed and not always followed.
                                                                                 56
Section on Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) Analysis

  The Strategic IDPs Assessment report provides a more in-depth analysis of the 2007-2013 Integrated Development Plans.
56
  This analysis is based on the Manual of methods used in policy planning and impact assessment realized by Latvian experts
under the Twining PHARE Project “Consolidation of the institutional capacity of the Romanian Government to manage and

                                                                                                                        229
SWOT analysis is one of the most used strategic planning tools in Romanian public administration. However, the
quality of the SWOT analysis is subject to improvement, as presented below:
    a) The SWOT analysis is reduced to a table divided in 4 sections, containing a large number of items (in some
         PIDUs the table extends on 14 pages), many of them very detailed and fragmented. It is not clear how the
         consultative process to develop the SWOT analysis was organized – i.e., the methodology for this activity:
         number and structure of focus groups, objectives of the analysis, list of questions, methods for
         prioritization;
    b) The SWOT analysis is not integrated, but a specific table with 4 sections is completed for every sector:
         economic development (or even more detailed: agriculture, industry, small and medium-sized
         enterprises, foreign investments, tourism, etc.), social sector, infrastructure, environment, education,
         health – in some cases, the number of sectors is high – e.g., 18. In this way, the capacity to integrate the
         analysis is significantly reduced by the impossibility to prioritize Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities,
         and Threats among sectors, not only within a specific sector.
    c) In most of the PIDUs in the sample, there is confusion between Internal Environment (S-W dials) and
         External Environment (O-T dials): items that are from the internal environment are enumerated among
         Opportunities/Threats or vice-versa. For example, EU funds were listed in the Strengths instead of in the
         Opportunities; economic crisis was listed in the Weaknesses instead of the Threats.
    d) There is no prioritization process based on items under each of dials: Strengths, Weaknesses,
         Opportunities, and Threats, finally obtaining a limited number of “the most important” S, W, O, T.
    e) There is no strategic analysis trying to set specific approaches: S-O, S-T, W-O, W-T, based on what to set as
         the vision and the main/strategic goals/objectives.
    f) In brief, the SWOT analysis has a limited role in setting the strategic vision and objectives. It remains a
         tool that must be used as a mandatory section of the strategic document. From all the PIDUs analyzed,
         only one PIDU (from Brasov city) develops the linkage between the problems identified as Weaknesses
         and the needs understood as future key area of interventions. Unfortunately, even in this case, the
         linkage is not very clear and the rest of SWOT dials (Strengths, Opportunities, and Threats) remained
         unused in the strategy section.

The Strategy Section
The Strategy section in PIDUs describes the visions, strategic objectives, specific objectives, main areas of
intervention, and a set of actions/measures. There are a number of critical issues that should be improved in the
future:
     a) The structure of the strategic chain is too cumbersome: General Goal  Strategic Objectives Specific
         Objectives Priority Domains  Policies  Actions/Measures/Projects. This complication of the logic
         chain often leads to incoherence between the goals and actions. The logic chain should be more simple
         and straightforward: Strategic Goals  Specific Objectives  Actions/Measures/Projects;
     b) There are too many strategic objectives and specific objectives. In some PIDUs, there are 20-30 strategic
         objectives and over 100 specific objectives. A good PIDU should have 5-6 strategic objectives and 25-30
         specific or operational objectives. In this case, the level of detail is too high and there is a clear lack of
         prioritization and integration of what should be achieved eventually. PIDUs do not highlight potential
         trade-offs among different objectives, which would confront the decision-makers at the city level;
     c) The specific objectives are designed more as actions/measures or in some cases as simple wishes – no
         SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound) definitions are used in any of the
         PIDUs in the sample. This an essential weakness because the implications are very important: the lack of
         SMART definition generates the absence of performance indicators assigned to specific objectives, which
         leads to the impossibility to monitor and evaluate the strategic document;
     d) There are too many actions/measures without prioritization and clear justification for their selection. For
         example, it is not clear why the modernization of a street or the rehabilitation of a bridge is selected, and



coordinate the policy and decision making processes,” Bucharest 2006, GSG web site:
http://www.sgg.ro/docs/File/UPP/doc/manual_metode_impact.pdf.


                                                                                                                  230
         not some other street or another bridge. There is unclear justification for actions on how they contribute
         to specific objectives.
    e)   There is no budget analysis on sustainability of all these projects, from two perspectives: the co-financing
         of investment costs and, essentially, the budgetary envelope for the operating and maintenance costs.
         There is a lack of analysis and forecast of local budgets, using performance indicators (as ratio of own
         revenues in total revenues, budget dependency on state transfers, rigidity of expenditures, capital
         investment ratio in total expenditures, annual debt service ratio in current revenues, or gross/net current
         surplus/deficit). The lack of this analysis may create the illusion that projects whose capital costs are
         largely funded by the EU will have little impact on local budgets over the medium and long term.
    f)   There is no performance measurement, monitoring system, or reporting system on the results of these
         PIDUs. This is the result of missing the SMART definition for specific objectives.

In conclusion, IDPs are generally focusing more on technical and detailed descriptions of the actual situation and
less on strategic issues such as: vision; priorities and the trade-offs facing the decision-makers; the logic of the
chain (strategic objectives – specific objectives – actions); results and impact measurement; budgetary
sustainability, especially in terms of operations and maintenance costs in the context of relatively low capital costs.
The strategic section of PIDUs is strongly driven by the eligibility criteria for the Priority Axis 1.1 rather than the
specific priorities and needs of the GPs/UDPs.

Annex 6. Analysis of Regional Development Plans for the period 2014 - 2020

Regional Development Plans have been drafted for the 2014 – 2020 period. These are expected to provide
investment guidance to projects in each region, mainly for the 2014 – 2020 ROP and other OPs. The RDPs drafts
continue to be driven by what is at this point considered the “most probable” potential structure of the 2014 -2020
programming period – it is not entirely clear as of January 2014 if Romania will have only one ROP, like in the 2007-
2013 budgeting cycle, two ROPs (one for the Bucharest-Ilfov region and one for the rest of regions), or eight ROPs
(one for each region). In this context, the major challenge will be how to fit the regional priorities within the
national framework and the EU 2020 strategic objectives.

For the 2014 – 2020 period, the Bucharest-Ilfov region will have a new status as a developed region because its
                                                                     57
GDP per capita has risen to 106% of the EU average GDP per capita. Therefore, in the 2014 - 2020 ROP, the set of
eligible projects for this region will change compared to the current period. At the same time, the real needs of
many local governments from the region remain basic and they continue to ask for much simpler projects. The
actual project pipeline is realized starting from basic needs and from the requirements of the actual programming
period, and not based on specific requirements for the next planning period (2014-2020). According to the opinion
of some participants to the interviews conducted as part of this study, the EU 2020 strategy objectives, targets,
and tools are too sophisticated or even not appropriate for Romania at this point in the country’s development.

All RDAs have started collecting project ideas and project fiches for the new RDPs. The correlation of strategic
projects with the needs and objectives from the RDP is done based on some set criteria and through the project
fiche. For example, RDA North West uses the following criteria to collect project proposals:
      integrated (multi-dimensional and inter-sectoral);
      with a significant territorial impact (preferably at the regional level);
      contributes to the achievement of regional objectives;
      are the result of cooperation between relevant key actors and are developed in partnership;
      are sustainable and aligned with previous, current, and/or future initiatives; and
      have a budget of at least 25 million EUR.

Unfortunately, many of the project proposals received by late 2013 do not achieve these criteria. Local
governments have mainly proposed non-strategic, small, and local projects. The main reasons for this result are as
follows:
      Lack of capacity for strategic thinking: local governments tend to think within local boundaries;
      The current ROP does not have projects of regional impact, which makes it difficult for local governments
         to “imagine” such projects for the future;
      Lack of new ways of thinking such as Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) and Community-Led Local
         Development (CLLD) at the local level;
      Lack of administrative capacity and professional expertise at local government level for programming.
      Lack of regional administrative tier, with clear responsibilities and financial resources: it is difficult for
         local governments to have an interest in, and make efforts toward, the identification and implementation
         of regional-impact projects. It is also difficult to get local governments to work together on regional-level
         projects.

In the absence of the regional administrative tier, strategic projects will be implemented by associations of local
governments, essentially county councils and/or important cities from the region. To be successful these
associations should be based on clear rules:
      Strong incentives, including financial incentives;
      Effective measures against local governments’ non-cooperative behavior;
      Legal changes in the status of these associations.

57
     According to the EU rules, any region that exceeds 90% of the EU average GDP per capita is considered as a developed region.

                                                                                                                            232
The drafts RDPs for the 2014 – 2020 period, as of December 2013, have some improvements compared to the
RDPs in the previous period. For example:
    1. The draft RDPs follow a standardized methodology prepared by the MA for RDP design. This methodology
         requires that RDPs have performance indicators and monitoring systems. However, it does not give any
         further instructions on how to build out the indicators and systems.
    2. There is an exhaustive analysis of the current situation, including the regional social and economic profile.
         Many data are presented to identify the trends and other qualitative aspects of the developments during
         the last seven-year period. In the North-East Region, in order to support the design of the new RDP, the
         RDA Programming Unit even made a map of all partnerships at local governments. Among them, Local
         Action Groups can be transformed into CLLD, while Inter-Community Development Associations (ADIs)
         among counties and metropolitan areas are appropriate for the ITI tool. In this way, it is possible to better
         plan future complex interventions using ITI or CLLD instruments;
    3. There is a need for a clearer emphasis on comparative and competitive advantages, specific to the
         regions;
    4. Better linkage between comparative and competitive advantages and the strategic objectives set by the
         RDPs – i.e., a much more coherent approach to use the specific situation of any region;
    5. Clear and coherent visions and strategic objectives.

However, despite some of these major improvements, there are still a number of problems in drafting RDPs, as
follows:
     1. The strategic planning process misses the necessary qualified expertise – the new Regional Development
         Plans should reflect the EU 2020 objectives, targets, indicators, and implementation tools, which is
         challenging in the context of the actual administrative/institutional capacity of the Romanian public
         administration. At the same time, they should also strive to go beyond EU objectives and try to focus on
         the actual needs of the regions (regardless of whether these needs could be financed with the help of EU
         funds).
     2. There is a lack of clear connection between the descriptive data and the list of problems underlined. The
         problems are not defined based on evidence or performance indicators.
     3. The SWOT analysis has a limited role in setting the strategic vision and objectives. It remains a tool that
         must be used as a mandatory section of the strategic document.
     4. There is a lack of coherence among strategic objectives and between specific objectives and actions.
     5. The specific objectives continue to not be SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-
         bound) and this undermines the performance measurement and monitoring.
     6. The specific actions are not prioritized according to comparative and competitive advantages. For
         example, all SMEs eligible for EU funding are equally supported, regardless of whether they are in the
         sectors identified as particularly strong in a region.
     7. Budgetary and financial impact analysis of RDPs remains limited: there is no assessment of the total
         investment costs or budgetary sustainability for the public administration. This type of analysis is difficult
         to complete in the absence of a regional administrative tier.
     8. There is still an unclear strategy between the competitiveness and cohesion objectives – not always is it
         possible to find the optimal compromise between them and it is not clear if the decision-makers are fully
         aware of the trade-offs and the pros and cons of every main strategic choice.
     9. A regional administrative tier to implement effectively the RDPs continues to be lacking.

Annex 7. Criteria used by RDAs to identify regional strategic projects

Guiding principles for selecting strategic projects in the West Region in 2014-2020
  For 2014-2020, the Regional Development Plan for the West Region will include a list of strategic projects
      (with major impact), which will have to be approved by the Regional Development Council.
  Regional strategic projects should cover an area as wide as possible in terms of priorities and intervention
      sectors.
  Lists of projects will be collected at the local and the county level, and technical assistance will be sought to
      mature strategic projects.
  Three types of regional projects will be identified: 1) regional strategic projects; 2) individual infrastructure
      projects; and 3) projects that address systemic/thematic issues.
  Regional Strategic Projects will:
              solve some major challenges at the regional level;
              have a territorial impact, addressing challenges in more than one county and for areas with more
                 than 50,000 inhabitants;
              benefit from the support of a consortium of regional stakeholders;
              have economic impact (jobs, business development, productivity increases, utilizing local
                 resources, time saving, energy);
              have a social impact (e.g., improve quality of life for people);
              fall within the development priorities defined in the Regional Development Plan; and
              not have property/ownership issues.
  Individual infrastructure projects will:
              solve major challenges at the county/local level;
              have a territorial impact, addressing challenges within a single county/locality (with at least 5,000
                 inhabitants);
              benefit from the support of a consortium of county/local stakeholders;
              have economic impact (jobs, business development, productivity increases, utilizing local
                 resources, time saving, energy);
              have a social impact (e.g., improve quality of life for people);
              fall within the development priorities defined in the Regional Development Plan; and
              not have property/ownership issues.
  Systemic/Thematic Projects will:
              look to engender systemic changes within a distinct thematic area;
              benefit from the support of a consortium of stakeholders;
              have a social impact (e.g., improve the quality of life for people);
              fall within the development priorities defined in the Regional Development Plan.


Selection criteria for identifying strategic projects in the South Region in 2014-2020
    1) Projects follow the objectives and priorities included in the 2014-2020 Regional Development Plan.
    2) Projects contribute to achieving national targets within the Europe 2020 Strategy – national targets
         assumed by Romania through the 2011-2013 National Reform Program.
    3) Projects with a significant regional impact:
              a. Projects that help address a number of key regional, county, and local issues;
              b. Projects with a significant territorial impact – affecting communities in several regions, counties,
                   territorial administrative units, several small cities, city neighborhoods, metropolitan areas, or
                   peri-urban areas.
    4) Projects for which there is a formal administrative engagement – e.g., a written agreement from regional
         actors (Regional Development Council, county councils, local authorities, regional bodies) to finance and
         implement them.

                                                                                                                 234
     5) Well-founded and mature projects: projects that already have in place analyses/studies that support their
        implementation (pre-feasibility studies, feasibility studies, traffic plans, business plans, etc.).
     6) Complex projects, which require a common approach with respect to planning, financing, and resource
        use – i.e., projects that are based on a partnership throughout the entire project cycle.
     7) Projects without legal problems or with legal problems that can be resolved within less than 6 months
        from selection.
     8) There is capacity to generate value-added: projects that will bring socio-economic benefits.
     9) Projects aligned with horizontal themes in the Regional Development Plans and that propose innovative
        solutions and approaches.

Criteria for collecting strategic project proposals in the North-West Region in 2014-2020
RDA North West uses the following criteria to collect project proposals:
      integrated (multi-dimensional and inter-sectorial);
      significant territorial impact (preferably regional);
      contribute to the achievement of regional objectives;
      are the result of cooperation between relevant key actors and are developed in partnership;
      are sustainable and aligned with previous, current, and/or future initiatives; and
      have a budget of at least 25 million EUR.

INTRODUCTION
     WB team presentation
     Project presentation: objectives, implementation schedule, results
     Project objectives:
          o Identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the current 2007 – 2013 ROP project
               preparation, evaluation and selection procedures
          o Recommendations on improved project preparation, evaluation and selection procedures and
               processes for the 2014 – 2020 ROP

PROJECT SELECTION MODELS
    General questions
            What are the 3-5 main positive aspects of the selection model for the 2007 – 2013 ROP?
               Compare and contrast first-in-first-out (FIFO) selection model vs. PA 1.1 selection model.
            Which of the current elements should be preserved or improved for the selection models for the
               2014-2020 ROP?
            Is absorption rate or impact the most appropriate indicator to measure the performance of ROP?
               How to best measure the latter?
    How effective is the current selection model in achieving the following goals:
            select projects with regional impact, county impact, local impact
            select projects with more value for money
            select projects more efficiently (less financial and human resources used and more projects and
               with higher quality of selection)
    How to best classify projects for different selection models based on:
            the nature of projects: projects for infrastructure investment that involve construction and
               projects of service contracts
            scope of projects (small, medium, or large project size)
            location of projects (county, inter-county, city/town, inter-city/town)
            type of beneficiaries (region, county, city/town, company, individual)
    What do you think about the following tentative options of project categories:
            Category A: large projects of regional/national importance that will be drawn from
               national/regional strategies, and which will be financed without prior selection
            Category B: medium-sized projects that will enter a pool, will be analyzed by a committee, and
               proposed for financing based on expected impact
            Category C: small projects that will be selected based on the FIFO rule, and will benefit from
               simpler and more straight-forward procedures.
    How would different selection models work for the different categories of projects?
            How should funding be allocated for different categories of projects to different regions?
            What categories of project should be selected competitively or not competitively? How to do so?
            What categories of project should have definite or indefinite deadlines for project submission?
            What agencies should be involved in project concept development and project appraisal
               management for different categories of projects?
            What categories of projects should be screened before going through appraisal?
            What agencies should have the authority/delegated authority to evaluate project application?
            What agencies should have the authority/delegated authority to select projects after the
               evaluation of application?
            What agencies should have the authority/delegated authority to approve project selection?
    For the success of these proposed selection models, what are required conditions for success in terms
       of:

                                                                                                        243
                Procedures
                Financial resources
                Human resources
                IT
                Political support

PROJECT EVALUATION PROCESS AND CRITERIA
    Evaluation Process
             Relevance of steps: What do you consider as relevant, irrelevant, or missing regarding the steps
                 in the evaluation process? What should be modified or simplified in the next ROP, for different
                 categories of projects?
             Relevance of step sequencing: What do you consider as relevant or irrelevant regarding the
                 sequencing of the evaluation process?
   The quality of project evaluation depends on three main elements: evaluation criteria, evaluators, inputs from
   project application.

       Evaluation Criteria
             What criteria are relevant, irrelevant, or missing for evaluating different categories of projects?
                 What criteria should be removed, kept, modified for the next ROP?
             Objectivity: Is there any room for subjectivity in evaluation? What modifications in criteria and
                 methodology to assign scores should there be to reduce the subjectivity in evaluation?
             Validity: Are evaluators required to check the assumptions underlying the appraisal results and
                 claims in project application before evaluating the results and claims?
             Clarity: Is the guidance for evaluators sufficiently clear and inclusive, or is it subject to individual
                 interpretation?
       Evaluators:
             What advantages and disadvantages does the current model for selection and appointment of
                 evaluators have? What agencies should have the authority to select and appoint evaluators for
                 different categories of projects in the next ROP?
             How does the current selection and appointment of evaluators affect the independence, quality,
                 and responsibility of evaluators?
             How relevant are the evaluator expertise and qualifications to the evaluation work?
             How can the performance of evaluators be improved in the next ROP?

       Inputs from project application
             Which requirements in the application form are relevant, irrelevant, missing? What is the RDA’s
                 role in the preparation of project application?
             In practice, what is the quality and comprehensiveness of information provided by applicants in
                 the application form, on average? How can the quality of data inputs be improved?
             Is technical guidance on feasibility study sufficiently clear? What requirements for feasibility
                 studies are appropriate/not appropriate for different categories of projects? What is the quality
                 and comprehensiveness of information provided by applicants in the feasibility studies, on
                 average? How can the quality of data inputs be improved? Do beneficiaries have adequate
                 financial and technical capacity to manage project appraisals and to provide good quality
                 feasibility studies?
             How is the cost-benefit analysis tool used by beneficiaries? For which type of projects should this
                 analysis be required?
             How is cost effectiveness analysis tool used by beneficiaries? For which type of projects should
                 this analysis be required?
             How can the quality of data inputs from feasibility studies be improved? Who should manage
                 feasibility studies for different categories of projects?



                                                                                                                 244
Annex 10. Selected Case Studies – Project Selection Models in 8 EU Member Countries


Germany – Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW) ROP: Competitive Calls in Business Infrastructure60
The German Land of Nordrhein-Westfalen has started using competitive calls on a large scale in the
2007-13 programming period. This case study will provide insights on calls for different types of
interventions (R&D, infrastructure, other), but as for selection criteria it will focus on a specific call in the
field of business infrastructure. The selection of project outlines by a jury (involving weighting and
scoring) is followed by the submission of full applications. The approach has been successful and will be
replicated in 2014-20, but there is scope for improvement, for example regarding target-orientation.

Context
In Germany, as a federal country, Structural Funds’ management is the responsibility of the Länder. In
Nordrhein-Westfalen, the regional ERDF OP is managed by the Land Government and more specifically
by the Ministry for Economy, Energy, Industry, SMEs, and the Craft Sector. The following table shows
the funding allocations by priority for the 2007-13 programming period.

The majority of funding is allocated through competitive calls. Funding under Priority 1 is allocated
through existing domestic funding instruments (e.g., aid or loan schemes for SMEs), where the approach
to project generation, appraisal, and selection is generally defined in the legal documents relating to
these instruments. Most remaining funding is allocated via competitive calls for tender (see detailed
description below). In exceptional cases, some funding under Priority 3 (notably for infrastructure in
lagging areas) may be allocated on the basis of decisions by the State Secretaries Committee, generally
in the context of well-established sub-regional strategies.

Overall, the implementation of the OP is progressing very well. By the end of 2012, ERDF commitments
were at 95.1 percent and payments at 47.3 percent.

  This case study is largely based on the findings of the following evaluation report: Deloitte & Touche GmbH (2012):
Evaluierung von wettbewerblichen Auswahlverfahren des Ziel 2-Programms 2007-2013, Ministry for Business, Energy, Industry,
SMEs & the Craft Sector of the Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, Final Report.

                                                                                                                      245
Project Selection Model and Procedures – Competitive Calls
Competitive calls have been used on a large scale for the first time in 2007-13 in order to select
projects with the highest impact. Although still fairly novel and experimental, the approach covers
virtually all of Priority 2 (Innovation and knowledge-based economy) and most of Priority 3 (Sustainable
urban and regional development). The intention is multi-fold: to enhance project contribution to
regional strengths and improve efficiency and effectiveness of support; to enhance the objectivity and
transparency of the selection process, as well as project quality and the mobilization of target groups.

The calls cover several project types and involve significant amounts of funding. Calls have been
launched to support the Land’s cluster strategy on horizontal themes (e.g., tourism or knowledge-
intensive services), and for regional networks or clusters. By February 2012, support had been granted
to 1,207 R&D projects, 176 infrastructure projects, and 114 other projects. Overall, ERDF funding of
€439 million had been committed through competitive calls. Domestic co -financing amounted to €195
million. The overall amount of eligible project funding was €923 million (i.e., aid rate of approximately
69 %). By February 2012, payments of around €198 million were made (i.e., roughly 31 % of
commitments).

Following the development of the calls, projects are selected in a multi-stage process:
    1. Development of calls by different Land sectoral Ministries and the managing authority further
       checks whether they respond to the main program objectives; the calls are published on
       internet sites of individual Land Ministries and on the Land government website, as well as on
       websites of other relevant support bodies; calls are publicized via information events.
    2. Pre-scoring on eligibility of project outlines (application form and project description, 12 pages
       maximum) to identify issues that may question project eligibility or require detailed checks
       (non-binding).
    3. Appraisal of project outlines by a jury of independent experts: eligibility check, scoring of
       project outlines in line with call criteria (three categories with call-specific sub-criteria) using
       indicators, weighing, and scoring.
    4. Selection of project outlines (around six months after publication of call) by the jury according
       to the highest impact relative to program and call-specific objectives – if projects have the same
       rating, the one with the best contribution to horizontal objectives is preferred.
    5. Submission of full application: project description – including work/time/expenditure and
       financing plan and details regarding indicators; information on applicant (profile, company data,
       extract from trade register); proofs of solvency and business plan (annual balance sheets,
       feasibility study, own contribution); statements regarding de-minimis rule, non-existence of
       prior project start, checked regarding completeness, consistency and eligibility of expenditure;
       specific focus on solvency of applicant and business plan (notably own contribution); decision on
       aid rate (around six months after selection of project outlines).

The duration of the different phases varied depending on the project type. While R&D projects take
longest overall, this is partly due to considerable variation and a high number of outliers.

During the 2007-13 period, efforts have been made to improve the implementation of the call
approach. This included standardization and simplification efforts, moves to enhance the independence
of jury members as well as the transparency of its composition, and a greater focus on eligibility during
the pre-scoring phase.

Selection Criteria and Indicators
The focus of this case study is on Measure 2.1: Support for business innovation, clusters and network
development, including business infrastructure and, more specifically, on calls on electronic mobility
(ElektroMobil.NRW). In this context, support is provided to R&D, infrastructure, and investment
projects, over three years, for a variety of themes (energy storage, vehicle, infrastructure and networks,
framework conditions, norms and standards). Regarding infrastructure projects, the focus is on: (a)
pooling products, services, or process innovations of several businesses to offer new integrated
solutions; and (b) projects required to enhance the automotive cluster (e.g., brownfield regeneration,
competence and operator centers, investment planning and preparation, promotion measures,
concepts and expertise). Under Measure 2.1, a total of €628.4 million has been committed in the
context of competitive calls between 2010 and 2012, including €55.7 million under the call on electronic
mobility.

The underlying purpose of the selection criteria is to allow the appraisal of projects through a
transparent and traceable process, in line with the principles and targets set out in the Operational
Programme. They should thus specify the statements made regarding individual measures rather than
narrowing the room to maneuver. Detailed approaches to project generation, appraisal, and selection
are defined in the relevant call for tender documents. On average, assessment is based on ten to twenty
criteria.

There are a number of standard requirements that apply to all projects:
    Compliance with core strategic program goals relating to the improvement of competitiveness,
       innovation and job creation, and horizontal targets in terms of sustainable development and
       equal opportunities.
    Economic and sectoral criteria: reliability and capacity of project applicant; volume and
       economic adequacy of project cost; secured financing; compliance with principles of efficient
       budget management; sectoral suitability.
    Time-related criterion: The project plan has to specify that time requirements will be adhered
       to and that the project applicant is able to ensure the timely delivery of the final proof of funds ’
       expenditure.

Cost-benefit analyses are seen to be useful in determining whether applications qualify. They are
therefore required for selected, strategically important projects, even if they cost less than €50 million,
as well as for infrastructure investments of over €10 million.

There are different categories of applicable criteria, each broken down at the measure / sub-measure
level. For Measure 2.1 Support for business innovation, clusters, and network development and
Measure 2.2 Business Technology and Research Infrastructure, these are the following:
     Core strategic program goals: Measure-specific sub-criteria are defined under each of the
        following aspects:
             o Competitiveness – improvement of business opportunities to position themselves on
                supra-regional and international markets through investment in new products and
                processes, which lead to increased productivity and thus sales potential; the application

                                                                                                        247
                  needs to specify the contribution of the project via quantitative (e.g., increased exports)
                  or qualitative statements (targeting local or regional markets is in this respect
                  insufficient);
             o Innovation – understood as the application of new ideas on the market, referring to
                  products, production processes, and organizational procedures (i.e., wide definition of
                  innovation, including organizational, logistical, financial, HR, marketing and design-
                  oriented innovations, and their application on the market); proof of respective
                  contributions is required and marketability needs have to be elaborated upon;
             o Employment – projects need to contribute directly to creating new jobs and to
                  safeguarding existing jobs; if a project does not contribute to this goal in the short term,
                  a medium to long-term contribution needs to be specified; employment effects need to
                  be quantified and (as far as possible) differentiated based on gender.
        Strategic target of Priority 2: Promotion of innovation and development of a knowledge-based
         economy
        Horizontal criteria:
             o Equal opportunities – contribution to reduce gender inequalities; if this does not apply,
                  applications have to describe gender-sensitive approaches (e.g., gender-differentiated
                  procedures during tests and field studies; ways to build in gender competences in
                  setting up networks; acknowledgement of needs of those using the new products /

Three sets of indicators are used and respectively relate to the project’s contribution to the three sets
of goals:

                     Weighting of indicators with respect to different types of goals
                       Goal                                               Weighting
 Strategic goals (competitiveness, innovation,       40% - the three aspects are weighted in line with
 employment)                                         the orientation of the call (10-20% each)
 Horizontal goals (equal opportunities,              10% - up to 5% for each horizontal goal
 sustainable development)
 Call-specific goals                                 50%

For the individual criteria, scores are attributed between 1 and 5, as follows:
     1 = no contribution
     2 = limited contribution
     3 = satisfactory contribution
     4 = high contribution
     5 = outstanding contribution

By multiplying the weighting with the score for each criterion, a total score is determined and compared
to the other project applications. In order to illustrate the approach, the following table shows an
example of how projects are assessed under Measure 2.1.

However, the criteria included in call-specific documentation are not accompanied by information on
weighting or maximum scores and it is difficult to see how the assessment works in practice (e.g.,
whether it is cumulative or alternative).

In order to monitor program progress at measure level, the managing authority works with
standardized (sub-)measure-specific monitoring fiches, which are filled in for each project. For
Measure 2.2, monitoring indicators include the following:
    - Infrastructure capacity (number of training places, room for SME);
    - Cooperation with business partners (number of network projects with businesses, number of
       new products and processes);
    - Number of businesses supported through infrastructure (focus on new creations and
       technology-intensive sectors);
    - Job creation (focus on technology-intensive jobs and jobs for women);
    - Relationship with horizontal objectives;
    - Relationship with demographic changes; and
    - Environmental indicators (change in resource and energy usage, change in CO2 emissions,
       contribution to soil sealing).

Performance Assessment
The competitive call approach has proven efficient overall, but there have been some difficulties with
project eligibility, which have hampered the post-selection stage. Between 2007 and 2010, 54 calls
were implemented under 28 themes. Participation was sufficiently high (at least 40 submissions per call)

                                                                                                    250
and the success rate for applicants was at approximately 32 percent. Funding allocations were
exhausted for most calls. Around 47 percent of committed funding was allocated to the R&D sector,
around 39 percent to the private sector (roughly 15 percent for large firms and 24 percent for SME), and
around 14 percent to the public sector. There has been an issue over the eligibility of project
applications across competitive calls in different thematic areas. This concerned almost one third of
those successful applicants who later withdrew their application linked to the missing proof of their own
contribution (while eligibility checks are carried out based on the submitted project outlines, the
statements and documents allowing for a final assessment are not required at this stage, since it is
considered too onerous to provide the complete documentation). Efforts are made to reduce the work
related to non-eligible project applications.

The vast majority of projects selected through competitive calls are set to achieve their targets, but
some think that the pursuit of regional objectives should be strengthened. According to project
applicants, almost 87 percent of projects will reach the targets set out in the project application, with
only 4 percent stating that the targets will not be achieved (the remaining 9 percent were unable to
comment, since they had just started implementing the project). Results were particularly positive for
projects in the field of product / process development and resource / process efficiency.62 However,
some experts believe that a stronger use of competitive calls to pursue regional objectives (i.e., related
to the regional innovation and cluster strategy) is necessary. Others think that competitive calls do not
provide a suitable framework to pursue specific themes in a strategic and long-term approach. The
targeting of regional strengths is not explicit enough, since sub-regional and horizontal themes are
supported as well. It is also thought that the jury is not in a position to assess project contributions to
strategic / political targets due to its specialist composition and the fact that evaluators do not come
from the region to ensure their impartiality. Some think that the call themes are not consolidated/
coordinated due to sectoral compartmentalization, while others suggest a wider / more open definition
of call themes (however, this may hamper the comparability of project outlines and may require a larger
jury in order to cover all areas).

With the competitive call approach it has been possible to support innovation potentials throughout
the region. While there has been a concentration on university cities / towns, this is in line with the aim
to support knowledge and technology transfer as long as businesses receive sufficient assistance.
Project networking partnerships initiated through calls are stable – projects are sustained after support
ends / networks are successful in applying for follow-on projects.

Main Lessons
Competitive calls are found to be suitable for different types of interventions and target groups.
However, a majority of experts view the model as not universally suitable and suggest implementing
alternative / complementary selection models in parallel in order to allow submissions for specific
objectives, project types or target groups and to be able to react to new developments. Regarding
different project types, many experts view competitive calls as a good model to be used in the field of
innovation (especially applied research); regarding infrastructure support, this statement needs to be
relativized slightly as different areas of infrastructure support (R&D, environment, investment) show
specific characteristics which need to be taken into account (see table below).

                                                          selecting projects with
                                                          best cost-benefit ratio

Competitive calls are also seen to be generally suitable for different target groups, although there are
limitations for SMEs that are not active in R&D due to the duration of procedures and the related
burden. Moreover, competitive calls can be used for both, injecting one-off impulses and pursuing
longer term strategies. However, there is scope for improvement regarding the implementation of
objectives – a clearer strategic orientation and back coupling with political targets are necessary.

Regarding the usability of selection criteria, it has been noted by some that the scoring procedure /
table is too complex. It appears to have been mainly used at the pre-scoring stage by the
administration, while the jury often uses it to a limited extent or in a simplified way. There also seems to
be a trade-off between the level of standardization and the specification of criteria. On a related note,
there are calls for reducing the number of criteria while making them more concrete and establishing a
stronger link with longer term priorities and political objectives – however, it may be difficult to achieve
both at the same time. In addition, applicants struggle with providing information on some criteria, e.g.,
the innovative character of infrastructure projects.

Several examples of good practice and conditions for successful implementation can be identified:
    Competitive procedures rely on the existence of a common point of reference to allow for the
        definition of criteria to compare and select projects; if a support of the ‘best’ is desired, then it
        needs to be ensured that sufficient strengths exist in the targeted field to allow for qualitative
        comparison;
    Project selection is qualified as transparent, traceable and fair, the contribution by the jury is
        judged to be positive (also regarding the effectiveness of selection), although this could be
        optimized;



                                                                                                         252
       The two-stage procedure works well, although there are some limitations for certain target
        groups and intervention targets (a one-stage procedure may be more attractive for SMEs);
       Project quality is high – it is easier to select the ‘best’ projects – provided that there is a critical
        mass of high-quality submissions; further improvements are possible regarding the advance
        planning of calls;
       Applicants are motivated through strict deadlines to submit well-structured and well-presented
        project outlines, on condition that there is sufficient lead time;
       There has been high mobilization of (new) target groups thanks to the clear thematic
        orientation, information events, targeted identification of beneficiary groups, and independent
        project selection by a jury (only the last point is directly linked to the competitive model, the
        three other aspects can also be found in alternative approaches);
       The model encourages sustainable networking between actors – as at February 2012, this
        concerned over 47% of projects (e.g., business and science); however, in some cases, the
        requirement to constitute networks can cause delays; and
       It has a two-fold function as selection and award (i.e., prize) procedure – an award can be used
        for image and marketing purposes.

At the same time, there are disadvantages to the use of competitive calls, mainly regarding
constraints on flexibility and administrative burden:
    Rigid deadlines;
    Limited interaction between applicants and call administrators in order to guarantee fair
        treatment;
    Lengthy procedures: delays occur mainly in the application and approval phases related to
        process organization, the number / interplay of involved actors, and the complexity of the legal
        basis;
    High burden during application and approval phases (eligibility checks), as well as during the
        implementation phase (provision of proofs, intensity of checks).

There is therefore scope for improvement, notably regarding the use of criteria, the frequency of
deadlines, and transparency. The use of criteria as strategic tool should be enhanced by integrating
their definition in the planning process and enforcing their application by the jury. In terms of deadlines,
their frequency is not ideal for certain target groups, especially regarding the limited scope for advance-
planning (dates and content); more frequent deadlines may attract a greater participation by SME.
Finally, transparency is insufficient regarding duties and efforts involved in the project application and
implementation phases; this can be linked to the limited suitability of the legal basis, insufficient quality
of information materials and uneven treatment due to the high number of involved actors.

The 2012 evaluation of the competitive calls approach advances numerous recommendations, which
are listed here (the most relevant ones highlighted):
    1. Institutionalization of top-down planning of competitive calls (involving, for example, a
         reduction in the number of themes and calls; a stronger link with political objectives through
         more specific selection criteria; the strengthening of cross-sectoral initiation, planning, and
         implementation of calls);
    2. Advance-planning of call themes over a timer period of approximately three years and increase
         in number of deadlines per call;
    3. Continuation of competitive calls as project selection model – decision on suitability for
         individual intervention targets supported by a decision matrix;


                                                                                                           253
       4. Strengthening of requirements for the application of call-specific selection criteria – mandatory
           definition of call-specific criteria as part of planning process – and simplification of scoring
           model – reduction of complexity (criteria and gradation of assessment) and enforcement of
           application by jury (reasons: call-specific criteria are not evenly applied to the concrete targets
           of the call, there is scope for an enhanced use of the criteria to take account of political aims
           and to steer content and quality; the scoring sheet is often not used by the jury (due to its
           complexity) and it cannot be ascertained that individual criteria are really taken into account in
           the assessment using appropriate weighting and that the selection process is documented in its
           entirety);
       5. Reduction of number of actors per call and across calls;
       6. Optimization of jury composition and procedures63 - it is recommended to compose the jury so
           that it covers all required (content-related) competences to assess applications, i.e., in addition
           to scientific-technological expertise, economic and regional know-how should also be present
           (experts from NRW should not be excluded in principle); in order to exclude bias, potentially
           biased jury members should be excluded from the vote and the highest and lowest votes should
           not be taken into account in the assessment; jury members need to receive an induction into
           regional objectives and the use of scoring methods; the ‘second opinion’ principle should be
           applied across the board; only eligible project outlines should be presented to the jury;
       7. Enhancement of knowledge and quality management;
       8. Optimization of interfaces in the payment process;
       9. Enabling support on cost basis;
       10. Introduction of flat rates for running costs and staff costs;
       11. Simplification of requirements related to public procurement law applied at the level of the
           Land – there is a need to reduce the current burden on beneficiaries (especially SME) and
           administrators, e.g., by increasing minimum thresholds for ERDF projects; by limiting the
           number of required offers to three (to be applied to projects with an aid rate of over 50
           percent); by invalidating procurement requirements for projects above €100,000 (the latter
           would lead to considerable time savings – it can be assumed that beneficiaries contributing over
           50 percent of project costs make own arrangements to ensure cost effectiveness);
       12. Document and spot checks based on electronic records;
       13. Document and spot checks based on samples;
       14. Introduction of an overarching ERDF guideline;
       15. Introduction of binding deadlines for administrators and beneficiaries;
       16. Revision of call documentation (including support handbook);
       17. Introduction of an electronic system to improve transparency and simplify processes – enables
           data exchange, provides a communication platform, and reduces administrative effort (e.g.,
           submission of project outlines, validation checks regarding completeness and correctness of
           statements and documents, checks of electronic receipts, overview of drawn-down versus
           available funding);
       18. Extension of eligibility checks during appraisal phase – extension of the appraisal checklist
           regarding statements on the financing plan (though no requirement of proof) to allow for more
           intense eligibility checks and to avoid disappointment (i.e., rejection of application) at a later
           stage
       19. Intensification of content-related project support following approval

                                                                                                                          254
In conclusion, competitive calls have proved of value, although their target-orientation can be further
enhanced. Looking ahead, the unification and structuring of planning processes and a consistent
targeting on intervention aims and the regional innovation strategy are required. There is considerable
need for improvement regarding the actual selection and implementation procedures (application and
approval phases, as well as the implementation phase). The fact that competitive calls will also be used
extensively in 2014-20 shows that the approach is seen to work well.


Poland - ERDF Regional Operational Programme Śląskie 2007-13: Pre-selection through Sub-regional
Development Programs – Urban Revitalization
In the Polish region of Śląskie, part of the regional ERDF OP has been successfully delivered through
projects pre-selected in the framework of Sub-regional Development Programs. The projects
underwent initial checks at the program development stage and were then assessed in the same way as
projects identified through competitive calls, drawing on expert advice (however, not involving any
weighting and scoring). The present case study provides details on Priority 6 Urban Revitalization.
Despite slightly lower than average progress in terms of funding absorption, the programs were more
successful than other selection methods, especially in identifying suitable projects in response to
complex challenges.

Context
In Poland, the management of regional ERDF OPs is decentralized. In the Śląskie Voivodship, the
Marshal’s Office is in charge of managing the 2007-13 Convergence Regional Operational Programme
(ROP). The following table gives an overview of the funding allocated to the ten priorities supported by
the program.

Program progress is satisfactory regarding both commitments and certified expenditures. At the end
of 2012, total grant commitments amounted to €1,556.24 million from the European Union, which
constituted 88.41% of the allocation for the years of 2007-13. The Certification Authority approved the

                                                                                                      255
declarations submitted by the Managing Authority for the amount of €853.64 million, which is co-
financed from the European Union and corresponds to 48.49% of the allocation.

The ROP uses three procedures to select operations, with most funding allocated through competitive
calls. According to the December 2006 Act on the Principles of Development Policy, the majority (60%)
of EU financing is allocated through the competitive mode; around 28% of total EU financing is allocated
through key projects, which are defined as individual projects; and 12% through Sub-regional
Development Programs (PRS), which are understood as systemic projects and are the focus of the
present case study.

Project Selection Model and Procedures – Pre-selection through Sub-Regional Development Programs
(PRS)
Sub-regional Development Programs were introduced to enhance stakeholder participation, in
response to the demand from cities and municipalities for strong participation in the OP
implementation process. The Śląskie region has a polycentric structure with four major agglomerations.
In order to involve municipal and district authorities in the process of implementing EU funds, four sub-
regional platforms were created around these bases: Central (Centralny Śląski), South (Bielsko-bialski),
North (Częstochowski) and West (Rybnicko-jastrzębski). Each sub-region developed partnership
arrangements involving municipalities, cities, knowledge institutions, and the private sector.

The Sub-regional Development Programs cover a variety of themes regarding different types of
infrastructure, the environment, regional growth, and urban renewal. They account for €246.48 million
(around 12% of the total EU allocation to the ROP) and include the following measures under seven out
of the ten program priorities:
     Priority 2.1 Infrastructure for information society
     Priority 2.2 Development of e-services
     Priority 3.2.2 Tourist infrastructure
     Priority 4.1 Cultural infrastructure
     Priority 5.2 Waste management
     Priority 5.3 Clean air and renewable energy
     Priority 6.1 Strengthening regional centers of growth
     Priority 6.2.1 Revitalization of large towns
     Priority 6.2.2 Revitalization of small towns
     Priority 7.1.1 Modernization and development of key road networks
     Priority 7.1.2 Modernization and development of infrastructure completing key road networks

The Sub-regional Development Programs are developed around a list of projects agreed among key
stakeholders. They are created in consultation with the local authorities of the four sub-regions. The
basic element is an agreed list of projects that have been identified as particularly important for the
development of the sub-region and will improve the life of the inhabitants in the territory (by the end of
2012, this involved 214 projects organized into four Sub-regional Programs).

The implementation of projects contained in the Sub-regional Development Programs was preceded
by four preparatory stages:
    1. Initial preparation stage (first half of 2007) – Sub-regions developed a list of potential projects
        in line with ROP measures, based on agreements among relevant stakeholders. For this, the
        managing authority provided a project fiche and guidance.

                                                                                                      256
    2. Program preparation (May 2007 and February 2008) – Sub-regions worked on PRS and
       submitted them to the managing authority. Each PRS contains:
        an analysis of the socio-economic context of the sub-region;
        a set of strategic priorities;
        a list of the main projects to be implemented;
        a financial plan;
        a description of the implementation system; and
        a description of the consultation process.
       On this basis, a cooperation agreement between the managing authority and the sub-regions
       (i.e., municipalities representing at least 75% of the inhabitants of the sub-region) was signed.
    3. Assessment of PRS and initial check of projects for eligibility for co-financing (February-May
       2008) - This stage involved a formal and meritocratic assessment of the PRS (see further below)
       and an initial assessment of project eligibility (based on application forms and project fiches).
       For the PRS to be approved, all criteria had to be met. There was also a quality assessment of
       the PRS, based on an analysis of the correctness of the individual program components
       (primarily to meet the requirements set out in the ROP Guidelines and regarding internal
       consistency between diagnosis – objectives – projects), and of the feasibility and compatibility
       of the PRS with regional programming documents (the ROP and the Silesian Regional
       Development Strategy). On the basis of this stage, an agreement for co-financing of the PRS was
       made between the managing authority and representatives of the sub-region.
    4. Implementation stage - This involved the detailed preparation of full project applications
       (completed by December 2009), the assessment of PRS projects (completed by June 2010) and
       the signing of project co-financing agreements (completed by December 2010). The projects
       were assessed according to the selection criteria used for the different ROP priorities and
       measures, i.e., at this stage the same approach and criteria as for competitive calls were used
       for PRS projects.

Selection Criteria and Indicators – Urban Revitalization
Urban revitalization (Priority 6) is an important priority and receives around one fifth of funding under
the PRS (€47.29 million). Śląskie is the most urbanized region in Poland (78.6% of people live in urban
areas). In the past, industrial plants often invested in urban centers, but more recently there have been
concerns over the degradation of urban areas linked to substantial industrial restructuring. The main
objective of interventions under this heading is to restore degraded sites of former industrial centers,
cities, and also districts subject to the processes of suburbanization, introducing new economic, social,
recreational, and educational facets. The revitalization of degraded areas will also contribute to
improving the living conditions and increase the attractiveness of the region.

Project selection involved two stages: one was specific to the PRS, while the other was the same as for
mainstream projects. Specific formal and meritocratic criteria were used at the initial stage of the Sub-
Regional Development Programs in order to ensure that the projects had strong links to the sub-regional
territory and that the programs as a whole were strategically integrated with the ROP (1). Subsequently,
PRS projects were subject to assessment in parallel with other delivery modes (2).

    1. The first stage was formal assessment of the PRS. It consisted of verifying whether the PRS
       contained all the necessary elements and the required documentation in accordance with the
       Guidelines set out in the ROP. Assessment was completed on the basis of a simple “yes/no,” i.e.,
       “meets - does not meet requirement.”

This was followed by a ‘quality assessment’ of the PRS based on an analysis of:
         correctness of the individual components of the PRS primarily to meet the requirements set
             out in the guidelines for non-competitive calls in the ROP;
         internal consistency between diagnosis - objectives – projects; and
         feasibility and compatibility of the PRS in relation to regional programming documents (ROP
             and the Regional Development Strategy).

The assessment of the individual elements of the PRS was based on criteria in the form of statements
that were assessed on a five-point scale '0 -4' where '0' is a complete failure to meet the criterion and '4'
refers to full compliance with the criterion.

    2. For the next step, PRS projects were assessed in parallel with projects under other ROP
       implementation modes, i.e., applying the same criteria. In the case of P6 Urban Revitalization,
       the process included:

         1. Formal assessment of PRS projects to verify the completeness and consistency of
            documentation. Formal assessment was based on the following:

         2. Quality assessment of PRS projects was carried out based on three sets of criteria shown in
            the following two tables: general (a), basic essential (b) and priority or measure-specific
            essential criteria by project type (c). As PRS projects were pre-selected, there was no
            weighting or scoring involved, but rather a process of checking by experts that gave the
            opportunity for project applications to be amended (information on weighting is included
            for information only).

                General (a) and Basic Essential (b) Criteria used to assess PRS Projects
            a) General Criteria
1.      The appropriateness of technological solutions in the project
2.      Appropriateness and feasibility of the level of eligible project costs
3.      The feasibility of indicators (whether data can be collected and targets can be achieved)
4.      The project guarantees technological neutrality and open access (only to projects involving
        information society)
5.      Properly prepared financial analysis of the project (the validity of the input data)
6.      Sustainability of project results

             b) Basic Essential Criteria
1.      The extent to which the project realizes the Priorities, measures or sub-measures, of the ROP,
        measured in terms of the project's impact on the achievement of indicators of a Priority,
        measure or sub-measure.
2.      The extent to which the project fulfils equal opportunities policy, environmental policy, energy
        efficiency
3.      Extent of complementarity with other projects
4.      Extent of organizational readiness of the beneficiary, including staff and technical resources to
        guarantee the feasibility of the project, organizational stability, experience in project
        management, feasibility of the schedule of activities within the project
5.      The anticipated effectiveness of the project (including additional effect / value of the project, its
        cost-effectiveness while maintaining high quality-input / output ratio)
6.      The anticipated impact of the project in increasing the attractiveness for investment of the
        region or sub-region while protecting and improving the environment, health, preserving cultural
        identity and developing territorial cohesion

Performance Assessment
Pre-selecting projects under the Sub-regional Development Programs was efficient and allowed for
high rates of absorption, albeit slightly lower than the program average. The total number of projects
submitted under the PRS by September 2013 was 263, i.e., 97% of the available funding. 247 of these
were approved, representing around 92% of the available funding. The number of PRS projects for
which co-financing agreements had been signed was 226, amounting to around 80% of the available
funding (the average for the program as a whole is 88%). At the outset of the programming period, the
managing authority had made it clear that if sub-regional agreements were not reached, then the
associated funding would be offered to open, competitive calls. The fact that this has not happened is
another proof of the efficiency of the approach.

In terms of strategic fit, the PRS allowed for the selection of high quality projects especially through
integrated approaches. A 2012 evaluation assessing the impact of the ROP looked at which approach to
project generation and selection (i.e., PRS, key projects or competitive calls) was most successful in
supporting indicator achievement regarding the relevant ROP priorities.64 For each of the different
approaches, the evaluation looked at the percentage of indicators achieved by a specific approach and
the percentage of the allocation used by a specific approach. On the basis of this analysis, the evaluation
concluded that PRS projects were the most successful. This was particularly the case for certain
“network-type” projects developed in response to complex challenges in a given territory. These
required integrated approaches based on cooperation and mutual complementarity in fields such as
urban revitalization and integrated local transport systems. More specifically, the evaluation concluded
that PRS projects are more effective than projects based on competitive calls in the following fields:
     Broadband infrastructure;
     Infrastructure projects for tourism and recreation areas;
     Projects of public cultural infrastructure;
     The restoration of degraded areas and the elimination of waste landfills, including dumps for
        environmental purposes; and
     Adaptation of buildings for the purpose of revitalization.

These projects require the cooperation between individual components within a network (e.g., the
individual sections of roads or broadband infrastructure), but also engage multiple stakeholders or
require multiple actions (e.g., cultural and tourism projects or regeneration). Competitive projects are in
turn more effective than the PRS in “linear” rather than “network-based” interventions, for instance
relating to stand-alone or one-off interventions to strengthen environmental or transport infrastructure.


Main Lessons
According to representatives of the managing authority, the effectiveness of PRS projects is a result of
the partnership method used during their preparation. Implementation of individual projects is slower
and more difficult, and they carry a higher risk of failure. In the context of competitive procedures,
beneficiaries tend to set unrealistic indicators and targets in order to receive funding. The PRS creates a
comprehensive way to solve a problem existing in a specific area. Therefore, and supported by the
results of the above analyses, managing authority representatives expect the PRS to be very important
and to receive a higher allocation in the 2014-20 ROP. Leadership of the PRS is vital, and the evaluation
suggests that the appointment by local authorities of a separate unit for this task is preferable to one
local authority playing a dual beneficiary / leadership role (see also below).

Despite the success of the PRS approach, there is also some scope for improvement regarding the
following aspects:
      Time / labor intensive procedure (including pre-assessment of projects);
      Delays in the submission of projects by beneficiaries;
      Shifts in timetables for project implementation (concerning 70% of projects);
      Resignation from submission, cancellation of contract (e.g., due to changes in rates and costs
        during the lengthy application procedure);
      Lack of regulations (e.g., related to State aid); and
      Lack of motivation of beneficiaries (due to guaranteed funding).

Looking ahead to the 2014-20 programming period, the following recommendations were made by
the 2012 evaluation assessing the impact of the ROP:65
     The selection of part of the projects following non-competitive procedures should be continued,
       because, in comparison to the implementation of competitive projects, EU funds can be spent
       more effectively. However, taking into account that work involved in selecting non-competitive
       projects, both on the side of the beneficiaries and the managing authority, lasted many months
       prior to the submission of the applications and incurred substantial costs, the need for the initial
       stage of project assessment is questionable.
     A mechanism should be created to allow for the selection of more strategic PRS projects, e.g., by
       increasing the importance of strategic coherence compared to other project assessment criteria.
     The model of the “Western” PRS should be disseminated, where the leadership role was taken
       on by a separate body appointed by local authorities in the sub-region. This solution provides
       greater objectivity in coordinating the implementation of the PRS and in representing the
       beneficiaries before the managing authority. Using this model prevents local governments from
       exercising a dual role as leader of the sub-region and beneficiary.
     Reduction of duplication during initial project assessment in the 2014-20 programming period.

       The project preparation process should be shortened but better monitored. The guidelines
        should provide for the preparation of monitoring reports by the leader of the sub-region
        documenting progress with project preparation (every two months).
       The managing authority should specify the demarcation line between PRS and key projects,
        while ensuring that the non-competitive path retains a complementary character and covers all
        possible project types.



Estonia OP for the Development of Living Environment: Open Calls
Most Structural Funds projects in Estonia are selected via open calls and this case study discusses how
they are implemented, focusing on the national OP for the Development of Living Environment. More
specifically, it looks at support for business infrastructure provided under Priority 4 “Integral and
balanced development of regions” (Measure 3). Projects are selected by an Evaluation panel using
common and specific criteria organized in three assessment blocks, involving scoring and weighting
techniques based on a detailed list of indicators. Open calls, which cover the whole of Estonia, allow
choosing the most competitive projects with the highest national impact. However, they have not
ensured balanced spatial distribution of the funded projects.

Context
Estonia has taken a centralized approach to Structural Funds management and implementation based
on a centralized administration and National Operational Programmes without explicit regional
targeting. The OP for the Development of Living Environment guides the utilization of the ERDF and
Cohesion Fund in the area of environmental protection, energy, local and regional development,
education and health care and welfare services. It involves c. €1,548.9 million, equal to 45.5 percent of
total Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund resources allocated to Estonia for the 2007-13 programming
period. The balanced development of regions (Priority 4) is pursued by developing local public services
and improving living conditions. The scope for investments is broad ranging from the renovation of
schools and constructing sports grounds to building business infrastructure. More than €388 million
(ERDF) has been allocated to support for regional development, equal to 11.4 percent of the Structural
Funds assistance allocated to Estonia. The Ministry of Finance is the Managing Authority of all three
Estonian NOPs. Support for regional development is implemented by the Ministry of the Interior (first
level Intermediary Body) and Enterprise Estonia (second level Intermediary Body).

Program progress has been satisfactory. By the end of 2012, commitments were at 87.7% and
payments at 54.3%. Most of the priorities have progressed well and as expected (progress of Priority 5
has been only modest) and the financial progress of the OP can be considered good.

Several selection models are used for the different priorities. The OP includes eight priority axes that
are divided into 16 sub-axes and 39 measures that are carried out through investment plans (17 in
total), programs (5), and open applications (15). The measures of (horizontal) technical assistance (2 in
total) are carried out as part of drafting the State budget. Apart from Priority 6, all priorities select
measures through open applications. The selection of projects through open applications may take place
through competitive or FIFO procedures. Priority axes 2, 4 and 6 select projects in the form of
investment plans, which are based on the prioritization of requirements by the State or local authorities.
In this case, a list of projects or a pipeline to be financed is approved by the Government. Investment
plans can also be compiled in order to fund local authority investments based on prioritizing project
applications (pre-application) at county level or in selected urban areas. In the case of national public
infrastructure, the Government designates investments (projects) to be financed from Structural Funds
once a year or less frequently. The decision about which implementation scheme to be used is decided
for each supported activity in line with measure-specific requirements based on an internal decree
linked to the Structural Assistance Act 2007- 2013.

Project Selection Model and Procedures - Open Calls (Measure “Strengthening of the competitiveness
of regions”)
Open calls are the most commonly used project selection method in Estonia, although their overall
use is less than in the 2004-06 programming period. They cover all of Estonia and allow for choosing
the most competitive projects with the highest national impact, and are used alongside pre-selected
investment plans. The present case study covers Priority 4 “Integral and balanced development of
regions,” which is implemented through six measures:
             1) Development of local public services
             2) Development of urban regions
             3) Strengthening of the competitiveness of regions
             4) Development of State-owned cultural and tourism objects
             5) Development of regional competence
             6) Improving the quality of broadband access
Measures three, four, and five are funded through open calls.

After the calls have been published, applicants can opt for support before submitting their
application; project selection itself is carried out by an Evaluation panel:
     Development of calls by first-level Intermediary Body (Ministry of Interior). The exact
        methodology for project selection is developed by the second-level Intermediary Body
        (Enterprise Estonia) or entity for each action. The calls are published on the websites of the first

                                                                                                                    266
        and second level Intermediary Bodies and in the national newspaper, providing information on
        the timing and resources to be allocated.
       Before submission of applications, the project applicant is entitled to get support from
        Enterprise Estonia for developing a project idea into an application. The support draws
        attention to the technical and substantive deficiencies of the application and gives
        recommendations for removal. However, this support is neither mandatory nor a prerequisite
        for submitting an application.
       Applications can be submitted on an ongoing basis. Applications can be submitted on paper or
        electronically. They are submitted to the second-level Intermediary Body (Enterprise Estonia).
        The application must contain a completed application form designed to ensure that the project
        is in line with the objectives of the measure and the priority area. The application must also
        include the following documents: 1) project description; 2) project budget; 3) the schedule for
        the project; 4) documentation on own contribution; 5) background information on the applicant
        and the project partners (not required from public authorities); 6) project manager’s Curriculum
        Vitae; 7) documents describing the action plan and a business model for business infrastructure
        and jobs to be created, wage levels, and taxes paid (including business plans and fiscal
        forecasts), as a result of the business infrastructure built; 8) applicant’s last annual report and if
        not available on databases/if the applicant has been in business for more than the current fiscal
        year, also the balance sheet and the income statement (not older than two months); and 9)
        statement of the need for infrastructure development to improve the business environment and
        of the intention to construct the infrastructure.
       The applications are evaluated by an expert Evaluation panel (predefined for each
        measure/program and communicated on the website), which is composed of external and
        Enterprise Estonia’s internal experts. The assessment will follow the predefined criteria, which
        are also publicly available on the Enterprise Estonia website. The assessment criteria are
        grouped in three “assessment blocks.” The assessment will result in a positive funding decision if
        the project exceeds the predefined threshold in all three blocks.
       No later than 30 days after submitting the application the applicant shall be notified of approval,
        partial approval, conditional approval, or rejection of the application.

Duration: Processing applications shall take up to 30 days. If the application contains inaccuracies, the
applicant shall be notified immediately in order to correct the deficiencies. The applicant is given 10
days to complement and correct the application. In this case, the period for processing the application is
extended by 10 days.

Selection Criteria and Indicators: Development of Business infrastructure
Measure 4.3 “Strengthening of the competitiveness of regions” aims to support the development of
the local business environment and cultural and tourism sites of national importance. The
development of local business environment supports the following operations:

       Development of regional industrial parks and logistics centers;
       Creation and strengthening of regional innovation systems and operations directed to the
        development of regional business networks and competence centers (in particular on the basis
        of county centers);
       Development of public technical infrastructure essential for business development;
       Preparations for community reuse of former military, industrial and agricultural facilities;
        demolition of low-value facilities;
       Adaptation of disused public facilities for new functions;

                                                                                                          267
       Creation of conditions for stimulating local employment (establishment of local workshops,
        promotion of the use of traditional know-how, etc.); and
       Investments in improving the quality of broadband access (data transmission links in areas of
        market failure, public broadband access sites and points).

The measure is implemented by Enterprise Estonia through the “Development Program for Regional
Competitiveness.” The program supports two types of projects: 1) development of tourism and leisure
infrastructure; and 2) development of business infrastructure. Business infrastructure development
projects include the following eligible activities: 1) construction and development of public technical
infrastructure (access roads, water and sewage systems, drainage systems, exterior lighting and power,
communication and heating networks); 2) redeveloping former military, industrial and agricultural
facilities in rural areas. The minimum amount of grant per project is €50,000. The maximum contribution
to the projects is decided on the basis of the contribution of the project to the State budget (i.e., tax
paid in the following three years after the end of project), but does not exceed €1 million. The grant can
cover up to 85% of eligible project costs. Beneficiaries are mainly local governments and the third
sector.

The eligibly criteria aim to facilitate transparent and effective project selection. The first-level
Intermediary Body specifies project selection criteria and implementation arrangements including
monitoring, supervision and other activities related to project implementation. The Managing Authority
monitors the definition of selection criteria in order to ensure their alignment with the specific
measures. The Managing Authority also prepares a guide for general project selection criteria to enable
common understanding and evaluation of the criteria. More specific appraisal criteria are defined in
measure decrees approved by the first-level Intermediary Bodies or the Government, and these can
elaborate or complement the general criteria approved by the Monitoring Committee to facilitate their
application to different measures. In addition, first-level Intermediary Bodies may define specific sector
or measure-based criteria to ensure better focus of measures. Both the general selection criteria
approved by the Monitoring Committee as well as the measure-specific criteria are made public and are
available on the web sites of the intermediary bodies.

The following common criteria were developed in cooperation of the intermediary bodies and are
applied across all Estonian OPs:
    project impact toward the achievement of the objectives of the priority axis;
    project feasibility; and
    demand for the project.

Specific criteria for “Strengthening of the competitiveness of regions,” projects developing business
infrastructure: Three sets of indicators are used (“assessment blocks” – see table).

                 Assessment Blocks – General Project Selection Criteria for Measure 4.3
                                     Goal                                         Weighting
Contribution of the project in advancing the goals of the measure                     50%
(impact on business activity, jobs, sustainability)
Relevance and sustainability of infrastructure facilities (benefit for                25%
beneficiaries, justification of the proposed site, financial and
administrative sustainability of infrastructure facility, technical quality
and sustainability of the infrastructure project)
Readiness to implement the project (feasibility, security of resources,               25%
applicant’s administrative capacity, self-financing, project budget)

Projects are assessed using scoring and weighting techniques around a detailed list of criteria. For the
individual criteria, scores are attributed between 0-4:
        4= Very good
        3= Good
        2=Mediocre
        1=Weak
        0= Poor

The total score for the individual criteria is the arithmetic average (to two decimals) of the marks
awarded by the individual members of the Evaluation panel. The total score of an assessment block is
formed by summing up the weighted-average scores. For a positive funding decision, the project must
reach the pre-defined score in each assessment block. In the first assessment block, the project must
score at least 2.75, and in the second and third blocks at least 2.50. If the average score given by any

                                                                                                    269
member of the Evaluation panel is less than 1.00 or more than half of the members of the Evaluation
panel assess any individual criterion for 0.00, the project receives a negative funding decision. The
following table shows the definition of grades for each individual evaluation criterion:

                  Assessment Blocks – Detailed Criteria and Indicators for Measure 4.3

0       Wage estimates are not reliable or justified
1.3     Impact on social tax income (25% of the total grade of the first assessment block)

4       The project is estimated to result in an additional social security tax in the first fiscal year following the
        fiscal year of the completion of the project;
        The project is estimated to result in an additional social security tax in the second fiscal year following
3
        the fiscal year of the completion of the project;
        The project is estimated to result in an additional social security tax in the third fiscal year following the
2
        fiscal year of the completion of the project;
        The project’s estimated effect on additional social income tax is overestimated and the project will not
1       result in additional social tax income by the end of the third fiscal year after the completion of the
        project.
0       The projected influence on social income tax is not reliable or justified.
1.4     Beneficiary/Beneficiaries’ sustainability (25% of the total grade of the first assessment block)
        The beneficiaries' business models are sustainable. There is demand for the beneficiaries' products /
4       services in the long term and the competitiveness of the beneficiary is high. It is likely that the
        beneficiaries continue to operate in the markets for at least five years after project completion;
        The beneficiaries' business models are sustainable. There is demand for the beneficiaries' products /
3       services in the long term and the competitiveness of the beneficiary is high. It is likely that the
        beneficiaries continue to operate in the markets for at least three years after project completion;
        The beneficiaries' business models work, but the business model is not particularly sustainable given the
2       changes in the external environment. There is market demand for the beneficiaries’ products/services
        but they lack clear competitive advantage;

                                                                                                                   270
        The beneficiaries' business models are effective, but they are expected to operate no more than two
1       years after the commissioning of the project because of maturing infrastructure. The market for the
        beneficiaries’ products / services market is fading and they have no clear competitive advantage.

0       The beneficiaries' business models are not sustainable or the beneficiary lacks a business model.
        Beneficiaries’ products / services have no real competitive advantages and no markets.

        The project eliminates some bottlenecks that hinder the beneficiary(ies) entry / expansion in the
1
        markets
        The project does not eliminate key bottlenecks that hinder the beneficiary(ies) entry / expansion in the
0       markets and the infrastructure is not essential for the beneficiary to enter / expand in the markets. The
        project is over-dimensioned.

4       There are no alternatives to the selected location in the same county enabling beneficiary entry /
        expansion, or the cost for building public infrastructure is significantly higher in the alternative location.
        There are alternatives for the selected location in the same county and the cost of building would be
3
        equal but would require significant additional financing from the beneficiary to change location.

2       There are alternatives for the selected location in the same county and the cost of building would be
        equal and it does not require significant additional financing from the beneficiary to change location.

1       There are alternatives for the selected location in the same county and the cost of building would be
        lower and the additional cost for beneficiary is modest.

0       There are alternatives for the selected location in the same county and the cost of building would be
        significantly lower and there are no additional costs for the beneficiary.
        Financial and administrative sustainability of the infrastructure (25% of the total grade of the second
2.3
        assessment block)

0       The applicant's financial capacity is weak and project co-financing is not ensured.
3.3     Technical readiness of the project (20% of the total grade of the third assessment block)

4       The project is ready to be implemented. All necessary permits to begin construction work are in place.
        Project planning is partially completed (e.g., conceptual design). Most of the necessary permits and
3       similar exist. Obtaining the missing permits is likely.
        The project requires additional permits before construction can begin. Obtaining the missing permits is
2       likely.
        The project requires additional permits before construction can begin. Obtaining the missing permits
1       before the start date of the project is questionable
        Readiness to implement the project is low, because the required permits are missing and / or cannot be
0       obtained by the proposed starting date of the project.




3.4     Project budget, quality and relevance (40% of the total grade of the third assessment block)

        The budget is transparent and linked to planned actions and their outcomes. Costs are detailed and

4       The budget is sufficient for the implementation of project activities and is not exaggerated.
        The budget is transparent and linked to planned actions and their outcomes. Costs are detailed and
        justified. The budget of the majority of project activities is based on bidding providers. Project costs are
        comparable with similar projects. The budget is sufficient for the implementation of project activities
3       and is not exaggerated.

        The budget is transparent and linked to planned actions and their outcomes. Costs are detailed and
        justified. The budget has been prepared on the basis of calculations and prepared by an authorized HR
        specialist. The project is very similar to market prices. The budget is sufficient for the implementation of
2       project activities and is not exaggerated.


        The budget is insufficient to implement project activities, prices are underestimated. There is a risk that
        fiscal resources are not adequately planned, which could hinder project realization; or the budget is
1       overestimated, the expenditure is not justified and the prices significantly exceed current market prices.
0       Expenditure is partly unjustified and only partially transparent. Estimates are largely unreliable.

Applications that meet the pre-defined thresholds for each funding block receive a positive funding
decision. If several projects are presented simultaneously and reach the same aggregate assessments,
preference is given to the project that receives the highest score in the first assessment block. The
applicant can receive approval, partial approval or conditional approval or be rejected. If the application
is rejected, the applicant is informed about the reasons for rejection.

In terms of monitoring and evaluation, the NOP for development of Living Environment defines

Performance assessment
The project selection system is found to work satisfactorily since it ensures absorption and output
achievement; it ensures high levels of transparency, but could be improved regarding its strategic
orientation. The project selection system of the Estonian Operational Programmes was evaluated in
2010 in order to assess in how far the selection models ensured funding absorption and how well the
selection models and criteria managed to ensure strategic fit of the projects. Commitments and
payments of activities aiming to improve the business environment have been as expected.
In terms of the effectiveness of the selection model, the following remarks can be made:
      The output indicator “Number of business infrastructure facilities created or qualitatively
        improved,” which measures the achievement of business infrastructure development activities,
        had reached 40% of the target value for 2015 by the end of 2012. Since many of the projects are
        still on-going it is expected that the target level will be achieved by the end of 2015.
      The effectiveness of the measure was hindered by the vagueness of targets. The aim of the
        measure was to increase the competitiveness of the regions by making them more attractive for
        businesses and visitors. However, the concepts of competitiveness and attractiveness are not
        clearly defined. Clearer targets are essential for purposeful project selection. To ensure this, the
        content of project applications and supporting documents should be delimited more clearly. For
        example, applicants provide their own description of the relationship between project goals and
        the goals of the county strategy. This is relatively straightforward due to the vagueness of
        strategic objectives. This makes the scoring and assessment of applications more difficult and
        leaves room for subjective assessment. Furthermore, applicants and evaluators are expected to
        refer to multiple strategic documents, however no list of key documents is provided, which
        would increase the objectivity and uniformity of the assessment by the panel members.
      The key strength of the project selection process is transparency; information on selection
        criteria, weighting and the members of the Evaluation panel, etc., is made public and all
        applications are assessed by all panel members. However, more emphasis should be placed on


                                                                                                        274
         clear and uniform definitions of key concepts and indicators. More detailed guidelines for the
         panel members and clearer definitions of indicators would enhance the uniformity of
         assessment by panel members and increase the quality of funding decisions.
        Cost efficiency should be assessed across all activities. In addition, there are no criteria or
         mechanisms ensuring that funds are evenly distributed across counties.


Italy – Lazio ERDF OP: Competitive Calls for Local and Urban Development Plans (P.L.U.S. Lazio)66
The Local and Urban Development Plans (P.L.U.S., Plano Locale e Urbano di Sviluppo) were introduced
to the Lazio ERDF OP very late in the programming period in response to problems with program
progress and the changed economic situation. Identified through a competitive procedure, they
provide a framework for projects in the field of urban development, including economic, social,
territorial and cultural activities. They are characterized by a number of procedural innovations and have
allowed for close strategic alignment with the ROP strategy (as reprogrammed) and also with the new
Europe 2020 strategy and the priorities of the forthcoming round of Cohesion policy, which see urban
development as a pillar of Cohesion policy.

Context
In Italy, the management of regional ERDF OPs is decentralized. The ERDF OP of the Lazio region is
managed by the Regional Directorate Economic Development and Productive Activities. It is one of the
Italian Regional Competitiveness and Employment ERDF OPs, and entailed, in its original configuration
(October 2007), c. €329.9 million (ERDF), equal to c. 1.3 percent of the total ERDF resources allocated to
Italy for the 2007-13 period. In a reprogramming exercise of 2011, to take into account low spending
performance (by the end of 2010 the program had only spent 8.5 percent of its total allocation) 67 and
new needs that emerged as a result of the economic crisis (including in the metropolitan area of Rome
and in medium/small urban centers),68 a new emphasis was placed on urban development as an engine
for growth.69 As a result, the program was integrated with a new Priority (P5) on urban and local
development, which is the subject of the case study.70

   A new Committee, CIPU - Interministerial Committee for Urban policies, was established in 2012. In March 2013, the
Committee issued a document entitled ‘Methods and Contents relating to the priorities in the field of the urban agenda ’.
Essentially, the document denounced the fragmentation of the interventions for towns and cities and the lack of an urban
regeneration policy intended as an engine for development, arguing in favour of renewed attention on this theme and better
(less fragmented) governance, through the lever of Cohesion policy, particularly to tackle the infrastructure bottlenecks and
congestion of urban areas; urban sprawl and land usage; building safety and the maintenance of urban land.
70
   Priority 5, ‘Urban and local development’ was introduced in a revision proposal of February 2011, with an allocation of €80
million. The identification of the intervention spheres (linee generali di intervento) was made by the MA and the Regional
Directorate for Economic Programming, Research and Innovation, together with the regional evaluation unit (Nucleo di
Valutazione e Verifica, NUVV) and the regional Environmental Authority. The revision proposal was endorsed by the partnership
in a meeting of 13 December 2010 and by the PMC on 18 February 2011. The revised ROP was then approved by the regional
executive (Giunta Regionale) with deliberation of 20 May 2011, by the regional Council with deliberation of 28 March 2012 and
by the European Commission on 28 March 2012 (source: Regione Lazio, Integrazioni al documento “Descrizione del Sistema di
Gestione e Controllo”, POR FESR Lazio 2007-2013, Novembre 2012).

Note: (1) This is the total in the document, but from the figures the total should be €770 million. We can only assume that the
grand total has not been updated to reflect the new allocations.

The OP relies upon a number of different selection methods, applicable to the various measures
(activities). These include: (i) evaluative procedure through open calls (procedura valutativa a sportello),
i.e., open calls for tenders where projects are selected if they meet eligibility criteria and score above
certain minimum thresholds in relation to pre-set criteria of merit; (ii) evaluative procedure through
competitive calls (procedura valutativa a graduatoria), i.e., calls for tenders with specified deadlines,
where projects that have passed a first eligibility scrutiny are ranked based on pre-set selection criteria;
and (iii) identification of projects based on the regional authority’s own sectoral plans (only for Priorities
2 and 3). Technical Assistance measures are administered through either calls for tenders or direct
contracting-out (affidamento diretto). The most used procedure is the evaluative procedure through
competitive calls. In some cases, notably under Priority 1, a single activity can be administered through
both open and competitive calls.

In addition, the regional authority established the use of ‘integrated access procedures’ (for activities
I.1, I.2, I.3. I.4, I.5, I.6 and II.1), comprising aspects of ‘negotiated procedure’ (procedura negoziale di
accesso alle agevolazioni), to select composite investment projects above €20 million and comprising at
least one ‘key’ project of at least €10 million, in order to enact quick and targeted interventions for the
economic development of the region inducing spillovers on local production chains (ricadute di filiera).
These ‘integrated access procedures’, which were finalized in 2008, proved too complex and contributed
to implementation delays, and had to be revised a year later.71

Project selection is undertaken by both the regional authority’s own offices and by a number of
Intermediary and Implementing Bodies.72 The selection procedures utilized for each activity or sub-

specific documents called ‘Implementing modalities of the program’ (Modalità Attuative del
Programma, MAPO), drafted by the managing authority and approved by the program monitoring
committee (and which provide the basis for the calls for tenders).73

The program is not progressing well: At 31 October 2013 (last available data), total payments (ERDF and
domestic co-financing) stood at 48 percent of financial allocations. It was therefore not able to meet the
domestic expenditure target of 55 percent (a target of c. €409.2 million, against a level of actual
expenditures of €354.3 million).74

Project Selection Model and Procedures – The P.L.U.S. Local and Urban Development Plan (Piano
Locale e Urbano di Sviluppo)
The P.L.U.S. were introduced in the ERDF regional program with a reprogramming exercise in 2011 to
respond to the changed context in the region’s medium-sized towns and cities, which has emerged as
the result of the economic crisis, while also addressing the spending and implementation difficulties
that the program was facing. A document was prepared by the regional evaluation unit in February
2011, explaining the reasons for the reprogramming (which did entail also other changes to Priorities 1
to 3, as well as the creation of the new Priority 5).75 The P.L.U.S. are implemented under Priority 5 on
urban and local development, Activity I.7 from Priority 1 (Development of telecommunication
applications, products, processes, contents and services) and Activity II.1 (in Priority 2) via integrated
investment programs for municipalities with more than 25,000 inhabitants, including investments in: via
integrated investment programmes for municipalities with more than 25,000 inhabitants including
investments in:
     1. Public works and acquisition of services and goods;
     2. Active labor market policies (e.g., training, traineeships etc.) and aids to individuals; and
     3. Aids to SMEs.

Eligible expenditures are precisely defined for each of these categories in a regulation for the P.L.U.S.76
and aids to individuals / firms are granted only to residents in the area of each P.L.U.S. (which is a sub-
area of the given municipality).

The selection procedure of the P.L.U.S. appears to have a two-fold rationale. On the one hand, the
choice of composite plans comprising, for the largest part, ready-to-be-implemented infrastructure
projects, was intended to support the achievement of the programme’s spending targets, at the same
time as ensuring added value (synergies between different projects) and concentration (territorial
focus), and thus high impact. On the other hand, the devolution to the municipalities of project selection
responsibilities for aids to businesses/persons and of the public procurement procedures for the
realization of public works, achieved a double effect: to lighten the work of the managing
authority/regional offices and to enhance skills and instill a performance-oriented mentality within the
municipalities (also beyond the preparation phase of the P.L.U.S.), in line with the principle of
administrative federalism recently introduced in the Italian Constitution. In relation to this last aspect, it
is noteworthy that a reserve was set aside to reward at a later date the best performing P.L.U.S..,
supported by procedural innovations allowing for real-time benchmarking of the different plans, notably
through an online monitoring system and a related ‘information querying tool’ to compare the financial
and procedural advancement across different P.L.U.S. programs.

Taken together, a total amount of €147.3 million was assigned to the P.L.U.S. based on an approved
ranking list, of which €113.7 million was immediately allocated to projects. The P.L.U.S. involve almost
€130 million from Priority 5, plus another €8.86 million under Activity II.1 in Priority 2 (Promotion of
energy efficiency and production of renewable energy) and further €8.95 million from Activity I.7 from
Priority 1 (Development of telecommunication applications, products, processes, contents and services).

Projects supported by the P.L.U.S. are composite projects comprising a variable mix, defined by each
municipality. They include public works, SME support, acquisition of goods or services, social inclusion
and employability measures (e.g., traineeships), and communication activities. The selection procedure
resulted in the allocation of resources to 16 Integrated Investment Programs in 16 municipalities.
Allocations are used to fund 153 projects of which: 73 public works, 17 projects for SMEs, 16 projects for
the communication of the results of each P.L.U.S., 13 projects for the acquisition of goods or services
and 24 projects for social inclusion and employability.

Each integrated program is composed of a different mix of projects, depending on the needs and
preferences of each municipality, as defined in the P.L.U.S. plan. In illustration, the P.L.U.S. of Rome,
called ‘Porta Portese, a resource for Rome’, consists of the following:77
     - Modernization of a public building (€3.14 million);
     - Modernization of the market of Porta Portese (€3.58 million);
     - Implementation of the PPTU (detailed plan on urban traffic) of the part of Rome covered by the
         P.L.U.S. (part of the area of the Municipio XVI) (€540,000);
     - Fund for the development of micro-entrepreneurship and firm start-ups (€230,000); and
     - Information and communication plan (c. €150,000);

In addition, it included investments from Priority 1 of the OP:
    - Information and telecommunication technologies for the improvement of the quality of urban
         mobility (€820,000);
    - Implementation of the PPTU (coordination of traffic lights and LED technologies, €410,000).

The P.L.U.S. programs were identified in a two-stage process, followed by a project selection stage in
line with the selection of mainstream projects. In July 2011, the regional authority issued a public call

                                                                                                          278
for tenders under Activity V.I, “Regeneration of the economic, social, and environmental functions of
urban areas,” inviting municipalities with more than 25,000 inhabitants to submit projects to increase
their competitiveness, attractiveness, and sustainability. Proposals had to take the form of a ‘Local and
Urban Development Plan’ (P.L.U.S.), which had to relate to a confined area within the territory of the
municipality and which could include four thematic spheres: (i) regeneration of public areas and
buildings; (ii) social inclusion, territorial cohesion, and development of social, cultural, and tourism
services; (iii) improvement of the state of the environment, of mobility, and of the urban transport
system; and (iv) promotion of entrepreneurship and revitalization of the economic and productive
fabric.

The requirements that the P.L.U.S. have to fulfill can be seen from the application forms.78 They
comprise a number of pre-defined sections (the description below draws from the P.L.U.S. of Fondi):
Section A – General Information on the P.L.U.S.
    - Summary information on the P.L.U.S. (in the form of a table indicating: title, proponent
        municipality, selected neighborhood within the municipality, population covered, m2 covered,
        population density of the area covered, office responsible and name of officials involved,
        responsible person for the whole P.L.U.S., and number of interventions, diversified by type of
        intervention);
    - Executive summary (in English);
    - Changes or integrations made to the P.L.U.S. strategy;
    - Management arrangements/responsible offices.
Section B – Operational and Financial Plan of the P.L.U.S.
    - Interventions for public works and acquisition of goods and services;
    - Interventions on active labor market policies and aids to persons;
    - Interventions for aids to SMEs;
    - Financial plans (indicating both the specific allocation to each intervention and the overall
        expenditure target for each year up to 2015).
Section C - Interventions for public works and / or acquisition of goods and services
    - Public works – technical fiches;
    - Acquisition of goods and services – technical fiches;
    - Description of procedural advancement;
    - Procedural strategy

by the regional authority/managing authority (Annex I to Deliberation 348/2011) and includes, in line with such pro-forma, the
requested executive summary in English.

                                                                                                                          279

     -    Objectives and beneficiaries;
     -    Output indicators;

          proposal, supporting letters by organizations that will be involved in the activities of the
          P.L.U.S.).

P.L.U.S. projects were then selected through a two-tiered procedure:
    Phase 1
    - Submission by the municipalities of a (preliminary) ‘application dossier’ compliant with the
         pro-forma included in the invitation to tender. This phase preceded the approval by the
         European Commission of the revised ROP.
    - Screening of the applications and pre-selection of P.L.U.S. proposals that were invited to
         submit a ‘definitive’ proposal (upon approval of the ROP’s revision). Pre-selection was based on
         three criteria described further below.
         This first phase resulted in the pre-selection of 16 P.L.U.S. proposals (with scores above 50/100)
         and the rejection of 13 P.L.U.S. proposals (scoring between 42 and 46/100).
    Phase 2
    - Definitive selection of the P.L.U.S.: The 16 pre-selected P.L.U.S. were definitively approved, but
         with improvements and changes introduced in response to feedback obtained from the pre-
         selection stage. The P.L.U.S. were re-scored and re-ranked based on the same A-B-C criteria
         used in Phase 1; this led to a different ranking order and overall higher scores than during the
         first phase (56/100 and above).

The selection for both Phases 1 and 2 was undertaken by an Appraisal Commission taking
approximately nine months. The commission was appointed by decree of the President of the Regional
Authority comprising:
     - The managing authority of the ERDF ROP (or delegated person), with the function of Chair;
     - The managing authority of the ESF ROP (or delegated person);
     - The regional environmental authority (or delegated person);
     - An expert on public works designated by the ERDF ROP managing authority;
     - An expert on Structural Funds designated by the Agency Sviluppo Lazio; and
     - A member of the regional authority’s Evaluation and Verification Unit.
The definitive selection of the 16 P.L.U.S. took about nine months from the launch date of the call for
tenders in July 2011,79 and the ranking list was approved on 24 May 2012. Subsequently, the office(s)
responsible for the P.L.U.S. within each municipality applied the standard approaches foreseen for
different types of projects:
             a. For projects involving aids to firms or individuals, select the beneficiaries, based on
                 procedures specified in the P.L.U.S. document or in subsequent calls;80 for aids to SMEs,
                 procedures can cover the standard selection procedures identified in legislative decree
                 no. 123/1998, i.e., the automatic procedure (eligibility-based, no technical appraisal);



79
   The deadline for the submission of the definitive P.L.U.S. proposals was extended to 1 March 2012 by Directorial
Determination no, B00870 of 13 February 2012, published in the regional OJ of 21 February 2012.

   For instance, the procedures for the traineeships of the P.L.U.S. of the Municipality of Fondi are illustrated here:
http://www.P.L.U.S.fondi.it/faq.html

                                                                                                                          280
              competitive call; open call (i.e., first come first served, based on an eligibility and merit
              appraisal, and projects are funded if they score above set thresholds).
           b. For public works projects, select the subjects responsible for the realization of the
              works, based on standard public procurement procedures.

The P.L.U.S. are characterized by a number of procedural innovations. In addition to the full online
submission of the application (the full P.L.U.S. project, inclusive of scanned supporting documentary
evidence, such as deliberations of approval of infrastructure projects by the given municipal council,
supporting letters, maps, etc.), the following procedures apply once a P.L.U.S. has been approved and is
implemented:
    - The responsible office has the obligation to transmit all documentation relating to expenditure
        claims exclusively in digital format, using certified e-mail with digital signature;
    - Online monitoring of the procedural and financial progress of the P.L.U.S. through an online
        system (this allows the managing authority to know in real time the progress of each P.L.U.S.
        and related activities);
    - Creation of an ‘information system’ (‘cruscotto informativo’) that elaborates the data included in
        the online monitoring system and compares and contrasts the financial and procedural progress
        of the various P.L.U.S., benchmarking them and thus identifying the best and worst performers
        (including an alert mechanism about the need for corrective measures).

Selection Criteria and Indicators
The P.L.U.S. were selected based on three macro-criteria, totaling 100 points:
        A – Urban Regeneration Strategy (40 points):
             Coherence between the objectives of the P.L.U.S. and the objectives of Priority 5 of the
                 ROP; quality, innovativeness, and experimental nature of the regeneration and
                 development strategy proposed;
             Coherence of the described regeneration needs and the solutions proposed to
                 overcome them;
             Ability of the proposed interventions to maximize the benefits for the environment, to
                 exploit fully the cultural, historical, and architectural heritage of the area, and to
                 promote the equal opportunities principle; where applicable, the inclusion of a
                 municipal energy efficiency plan and CO2 reduction represent an element of added
                 value;
             Degree of interconnection between interventions included in the P.L.U.S. and appraisal
                 of the approach taken / to be taken to ensure the integration of interventions;
             Balance and innovativeness of the types of initiatives foreseen in the various thematic
                 areas (physical, environmental, social, and economic); the development of
                 telecommunication infrastructure and services for the improvement of urban quality are
                 an element of added value.

       B – Administrative feasibility (40 points)
            Completeness of submitted documentation and sufficient level of overall
              detail/definition of projects;
            Coherence of the P.L.U.S. with regional and provincial territorial planning instruments
              and with urban planning instruments;
            Procedural advancement of each specific intervention (a higher score is assigned to the
              P.L.U.S. that include projects with available or expected authorizations and certificates);


                                                                                                       281
                    Financial sustainability of the interventions – this includes the financing of the works
                     after completion. The replicability and innovativeness of the proposed interventions is
                     an element of added value;
                    Compatibility of the time-frame of each intervention with the time-horizon of the 2007-
                     13 ROP and Structural Funds regulations.

            C – Favorable factors for the completion of the P.L.U.S. (20 points)
                 Quality of the project management structure and clear / detailed description of the
                    organization within the proponent municipality for both the overall coordination of the
                    P.L.U.S. and the successful delivery of each intervention; participation of the
                    municipality in networks of towns already involved in urban regeneration strategies
                    (e.g., URBACT) and / or strategic programming. The presence and operation of an
                    URBAN center is an element of added value.
                 Functional integration of the operations foreseen as part of the P.L.U.S. with
                    interventions already realized or being realized in the reference territory.
                 Financial participation of private actors in the P.L.U.S. initiatives or, alternatively, in
                    complementary initiatives and the delivery stages.

Monitoring is carried out as part of the ordinary monitoring activities of the program. In addition, a
dedicated ‘cruscotto informativo’ has been established to monitor the financial and procedural progress
of each P.L.U.S., allowing to benchmark the 16 plans against each other. No evaluation has been
conducted on this initiative yet, understandably given its novelty. It would be premature to attempt to
appraise achievements at this stage.

Performance Assessment
At 20 December 2013,81 46 out of the 73 public works had stipulated the contract for the launch of the
works or had already started the construction phase. 27 further works have still to finalize the public
procurement procedures; a majority of these, however, are expected to conclude the contracting-out by
mid-January 2014. 63 percent of the works approved for funding – representing c. €53.5 million of
investments – have been started. Legally binding commitments stand at above €50 million. Certified
expenditure amounts to roughly €9.3 million.

The P.L.U.S. have allowed for close strategic alignment with the ROP strategy. Given the structure of
the P.L.U.S. and the procedure and criteria used to select them, the selected projects closely match the
ROP objectives, as amended following the 2011 reprogramming exercise.

Main Lessons
Composite territorial projects are generally suitable with respect to ERDF regional development goals
for the following reasons:
      Suitable to address the specific needs of local milieu;
      Positive empowerment of municipalities through delegation of functions, while at the same
         time framing the interventions realized within the regional strategy of the ROP;
      Clear description of objectives in the individual P.L.U.S. proposals formulated by the
         municipalities and specification of how they match those of the ROP. Coherence between the
         two sets of objectives ensured by this being one of the selection criteria;

                                                                                                                           282
        Two-tiered project selection appears to have raised the quality of the interventions foreseen in
         the P.L.U.S. (as manifested by the higher scoring recorded in the second round of appraisals).

The following good practice and conditions for successful implementation can be highlighted:
    Transparent and traceable project selection according to pre-defined procedures and criteria
        specified in the call for projects (something which is quite standard in Italy);
    Two-stage procedure for the selection of the P.L.U.S. appear to have worked well, in allowing
        the ROP authorities to have a dialogue with the proponent municipalities so as to improve the
        proposals;
    Assignment of ad-hoc resources for the municipalities to define their P.L.U.S. proposals once
        pre-selected;
    Weight assigned to readiness to be implemented ensures fast absorption of resources and aids
        meeting spending targets;
    High degree of transparency: all the documentation for potential applicants and the general
        public is readily available online, not least through a dedicated site (http://www.pluslazio.eu/);
    High degree of transparency and certainty on selection procedures and criteria appears to
        depoliticize project selection (at the level of the individual P.L.U.S.);
    The benchmarking of the different P.L.U.S. through the dedicated IT platform and the reserve
        for performing projects should encourage virtuous behaviors and drive performance;
    The fact that P.L.U.S. documents have to specify the financial sustainability of infrastructure
        projects, after their completion, is a very welcomed aspect of the approach. Past evaluations on
        ERDF programs found that the unavailability of maintenance and running costs for infrastructure
        realized has been a major problem.82

There is scope for improvement, notably regarding result orientation and transparency of funding
sources. Although the P.L.U.S. have to define output indicators and targets, the emphasis appears to be
predominantly on financial performance and spending according to timetable (understandably, to an
extent, given the critical situation of the ROP). While the list of approved projects describes the two
rankings of the 16 selected P.L.U.S. programs, the overall financial plan of the P.L.U.S. (i.e., a summative
table providing details on the scores and resources obtained by each P.L.U.S.), and the detailed financial
plan of each individual P.L.U.S. (i.e., a table for each P.L.U.S. indicating the requested and obtained
contribution to each intervention), it does not provide any information on the outputs/results targets
attached to these. This is something that would have to be improved in a future program. The way in
which the overall financial plan of the P.L.U.S. relates to the ROP is not entirely clear (different sources
state different amounts and it is not clear whether the overall amount assigned to each P.L.U.S. comes
entirely from the ROP or also from other sources).83

   For instance, the approval decree indicates an overall amount of funded investments of €147.3 million, of which €113.7 from
the ERDF ROP, plus €24.6 million from ‘economies’ from Priority 5 and a further €8.9 million from activity I.7 (which a re both
also based on the ROP). At the same time, the dedicated webpage in its update dated 20 December 2013 states that certified
expenditure is equal to just 10.5 percent of resources allocated under the ERDF ROP (of €88.7 million). The ROP as
reprogrammed in 2011 assigned to Priority 5 €80 million, of which €60 million for urban regeneration and €20 million for the
promotion of attractiveness and entrepreneurship.

                                                                                                                           283
Potential disadvantages of the P.L.U.S. approach relate to the time involved in selecting them,
additionality, and issues around the targeting of municipalities that are most in need:
    The appraisal and selection procedure was perhaps lengthier than desirable (but it was also
        experimental to some degree);
    Given that the public works were already in the pipeline, would they have been implemented
        anyway, even without support from the ROP? (Possibly not, given the tightening of public
        finances, but this would have to be verified);
    The procedure may favor more institutionally advanced municipalities and, by the same token,
        penalize less endowed ones (which may also need more support for regeneration/to address
        social problems, etc.).

In conclusion it can be said that the P.L.U.S. are a promising approach in several respects. The P.L.U.S.
are an interesting example of how project application and selection procedures can encourage the
pooling of different types of projects into wider plans characterized by both internal strategic coherence
and external strategic fit with the goals of the ERDF program (and wider regional programming). It is also
an example of how a two-tier selection procedure can drive the quality of the interventions proposed. It
is a new type of support which was only introduced in the ROP in 2012, the actual performance of this
new approach in terms of selecting projects should thus be appraised upon completion of the realized
investments, but the integrated approach appears promising.


Slovenia – Strengthening Regional Development Potentials OP (ERDF): Competitive Calls in Promotion
of Entrepreneurship84

Competitive calls have been widely used in Slovenia in 2007-13, including for the OP Strengthening
Regional Development Potentials, which is considered in this case study . Projects are selected based
on a short criteria list by awarding scores in line with indicators. The approach has worked well in the
Slovenian context, although high levels of selectivity have been criticized by unsuccessful applicants.

Context
Structural Funds management in Slovenia is largely centralized. The ERDF OP ‘Strengthening Regional
Development Potentials’, which will be considered in this case study, is managed by the Ministry of
Economic Development and Technology, and more specifically the EU Cohesion Policy Directorate. The
following table shows the funding allocations by priority for the 2007-13 programming period.

The majority of funding of the OP Strengthening Regional Development Potentials is implemented via
competitive calls. There are some exceptions under Priority 3, where tourism projects are preselected.

Overall, the implementation of the OP is progressing very well. By the end of 2012, ERDF commitments
were at 95.1 percent and payments at 47.3 percent. Priority 1 performed above average (81.1 percent –
see Table below) and the measure under which the case study falls stands even at 98.9 percent of funds
already paid out.

Project Selection Model and Procedures – Competitive Calls
Funding under Priority 1 is allocated via the Ministry of Economy as the responsible intermediate
body with calls being administered by subordinate agents . The Ministry tasks agents with the
implementation of measures, for instance the Slovenian Technological Agency (now part of SPIRIT,
Public Agency for the Promotion of Entrepreneurship, Innovation, Development, Investment and
Tourism) and the Slovene Enterprise Fund (SEF, Slovenski podjetniški sklad). For the selected case of
project selection, the SEF is the agent responsible for the whole selection procedure, including the
preparation and publication of calls, assessment of applications and deciding on project selection. The
‘Public call for co-financing of purchase of new technology equipment for SMEs’ has been carried out in
a similar way seven times in the current programming period. Most information in this report relates to
the call for 2009-11 from 13 March 2009 and the last call of this kind for 2013-14 from 21 June 2013.
The call covers parts of Measure 1.2 (Promotion of entrepreneurship) under Priority 1 (Competitiveness
and research excellence).

                                                                                                                          285
The purpose of this public call is to select SMEs with the best potential to show increased growth and
productivity. The aim is to encourage initial investments in tangible and intangible assets, namely those
associated with the expansion of an existing business, expanding the company's activities into new
products or a fundamental change in the overall production process of an existing business. Funding
should enhance the competitiveness of supported firms, as measured by value added per employee.

The amounts allocated are roughly €30 million for each call (€29.75 million for the call from 13 March
2009, €31.14 for the call from 21 June 2013), corresponding to around 17 percent of all funding under
Measure 1.2. Eligible costs are physical investments (purchase of new machinery and hardware) and
investments in intangible assets, namely the costs of purchasing new software up to a maximum of
€40,000. Micro and small enterprises can receive up to 50 percent or a maximum of €250,000, medium-
sized enterprises up to 40 percent or a maximum of €200,000, and companies from the transport sector
up to 30 percent or a maximum of €150,000.

Project selection involves the following stages:
            1. Development of calls by the agent (SEF). Proposal for calls has to be confirmed by
                intermediate bodies (Ministry of Economy) and managing authority.
            2. SEF publishes the call, which remains open for six weeks.
            3. Submission of applications (postal) to SEF.
            4. Provision of guidance (email, phone) to applicants by SEF.
            5. SEF registers applications.
            6. SEF carries out the assessment process. Eligibility and quality of proposal are checked
                simultaneously.
            7. A group of SEF staff members prepares proposal for selection.
            8. The intermediate body (Ministry of Economy) checks the proposed projects as well.
            9. If the intermediate body agrees with the proposal, the SEF informs successful and
                unsuccessful applicants. Assessment results are also published online.

    Applications must contain:
        The registration form, which can be found online
            (http://www.podjetniskisklad.si/elektronski-prijavni-obrazci.html) and needs to be
            submitted in printed form;
        A signed declaration on the number of employees on the last day of the month preceding
            the application;
        A business plan including an analysis of the two previous years, an outlook on future
            operations for at least three years and a certified balance sheet for the current year;
        A proof of creditworthiness (not older than 30 days);
        A list of the costs of the planned operations, accompanied by quotes and other supporting
            documents. The supporting documents are the basis for the assessment of the operation;
            and
        A bank statement confirming a bank guarantee equal to 30 percent of the funding amount.

The calls are open for one to three months and applications are processed very quickly. The 2009 call
was published on 13 March 2009, the submission deadline was on 24 April 2009 and the conclusion of
co-financed operations was expected by 30 March 2011. The 2013 call was published on 21 June 2013

                                                                                                     286
and ran until 5 September 2013. In terms of workload for the SEF incurred by the assessment process,
the registration of an application takes 10 minutes, while the whole assessment process takes 4-6 hours.

Procedures have continuously been adjusted for each call, albeit only to a minor extent. For instance,
the number of criteria was reduced from 8 to 7 (see below). Most other changes were due to the
changing implementation rules and conditions set by the responsible intermediate body.

Selection Criteria and Indicators
Under Measure 1.2 ‘Promotion of entrepreneurship’ (in parts), beneficiaries need to be an SME. They
can be micro companies (between 1 and 9 employees and annual turnover and/or annual total assets
not exceeding €2million), small companies (between 1 and less than 50 employees and annual turnover
and/or annual total assets not exceeding €10 million), or medium-sized companies (between 1 and less
than 250 employees, with annual turnover less than €50million and/or annual total assets not exceeding
€43 million).

A limited number of selection criteria are used, and projects are awarded scores under each of them
based on indicators. The last call carried out in 2013 involved seven appraisal criteria with different
maximum points awarded (see table):

 Market orientation in conjunction with a new project                                              10
 Impact of investment on the environment                                                           10
 Total                                                                                           100

Points are awarded to applications on the basis of specific indicators for each criterion . For instance,
full points (15) for ‘Innovativeness’ are awarded when the company has developed a new product /
service. If there is only an improvement of a product / service, the company receives 10 points. If there
is no new or improved product / service, the application receives 0 points. In the case of ‘Introduction of
modern technology related to new / improved products / services’, the applicant receives points on the
basis of a combination of whether there is a new / improved product / service and whether it is based
on an innovation developed internally or externally. This applicant then receives 25, 17, 12, 5 or no
points at all.

When the call was launched for the first time, the number of employees in company (5 points) was
also a criterion. This has been abolished later on, because this gave medium-sized companies an
advantage. Also, it was found that new technology and additional employment do not necessary go
together. The 5 points were moved to “Impact of investment on the environment,” which increased
from a maximum of 5 to 10 points.




                                                                                                       287
In order to receive support, the minimum threshold was 60 points. If there were more projects scoring
above 60 points than there were available funds, those with the most points were selected for co-
financing. If more applications would receive the same number of points, those with a higher score
under criterion ‘Increase in added value per employee (average in years 2008 and 2012)’ would be
selected. If even this would not enable a final ranking of projects, projects would be prioritized
according to the highest number of points under the following criteria: ‘The introduction of modern
technology in conjunction with new or radically improved products / services’, then ‘Innovativeness in
connection with a project’, ‘Project impact on competitiveness of a company / applicant’, ‘Direct sales
outside Slovenia (average of years 2008 and 2012)’ and, in the end, ‘Market orientation in conjunction
with a new project’. Selected projects can only obtain full co-financing as requested. If this is not
possible, the remaining sources were not used.

In terms of monitoring, projects need to report regularly to the agent and indicators are collected at
project level. These include value added per employee, number of jobs created, direct sales, additional
income and profit. Sales and value added are part of on-the-spot checks.

Performance Assessment
The calls were very successful and allowed for the fast absorption of funds. In case of the call from 13
March 2009, 492 applications were submitted, 232 (47 percent) of which were selected. The call of 21
June 2013 resulted in the selection of 173 projects with a total funding of €31.1 million.

Strategic fit is assured via the appraisal criteria, which are derived from the OP as the main strategic
document. The strategic dimension features strongly in the tender documents. The aim of the tender is
to increase the value added per employee, which corresponds to the aims set out in the program. For
Priority 1 the impact indicator is ‘Increase in value added per employee in companies receiving financial
support’ and the target for 2013 was an increase by 8 to 10 percent (however, results were not available
at the time of writing). A general analysis of the effects of the instrument conducted by the SEF based
on recipient information shows that some companies were not able to achieve their targets due to the
economic crisis. However, it is considered that the upgrading of equipment undertaken by some
companies will also have a positive impact in terms of competitiveness and value added.

Main Lessons
Competitive calls are generally found to be highly suitable but high levels of selectivity give rise to
criticism. The calls allow selecting the best projects in a fast and transparent way. However, in each call
about two thirds of applications had to be rejected, of which a lot were nevertheless good projects. This
creates frustration and criticism among rejected applicants. The threshold to be selected for funding had
to be raised over time due to the high quality of applications.

There are, nevertheless, some disadvantages to the use of competitive calls, notably relating to the
administrative burden and the high level of selectivity. Time and workload pressures for involved staff
are high due to applications coming in all at the same time. Due to the high quality of applications many
good projects had to be rejected, causing frustration among rejected applicants.

Several recommendations apply pertaining to simplification and capacity needs. It is advised to keep
tender documents simple and to define clearly what costs are eligible. More generally, application
procedures should be made as simple as possible for potential beneficiaries. Finally, a good team is
needed that can cover the workload of dealing with c. 500 applications all at once and come to decisions
within 90 days.

                                                                                                       288
In conclusion, the project selection model applicable to this OP in Slovenia is seen as a useful way to
select the best projects in a fast and transparent way. Hence, it will be continued (albeit for other
measures) in the forthcoming 2014-20 programming period. However, there are concerns about how to
deal with rejected applicants, especially if they represent good projects worth receiving funding.



United Kingdom – West Wales and the Valleys ERDF Convergence Programme 2007-13: Open Calls
under the Sustainable Transport Strategic Framework
This case study focuses on open calls used to deliver the West Wales and the Valleys Convergence OP
in the field of sustainable transport. Projects are selected in the context of Strategic Frameworks in a
two-step approach (Expression of Interest followed by detailed proposal), using selection and
prioritization criteria. Evidence shows that, while the Strategic Frameworks have helped select
appropriate projects in an efficient way, their influence on project content and scope has been more
limited.

Context
In the United Kingdom, Structural Funds’ management is a devolved responsibility. In Wales, two ERDF
and two ESF OPs are managed by the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO), which under the Welsh
Government. In 2007-13, Wales was awarded around €2.24 billion of EU Structural Funds across the
Convergence and Regional Competitiveness and Employment Programmes. The following table gives an
overview of the funding allocated to the six priorities supported by the West Wales and the Valleys ERDF
Convergence OP.

Commitments are over 100% for most priorities, while payments have been progressing at a slower
rate. By the end of 2012, 103% of the allocation available under the program was committed. The
commitment was highest under Priority 5 at 120%. The percentages for Priorities 1 and 3 stood at 113%
and 114%, respectively, and for Priorities 2 and 4 at 75% and 91%, respectively, while the percentage for
Priority 6 was 47%. The total payments were at 34%.

Projects are selected via two selection models. First, WEFO operates open calls for project proposals
under both the Convergence and the Regional Competitiveness and Employment (RCE) programs. Under
these, organizations from the public, private, and third sectors can apply for funding, as a lead project
sponsor, by submitting project bids directly to, and for assessment by, the managing authority, WEFO.
Second, organizations can participate as partners, joint sponsors of projects, or (where the Welsh
Government is the lead project sponsor) by bidding to deliver specific activities of approved projects, in
response to procurement notices published on the Welsh Assembly Government’s Sell2Wales website.

The present case study will be looking at the first route, where Strategic Frameworks are used to ‘help
guide the project activities taken forward by sponsor applicants’ and “to assist WEFO in selecting and
prioritizing projects.” Projects are also assessed against generic Selection and Prioritization Criteria that
apply to all projects submitted under the open call system.

Project Selection Model and Procedures – Open Calls organized in the Context of Strategic Frameworks
Strategic Frameworks are overarching planning documents. They were introduced at the start of the
2007-13 programming period, defined as “plans to achieve a particular strategic purpose by means of
interventions that are strategically linked.” They comprise: five Spatial Frameworks covering the
delivery of spatially-focused ERDF themes in the six Wales Spatial Plan Areas, and 15 Thematic
Frameworks covering the delivery of the Priorities and Themes in the ERDF and ESF programs. For ERDF
programs, there are thematic and spatially driven Strategic Frameworks addressing the areas of business
finance and enterprise, ICT, R&D and innovation, community regeneration, sustainable transport, and
the environment. For ESF programs, there are thematic frameworks addressing the areas of
employment and skills, supporting young people, promoting gender equality, and improving public
services. This case study examines the Sustainable Transport Strategic Framework.

Strategic Frameworks provide an operational strategy intended to help focus support on the types of
interventions that deliver best on program priorities. A total of 20 thematic and spatially-driven
Strategic Frameworks have been developed in partnership, to:
     improve impact on growth and jobs;
     strengthen strategic alignment between EU and Welsh Government policies;
     encourage more ”joined up” action;
     assist in reducing the overall volume of projects; and
     help shape and balance program delivery.

The Frameworks have two specific purposes: to guide project applicants on the strategic approach that
partners in Wales have agreed upon to deliver on the aims objectives and targets of the Operational
Programmes, and to help identify the extent to which project proposals will contribute to these; and to
assist the managing authority in selecting and prioritizing projects.

There are three stages involved in applying for EU funding as a lead project sponsor under the open
call system:
     1. Preliminary exploratory activity: Applicants must ensure that their project is eligible for grant
         support by first checking eligibility rules, project and selection criteria, and other guidance
         provided by the managing authority. They should also ensure that the proposed project fits
         within the relevant Strategic Framework (the operational strategy that focuses on the types of
         intervention that are considered to best deliver on the program priorities). These are available
         for applicants to browse or download from the managing authority’s website. Applicants must
         then take part in Collaborative Planning, where the project idea is discussed with stakeholders,

                                                                                                         290
      partners, and potential partners or match-funders, particularly those who have similar concepts
      they intend to pursue. This is facilitated through the managing authority’s website, which has a
      Project Idea section, where other project ideas can be viewed and the applicant’s own idea can
      be posted for feedback. Applicants must be prepared to evidence that this collaborative
      planning has taken place – i.e., that they have examined relevant project ideas on the website,
      that they have discussed the proposal with other organizations seeking to operate in the same
      or a similar way, and that they have carried out substantial discussions with major stakeholders
      and secured their support. The applicant can then request to submit an Expression of Interest
      (EoI) to the managing authority.
   2. Submission of an Expression of Interest to WEFO: The applicant must make a request to submit
      an Expression of Interest (EoI) on the managing authority website. In response to the request to
      submit an EoI, the relevant Project Development Officer (PDO) in the managing authority will
      contact the applicant and work with them to make progress on their EoI. The decision to
      progress, defer, or reject an EOI rests with the Priority Controller within the managing authority,
      who makes a decision based on the recommendations of the PDO. If the request is successful,
      the Project Development Officer will contact the applicant to discuss the proposal and guide her
      through the rest of the process. Following formal submission of the EoI, which provides enough
      information for the managing authority to judge whether a more detailed project assessment is
      appropriate, the managing authority will carry out an initial assessment against specified
      Selection and Prioritization Criteria. A decision will be made to either: take the proposal forward
      to the next stage of full assessment; hold it on “reserve status” pending further information or
      wider program management considerations; or reject it.
   3. Submission of a detailed project proposal for full assessment: At this stage, the applicant is
      asked to produce a more detailed Delivery Plan, which will be considered against the Selection
      and Prioritization Criteria. The PDO will work with the applicant to clarify project details and
      identify any risks or conditions that will need to be covered. Experts may also be called to assess
      points of detail in the proposal and to provide evidence in support of judgments made. The
      managing authority will issue a formal decision on whether support can be offered. If support is
      offered, a detailed letter of approval will be issued.

Over the life of the program, as conditions change, operational strategies set out in the Strategic
Framework documents may need to change too. Therefore, each Framework is subject to ongoing
monitoring, evaluation, and review. For example, the Frameworks were modified as a result of the
introduction of the Welsh Government’s new Economic Renewal Programme in 2010. Changes to the
approach are planned for 2014-20 (see below).

Selection Criteria and Indicators - Sustainable Transport Strategic Framework
Sustainable Transport is covered by Theme 2, including the majority of funding under Priority 3 of the
ERDF Convergence Programme. According to the OP, funding allocated to this theme was expected to
total around 80% of that allocated to the priority.

The Strategic Frameworks are intended to guide prospective project applications as well as the
managing authority. The Strategic Framework for Sustainable Transport was developed jointly by the
Welsh Government and the Welsh Local Government Association. Other partners were also involved,
including regional transport consortia and Wales Spatial Plan Action Groups. It was also developed in
parallel with the Wales Transport Strategy (WEFO, 2011). The Strategic Framework is an operational

sustainable transport, and examples of the type of strategic intervention which are likely to be taken

                                                                                                     291
forward under the theme. It also provides background detail on the spatial and financial context for the
theme, and on key principles and regulations affecting activity under the theme. The Strategic
Framework document also provides some guidance on eligibility issues and on the types of project that
will be given priority, for example:
      Priority will be given to schemes that promote agglomeration effects;
      Priority will be given to innovative schemes that serve as exemplars or models of best practice in
         sustainable transport solutions.
It also outlines activities that will not be supported (e.g., projects that are commercially viable without
support). Project proposals then go on to be assessed against a standard set of selection criteria which
apply to all projects submitted in response to the open calls. The selection criteria are published on the
managing authority’s website.

The Selection and Prioritization Criteria matrix introduced in 2007-13 was so-called to emphasize that
projects are appraised against each other, i.e., it is a competitive approach, and that projects will be
ranked according to their score. The matrix (see below) outlines a set of positive criteria (“contribution
factors”) and a set of risk factors (“certainty factors”), and projects are ranked using this matrix. Projects
score between 1-5 on the degree of fit and risks. Judgment on scoring is informed by experts. Specialist
software is used to score each of the benefits and risk criteria, weigh them against each other, give a
score to the project, and rank all projects against each other.

Projects are appraised against the Selection and Prioritization Criteria, while additional appraisal
guidelines also exist that are used to different degrees (for example, the UK central government’s
Green Book guidelines that apply to spending by central government departments and agencies rather
than devolved entities, and Welsh Audit Office definitions). The basic principles of the Green Book are
based on sound challenge to the perceived need for a project in the first place, whether the objectives
can be achieved in any other way through an options appraisal, and, where appropriate, a form of cost-
benefit analysis. The key phrase “where appropriate” is related to the size of the project, its degree of
complexity, its novelty, or a combination of those factors. The time and cost of making a full cost-benefit
analysis must be set against the potential advantages that can be obtained through the results. The
Welsh Audit Office defines its expectations for sound project appraisal around several issues. First, there
needs to be an assessment of whether a bid or proposed project is worthwhile, considering its
objectives, the various options available, their costs and benefits, and the risks and uncertainties. This
assessment has to be done before a decision to apply for (or award) funding is made, as it helps ensure
that: proposed projects meet the objectives; funding is actually needed for the project to go ahead;
financial propriety over public money is observed; value for money and sustainable development will be
achieved; and appropriate management arrangements are in place to deliver results and monitor
progress.

The managing authority in Wales has worked extensively on developing the monitoring system for the
2007-13 period and indicators have been streamlined as compared to the 2000-06 period. The
approach taken to monitoring in Wales includes monitoring the context within which the program is
being implemented as well as monitoring the specific and attributable outputs and results of the
program against which projects will report. The OPs contain high-level tracking indicators (context
indicators) and program indicators (at priority level and aggregated to program level). The high-level
tracking indicators were derived from the Lisbon indicators and the Welsh Government’s domestic
economic development strategy. They are reported against in Annual Implementation Reports (AIRs).
Monitoring indicators at priority level are included in the OPs (regarding outputs and results). Impact
indicators are also included in the OPs, but these are assessed through evaluation rather than

                                                                                                          292
monitoring. Some indicators are quantified to give targets. Progress against targets is also reported in
the AIRs. In addition, analyses of program-level monitoring information is undertaken by the managing
authority and reported to the Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC).

Indicators were developed by the managing authority using a project logic chain approach, with
output, results, and impact indicators for the activities, objectives and aims of the priorities . In this
way, it is considered that indicators are clearly linked to the OPs and to each other. Projects must select

                                                                                                       293
relevant indicators from the OPs and detail within their monitoring plans how they intend to collect and
process monitoring data. The managing authority has produced guidance that provides definitions and
details of evidence requirements for the ERDF monitoring and evaluation indicators. Successful
applicants must submit a detailed ‘Delivery Profile’ that includes all indicators and associated targets.
This is submitted to WEFO online. Projects are encouraged to collect information beyond what they are
required to report to the managing authority, which could be used in the project-level evaluations. The
Strategic Framework for Sustainable Transport highlights the indicators considered most relevant. These
are as follows:

Performance Assessment and Main Lessons
The Strategic Frameworks have helped select appropriate projects in an efficient way without,
however, triggering in-depth change in project content or scope. A 2011 evaluation of the delivery of
Structural Funds in Wales concluded that the Strategic Frameworks have “served their purpose” and
been useful in assisting WEFO staff to assess individual projects for eligibility and strategic fit. They have
also played an important role in letting applicants know what was technically ineligible and not in
alignment with the policy. However, the Strategic Frameworks were found to have had a limited role in
the post approval stage. While they were seen to have had a positive influence in guiding applicants
toward desired areas of activity, playing a role in reducing duplication and competition between
projects, they have not fundamentally influenced or altered the design, spatial location or coverage of
projects. In addition, whereas the Frameworks do not seem to have turned potential applicants away
from applying for funding, some have been perceived as ‘closed shops’ to sponsors outside of the Welsh
Government.

Specific challenges identified included:
    Getting the right balance between providing enough detail in the Frameworks to help applicants
         develop their projects without becoming too prescriptive;
    Interest in the Frameworks reduced as the program progressed, but this was probably largely
         due to most of the program funding being committed. In addition, they have been overtaken by
         other key policy developments.



                                                                                                          294
       There was (a low level of) concern that the Frameworks may have been used in an overly
        mechanistic way at the start of the programming period by Project Development Officers, but as
        experience and knowledge built up, they were used in a more sophisticated way.

A 2013 report reviewing Structural Funds implementation arrangements in Wales (Guildford, 2013)
reported mixed views on the effectiveness of the Strategic Frameworks in practice: from having
provided useful direction in early parts of the program, to having a declining value as the programs
progressed and there were major changes in the economic context. One negative view was that the
Strategic Frameworks: “did not go down to a level of detail sufficient to allow a clear delineation
between areas and activities that were a priority for support and those that were not. This may have
made it more difficult to achieve an appropriate balance between eligibility (compliance risk) criteria
and economic suitability (business risk) criteria, which in turn can affect the appropriate balance
between a focused and a more widely distributed expenditure pattern.”

Some practical recommendations have been made regarding the 2007-13 and 2014-20 programs. The
2011 evaluation of the delivery of Structural Funds in Wales made a series of recommendations related
to Strategic Frameworks. These included, in relation to the 2007-13 programs:
     The managing authority, in conjunction with Strategic Framework Coordinators should carry out
        a stocktaking exercise of projects already approved under each Strategic Framework. WEFO
        should then publicize specific areas where it would like to see new project ideas come forward.
     WEFO should continue to use the Strategic Frameworks as part of the process of assessing the
        eligibility and strategic fit of project applications. Where funds remain to be committed, the
        Strategic Frameworks should be refreshed to reflect major policy announcements.
     The relationship between WEFO Project Development Officers and Strategic Framework
        Coordinators needs to be maintained, given a fresh impetus and where necessary re-
        established.

In relation to the 2014-20 programs, the evaluators recommended:
      The concept of strategic guidance that complements Operational Programmes and prioritizes
         fields of intervention is sound. However, the managing authority and the Welsh Government
         need to consider the exact form this should take for any future programs.
      In any future programs where Strategic Frameworks are used, the managing authority should
         seek as an internal management tool to break down priority level performance indicator targets
         by areas of eligible activity relevant to each Strategic Framework and should monitor progress
         against these to enable a clearer understanding of the extent to which the desired balance
         between different elements of each Strategic Framework is being achieved as the program
         progresses.
      In any future programs, the role and on-going function of Strategic Framework Co-coordinators
         should be more clearly defined and communicated to the individuals that hold these posts.

Looking ahead, a two-phase approach is foreseen, entailing the pre-selection of key projects, followed
by a more responsive and innovative approach later in the program. The publication of the 2013
Guildford report, which reviewed Structural Funds implementation arrangements in Wales (Guildford,
2013), is expected to inform the approach to project selection and prioritization in the 2014-20
programs. The report recommends the development of an Economic Prioritization Framework (EPF),
which allows the areas to which Structural Funds can contribute most effectively in Wales to be
identified, and also identification of synergies with Welsh Government policy. It is intended that the EPF


                                                                                                      295
be constructed by the managing authority ‘with enough detail to provide guidance to potential project
sponsors, to inform decision making at the time of project selection and support the management of
implementation.’

The report recommends that, to help discriminate between “compliance risk” and “business risk,” a
two-phase mechanism is created in which “eligibility is seen in the context of a gateway function and in
which the EPF subsequently informs a selection process based on fit with its priorities.” The project
appraisal system would therefore:
    aim for the early establishment of key backbone projects that would form the basis of the
        program; and
    later in the program approval could focus on gap filling, could be more responsive to change and
        could involve more innovative approaches (including commissioning) and be able to tolerate a
        higher overall risk profile, given that the risk profile of the backbone projects might be relatively
        low.


Ireland – Border, Midland and Western (BMW) ROP
European Union Structural Funds have played an important role in the success of the Irish economy
and the dramatic rise in the standard of living across all sectors of Irish society over the past decade.
Since 1973, almost 19 billion EUR of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds have been invested in Ireland.
The Economic and Social Research Institute estimated that structural funds over the first two
programming periods combined (1989-93 and 1994-99) led to a permanent increase in GNP of 2%. They
also estimated that funding for the first three years of the 2000-06 programming period added a further
0.7% to GNP.85The government has concentrated Structural Funds on programs designed to strengthen
competitiveness through three broad areas: infrastructure, human capital, and the productive sector,
including manufacturing, tourism and agriculture. As the Structural Funds allocations increased in the
1990’s, the government increased the share of funds allocated to infrastructure. Ireland has used EU
Structural Funds to its benefit for many years and has taken the opportunity to use the availability of
these funds as a driver for reforms to its PIM processes over the years.

The National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013, launched in Dublin Castle on January 23, 2007, is a
high level strategic document that sets out, within a sustainable economic and budgetary framework,
indicative seven-year investment allocations. These cover various sectors, totaling almost 184 billion
EUR, at a much larger level compared to EU contributions over the same period.86The NDP 2007-2013
sets out the key high level objectives of investment for Ireland for 2007-2013, as follows: promotion of
sustainable economic and budgetary stability; promotion of national competitiveness; fostering better
balance in regional development with a particular focus on assisting all regions to deliver to their
maximum potential; delivering economic and social infrastructure in an efficient Value for Money way
that improves the quality of life of citizens; ensuring environmental sustainability; and promoting social
inclusion.

The economic and social progress made by Ireland through previous EU funding now means that
structural financing is significantly less than in previous years. It also means that funding from the EU
now plays only a tiny role in public investment funding in Ireland. The ERDF actions thus target niche
areas that generate high levels of added value: for instance, supporting the Research and Development

  Although this has been substantially re-modelled following the economic crisis

                                                                                                         296
(R&D) work of institutes of technology in the BMW region, environmental flagship projects, small
business development schemes and specific public transport projects. Within the agreed objectives of
Cohesion policy, Structural Funds are focused on implementing community policies, namely the
renewed Lisbon Agenda 5 and the Göteborg Declaration 6. The specific focus is on innovation and the
knowledge economy, environment and risk minimization, accessibility to services of general interest
(e.g., broadband, transport infrastructure), increasing adaptability of workers and enterprises,
enhancing access to employment, and social inclusion measures.

This case study refers only to the BMW OP. The Irish Government, as set out in the National Strategic
Reference Framework4 (NSRF), decided that Cohesion policy would be delivered through separate
Regional OPs for the Border, Midland and Western (BMW) Region and the Southern & Eastern (SE)
Regions, and through a national European Social Fund OP. These programs are part-funded by the ERDF.

Project Selection
Ireland has a comprehensive set of guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital investment
projects, dating from 2005.87These are to a large extent reflective of the UK’s appraisal system and put
‘value for money’ at the heart of the process, focusing on a risk-adjusted balance of price and quality.
The guiding principles for selection models are as follows: transparency in the process (all potential
beneficiaries should be aware of the process and criteria to be used); incorporation of OP objectives into
the selection criteria; incorporation of applicable horizontal principles (e.g., sustainability, equality) into
the selection criteria; use of competitive selection processes, where feasible; cost effectiveness and
value for money; and consistency in the appraisal of proposals.

There are almost as many selection criteria operating under these principles as there are possible
interventions. A sample of published selection criteria for proposed action areas is shown in the figures
below. The examples are all from the same document88 and show the diversity of selection criteria used,
the range of sophistication, and also the degree of transparency ranging from vague (Example 1) to
excellent (Example 5). It can be argued that the authorities are allowing enough discretion to awarding
bodies to tailor their exact objectives to the selection criteria. Others may argue that transparency
suffers and the possibility for highly subjective selection practices increases.

All examples are from the same implementation and it is notable that they use relatively subjective
and hard to measure criteria. For instance, estimating “commitment of the host institution” in Example
2 or “commercialization potential” in Example 3 is not an easy or straightforward task. In general, such
qualitative criteria should be better defined in order to ensure fairness and transparency, though it is
possible that evaluators have more in-depth grids that help them score on similar scales.

Implementation Capacity
Ireland benefits from around 30 years of concerted effort to develop its PIM capacity . It also makes
extensive use of external consultancy, which has become a thriving industry in the country. Due to the
well-developed skills of public sector managers, they are able to fulfill the role of “intelligent customer”
when consultants are employed, knowing what to ask for and holding them accountable for results. In
this way, capacity requirements are readily achievable.

In the case of the vast majority of projects that fall outside the normal definitions of PIM and might be
considered short-term service contracts, Ireland is also able to benefit from a well-developed skill set
in public procurement. Its officials not only fulfill the administrative and control requirements, but they
are required to be enablers and assist project initiators to structure their objectives and align them with
the finally agreed selection criteria. Additionally, where these skills are not available – as might be the
case in more rural areas– there is a thriving consultancy community that can provide assistance as
needed. This allows project initiators and the intermediate bodies to manage the preparation of projects
in a satisfactory manner, a recommendation also made for the Romanian ROP in the report on “ROP 2.0:
Facilitation of Proactive and Direct Support for Applicants and Beneficiaries of the ROP 2014-2020.”

                                                                                                         298
Lithuania – Economic Growth OP
Lithuania is one of the smaller EU countries and takes on many of the characteristics of a region within
other Member States. Due to this, there is no ROP and instead the study has focused on the Economic
Growth Operational Program, which represents almost 50% of the Structural Funds allocation and is
supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF). The core
targets of the Lithuanian National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) concern: (a) accelerating long-
term economic growth; (b) creating more and better workplaces; and (c) developing social cohesion. To
achieve these targets, the NSRF includes three key objectives – namely, promoting productive human
resources for the knowledge society, building a competitive economy, and supporting quality of life and
cohesion – and four horizontal areas to which the entire strategy must contribute: information society,
sustainable development, equal opportunities, and regional development.

Lithuania is different from the other countries in this study in that it has moved in the opposite
direction from the more common decentralization approach with many smaller projects. It has instead
gone for a centralized strategy based on larger investments of national or regional significance. In the
OP, five projects were identified or pre-selected, all in excess of 50 million EUR. It is interesting that this
approach is in sharp contrast to the one employed in the previous programing round during which the
country focused on smaller, localized interventions. Infrastructure has been given a higher priority for
the current programming period, as shown in the figure below.

To measure the impact of the strategy, Lithuania has proposed a range of target objectives for the
end-year of the programming period (2013). These include an increase in the employment rate for the
15-64 year-old population to 70% (compared to 61.2% in 2004), as well as an increase in labor
productivity to 65% of the EU average (from 41.7% in 2004). Another objective is to increase R&D
expenditure to 2.2% of GDP. In particular, the main objectives of the Operational Programme on
Economic Growth are as follows: increase the share of high value added businesses; boost business
productivity especially by creating a favorable environment for innovations and SMEs; and increase
efficiency of economic infrastructure.

Project Selection
Starting from the OP programmatic document it is clear that review, scrutiny, and challenge form an
important part of the Lithuanian strategy. Although a requirement under EU procedures, the document
itself contains many pages in annexes of ex-ante peer review, which contain a number of questions
about proposed interventions and challenges their realism and capacity for implementation. The
managing authority’s responses and an indication of the degree to which they have enacted these plans
are also shown.

The selection of projects is heavily influenced by national strategic requirements. Examples of this
include: “Establishment and development of a modern North-South transport link (Tallinn–Riga–
Kaunas–Warsaw) connecting the Baltic States and Poland” and the “Rehabilitation of the infrastructure
of the West-East transport axis.” What is not clear at all is how the specific projects proposed for
investment were identified as being more effective and impactful than others. Under EU requirements,
a Cost Benefit Analysis for each one would be required in terms of demonstrating financial viability and
economic value. However, this would not demonstrate how the projects indicated in the OP would be
better than other potential projects not mentioned. No indication is given as to how these projects were

Much like other Member States, Lithuania has two basic models for intervention. First, there are the
PIM style infrastructure-based projects that are subject to CBA. Regional Development Councils plan and
pre-select projects based on their own high-level strategic goals, but even so pre-selection is based on
criteria set up by a Single Monitoring Committee. They ensure that interventions are selected for
funding in accordance with the criteria applicable to the operational program. The final decision on
selecting projects is made by the relevant managing authority. This model removes significant discretion
from local entities and places some distance between the identified “problem” and the optimal
“solution.”

Second, there are projects that enter competitive ‘open-call’ interventions. These are appraised
through two basic selection tools: the degree to which the project proposal meets the strategic
objectives in each priority axis and the degree to which the project can demonstrate its capacity to be
implemented. The precise selection criteria for each axis are developed by the public body responsible
for implementation. For example, for the priority axis on “Development of Trans-European Transport
Networks” the Transport Investment Directorate within the Ministry of Transport makes the initial
proposal, although the final approval for all PAs comes from the Single Monitoring Committee made up
of a number of relevant bodies.

Implementation Capacity
The highly centralized model ensures that the available resources are concentrated rather than
dispersed. Projects are designed and prepared by ministries and institutions with relevant technical
skills. A further project management overlay is the existence of the Central Project Management Agency
that, in addition to its own direct responsibilities, is able to provide specialized project management
advice and assistance. It is also responsible for the Technical Assistance part of the OP, meaning that its
skills can be put to use in designing targeted Terms of Reference for consulting firms that assist other
implementing bodies.

Annex 17. Capital Investment Planning/Case study: Nis, Serbia89

Population:                     255.500 inhabitants
Annual city budget:             384 USD per capita (2011, planned)
Annual city capital investment: 149 USD per capita (2011, planned)

The Draft Capital Investment Plan (CIP) of the City of Nis is a document of strategic importance that
defines the city’s midterm development guidelines. It is a five-year plan of budget investments in
infrastructure, public buildings, and facilities and equipment.

This document was prepared by the CIP Working Group (21 members plus 1 CIP coordinator), appointed
by the mayor, and made up of the staff of the Local Economic Development Office and representatives
of the Nis administration. The process was facilitated by advisors from the US Agency for International
Development (USAID)-sponsored project, Municipal Economic Growth Activity.

The CIP is designed to bring together the City Development Strategy and the City’s financial capabilities.
One of important final results of the strategic planning process is a list of potential capital projects that
will be implemented in the future.

The CIP Working Group developed the following guidelines, assessments, and forms:

        Period to be covered by CIP: 2010–15

        Definition of a capital investment project: Sectors that may be included; minimal value: 100,000
         Euro; period of implementation: Not fewer than 2 years

        Possible sources of finance: City budget, the National Investment Plan and other central
         government programs, loans, donations, own resources of municipal public companies, and
         concessions (public-private partnerships)

        CIP calendar, according to which the document had to be adopted in December 2010

        System for rating projects

        Assessment of city’s financial capacity and budget projections through 2015 prepared by
         Department of Finance

        Project Proposal Form (project request) was adopted, including: (1) general project information;
         (2) project goals and strategic framework; (3) project description; (4) degree of project readiness
         for implementation; and (5) project management structure/project sustainability.

Budget institutions and public utility companies filled out the forms and sent them back to the working
group. Once the project proposals were submitted, the working group eliminated those that did not
comply with the defined criteria (cost was below 100,000 Euro or was not from the targeted sectors, or

implementation period was fewer than 2 years). Next, the working group rated the remaining projects
according to 16 criteria, with a weight (from 1 to 3) assigned to each criterion. Each project was scored
against each of the 16 criteria; the points were multiplied by the weights and added to produce the total
score for the project.

Content of the Capital Investment Plan:
   1. City’s organizational structure, composition of the CIP Working Group, and city development
       vision and general data about the city (population, economy, employment, education, natural
       and cultural resources, and transportation infrastructure);
   2. Methodology used to draft the CIP, including methodology formulating the CIP, calendar,
       project selection criteria, assessment of city’s financial capacities, and selection of project
       proposal form;
   3. Project descriptions and ratings (project value, budget share of funding, and degree of readiness
       for implementation).

A total of 33 projects were selected and ranked. The top priority projects in the CIP were for utility
infrastructure and general infrastructure: reconstruction and expansion of the local airport; parking
garage; central waste water treatment system; and a farmers’ market. In addition, three social housing
projects (housing at subsidized prices) also received high ratings.

Lessons of the case study:
     The CIP process is a complex set of activities that requires almost 12 months of engagement.
       Unfortunately, LGs do not always understand this, and after a period of initial enthusiasm, only
       a couple of employees followed through on the entire process.

       The experience of using the National Investment Fund application form for CIP project requests
        produced mixed results. On the one hand, it is a good form that requires solid data and
        information. On the other hand, many projects still lack technical and engineering documents.
        For this reason, it often was impossible to complete the form.

       Even when technical documents (for example, surveys, engineering studies and design) have
        been prepared for a project, an economic feasibility assessment usually is lacking, and often
        there is no financial analysis. Consequently, it is impossible to specify the timing of project
        expenditures. The LG should allocate attention and resources to prepare feasibility studies.

       A CIP calendar should allocate more time for budget beneficiaries and public utility companies
        to fill out and return the project proposal forms and for members of the CIP Working Group to
        evaluate and rate projects.

       It would be better to include the entire CIP Working Group in evaluating projects. Doing so
        would secure a broader based evaluation, less influenced by judgment of the Mayor, his deputy,
        and other members of the 5-member evaluation group.

       Although there is no “standard” for selecting CIP Committee members, in addition to budget
        beneficiaries and public utility companies established by the LG, it is desirable to include
        businesses, institutions, and citizens in the CIP process. It is especially desirable to include

    citizens’ and businesses’ vision of investment priorities in the city. In Nis, for instance, no public
    participation was brought into the process.

   The City of Nis CIP is based on well-prepared strategic documents, which clearly identified the
    long-term needs of the city.

   Lack of documents such as pre-feasibility studies often makes it impossible to identify all of the
    investment cost components.

   The project request form did not include a section for estimates of future maintenance and
    repair, investment maintenance, and operating costs of the projects. As a result, except for
    2010, this information was not collected, making it impossible to evaluate the impact of future
    annual costs on the city budget.

   Midterm budget projections (for five years) often are unreliable due to uncertain fiscal and
    monetary policies and an unpredictable inflation growth. It also is impossible to rely on such
    sources of revenue as donations and funds provided by central ministries.

   CIP preparation and adoption often depend on the distribution of political power in the City
    Assembly. Obstruction by political parties has occurred. To overcome such obstacles, a clear CIP
    methodology must be in place.

Short Description of Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations in Romania
Own Revenues: first tier local government revenues generated by local fiscal revenues (property tax, vehicle tax, company income tax for the companies
owned by local authorities, judicial and notary taxes, special taxes/betterment taxes, other minor local taxes) and non-fiscal revenues (concessions, rents,
penalties/fines, revenues from capital). The second tier local governments (county councils) have a much more narrow capacity on own revenues: company
income tax for the companies owned by county authorities, tax on transport vehicles, some license fees, capital revenues, concessions and rents, and other
very small sources.

Shared Personal Income Tax (PIT): revenues generated by sharing the PIT based on area of collection, following the formula: 41.75% for the budget of tier 1
local governments (municipalities, small towns, communes), 11.25% for the budget of tier 2 local governments (county councils), 18.5% for equalizing at the
level of the county using the same equalization formula used by the center government. This share of 13% should be considered non-earmarked grants –
analyzed below.

Non-Earmarked Grants: equalization transfers supported by PIT or VAT, allocated by counties and localities in two rounds: first round Ministry of Finance
allocates equalization transfers based on VAT by counties, using a formula with two indicators: area (30% weight) and fiscal capacity per capita (calculated only
based on PIT and used inverse proportional to obtain an equalization effect) (70% weight). From the total non-earmarked transfer at county level (what is
allocated by MoF based on VAT and 18.5% from collected PIT within county administrative boundaries) the county council budget receives 27% and the rest is
allocated among localities in the following manner:
 - 80% is allocated among localities using a formula with three indicators: fiscal capacity per capita (calculated on PIT and used inverse proportionally),
     population and urban area, excluding the agricultural land). The effective allocation is done by the deconcentrated office of the MoF and it is realized in
     two steps. In the first step the transfers are allocated only for the local government units with the fiscal capacity per capita (calculated based on PIT) less
     than the average fiscal capacity per capita calculated at county level, using a formula with two indicators: population (75% weight) and permitted to build
     area (25%). In the second step, the non-allocated money are distributed to all local governments from the county, inverse proportionally with their fiscal
     capacity per capita;
 - 20% is allocated among localities by county councils for three purposes, but without formula: the pay the arrears, to support the local development plans,
     and to support the co-financing of investment projects.

Earmarked Grants are state transfers with specific destinations: for the first tier of local governments they are used for pre-university education and social
welfare (Minimum Income Guarantee program, disabled people, heating subsidies for poor families). At the county level, the earmarked grants are essentially
used to finance the social assistance services (for children, disabled persons, and the elderly). The allocation by local government units is done generally based
on number of beneficiaries – in pre-university education it is calculated mainly on the number of teachers. The reimbursements of EU funds are also an
important component of earmarked grants, used essentially for investments – the value of EU non-investment projects at the level of local government is only
marginal.

Other Revenues contains a number of small other revenue sources – with the exception of 2010, when apparently the reimbursements from EU funds have
been included in this category (for this reason the share of this category is very high in 2010). This analysis is done based on international practice and OECD
classification and specific categories for local government finance.

    C. Cost-effectiveness or unit cost measures

Cost-effectiveness measures are often employed when it is difficult to place a value on the output or
services delivery by a project. They are also used to estimate the unit costs of production for a service.
The measure can either be expressed in financial cost terms or economic cost terms as needed.
Financial unit costs are required for budgeting or contracting purposes where the financial costs of a
service provider need to be covered. For example, the financial cost of treating a patient, educating a
student to a specified level, delivering a cubic meter of water, maintaining or rehabilitating a kilometer
of road, etc. are all useful budgeting measures. Economic unit costs can be a substitute selection
criterion. For example, the economic cost of extending a patient’s life by a year or saving an hour per
vehicle on per 1000 vehicle-kilometer.

Conceptually cost-effectiveness measures are derived from the net present value criterion whether from
a financial or economic perspective for a project or program:
        NPV = PV (price or unit value of stream quantities or effects over life of project) – PV (stream of
                 capital and operating costs over life of project)
        If NPV = PV (p * stream of quantities) – PV (costs) = 0 and p is a constant real price (value or unit
        cost) indexed for inflation, then
        p = PV(costs) / PV(stream of quantities) = real unit cost or value.

A few key points should be noted about this unit cost measure (p):
        i.      The unit cost applies to the pattern of costs incurred and pattern of quantities or effects
                produced over some specific project life time.
        ii.     The unit cost will be sensitive to the timing of the costs (increase if costs are front
                loaded) and the quantities (increase if the achievement of the effects are delayed)
        iii.    The unit cost effectively smooth out the accrued annual costs that may vary from year
                to year over the project life time.

Abbreviations (consistent with EU manual notation)

FNPV(K) = financial net present value based on real net cash flows (including all user charges
and fees and receipts of debt disbursement on loan raised to finance project and interest and
principal payments) discounted by real cost of investment funds of sponsor (cost of equity if
private investor).

FRR(K) = real financial internal rate of return based on real net cash flows for NPV(K)

FNPV(C) = financial net present value based on real net cash flows to total investment before
inclusion of debt financing discounted by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)

FRR(C) = real financial internal rate of return based on real net cash flows for NPV(C)

WACC = weight average of the costs (real interest rates or required rates of return) of the shares
of debt and equity in invested in the total value of the project assets.

ENPV = Net present value of real cash flow to total investment plus all external costs and
benefits arising to users of project services or suppliers of project inputs or changes in
government revenues discounted by the real social discount rate

Annex 22. Limitations to the use of the Cost-Benefit Analysis and the Internal Rate of Return
in the competitive selection of projects

The Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are two indicators that are now
used by the MA-ROP to evaluate and select projects. The indicators are not used to compare projects,
but rather as measures of individual project performance. They are however inadequate measures for
comparing projects with each other. In what follows, we will outline some of the limitations of these
tools.

The Limitations of the IRR
The IRR is the discount rate (K) at which the present value of benefits are just equal to the present value
of costs for the particular project




It is important to note that the IRR is a mathematical concept, not an economic or financial criterion,
and it has two common uses:
  (a) If the IRR is larger than the cost of funds then the project should be undertaken
  (b) Often the IRR is used to rank mutually exclusive projects. The highest IRR project should be chosen
   An advantage of the IRR is that it only uses information from the project

Put in graph form, the IRR looks as follows:




Next, we will provide four examples that highlight the limitations of the IRR, as a tool for comparing
projects.

1. Having multiple rates of return for a project over time



                                                                                                       385
As the graph below indicates, an internal rate of return can vary over time.




For the example above, if we set the discount rate at 0% or at 100%, we get the same Net Present Value
(NPV), as indicated in the two solutions proposed below:

Solution 1:     K = 100%; NPV= -100 + 300/(1+1) + -200/(1+1)2 = 0
Solution 2:     K = 0%;   NPV= -100+300/(1+0)+-200/(1+0)2 = 0

2. Having projects of different sizes and strict alternatives




In this situation one could have an NPV and an IRR that provide different conclusions, as indicated in the
example below:

        Opportunity cost of funds = 10%
        NPV : 600/0.10 - 2,000 = 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000
        NPV : 4,000/0.10 - 20,000 = 40,000 - 20,000 = 20,000
                 Hence, NPV > NPV
        IRRA : 600/KA - 2,000 = 0 or KA = 0.30
        IRRB : 4,000/KB - 20,000 = 0 or KB = 0.20
                 Hence, KA>KB

3. Having projects of different lengths of life and strict alternatives

Opportunity cost of funds = 8%
Project A: Investment costs = 1,000 in year 0
                 Benefits = 3,200 in year 5
Project B: Investment costs = 1,000 in year 0
                 Benefits = 5,200 in year 10




        IRRA : -1,000 + 3,200/(1+KA)5 = 0 which implies that KA = 0.262
        IRRB : -1,000 + 5,200/(1+KB)10 = 0 which implies that KB = 0.179

                                                                                                      386
        Hence, KA>KB

4. Having the same project but started at different times

Project A: Investment costs = 1,000 in year 0
                 Benefits = 1,500 in year 1
Project B: Investment costs = 1,000 in year 5
                 Benefits = 1,600 in year 6




        IRRA : -1,000 + 1,500/(1+KA) = 0 which implies that KA = 0.5
        IRRB : -1,000/(1+KB)5 + 1,600/(1+KB)6 = 0 which implies that KB = 0.6
        Hence, KB>KA

In sum, the IRR can be used to compare investments when they have the same:
     Scale/size;
     Timing
     Term/length
     Pattern of benefits

This is very hard to do in practice, as ROP projects, even within the same axis, tend to be quite different
with respect to the four items listed above.

The Limitations of the CBA
The Benefits-Cost Ratio is calculated as follows:

Benefit-Cost Ratio (R) = Present Value Benefits/Present Value Costs

If the benefit-cost ratio (R) is larger than 1, then the project should be undertaken.

There are however many cases when it is not possible to rank projects with the Benefit-Cost Ratio:
   • Mutually exclusive projects of different sizes
   • Mutually exclusive projects and recurrent or operating costs subtracted out of benefits and
        costs versus benefits reported gross of operating costs
   • Not necessarily true that if RA>RB project “A” is better

These issues can be explained easily in mathematical form using the following example:

Project A:      PV0of Costs = $5.0 M, PV0 of Benefits = $7.0 M
                NPVA = $2.0 M                 RA = 7/5 = 1.4
                  0                      0
Project B:      PV of Costs = $20.0 M, PV of Benefits = $24.0 M
                NPVB = $4.0 M                 RB = 24/20 = 1.2

According to the Benefit-Cost Ratio criterion, project A should be chosen over project B because RA>RB,
but the NPV of project B is greater than the NPV of project A. So, project B should be chosen.

                                                                                                        387
A second problem is that the Benefit-Cost Ratio does not adjust for mutually exclusive projects with
recurrent or operating costs subtracted out of benefits and costs versus benefits reported gross of
operating costs. For example:

Project A: Total Costs = $5.0 M                  Recurrent Costs = $1.0 M
        (i.e., Fixed Costs        = $4.0 M)              PV0 of Gross Benefits= $7.0 M
        RA = (7-1)/(5-1) = 6/4 = 1.5 (compared to 1.4 above)

Project B: Total Costs = $20.0 M        Recurrent Costs = $18.0 M
        (i.e., Fixed Costs      = $2.0 M)      PV0 of Gross Benefits= $24.0 M
        RB = (24-18)/(20-18) = 6/2 =3 (compared to 1.2 above)

Hence, project B should be chosen over project A under Benefit-Cost Criterion.

Consequently, the CBA cannot be used to rank projects.

Annex 24. The LHDI as an Overall Measure of Public Investments for the ROP’s M&E
The purpose of this section is to design and test a version of the human development index
(HDI) and to use it for monitoring the development of Romania over a set period of time. The
standard HDI developed by the UNDP measures development on the basis of three dimensions -
education, life expectancy, and GDP per capita - usually measured country-wide or for large
regions (UNDP, 2013). The Local Human Development Index (LHDI) is an adaptation of the HDI
designed to capture the development at the commune and city level in Romania. It measures
development by looking at four key dimensions: human, health, and vital and material capital.
The figure below provides an overview of the individual indicators collected to measure the
LHDI.

Different versions of the index have been designed and implemented in Romania since the
mid-90s. Four waves (see Annex 24A) of measuring human development at the community level
followed:
      commune (i.e., basic rural administrative unit) level, in a research project for the World
        Bank (1998);116

         village (i.e., socio-territorial unit without an administrative status) level, in a national
          UNDP report (2005);117
         basic administrative units level, favoring comparisons between similar localities or
          between different residential communities (2008);118
         basic administrative units level (communes or cities), also allowing for comparisons
          between data collected in different censuses (2013, based on data from the 2011 and
          2002 censuses).

This analysis represents the fifth wave of measuring local human development and it is
designed to allow for a yearly computation of the LHDI, irrespective of census moments. The
methodology for normalizing the constituent indicators and for aggregating the four dimensions
is the same as the one for HDI: each indicator is normalized by dividing its deviation from the
minimum value of the data series to the range between minimum and maximum (mini-max
method); normalized values are aggregated by geometric means.

The analysis is structured in three parts, focusing on the steps in computation of the LHDI, the
computation algorithm, and validating the index. Annexes 24 A, B, and C contain further details
about all issues discussed in this section. The LHDI could be computed for all localities in
Romania, for each successive year or at a two-year interval, using the data provided by the
National Institute of Statistics. The only constituent indicator that is reported only to census
moments is the education stock, which equals the average number of graduated years at the
locality level. Due to its high stability as a stock measure, this indicator will be updated through
estimations every three years.

The validation of the index is done by first testing the stability over time of the relation
between local development as a latent variable and its measurement indicators (see Annex
24B). Second, the index is validated by considering the LHDI in the context of its key predictors

   The data from this version of the index (called in Romanian indicele dezvoltarii sociale locale, IDSL, Sandu 2011)
have been largely used for the foundation of the document laying the foundation for the designing the administrative
regionalisation of Romania in 2013 (Sandu 2013).
                                                                                                                                                        398
related to extra-local connectivity, local labor supply, population concentration, and diffuse
modernity of the population as reflected in demographic behaviors (see figure above).

Steps in computing the LHDI
    1. Computing the values for the component indicators for the reference locality L and a
        reference moment:
        1.1. Life expectancy at birth (LIFEXP) is estimated for the last three years of available
             data. Its value for 2011, for example, involved estimations for the period 2009-2011
             and the measure for 2012 was based on the 2010, 2011, and 2012 values.
        1.2. Stock variables referring to mean age (MEANAGE), size of the houses and private
             cars are based on data from the last available year.
        1.3. Education stock (EDSTOCK) is the only indicator that is measured only at census
             moments. In the first three years after the census moment the same data can be
             used for the estimation of the education stock. For later years, the update of this
             indicator could be done by considering regional values taken from large surveys
             conducted by the National Institute of Statistics (e.g., Living Force Survey, known as
             AMIGO) and intraregional education stock hierarchies of localities.
    2. Checking data quality for each indicator by:
        - comparing the most recent data to the previous data at locality and county levels
        - examining maximum and minimum values. It is particularly important to verify the
        quality of the data for private cars, as this data is usually not aggregated for territorial
        administrative units (UAT), but rather collected for individual localities (villages,
        communes, cities).
    3. Estimating upper limits for each of the six component indicators (I) for 2020. The
        principle at the foundation of this activity is to consider two inputs: the elasticity of the
        means for the reference indicator to the increase of GDP/capita between 2002-2011
        and its expected upper limit for 2020.The GDP/capita in Romania as a percentage of the
        EU average was equal to 47% in 2011. Its target value for 2020 is approximately 80%of
        the EU average119.
        3.1. Elasticity coefficient for indicator I= (I2011 – I2002 )/ (GDP2011-GDP2002)
        3.2. Expected increase of mean I2011-2020=(GDP2020-GDP2011)*elasticity coefficient.
        3.3. Expected mean for I2020 = mean of I2011 + Expected increase of mean I2011-2020.
        3.4. Estimating maximum limit for I2020 by considering the trend in the change of
             maximum/medium value between 2002 and 2011:
             max I2020 =mean I2020 *(max I2020 / mean2020).
    4. Identifying minimum value for index I as equal to the minimum recorded in 2002 and
        2011.
    5. Normalizing each indicator I through the mini-max procedure: dividing (observed
        deviation value of index I for locality L, in the reference year)/ difference between
        maximum and minimum values for the whole period 2002-2020.


119
   The reference level of 80% for Romania’s GDP/capita2020 is adopted from National Sustainable Development
Strategy Romania 2013-2020-2030, GOR, UNDP 2008.
                                                                                                              399
    6. Aggregating the three normalized indicators of the material capital (CAPMAT) – private
       cars, living floor area per household and natural gas consumption per inhabitant – to
       generate the partial index of material capital for each locality.
    7. Computing LHDI as a geometric mean of the four component dimensions for each
       territorial administrative unit (UAT) in Romania with more than 1000 inhabitants in
       2011:
       LHDI= (EDSTOCK*CAPMAT*LIFEXP*(1-MEANAGE))(1/4) .
    8. Testing the validity of the new LHDI estimates, compared to:
       8.1. Measures from previous years,
       8.2. Predictability of the new value functions of external criteria (regression models
             based on predictors of urban connectedness, locality size, immigration, commuting
             etc. – see relevant chapter later in the analysis).

Computing algorithm

Normalizing variables using the mini-max method with empirically determined fixed ranges


Where :
 i – indicator i,
 l –reference locality,
t – reference time for current estimation,
t0 – starting year for the period of range stability,
tn – end year for the period of range stability
      t0
min – average of the five smallest values of the indicator for the year t0

The starting year for the data series of LHDI is t0= 2002 (the year of the second to last census)
and tn=2020. The expected maximum value for the ith indicator is determined by the value from
the last census plus the expected increase function of the known variation between the two last
successive censuses. The maximum values for the last two censuses are averages of the five
highest values in the corresponding series.

                                                        (1)


                                                              (2)

The normalization of the indicators composing the LHDI for a series of successive measurements
involves the identification of stable minimum and maximum limits over time (see equation 1).
What would the maximum limit be for the stock of education at the level of locality in 2020?
What is the best rule for predicting such a limit for Romanian localities in 2020? Answers to
these questions have to be formulated for all the indicators composing the LHDI.

Education stock (EDSTOCK) is the average number of years that people from the same locality
graduated within formal education cycles. The number of graduated years in different cycles
differs according to the age of the person. One way to get a proxy for the local education stock

                                                                                             400
is to multiply people in each educational segment by the maximum number of years of the
reference cycle. People that only graduated primary school, for example, would receive 4 years
of education. Following this logic, the computation weights (wi) for the number of people (pi)
that graduated cycle i would be 8 for gymnasium, 10 for vocational or apprenticeship schools,
12 for high school, 14 for post-secondary school and 16 for higher education.



Where ∑pi =all the population living for more than 10 years in the respective locality. The
education stock in Cluj-Napoca city, for example, increased from 10.9 in 2002 to 12.1 in 2011.
The EDSTOCK at the national level grew in the same period from 8.6 to 9.8.

In order to set the upper limit for 2020 we will have to first consider the expected mean of the
constitutive indicator function of the elasticity coefficient of its change for one unit of change in
the GDP/capita of the country from the mean of European Union. In the 2002-2011 timeframe
the relative GDP/capita of the country increased from 30% to 47%120 and the education stock
from 8.6 to 9.8. By dividing the increase of EDSTOCK to the increase of GDP we get an elasticity
coefficient of 0.071.

Expected increase of mean EDSTOCK2011-2020=(GDP2020-GDP2011)*elasticity coeff.=(80-
47)*0.068=2.24

By adding the resulted value to 9.8, the average stock for 2011 that results is 12.03 =9.79+2.24,
representing the expected average level for the education stock in Romania 2020. The ratio of
the maximum education stock in the series of data for all the localities to the national average

Hypothesis of a decrease of the ratio between maximum/mean toward the average between 2002 and 2011. This
could be the result of higher concentration of the population and of the reduction in health disparities through
regional policies. Maximum values for 2002 and 2011 are averages of the first five highest values in the year series.

The average age for the adult (18 and 18+ years old) population in a locality is included into
LHDI index as a measure of the vital capital of the locality. The higher the mean age in the
community, the lower its vital capital and, implicitly, its human development level. The aging
process in the Romanian society is inevitable. Its variation in territory, among regions or among
localities, indicates the variation in the development potential as given by its younger working-
age population or vital capital. Due to the negative correlation between local human
development and the mean age of adult population, this indicator will be included into the
aggregation process for the LHDI as a complement to one, after its normalization through the
mini-max procedure.

The average age of the adult population is expected to move from 45.6 in 2011 to about 49.4
years of age in 2020. A slight increase of the upper average limit per locality is also expected. It
is presented in the table below and follows the same reasoning as in previous tables:

The maximum in the local data series is expected to come closer to the average, as indicated by the trend from 2002
to 2011. That could be a consequence of the expansion of the aging process in more and more communities.
Emigration abroad contributed and will very likely continue to contribute to the same trend. The shadows indicate
figures that are derived through elasticity coefficients or expected ration between maximum and mean.

The indicator is correlated in a negative way with the local human development. This is the
reason why its complementary to one values (after rescaling it through the min-max formula) is
included in the algorithm for the LHDI.

Living floor area per dwelling. The disparities in the housing conditions among localities are
expected to increase up to 2020. It will be particularly true for communes that are close to rich
cities to have larger houses (Dumbravita and Ghiroc near Timisoara, Corbeanca and Voluntari
close to Bucharest, and Corunca in the proximity of Targu Mures, for example) and for poor

Private cars to 1000 inhabitants. The low elasticity of variation in the number of car per 1000
inhabitants could be an effect of the weak measurement at the raw data level: some of the cars
in Romania are recorded abroad due to tax reasons, and also due to the fact that the official
evidence is better at the county level rather than at the locality level. Data series for 2011
involved several estimations as some localities had cars in 2007 and no car in 2012 etc. A
detailed check of the raw data is necessary in the case of repeated analysis for the LHDI.

The range among maximum and minimum consumption decreased. Repeated use of the

Validating the LHDI
There are several ways to validate the Local Human Development Index. First of all, one can
consider the stability of the relations between local development as latent variable and its
indicators measuring the four forms of vital, human, material and health capitals. Annex 24B
argues with technical reasons, and by comparing data from 2002 and 2011, that the criterion of
”metric invariance” is met to a partial, but acceptable degree, according to the mainstream
methodological practices. Human capital is the most relevant indicator for local human
development in both periods of reference. Material capital tends to have a higher relevance for
development compared to vital capital during the period of reference. The process is consistent
with the stable nature of the age structure compared to material capital stocks. The ways of
using variables for measuring human development at the local level keep a rather consistent
configuration in their inter-relationships.

One of the most relevant reasons for proving the validity of LHDI is the predictability function
of the development factors that are not included into its computation (criterion validity,
Babbie 2010). From the degree to which the index is really measuring local development one
can expect to get a good estimation of its value function of indicators related to local
connectivity, local employment and diffuse cultural modernity of the local population.

The data in the figure below entirely supports the idea that local human development is
strongly dependent on local connectivity through-out – commuting, migration abroad, and
distances to the nearest cities. Higher development goes also together with higher local labor
supply, population concentration (given by urban status and demographic size) and higher
cultural modernity, as reflected into demographic behaviors.
The above mentioned factors have different roles, depending on the residence status of the
locality: local population concentration seems to have a larger impact on rural local
development than on urban development; the share of employed people from the same locality
has a higher impact for the development of cities than for that of communes; cultural modernity
of the population is a significant predictor just for communes (see table A26c in Annex 24C).

The above findings demonstrate that the LHDI is a powerful development measure that
includes information both on the four forms of community capital (education, health, material
and vital) and on important conditioning factors of development (extra-local connectivity, labor
supply, territorial concentration and diffuse local modernity). In order to test the effect of the
aggregation method on the index we used as well a more sophisticated procedure (a factor
score) with the same four constituting indicators. The factor score procedure generates an index
that is highly correlated with the LHDI, based on aggregation through the geometric mean (r=
0.98). The disadvantage of the factor score procedure is that the generated index is less
comparable across time.

The map below highlighting the development level for counties in 2012 could be taken as a
reference for the dynamics of the LHDI. This is largely consistent with another map that
circulated extensively in Romania when the foundations for regionalization project in 2013 were
under debate (Sandu 2013). The location of the most developed areas remained the same:
Sibiu-Brașov-Timiș-Cluj-București-Ilfov. This is the case for poverty as well, which is mainly
located in both maps in the South and East, and in the lower middle-developed areas in West
Moldova. Middle developed areas “migrated” from West Transylvania in 2002 to North and
South-West Transylvania in 2012.

Results of OLS multiple regression. N=2955. The model explains 69% of the variation in LHDI (R =0.689). Figures are for beta coefficients. The higher the value of the coefficient, the
higher the influence of the reference factor on LHDI. All the predictors are significant for p=0.01, excepting urban staus of locality with p=0.03. Only FERTILITY is connected in a negative
way to development. This relation means that higher local diffuse modernity (indicated by low values of FERTILITY) brings higher local development. All the five indicators that are rates
are computed by dividing the indicator values to local population in 2011 and converting this value by a ln transformation. Locality population as controle variable is also transformed by
ln.

Annex 24A. Design and use of the LHDI in applied research in Romania
The Local Human Development Index (LHDI) is an adaptation of the Human Development Index (HDI)
developed by UNDP. Different versions of the index were designed and implemented in Romania since
the mid-90s. Four waves of measuring human development at local or community level followed:
     Commune (i.e., basic rural administrative unit) level, in a research project for the World Bank
       (1998)121
     Village (i.e., socio-territorial unit without an administrative status) level, in a national UNDP
       report (2005),122
     Basic administrative units level, favoring comparisons between similar localities or between
       different residential communities (2008)123,
     Basic administrative units level (communes or cities), also allowing for comparisons between
       data collected in different censuses (2013, based on data from 2011 and 2002 censuses).

Commune level. The first design and use of LHDI in Romania dates back to a research project for the
World Bank124. The Commune Development Index was generated as a factor score from 11 indicators
(see figure below).

Village level. The second design and large scale use of LHDI in Romania was for the 2003-2005 National
Human Development Report (NHDR) for Romania (UNDP, 2005), and it was based on data from the 1992
and 2002 censuses:
         ”The NHDR is using a so-called Local Human Development Index to attempt to aggregate for the
         first time a number of human, social and material indicators (inhabitability or inhabitancy
         conditions), to measure development and potentials. Given that this is an initial attempt, the
         Local Human Development Index presented in this Report should be seen as a proxy measure for
         human development at the regional, county and village levels. As such, it does not attempt to
         use the same exact variables as does the Human Development Index and neither does it focus
         on defining poverty rates through estimations of incomes and consumption spending. Instead it
         focuses on human capacity, using the educational stock and the occupational characteristics
         (agricultural /non-agricultural, employment/ unemployment). The degree of isolation, which is
         considered to be directly proportional to the distance to the closest city, provided that the
         village is an outlying one (the city is not within its territory). The Local Human Development
         Index proves to be valid also in explaining other economic and cultural trends.” 125

The functions and design of DEVSAT index are similar both to HDI and to the multiple deprivation index
that is used in United Kingdom at the level of small areas (wards)126.

The methodological premises for building the LHDI at the village level are summarized below:127

         “Village poverty is considered (…) to be a complex latent variable that cannot be measured
         directly. It is a kind of hidden nucleus within several spheres of more or less visible signs of
         poverty or development. The most visible aspects of community poverty are location factors; such
         location signs of poverty include: being isolated in relation with the regional road system or being
         a peripheral village within a commune. But these are rather week signs as there are villages
         which are quite well off without being commune centers or without being located very close to a
         highly modernized road. A family of signs that is closer to the real nucleus of village development
         or poverty is formed by a set of structural factors as human capital, social capital, public
         infrastructure, housing infrastructure, production units and housing durable goods. All these
         aspects indicate clear signs of community development. Having more educated people in a
         community, better housing and better public infrastructure, more developed economic units and
         more durable goods in the households is a clear sign of a wealthy community. Reaching by
         measurement these structural aspects of community development or poverty will give long
         lasting outcomes as the reference structures are characterized by high inertia. They do not
         change from day to day. The layer of signs that has the maximum proximity to community
         development/poverty is formed by the following set of phenomena: migration, fertility,

Only part of the signs of the community well-being is available for direct measurement with
statistical data for all the villages of the country. They are highlighted through bold letters in the
figure below. Some other variables could be estimated by using the grid system that is already
used by the Romanian Social Development Fund.

Note: The categories of variables that function with available data and that have been used to construct the index of village
development for each of the existing villages of the country are highlighted through bold letters. Public infrastructure and

and village centrality variables are marked by italic letters and are used for testing the validity of the proposed methodology of

The same LHDI algorithm was then computed for communes and cities. LHDI 2008128 is computed so as
to allow comparisons between cities’ and communes’ development starting from a set of seven
indicators.129 Its novelty resides in the ability to measure by the same set of indicators the level of local
human or social development for both cities and communes. LHDI 2011 (UMANLOC acronym, in
Romanian) keeps six out of seven indicators from LHDI 2008, as well as its ability to compare human
development among localities of the same or of different residential status (communes and cities). The
improvement is related to the possibility to compare data from several censuses by putting them in the
same data base for estimating the index.

Annex 24B. Comparability of LHDI across time
Short presentation of issues in measurement invariance analyses
Since LHDI is a multi-item measure, containing indicators of material capital, educational stock, life
expectancy at birth, and the average age of the adult (18 years of age or older) population, we can treat
it as a latent variable with multiple indicators. This allows us to formally test hypotheses regarding the
comparability of this measure across time. The degree of comparability is established using tests of
measurement invariance (Steenkamp & Baumgartner, 1998). The main challenge in testing
measurement invariance is to provide an answer to the question whether the instrument (the LHDI
index in this case) operates equivalently across groups or occasions or, in other words, if we measure
the same construct over time. The tests are designed to provide information regarding: (a) comparability
of LHDI effects on other variables across occasions (in our case 2002 and 2011) and (b) comparability of
the mean of local development levels, computed using LHDI across occasions.

The first situation (labeled as “metric invariance” in measurement invariance studies) is useful if the
LHDI is used as a predictor for other variables (or, conversely, if one would like to test the effects of
other variables on LHDI). The second situation (labeled as “scalar invariance” in measurement invariance
studies) would apply when one would like to study changes across time in the average local
development levels in Romania across occasions (computed based on the LHDI). Any research using
comparisons of multi-item measures assumes (but often does not directly test) that these multi-item
measures are invariant (across cultures in cross-cultural research, or across occasions in longitudinal
research) (Pentz & Chou, 1994; Widaman, Ferrer, & Conger, 2010). The computation of the LHDI index
gives the same weights to indicators, regardless of the year in which the index is computed, so the LHDI
is constructed on the assumption that all four indicators are similarly related to the underlying construct
of interest (local development) at all occasions. The next analysis evaluates whether this assumption is
tenable or not.

There are three levels of interest considering measurement invariance in longitudinal comparisons, each
more restrictive than the next. The first, least restrictive level is the configural invariance and implies
that the same indicators measure the same latent variables across occasions (the variables load in the
same way on the latent variable). This is a necessary, but not sufficient condition of being able to make
comparisons involving latent variables across occasions. The next level, metric invariance, keeps the
constraints of the configural invariance model and further imposes the requirement that the loadings
should have the same sizes across occasions. In other words, items have the same importance in
defining the underlying constructs or latent variables at each occasion. This is a necessary and sufficient
condition for comparing the effects of (or on) latent variables across occasions, but it is not sufficient for
comparing the means of latent variables across occasions. In order to be able to achieve comparability
of latent variable means across occasions, a third level of invariance is required: scalar invariance. This
level of invariance keeps the constraints from the previous two levels of invariance and further imposes
the constraint that observed variable intercepts are the same across occasions (Byrne, 2012; E. Davidov,
2008; E Davidov, Datler, Schmidt, & Schwartz, 2010; Steenkamp & Baumgartner, 1998; Widaman et al.,
2010).

We are mainly interested in the degree of cross-temporal comparability of the LHDI as a predictor for
other variables, so we evaluate tests regarding metric invariance for a latent variable measured by the
four indicators of LHDI; we will label this latent variable LHDlat in order to differentiate between the LHDI
index (resulting from aggregation based on the geometric mean of the four indicators) and the LHD lat
(the latent variable measured by the four indicators). The LHDI and LHDlat are alternative ways of

                                                                                                          413
constructing multi-item measures, with the indicator LHDI having the advantage of simplicity of
computation and the latent variable LHDlat having the advantage of accounting for measurement error
and allowing for formal tests of measurement invariance.

We also conducted tests of scalar invariance, but this is of secondary importance since we are less
interested in estimating and comparing the 2002 national average of local development and the 2011
national average of local development. Furthermore, we expect that the development indicators
(educational stock, life expectancy at birth, mean age of adult population, and material capital) will
change over time in association with changes in the underlying dimension (local human development),
but their change will be dependent on other factors as well. This would automatically lead to a lack of
scalar invariance (Steenkamp & Baumgartner, 1998)

Recent cross-national research has suggested that the requirements of metric (and scalar) invariance as
described above are very hard to fulfill. This might be the case in longitudinal research as well,
depending on the construct under investigation. Consequently, more recent recommendations suggest
that if full metric or full scalar invariance does not hold, one needs to be able to demonstrate at least
partial invariance in order to be able to proceed with cross-group comparisons. Partial measurement
invariance requires that at least two loadings per factor are invariant (for partial metric invariance) and
at least two intercepts per factor are invariant (for partial scalar invariance) (E Davidov et al., 2010;
Steenkamp & Baumgartner, 1998).

Models
The latent variable model used to capture local human development is presented in the figure below.
LHDlat is the latent variable or factor, measured by the four indicators used for the construction of the
LHDI index. This configuration of the factor is used both in the 2002 and in the 2011 data. The figure
presents the size of the factor loadings (in standardized form) resulting from estimating this model on
the pooled 2002 and 2011 data. This is a preliminary model used to check how the indicators are related
to the underlying factor.

All factor loadings in this model have moderate to high sizes and two of the indicators (educational stock
and material capital) are particularly highly associated with the underlying local human development
dimension. Since this model is estimated on pooled over-time data (with a single set of coefficients
being estimated for both 2002 and 2011), it implicitly assumes (but does not directly test) that the four
indicators130 are invariant measures of the latent variable across time. The model in the figure below is
equivalent to the model used in computing LHDI. The only differences in the latent variable model are
that the weights of the observed indicators are freely estimated (as opposed to using the geometric
mean to aggregate the indicators for LHDI) and that the latent variable model accounts for
measurement error in the four indicators by including error terms in the model (e1 through e4).




130
  We use the normalized version of the indicators in these models to replicate the model used in computing LHDI as closely as
possible.

                                                                                                                         414

Notes: N=5,887 (2,831 localities with complete data on all four indicators in 2002 and 3,056 localities with complete data on all
four indicators in 2011); pooled data for 2002 and 2011; the data is arrayed so that each case represents one locality in one of
the years.
The figure above follows structural equation models (SEM) conventions:
rectangles        = observed variables
ellipses          = unobserved/latent variables (factors measuring unobserved constructs such as “local human development” -
                  LHDIlat and error terms in the model – e1, e2, e3, a.s.o.)
straight arrows= causal relationships (in this case, factor loadings or the relationships between the observed indicators and the
                  latent variable)
curved arrows = associations (covariances) between variables

Next, we explicitly test the assumptions of configural, metric, and scalar invariance for the LHD lat factor.
The initial model for testing longitudinal invariance (the configural invariance model) is presented in
Figure A6, below.131

                      Testing Longitudinal Invariance of LHDlat – The Configural Invariance Model




Notes: N=2,830 (localities with valid data for the four indicators in both 2002 and 2011); the data is re-arrayed so that one case
represents one locality.

131
    All models for testing longitudinal measurement invariance are estimated using a longitudinal dataset in which missing data
is treated using list-wise deletion (we analyze localities with valid data in both 2002 and 2011 occasions of measurement). 226
localities present in the 2011 database were excluded from these analyses due to their absence from the 2002 data. The
technical specification of the configural invariance model is as follows: the mean of the factor at the first occasion is set to 0,
the variance of the factor at the first occasion is set to 1, the loading of the EDSTOCK indicator on the factor is estimated as
invariant over time (lambda1), the intercept of the EDSTOCK indicator is estimated as invariant over time (alpha1), and the
means of the error terms are fixed at 0. Error terms for each indicator are correlated across occasions of measurement to
account for non-random error introduced by having the same indicator measured at different time points. Finally, the two
latent variables (Local Human Development in 2002 and Local Human Development in 2011) are correlated to account for the
stability of the underlying factor over time.

                                                                                                                               415
The model for testing metric invariance adds the constraint that loadings should be equal across
occasions and the scalar invariance model further adds the constraint that intercepts should be equal
across occasions. We also explored partial metric invariance (relaxing some of the constraints on the
loadings) and partial scalar invariance (relaxing some of the constraints on the intercepts) models, in
accordance with the recent literature recommendations mentioned above and suggesting that partial
measurement invariance is sufficient to demonstrate the comparability of latent factors across groups.
Decisions regarding whether the constraints are appropriate (supported by the data) or not are made
based on comparisons of model goodness of fit – if the fit of the model worsens significantly with the
addition of constraints, which suggests that the constraints are not appropriate, and if the fit of the
model does not worsen significantly, which suggests that the constraints are supported by the data132.

Results and Discussion
The Table below presents model goodness of fit for the series of models (briefly described above) used
to test measurement invariance over time of the LHDlat. The initial model, the configural invariance
model has an adequate (moderate) fit to the data according to measures of goodness of fit, suggesting
that a model in which the structure of the local development factor is the same across occasions is
plausible.

   Decisions regarding measurement invariance were made based on a series of model comparisons, using criteria for choosing
models proposed by Chen, 2007. Chen’s simulations suggested that:
      -    Δ CFI >=0.01 supplemented by ΔRMSEA>=0.015 or Δ SRMR >=0.03 suggest metric non-invariance (constraining
           loadings to be equal across occasions is not supported by the data)
      -    Δ CFI >=0.01 supplemented by ΔRMSEA>=0.015 or Δ SRMR >=0.01 suggest scalar non-invariance (constraining
           intercepts to be equal across occasions is not supported by the data)
                                                                                            2
and among the tests Δ CFI is the main criterion for judging measurement invariance. Δ χ (with its corresponding Δdf and Δp) is
also presented, but not primarily used in the interpretation of results, due to its serious limitations related to its sensitivity to
sample size, noted in previous literature (Bentler & Bonett, 1980, p. 591). Decisions regarding which loadings and intercepts to
free in the partial measurement invariance models were made based on modification indices.

                                                                                                                                   416
The second row of the table presents measures of goodness of fit for the metric invariance model in
which loadings for each indicator are constrained to be equal across occasions. The results show that
the goodness of fit of this model is significantly worse compared to the configural invariance model,
suggesting that the condition of full metric invariance is not tenable. However, there is a single indicator
whose non-invariance in loadings over time drives this conclusion: this is the indicator capturing the
average age of the adult population of 18 years old and over (compAGE). If we allow this indicator to
have unequal loadings over time, but keep the equal loadings constraints for the other three indicators
in the model (this is essentially a partial metric invariance model), the resulting model, compared to the
configural invariance model does not significantly worsen in terms of goodness of fit.

Consequently, even though the local development index was not characterized by full metric invariance,
it does fulfill the requirement of partial metric invariance. While the indicators capturing the educational
stock, life expectancy at birth, and material capital are related in the same way to the underlying
measure of local human development over time, average age had a slightly stronger association with the
underlying factor in 2002 (the unstandardized loading was 6.59), compared to 2011 (the unstandardized
loading is 3.67).

Given that three of the four indicators used to construct the measure of local human development have
invariant loadings over time, the measure fulfills the requirement of partial metric invariance.
Consequently, this supports its value as a comparable predictor for other variables over time. If one is
interested in the effects of other variables on local human development and in comparisons of these
effects over time, these effects will be comparable, as well. The coefficients estimated in this model
(which is ultimately the model that best approximates the data and fulfills the requirements of factor
comparability over time) are presented in the figure below.

Since full metric invariance is not supported, full scalar invariance will not be a tenable assumption
either, but we may proceed by testing the weaker hypothesis of partial scalar invariance. Unfortunately,
none of the possible partial scalar invariance models is supported by the data. It is very likely that
including some additional control variables in the model (potentially important predictors of the
observed indicators) would remove the scalar non-invariance that is apparent in this model. Further
tests are needed for the use of the LHDI measure in order to compare average local human
development levels for Romania across time and make inferences about such trends over time.

In sum, the local human development index is a measure that is appropriate in those cases in which
researchers use it to compare its effects on other variables (or effects of other variables on it) over time.
The models presented above referred strictly to comparison between 2002 and 2011. However, the
comparability of the measure extends most likely over a longer period of time. The measure is also
highly stable over time (the correlation between local human development in 2002 and local human
development in 2011, controlling for error autocorrelations between the same indicators measured at
different time points is extremely high: 0.96). Furthermore, the constructed measures based on the
partial metric invariance model (factor scores based on estimated factor score coefficients in the model
presented in the Error! Reference source not found.) are highly correlated with the proposed LHDI
index computed using a simpler algorithm based on the geometric mean of the four observed indicators.
In 2002, the correlation between LHDI and LHDlat is 0.89 and in 2011, the correlation between LHDI and
LHDlat is 0.86.133

      Both correlations are statistically significant at the p=0.001 level.

 each category of city: small, medium, large and very large. It is constructed as a geometric mean (numerator in each
 fraction represents the minimal limit of population, in thousands, for each city category):




 For the case of the most developed locality according to LHDI measurement (commune of Dumbravita from Timis),
 the nearest cities are Timisoara, Arad, Resita and Lugoj. With the above formula and appropriate data, the index is

Annex 25. The new European Commission requirements on Project Selection models

The new approach of the EC on programming, monitoring, and evaluation
Up until 2013, the European Commission primarily required from Member States a focus on absorption
and a number of output indicators. Staring with the 2014-2020 Programming Period the EU Cohesion
Policy is more performance-oriented, with a shift of focus toward outcomes. Operational Programmes
are encouraged to draft project selection models that focus on the specific dimensions of people’s well-
being and progress (outcomes) through the use of appropriate indicators rather than of financial inputs
and on actions: i.e., on ends rather than means134.

The result orientation of the future European Structural and Investment Funds is based on three pillars:

      a. A clear articulation of the objectives of the programs with a strong intervention logic (the
         result orientation of programmes)

      b. The definition of ex-ante conditionalities to ensure that the necessary prerequisites are in
         place for the effective and efficient use of the EU support

      c. The establishment of clear and measurable milestones to ensure progress is made as planned
         (performance framework)

The following logical framework is capital for understanding the change of perspective over outputs,
results and impact in relation to programming, monitoring and evaluation of ERDF and Cohesion Funds
for 2014 – 2020.




                                                                                        135

The most important change as compared to the former Guidance of the EC for 2007 – 2013 period is the
emphasis on clear articulation of the policy objectives. This is key to implement a results oriented
policy and moving away from an excessive focus on the absorption of funding.

1.1 Programming
Programmes with a clear identification of changes sought, concentrated on a limited number of
interventions are a decisive condition for achieving tangible results. The concentration of financial
means will also facilitate a programming process of good quality, in which the limited administrative
resources can be dedicated to the careful preparation of interventions.

One of the criteria/conditions that are considered to be critical for a sucessful programming excercise is
to have clear objectives and to carefully select result and output indicators. In this sense, each priority
axis will include one or more investment priorities selected by the Member State/region, according to its
specific needs and context. The specific objective is the expression of what each investment priority
aims to achieve.

The change sought by the specific objective is expressed in some (although the push is for very few)
result indicators. Each result indicator requires a baseline value (the value at the beginning of the
programming period). If the programme is not in the position to deliver the baseline for a result
indicator for ERDF and CF, this can be seen as a case of not meeting the ex-ante conditionality on result
indicators.

Investment priorities will be implemented through projects. Result indicators are an expression of an
investment priority. Consequently, result indicators can inform the decision on project selection criteria
because projects should be able to demonstrate how they will contribute to the achievement of the
objectives of a priority. It should be underlined that project selection is a task of the Member States;
however, the decision upon a project selection model should take into consideration the need to
maximize achievement of results and demonstrate progress (outcomes) against the targets assumed by
each Member State under the main coordinated of ERDF/CF:

       -   Productive investment;
       -   ICT
       -   Transport
       -   Environment
       -   Research, Innovation
       -   Energy and Climate Change
       -   Social Infrastructure
       -   Urban Development

The outputs and results indicators used should be the ones listed in the List of common indicators136.

1.2 Ex-ante evaluation


136
      http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/2014/working/wd_2014_en.pdf, p. 20
                                                       423
The ex-ante evaluations – analysis helping to understand the data needs for the envisaged interventions
– should be carried out in interaction with the establishment of the programme and shall be submitted
to the Commission at the same time as the Operational Programme with an executive summary. The
Member States will integrate, where appropriately, the strategic environmental assessment into the ex-
ante evaluation.

1.3 Monitoring
Annual monitoring reports will be provided for each Operational Programmes, based on a given
structure mandatory starting with the report for 2016.

1.4 Evaluation
The Commission recommends Member States to start drawing up the evaluation plan together with the
operational programme. The evaluation plan will be submitted to the monitoring committe no later than
one year after the approval of the programme.

1.5 Performance Framework
The performance framework is one of the tools to achieve a result-orientation of the ESI Funds. It is a
table in which a set of milestones and targets is defined for each priority in a programme. The
achievement of milestones will be assessed in 2019 and will form the basis for the allocation of the
performance reserve and possibly the suspention of payments. The achievement of targets will be
assessed in 2025 and might form the basis of financial corrections. A priority will be presumed to have
seriously failed to achieve the milestones if two or more of the indicators related to a priority fail to
achieve 65% of their intermediate target. An example of a Performance Framework for ERDF can be
seen below:




                                                  424
Based on a Report on Pilot Tests in 23 regions/15 Member States across the EU with regard to the
Results Indicators 2014+137, among the most important lessons learnt provided further as Guidance by
the Commission are the following:

       -   The results focus must become part of the development of the programme, which need a
           stronger and more explicit intervention logic; this cannot be added afterwards.
       -   The main change required is concentration. Many of the priorities examined were in fact an
           amalgamation of more or less related sub-priorities which could not be expressed in one or two
           result indicators.
       -   Concentration is more than thematic concentration as defined in the Common Provisions
           Regulation. Resources should be concentrated where they can have measurable effects; this
           requires identification in a very precise way of needs to be tackled or potentials to be
           exploited and the targeting of resources on these.
       -   Concentration has to be the outcome of a process of deliberation and policy choice. This
           emphasises the importance of political debate on the choices which should drive programme
           design and starting this process urgently.
       -    If there is concentration, this means that there will be fewer indicators. Whatever result
           indicator is selected, baselines and targets are essential. These can be quantitative or
           qualitative.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could
receive a corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the
technical and financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular
project, for a certain sub-criterion, will take into account where the project fits among
the various scenarios presented. For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 6 or 1 to 6 (with
one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding
to sub-criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average
of scores corresponding to the main criteria.

After the technical and financial evaluation, a qualifying score is equal to 3.5 or more. A score of
0 for any of the sub-criteria results in the disqualification of the project.


Note: This grid only covers SMEs. Once the axes/key areas of intervention are finalized, the same
grid will be adaptable to the other types of eligible enterprises (e.g., same general criteria, with
some adjusted thresholds).

2.2   Methodology for project implementation
         a. The objectives of the project are clear and can be achieved.
            The activities of the project are clearly identified, detailed,
            and closely correlated with the implementation calendar, the 6 points
            attributions of project team members, and the planning of
            public procurement activities. The results of the project and
            the indicators are correlated with the planned activities and
            the set targets are feasible. Indicators are specific,
            measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

          b. The objectives of the project can be partly achieved. The

2.3   The project’s budget
          a. The budget is complete and perfectly correlated with
              proposed activities, with material resources involved in the
              project’s implementation, with anticipated results.
              Expenditures have been correctly differentiated into the
              categories of eligible and non-eligible expenditures, and the
              thresholds for certain expenditures have been observed,
              according to the Eligible Expenditures Order and the 6 points
              provisions of the applicable de minimis aid scheme. There is
              full correlation between the budget and the financing
              sources. Costs are realistic (correctly estimated), sufficient
              and necessary for project implementation. The budget
              observes the standard model for the key intervention area, is
              accurately calculated, and the VAT is calculated with two
              decimal places. The total project value is within the limits
              established for the key intervention area.

          b. The budget is satisfactorily correlated with proposed
             activities, with material resources involved in the project’s
             implementation, with anticipated results. There is an
             imperfect correspondence between each activity/result and
                                                                                         10%
             budget lines, and some activities and costs are treated as
             “global.” Costs are necessary and sufficient for the project’s
             implementation. Expenditures have been correctly
             differentiated into the categories of eligible and non-eligible 3 points
             expenditures, and the thresholds for certain expenditures
             have been observed, according to the Eligible Expenditures
             Order and the provisions of the applicable de minimis aid
             scheme. There is full correlation between the budget and the
             financing sources. Costs are realistic (correctly estimated),
             sufficient and necessary for project implementation. The
             budget observes the standard model for the key intervention
             area, is accurately calculated, and the VAT is calculated with
             two decimal places. The total project value is within the limits

          c. The budget is not perfectly correlated with proposed
             activities, with material resources involved in the project’s
             implementation, with anticipated results. The budget has 1 point
             certain errors. The total value of the project is within the

2.4   The quality of the business plan
          a. Data are sufficient, correct, and justified. The market
             analysis demonstrates a clear need/demand for the
             products/services offered. The competitive analysis
             identifies competitors, their strong and weak points, the
             competitive advantage of the applicant (in marketing,
             operations, organizational structure, etc.). The marketing
                                                                           6 points
             strategy is feasible (it identifies adequate and efficient
             instruments) in the context of available resources. Financial
             projections are correlated with the marketing strategy; they
             are correct and realistic. Cost and revenue estimates are
             correct, realistic, and justify the financial projections.

          b. Data are sufficient and largely justified. The market analysis
             demonstrates a need/demand for the products/services
             offered. The competitive analysis identifies competitors, but
             provides only a partial assessment of their strong and weak
             points, and the competitive advantage of the applicant (in
                                                                                         40%

             marketing strategy is partly feasible (it identifies adequate
                                                                            3 points
             and efficient instruments) in the context of available
             resources. Financial projections are partly correlated with
             the marketing strategy; they are partly correct and realistic.
             Cost and revenue estimates are partly correct, realistic, and
             justify to a limited extent the financial projections.

          c. Data are insufficient and/or not justified. The market
             analysis does not demonstrate a need/demand for the
             products/services offered. The competitive analysis
             identifies competitors, but does not assess their strong and
             weak points, and/or the competitive advantage of the
             applicant (in marketing, operations, organizational structure,
             etc.). The marketing strategy is not feasible (it identifies

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 6 or 1 to 6 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

After the technical and financial evaluation, a qualifying score is equal to 3.5 or more. A score of
0 for any of the sub-criteria results in the disqualification of the project.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 6 or 1 to 6 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

After the technical and financial evaluation, a qualifying score is equal to 3.5 or more. A score of
0 for any of the sub-criteria results in the disqualification of the project.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 6 or 1 to 6 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

After the technical and financial evaluation, a qualifying score is equal to 3.5 or more. A score of
0 for any of the sub-criteria results in the disqualification of the project.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 6 or 1 to 6 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 10 or 1 to 10 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.

In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 6 or 1 to 6 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

After the technical and financial evaluation, a qualifying score is equal to 3.5 or more. A score of
0 for any of the sub-criteria results in the disqualification of the project.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 6 or 1 to 6 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

After the technical and financial evaluation, a qualifying score is equal to 3.5 or more. A score of
0 for any of the sub-criteria results in the disqualification of the project.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 10 or 1 to 10 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.

In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.


Note: This grid only covers SMEs. Once the axes/key areas of intervention are finalized, the same
grid will be adaptable to the other types of eligible enterprises (e.g., same general criteria, with
some adjusted thresholds).

1.1   The applicant demonstrates through a rigorous business plan that the
      ROP investment does not negatively affect the firm’s financial
      sustainability:
          a. The applicant has a solid capacity to ensure that the
              investment/enterprise is preserved, maintained, and 10 points
              operational during and after the project’s implementation
              and after the grant disbursement stops. The investment
              generates profit (at least starting in Year 2), and the risk of
              failing to ensure a functional investment is minimal or
              nonexistent. The data provided (and working hypotheses) are
              correct, realistic, and justified.

         b. The applicant has an average capacity to ensure that the 7 points
            investment/enterprise is preserved, maintained, and
            operational during and after the project’s implementation
            and after the grant disbursement stops. The investment
            generates profit (at least starting in Year 3), and the risk of
            failing to ensure a functional investment is low. The data
            provided (and working hypotheses) are correct, realistic, and
            justified.

            generates profit (at least starting in Year 5), and the risk of
            failing to ensure a functional investment is significant. The
            data provided (and working hypotheses) are correct, realistic,

2.2   Methodology for project implementation
         a. The objectives of the project are clear and can be achieved.
            The activities of the project are clearly identified, detailed,
            and closely correlated with the implementation calendar, the
            attributions of project team members, and the planning of 10 points
            public procurement activities. The results of the project and
            the indicators are correlated with the planned activities and
            the set targets are feasible. Indicators are specific,
            measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

         b. The objectives of the project can be partly achieved. The
            activities of the project are clearly identified, detailed, and
            partly correlated with the implementation calendar, with the 7 points
            attributions of project team members and with the planning
                                                                                           15%
            of public procurement activities. The results of the project
            and the indicators are partly correlated with the planned
            activities and the set targets are partly feasible. Indicators
            are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-
            bound (SMART).

         c. The objectives of the project are not realistic. The activities
            of the project are clearly identified, detailed, but are not 4 points
            correlated with the implementation calendar, with the
            attributions of project team members, or with the planning
            of public procurement activities. The results of the project
            and the indicators are correlated with the planned activities
            and the set targets are not feasible. Indicators are specific,
            measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
2.3   The project’s budget
          a. The budget is complete and perfectly correlated with
              proposed activities, with material resources involved in the
              project’s implementation, with anticipated results.                          15%

             according to the Eligible Expenditures Order and the
             provisions of the applicable de minimis aid scheme. There is
             full correlation between the budget and the financing
             sources. Costs are realistic (correctly estimated), sufficient
             and necessary for project implementation. The budget
             observes the standard model for the key intervention area, is
             accurately calculated, and the VAT is calculated with two
             decimal places. The total project value is within the limits
             established for the key intervention area.

         b. The budget is satisfactorily correlated with proposed
            activities, with material resources involved in the project’s
            implementation, with anticipated results. There is an
            imperfect correspondence between each activity/result and
            budget lines, and some activities and costs are treated as 7 points
            “global.” Costs are necessary and sufficient for the project’s
            implementation. Expenditures have been correctly
            differentiated into the categories of eligible and non-eligible
            expenditures, and the thresholds for certain expenditures
            have been observed, according to the Eligible Expenditures
            Order and the provisions of the applicable de minimis aid
            scheme. There is full correlation between the budget and the
            financing sources. Costs are realistic (correctly estimated),
            sufficient and necessary for project implementation. The
            budget observes the standard model for the key intervention
            area, is accurately calculated, and the VAT is calculated with
            two decimal places. The total project value is within the limits

         c. The budget is not perfectly correlated with proposed
            activities, with material resources involved in the project’s
            implementation, with anticipated results. The budget has
            certain errors. The total value of the project is within the
            limits set for this key intervention area. Expenditures have
            been correctly differentiated into the categories of eligible
            and non-eligible expenditures, and the thresholds for certain
            expenditures have been observed, according to the Eligible

             analysis demonstrates a clear need/demand for the
             products/services offered. The competitive analysis
             identifies competitors, their strong and weak points, the 10 points
             competitive advantage of the applicant (in marketing,
             operations, organizational structure, etc.). The marketing
             strategy is feasible (it identifies adequate and efficient
             instruments) in the context of available resources. Financial
             projections are correlated with the marketing strategy; they
             are correct and realistic. Cost and revenue estimates are
             correct, realistic, and justify the financial projections.

         b. Data are sufficient and largely justified. The market analysis
            demonstrates a need/demand for the products/services
            offered. The competitive analysis identifies competitors, but
            provides only a partial assessment of their strong and weak

            Cost and revenue estimates are partly correct, realistic, and
            justify to a limited extent the financial projections.

         c. Data are insufficient and/or not justified. The market
            analysis does not demonstrate a need/demand for the
            products/services offered. The competitive analysis
            identifies competitors, but does not assess their strong and
            weak points, and/or the competitive advantage of the 4 points
            applicant (in marketing, operations, organizational structure,
            etc.). The marketing strategy is not feasible (it identifies
            adequate and efficient instruments) in the context of
            available resources. Financial projections are not correlated
            with the marketing strategy; they are incorrect and/or
            unrealistic. Cost and revenue estimates are incorrect and/or
            unrealistic.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could
receive a corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the
technical and financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular
project, for a certain sub-criterion, will take into account where the project fits among
the various scenarios presented. For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 10 or 1 to 10
(with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding
to sub-criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average
of scores corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.

In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 10 or 1 to 10 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.

In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 10 or 1 to 10 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.

In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.

             competitive advantage of the applicant (in marketing, 10 points
             operations, organizational structure, etc.). The marketing
             strategy identifies adequate and efficient instruments,
             appropriate for the structure type. The management
             strategy is appropriate, given the specifics of the structure
             and the services it offers.                                                    20%

            the competitive advantage of the applicant (in marketing,
            operations, organizational structure, etc.). The marketing 7 points
            strategy identifies some adequate and efficient instruments.

             complete and fully correlated with foreseen activities, with 10 points
             allocated estimated resources, and with cost breakdowns.
             Costs are realistic (correctly estimated) and necessary for the
             implementation of the project.

         b. Estimated cost breakdowns are partially clear, complete, and 5 points           10%
            realistic, and closely tied to drawn parts. The budget is
            complete but only partly correlated with foreseen activities,

                  needs of the            companies     present    within     the 10 points
                  structure/potential (space, utilities, specific services, etc.).
                  The accessibility degree: the structure location allows for                                      35%
                  easy access to at least 2 types of transport (road, railroad,
                  naval). The activity of building/modernizing/ expanding the
                  access road to the business support structure, as well as the
                  related expenditures, are fully justified by the current

            included, the activity of building/modernizing/expanding the
            access road to the business support structure, as well as
            related expenditures, are partially justified by current

            structure/potential (space, utilities, specific services, etc.).
            The accessibility degree: the structure location does not
            allow for easy access to any type of transport (road, railroad,

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 6 or 1 to 6 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.

In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.

2.2   Methodology for project implementation
         a. The objectives of the project are clear and can be achieved.
            The activities of the project are clearly identified, detailed,
            and closely correlated with the implementation calendar,
            the attributions of project team members, and the planning 10 points
            of public procurement activities. The results of the project
            and the indicators are correlated with the planned activities
            and the set targets are feasible. Indicators are specific,
            measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
         b. The objectives of the project can be partly achieved. The
            activities of the project are clearly identified, detailed, and
            partly correlated with the implementation calendar, with
                                                                            7 points

            project and the indicators are partly correlated with the
            planned activities and the set targets are partly feasible.
            Indicators are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant,
            and time-bound (SMART).
         c. The objectives of the project are not realistic. The activities
            of the project are clearly identified, detailed, but are not
            correlated with the implementation calendar, with the 4 points
            attributions of project team members, or with the planning
            of public procurement activities. The results of the project
            and the indicators are correlated with the planned activities
            and the set targets are not feasible. Indicators are specific,
            measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 10 or 1 to 10 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.

In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.

2.2   Methodology for project implementation
         a. The objectives of the project are clear and can be achieved.
            The activities of the project are clearly identified, detailed,
            and closely correlated with the implementation calendar, the
            attributions of project team members, and the planning of 10 points
            public procurement activities. The results of the project and
            the indicators are correlated with the planned activities and
            the set targets are feasible. Indicators are specific,
            measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

         b. The objectives of the project can be partly achieved. The
            activities of the project are clearly identified, detailed, and

            measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

         c. The objectives of the project are not realistic. The activities of
            the project are clearly identified, detailed, but are not
            correlated with the implementation calendar, with the 4 points
            attributions of project team members, or with the planning of
            public procurement activities. The results of the project and

             fully correlated with foreseen activities, with allocated 10 points
             estimated resources, and with cost breakdowns. Costs are
             realistic (correctly estimated) and necessary for the
             implementation of the project.
                                                                                         15%
         b. Estimated cost breakdowns are partially clear, complete, and 5 points
            realistic, and closely tied to drawn parts. The budget is
            complete but only partly correlated with foreseen activities,
            with allocated estimated resources, and with cost
            breakdowns. Costs are partly realistic (there are some over- or
            underestimated budget lines).

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 10 or 1 to 10 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.

In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 10 or 1 to 10 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.

In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 10 or 1 to 10 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.


In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.

            attributions of project team members, and the planning of 10 points
            public procurement activities. The results of the project and
            the indicators are correlated with the planned activities and
            the set targets are feasible. Indicators are specific,
            measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
          b. The objectives of the project can be partly achieved. The
             activities of the project are clearly identified, detailed, and
             partly correlated with the implementation calendar, with the

Technical and Financial Evaluation Grid

Each sub-criterion below will be scored on a scale from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum).

For each sub-criterion, there are 1-3 hypothetical scenarios for which a project could receive a
corresponding score. These hypotheses are meant as reference points in the technical and
financial evaluation of the project. The score assigned to a particular project, for a certain sub-
criterion, will take into account where the project fits among the various scenarios presented.
For each sub-criterion, a score of 0 to 10 or 1 to 10 (with one decimal point) can be assigned.

The score for a main criterion is equal to the weighted average of scores corresponding to sub-
criteria. The final score obtained by the project is equal to the weighted average of scores
corresponding to the main criteria.

For the “semi-competitive” scenario, projects are selected based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO)
rule: any project receiving a score equal to or higher than 5 is eligible for financing, as long as
there is still financing to be disbursed.

For the “competitive” scenario, the same grid is used, except all projects submitted within a set
time interval are ranked with respect to their absolute score. The highest scoring applications
receive financing, going down the ranking until the financial allocation (for that time interval) is
depleted.

In either scenario, a score of 0 for any of the five major criteria results in the disqualification of
the project.
