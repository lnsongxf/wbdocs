Abstract
The ability to prove one’s identity is increasingly recognized as the basis for participation in social, political,
economic, and cultural life. Yet at least a billion people in developing countries lack any form of officially
recognized ID. This problem disproportionally impacts rural residents, poor people, women, children, and other
vulnerable groups in Africa and Asia. Digital identity, combined with the extensive use of mobile devices in the
developing world, offers a transformative solution to this global challenge and provides public and private sector
entities with efficient ways to reach the poorest and most disadvantaged. This discussion paper, divided into three
parts, explores the connection between digital identity and sustainable development. Part I illustrates how the
use of digital identity promotes efficiency gains, financial savings, social inclusion and access to basic services
and rights, with examples from countries that have adopted digital identity systems. The paper then outlines
some of the key risks and challenges that must be overcome, specifically in the areas of political commitment,
data protection and privacy, cost, and sustainable business models. Part II of the paper lays out the digital identity
lifecycle and the roles of public and private sector players, and suggests some key considerations in the design
of business models. Finally, Part III of the paper suggests some common principles—including universal coverage,
appropriate and effective design, and privacy and data protection—and enablers for maximizing the potential of
digital identity to contribute to sustainable development.

      BOX 1



        Defining Digital Identity

        A Digital identity is a collection of electronically captured and stored identity attributes that uniquely
        describe a person within a given context and are used for electronic transactions. A digital identity
        system refers to the systems and processes that manage the lifecycle of individual digital identities.

        A person’s digital identity may be composed of a variety of attributes, including biographic data (e.g.,
        name, age, gender, address) and biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, iris scans, hand prints) as well as
        other attributes that are more broadly related to what the person does or something someone else
        knows about the individual. When these data are collected and verified, they can be used to identify
        a person by answering the question “who are you?”. These attributes, along with credentials issued
        by the service provider (e.g., unique ID number, eDocument, eID, mobile ID) can then also be used
        as authentication factors to answer the question “are you who you claim to be?”. The attributes and
        authentication factors used in a digital identity may vary from one context or country to the next
        depending on the type of identity system.

      Establishing a Minimum Set of Unique Identity Attributes

      A minimum set of unique identity attributes is the set of data attributes that uniquely represents an
      individual, and is usually available from a national identity system. It is essential for establishing digital
      identity across actors within a country’s ecosystem and also across borders. It typically contains a number
      of mandatory attributes but may also contain one or more additional optional attributes. For example,
      the European Union’s eIDAS Implementing Regulation (2015/1501) established that the minimum data
      set of unique identity attributes for a natural (i.e. a physical) person includes both mandatory attributes
      (current family name(s), current first name(s), date of birth, and a unique identifier which is as persistent
      as possible in time) and additional attributes (first and family name(s) at birth, place of birth, current
      address, gender).23

      It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that when establishing a legal identity, a minimum set of
      attributes uniquely representing the individual in question is provided, in accordance with the technical
      specifications, standards, and procedures set forth in the law. Furthermore, it is recommended that
      private sector entities follow the same principle when creating user identities for online authentication
      so that third parties are able to confirm an individual’s digital identity with an appropriate degree of
      confidence. However, according to best practices, authentication for an online service should require
      only those attributes that are adequate, relevant, and not excessive to grant access the service. Using
      attributes disproportional to the use case puts user data and privacy at risk.

24.	 Examples of existing standards for security assurance level for digital identity and authentication include: ISO29115/IEC DIS; UK Cabinet Office; European Commission, etc. There are four Levels of Assurance (LOA) in
     accordance with ISO 29115:
     1. LoA1 - no identity proofing; little confidence that this is the same person
     2. LoA2 - basic identity proofing; single factor of authentication (e.g., username/password or possession and control of a device)
     3. LoA3 - more stringent identity proofing; multi-factor authentication [e.g., something I have (the device) + something I know (a PIN)]
     4. LoA4 - in-person identity proofing required; strong cryptographic authentication of all communicating parties and all sensitive data transfers between the parties (e.g., mobile signature)

     1. Authentication robustness - Is this the same person?
     2. Security robustness - Is the authentication tamper-proof?
     3. Identity proofing robustness - Who is this person? How much do I trust the veracity of the information provided?

     unique mobile number combined with a unique PIN and secure network of the mobile operators to ensure the validity of the mobile device and user for more secure use cases, including government services. It enables
     the use of mobile operator data and business process to enhance user security and combat identity theft.

     smart card providers, etc.) or the public sector. In the UK, for example, the Identity Assurance Programme (IDAP) took a procurement approach for their government certification program, which enables private sector
     organizations—including mobile network operators and other private providers—to become authorized digital identity providers. A Draft of Identity Assurance Provider Framework Agreement is available here (https://

 Note: Figure depicts who is responsible for the primary activities in each phase of building an official identification system. In reality,
 even phases for which one sector has clear responsibility often involve a supporting role for other actors. For example, although the
 government executed the design and building phase in the cases of India, Pakistan, and Peru, the private sector was involved as a
 supplier of key hardware and/or software inputs. Similarly, even though Albania awarded a complete concession to a private company,
 the government was still involved in planning and oversight.




34.	 In a typical public procurement project, governments contract vendors to supply a defined set of inputs or outputs, funding capital expenditures and retaining ownership of assets (and risk). In this model, the
     national or regional government is responsible for the set-up and delivery cost of the technology solution and bears the responsibility of its running costs, although they may look to the private sector to bring in
     needed expertise and efficiencies.

Annex: Case Studies
Albania – eID and e-Passport
What is the project? In the early 2000s, Albania began its “Digital Albania” initiative in order to improve public
and private service delivery. One of the goals of the initiative was to modernize the national identification system
and begin issuing passports that complied with European standards. Identity became a priority in 2008, when the
government needed to issue secure ID cards ahead of the 2009 elections. To implement this project, it awarded a
concession to deliver 1.5 million eID cards to citizens. To date, some 3.2 million smartcards and 2.6 million biometric
e-passports have been issued. In 2013, the concession was renewed for 10 years. These cards are used as voter ID
in elections and for a variety of other services.

Who is involved? The Ministry of Interior Affairs is the main agency in charge of identification, although other
public agencies were involved. The concession was awarded to Aleat, an Albanian subsidy of Morpho and joint
venture AAEF, which was created to manage the national identity project.

How does it work? Before this project, Albania’s national identity system included a number of paper-based
registers across different provinces that were inherited from the Soviet era. Rather than attempting to digitize
these records—many of which were inaccurate—the Ministry of Interior Affairs partnered with the private firm
to re-register the entire population and create an entirely a new, digital database. This was a full concession, and
company implemented and managed every aspect of the project, including technology development, operation,
and maintenance. In order to obtain an eID or passport, citizens enroll in one of 400 centers nation-wide, and their
data is then validated against the central database. Cards are then printed off-site and sent back to the municipal
enrollment center for later pick up. The private firm has added optional services to the process, including a fast-
track system that allows citizens to get their passports within 24 hours or less for an extra fee. In addition, the
smartcard includes digital certificates that can be used to access eGov services via kiosks. With the new passports,
Albania reached an agreement with the European Commission in 2010 that allows Albanians the right to travel
throughout the Schengen area without a visa.

Who collects and stores data? The private firm collects, manages, and stores all the data, and a copy of the
data is provided to the Ministry of Interior Affairs. Although the firm technically owns the data, there are security
measures in place to ensure that only Ministry officials can gain access to sensitive data.

How are investments and revenue divided? As a full concession, the firm incurs all design, building, and
operational costs. The company collects the user-fees from the eIDs and e-passports, and pays the government a
portion of these fees.

Chile – eID and e-Passport
What is the project? In 2013, Chile began a follow-on project as part of the process to modernize its national
identification and passport systems. The goal was to strengthen and automate the registration and verification
of citizens and foreign residents, increase the security of systems and documents, and comply with international
standards for border crossing. In addition, the government sought to increase citizen’s access to identification
and passport services, particularly in remote areas. To implement this system, the government awarded a 10-year
concession to a private firm to upgrade its national identity system and issue 25 million eID cards and 4 million
e-passports by 2020.

Who is involved? The project was undertaken by the Registro Civil e Identificación, housed within the Ministry of
Justice, which is in charge of civil registration and documentation for all Chileans and foreign residents. The main
private sector partner for the provision of passports and the new ID cards is Morpho Chile. Sonda continues to
provide the platform for civil registration.

How does it work? At the start of the concession, the private firm upgraded the Registro’s existing technology
platform—including hardware, software, and systems integration at the central database and the country’s 900
enrollment stations—and also trained civil service staff on the use of the technology. Citizens enroll at one of the
enrollment stations, and their data, including biometrics, is validated against the central database. The company
then personalizes the eID smartcard or e-passport and sends it back to the enrollment station for the person to
come and collect. The identity system uses a unique identifying number, RUN (Rol Único Nacional), which links the
national ID, passport, and a number of other databases, such as the ministry of health and the ministry of social
development. The connectivity of the registration process and integration with multiple databases has dramatically
reduced enrollment time to only one hour. In addition, the biometric e-passport system has allowed Chile to become
the first Latin American country to gain access to the US Visa Waiver program. With this system in place, Chile is now
exploring expanded functionality for the smartcard, including digital signatures for authentication.

Who collects and stores data? All data is collected and stored by the Registro Civil e Identificación.

How are investments and revenue divided? The private firm invested significant capital to upgrade Chile’s
identity system. The Registro Civil e Identificación collects fees for issuing eID cards (around $3,000 pesos or USD
4.50) and e-passports (around $89,660 pesos or USD 134), and then pays the firm per document issued.

Estonia – Mobile eID
What is the project? Estonia’s Mobile eID Solution (m-ID) was among the first of its kind and has been heralded
as a model case internationally. The Government of Estonia has been offering services electronically through
its eGovernance agenda since the early 2000s. Initially, the private sector was involved only in manufacturing
smartcards, and online authentication was based on a PKI-enabled smartcard and a physical card reader with a
USB hub. In 2007, a mobile operator began offering mobile authentication to facilitate e-banking transactions and
other private-sector service exchanges. In 2011, the Government of Estonia reached an agreement with mobile
operators to integrate this form of authentication into e-government services as well. Today, mobile ID can be used
on most wireless devices for the entire range of government services, from tax returns to public transportation
and voting in national elections.

Who is involved? The primary government body involved with m-ID is the Estonian Certification Authority,
Sertifitseerimiskeskus, which manages the population registry. Other government agencies are responsible for the
content and execution of electronic services. Private-sector partners include mobile operators EMT, Elisa, and Tele2.

How does it work? Users wishing to participate in the mobile ID scheme need to request special PKI-enabled
SIM cards from their mobile operator. The user’s identity is verified and a private key stored on the SIM card
facilitates digital authentication through the mobile operator and a trusted service provider. These SIM cards are
issued by the certification authority, but sold to customers by the respective operators as part of their existing
mobile phone contract. To access an electronic service offered by the government through a mobile phone
or a tablet, mobile ID offers secure digital two-factor identification without requiring additional hardware or
documentation, such as a card reader.

Who collects and stores data? End user data is stored in the country's population registry, against which mobile
operators will check their customer data in order to provide the authentication service. The mobile operator has no
direct access to the registry or other citizen data; it merely sends a request to the government server and receives
a positive or negative response.

How are investments and revenue divided? The technical infrastructure needed for a successful mobile ID
environment was provided by the mobile operators. To some extent, the infrastructure was already in place by
the time the Estonian government sought to introduce the m-ID project, as mobile identification was already
established practice in the Estonian banking sector. The government provided no significant investment in
mobile infrastructure. Mobile operators hope to recuperate the costs of investment through growing market
shares by offering mobile ID to potential customers as well as end user charges for using the m-ID service.
Pricing structures for mobile ID services vary depending on specific contract and bundling models, much like air
time, data usage, or text messaging.

Finland – Mobile eID
What is the project? In Finland, multiple forms of electronic ID have existed since 2001. The banking sector had
been demanding two-factor authentication involving a unique ID number, a PIN code, and a one-time password
since the late 1980s. In terms of government-issued ID, Finland was the first country to roll out a national eID
card in 1999. In 2008, in response to challenges of impracticality and underuse the existing systems were facing,
a consortium of government agencies, mobile operators, and the Finnish Federation for Communications and
Teleinformatics (FiCom) agreed to launch a mobile identification system that would combine the benefits of the
existing systems and be more accessible to the public.

Who is involved? A number of public service and government agencies were involved in designing the terms
for the mobile ID scheme, while the Finnish Population Register Centre (VRK) continues to be involved as the
ultimate holder of population data. The system in itself was designed by three major mobile operators—DNA,
Elisa, and TeliaSonera—and the PKI infrastructure had already been developed by the time that the mobile ID
project was launched.

How does it work? The system is a two-way authentication system based on PKI SIM-cards and the operators'
user database. When wishing to access an electronic service through a mobile phone, the user's phone number
acts as a trigger for the mobile ID transaction – the user will only have to provide a PIN code to verify the correct
use of his mobile device. User IDs are pre-identified, and a private key stored on the specialized SIM card facilitates
the digital authentication through the mobile operator and a trusted service provider. What is distinctive about
the Finnish mobile ID system is its inter-operability among mobile operators. Despite each provider operating its
own mobile ID application, a so-called “circle of trust” agreement ensures that users will be able to access services
through the application of a mobile operator other than their own.

Who collects and stores data? The VRK is the state Certificate Authority in the country. Prior to a change in
legislation in 2009, it was the only entity able to issue unique identifiers to individuals. The authority still holds
centralized population data for the country, which forms the basis for the national ID, but mobile operators are
now able to issue Finnish unique identifiers to customers directly at the store, which will later be transmitted to the
VRK database.

How are investments and revenue divided? The mobile ID project as a whole is largely built and owned by the
private sector. As one of the most advanced mobile markets in the world, Finland benefited from high levels of
network coverage, existing PKI infrastructure, and the large number of PKI-ready SIM cards already in circulation.
No large investments in technology or infrastructure were required. Revenue is collected by the mobile operators
on the basis of different pricing models agreed upon with service providers. Usage for consumers is initially free.
Service providers who use mobile signature service are charged a set fee per transaction.

India – Aadhaar Unique ID
What is the project? In 2009, the Indian government embarked on an ambitious project to enroll its 1.2 billion people
in a digital identity system that would provide each person with a unique identity number (Aadhaar) to serve as
a foundation for proof of identity and public service delivery. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)
was created to design and manage this process. Rather than hiring thousands of staff and creating public-sector
infrastructure to undertake this enrollment itself, UIDAI decided to rely on third parties to collect resident’s data with
the goal of increasing efficiency and value for money. To date, over 1 billion people have been registered (around two-
thirds of these by private firms), and Aadhaar numbers have been linked to the delivery of Liquefied Petroleum Gas
(LPG) subsidies, Public Distribution System rations, and other social protection programs. In the future, the goal is to
connect Aadhaar to myriad other public and private services through a variety of partnerships.

Who is involved? The UIDAI is the main authority in charge of the Aadhaar program, while the “Registrars”—
including state governments, public service agencies, banks, telecom companies, insurance agencies, etc.—sub-
contract a variety of local agents to complete the registration process. Any public or private entity can then use
the Aadhaar number to authenticate a user against the UIDAI database. The Standardization Testing and Quality
Certification (STQC) Directorate is charged with ensuring that the technology meets UIDAI standards.

How does it work? UIDAI signs Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with Registrars in each state, and these
Registrars may then contract with public entities or private companies to carry out the actual enrollment of
residents according to UIDAI’s strict technical specifications and regulations. The data captured by enrolling
agencies—including biographical information such as name, gender, date of birth, and address, along with 10
fingerprints, two iris scans and a photo—are then securely sent to UIDAI for verification and de-duplication. Once
the digital identity is verified, a unique identification number (the Aadhaar number) is issued to the enrollee, who
receives a printed letter with the number in the mail. Public and private service providers can then authenticate
identity online using the Aadhaar number and a fingerprint (e.g., via a point-of-sale or POS device). Vodafone,
for example, has partnered with the Indian Telecom Authority to begin Aadhaar-based e-KYC verification of new
customers in Kolkata.

Who collects and stores data? The enrolling agents collect the data, which is then encrypted and sent to UIDAI
for validation against its central database. When Aadhaar is used for authentication, service providers simply
send a request to UIDAI for verification of an identity (“is this person who she claims to be?”) and receive a yes/no
response in return---data remain with UIDAI and are not shared or accessible by other public or private entities.

How are investments and revenue divided? All costs for establishing registration infrastructure are borne by the
enrolling agents; the UIDAI only provides the technical standards that they must meet. Enrollment in Aadhaar is
free, and no revenue is generated by user-fees (although certain agents may charge user fees for add-on services).
The government pays enrolling agents based on the number of people enrolled, at a standard rate of INR 31 (USD
0.467) per person—to date, this amounts to approximately USD 311 million in profit for these firms.

Moldova – Mobile eID
What is the project? The Moldova Mobile e-ID Solution (Me-ID) was developed in 2011 by the Government
of Moldova as part of an e-Governance program aimed at facilitating and digitalizing public service delivery.
After a cost-benefit review examining various models and scenarios, the government decided in 2011 to launch
a client-side mobile ID system based on PKI-enabled SIM cards that would allow for digital authentication of
citizens accessing public services electronically. Although certain government agencies had already built a PKI-
infrastructure, the project team decided to partner with the private sector in order to improve accessibility for
citizens and foster long-term innovation and investment in electronic services.

Who is involved? The e-Government office within the State Chancellery acts as the national certification authority
for digital identity and as a coordinating body for the shift towards e-Governance. On the private-sector side, the
firms involved are the country's leading mobile operators, MoldCell/TeliaSonera and Orange.

How does it work? As the Moldovan Me-ID project was closely modeled on the Estonian system, the technical
application is very similar in its details. Users wishing to participate in the mobile ID scheme request special
PKI SIM cards from their mobile operator. These SIM cards are issued by the certification authority, but sold to
customers by the respective operators as part of their existing mobile phone contract. When accessing electronic
services offered by the government through a mobile phone or a tablet, mobile ID offers secure digital two-factor
identification without requiring additional hardware or documentation. The users ID will have been pre-identified,
and a private key stored on the specialized SIM card facilitates the digital authentication through the mobile
operator and a trusted service provider.

Who collects and stores data? End user data is stored in the country's population registry, against which mobile
operators will check their customer data in order to provide the authentication service. The mobile operator has no
direct access to the registry or other citizen data; it merely sends a request to the government server and receives
a positive or negative response. Mobile operators will have records of customers' use of mobile signatures, but no
information regarding the exact nature of services for which the mobile signatures were used.

How are investments and revenue divided? The technical infrastructure needed for a successful mobile ID
environment was provided by the mobile operators. While mobile phone penetration was already high in Moldova
by the time the Me-ID project was rolled out, the specific nature of the PKI authentication system required
additional investments in hardware and network strength. The cost for these investments (around EUR 400-500k)
was borne almost entirely by the mobile operators; the government spent approximately 30k to connect the
infrastructure. Mobile operators charge end-users a fee for the use of mobile signatures and pass on part of the
income to the government as part of a revenue-sharing agreement. Pricing structures for mobile ID services vary
depending on specific contract and bundling models, much like air time, data usage, or text messaging.

Nigeria – National eID
What is the project? In 2007, the Nigerian Identity Management Commission (NIMC) was tasked with creating a
new National Identity Database built around the issuance of unique National Identity Numbers (NINs) and a multi-
purpose smartcard. The goal of the new system is to streamline Nigeria’s existing ecosystem of multiple identity
systems in the country. In order to stimulate use of the ID card, the NIMC has begun offering networked financial
services as one application on its smartcard. Since 2013, it has been partnering with MasterCard, Visa, and Verve,
a local payment network. In separate agreements with local banks, these cards can be linked to pre-paid bank
accounts and can be used to pay for goods and services. Eventually, a variety of databases and services may be
linked to a single-platform eID, including the including driver’s licenses, voter registration, health insurance, taxes,
SIM card registration, and pensions.

Who is involved? The NIMC is responsible for enrollment, verification, and issuance of the smartcards. MasterCard,
Visa, and Verve are the payments technology providers, Unified Payment Services Limited is the payments
processor, and a number of banks (including Access Bank Plc, United Bank for Africa, Union Bank, etc.) are
providing the pre-paid accounts. The Central Bank of Nigeria and other agencies are involved in an effort to offer
bank verification numbers (BVNs), extend connectivity and the number of payment terminals around the country.

How does it work? Once a person is registered in the National Identity Database by the NIMC, they collect their
card at an NIMC enrollment center and chose a PIN number to access their pre-paid account (card-holders should
also be able to link existing bank accounts to their card). They can then use the cards to deposit or withdraw
cash and make payments to any entity or merchant that accepts the cards in Nigeria or abroad. The goal is also
to include online and offline authentication services using biometrics and the embedded chip via a POS device.
Future rounds of ID cards may include service agreements with other companies following a similar design.

Who collects and stores data? The NIMC collects, validates, and stores all personal and biometric data for the
National Identity Database. The private firms cannot access this data.

How are investments and revenue divided? The NIMC contracted suppliers to provide smartcards under a
normal public procurement process. As such, the funding for the eID system infrastructure is provided by the
government. However, the influx of millions of new smartcard users incentivizes the companies to extend their
network within the country.
