     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Nepal’s mountainous landscape and infrastructure gaps have weakened linkages in the food value chain, exacerbating the challenges in agricultural
     growth and food security. Its entry into the World Trade Organization presents new opportunities for market integration, provided the competitiveness
     of the agriculture sector can be significantly enhanced. Nepal is strengthening emerging commodity value chains, and providing local and
     international access to markets by forging backward and forward linkages in selected value chains The project aims to improve the competitiveness
     of project-supported smallholder farmers and agribusiness within selected commodity value chains. This is to be achieved by:
     ■■     Agriculture and rural business development through provision of matching grants to commodity value-chain actors mainly for technology sup-
            port and agribusiness development;
     ■■     Support for sanitary and phyto-sanitary facilities to regulate and maintain food quality;
     ■■     Project management.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     PACT has so far supported over 283 cooperatives, 227 farmer groups, 342 private firms and 16 producer associations, reaching out to 81,700 direct
     beneficiaries, of which 42.5 percent are women across Nepal’s five development regions. Project support for these stakeholders is based on a value
     chain approach and the project activities have helped strengthen the linkages among those taking part in a given commodity value chain, Project
     value chain activities are further being supported through the establishment of the Agribusiness Innovation Center, construction and rehabilitation of
     central and regional markets, laboratory equipment, and training support to the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, Department of
     Livestock Services and Department of Agriculture (DoA). Additionally, more than 1,000 sub projects across Nepal’s 75 districts are being implemented
     by PACT stakeholders under the project’s matching grant scheme; this program includes support to farmers and SMEs and contribute to smallholders’
     enhanced access to markets, improving MOAD’s IPM agenda, or the competiveness of export-promoting as well as import-substituting value chains.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Two-thirds of Nepal’s population is engaged in the agriculture sector, which contributes 36 percent towards the nation’s total GDP. With only about 28
percent of the total agricultural land under year-round irrigation, there is a scope for both expanding the area under irrigation and improving water
delivery and management efficiency. The Agriculture Development Strategy (2015 – 2035) has recognized irrigated agriculture as engine of economic
growth to alleviate poverty through judicious use of water, increased income through adoption of high value agriculture and value chain approach to
agriculture development. The Irrigation and Water Resources Management Project (IWRMP) aims to improve agriculture productivity and the management
of selected irrigation schemes and to enhance institutional capacity for integrated water resources management. It aims to ensure efficient integration of
water resources and crop production to derive full benefits from investments in irrigation. The project has four main components:
■■     Irrigation infrastructure development and improvement;
■■     Irrigation management transfer to water user associations in the Tarai (plains);
■■     Institutional and policy support for integrated water resources management;
■■     Integrated crop and water management

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
IWRMP’s first phase (2008 to 2014) ended in June 2016 after securing a closing date extension of two years in 2014. In December 2013, the project secured
an additional financing of $50 million to internalize the gains it had made and scale up the best practices. With the reliable supply of irrigation, water
farmers are now able to cultivate three crops a year. Productivity of target crops (rice, wheat, maize and potato) has increased in a range of 44 percent to 73
percent, with corresponding increase in cropping intensity from 149 to 213 percent. Sixty-eight percent of the beneficiaries at the tail end of the systems are
satisfied with the availability of water. A total of 158 schemes (73 percent) have been rehabilitated and modernized covering an area of 17,643 ha against
the end-of-the-project target of 217 schemes (20,038 ha). The project is on course to meet the target of irrigating 20,034 ha. Four Agreements have been
signed between the Water Users Association from the four Agency Managed Irrigation Schemes in Kankai, Sunsari-Morang, Narayani and Mahakali systems
to transfer management functions covering an area of 23,100 ha. Similarly, three new Agreements have been signed under the Additional Financing
to handover 16,500 ha of command area. IWRMP support to the Water and Energy Commissions Secretariat (WECS) has resulted in the installation of
telemetry systems in 32 sub-stations in Babai, West Rapti and Karnali River Basins. IWRMP together with the Power Sector and Hydro Power Development
Project is currently supporting the development of seven river basin management plans. The basin management plans will guide the development of
master plans for the hydropower, irrigation and drinking water sectors in Nepal. With the availability of year round irrigation, water and promotion of
improved productivity of rice, wheat, maize, and potato have respectively increased by 47, 44, 73 and 61 percent over the baseline. To make best use of
irrigation water, the focus is now placed on crop diversification to include high value crops, vegetables in particular which fetch higher income and enjoy
year round market. In addition, in response to the request from the Government of Nepal, the agriculture component supported the construction of 5,944
livestock sheds, 10 community crop storage facilities and provided 90 units of farm equipment including 30 power tillers to four earthquake affected
districts in the project area.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) commenced in 2007 and is now operating its regular program in 55 districts and has made agreements with 28,139 Community
     Organizations (CO). Out of the 31 districts impacted by the April and May earthquakes in 2015, PAF covers 14 districts, out of which seven were severely impacted
     as per the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA). PAF is providing support to these districts through infrastructure rehabilitation, income generation and skills
     development. The project aims to improve living conditions, livelihoods, and empowerment among the rural poor, with particular attention to groups that have
     traditionally been excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity, caste, and location. The project has four main components:
     ■■     Small-scale community infrastructure to provide capacity-building support and sub-grants to community organizations for local infrastructure projects;
     ■■     Sustainable income generation to provide capacity-building support and sub-grants to community organizations for income-generation activities;
     ■■     Product development, market linkages, and pilots to support those community organizations that are more advanced;
     ■■     Capacity-building and institutional strengthening to support the formation and development of community organizations and the creation of cooperatives and
            market alliances.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:	
     ■■     The project has so far directly benefitted 825,000 households and has indirectly benefitted an additional 47,000 households (through PAF financed infrastructure
            sub-projects), out of which 64 percent fall under the category of ultra-poor (food sufficiency less than three months).
     ■■     CO member households constitute 25 percent Dalit, 27 percent Janajati, 3 percent Muslim, 29 percent Brahmin/Chhetri and 16 percent other ethnicity.
     ■■     About 74 percent of CO members are female. According to the independent evaluation, PAF intervention resulted in a 22 percent increase in real per capita
            consumption net impact in the short-run (within the first three years).
     ■■     The net per capita consumption growth is maintained at 7 percent even over a medium-term (seven years)

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     With a growing youth population and a rising number of people entering the labor force, the Government of Nepal is implementing various programs to improve access
     to technical and vocational education and training (TVET) for the poor and disadvantaged youth. This first IDA TVET project in Nepal contributes to the government’s
     efforts by reaching out to more than 75,000 youths, especially women, the poor, and youth belonging to socially marginalized groups, for access to short-term skills
     training, technical education, and opportunities for certifying their existing skills, and other inclusive processes. The project also supports quality enhancement of
     institutions offering Technical School Leaving Certificate and Diploma programs through the provision of matching and performance grants. It successfully uses a
     pay-for performance modality of implementation. The project’s goal is to expand the supply of skilled and employable labor by increasing access to quality training
     programs, and by strengthening the technical and vocational education and training system in Nepal. It consists of four components:
     ■■     Strengthening technical education and vocational training regulatory activities and capacity building;
     ■■     Strengthening technical education;
     ■■     Supporting short-term training and recognition of prior learning;
     ■■     Project management and monitoring and evaluation.
     ■■     The project is providing short-term training, stipends to students for technical education, and performance-based grants and/or matching grants to technical
            institutes. It also has provisions for certifying existing skills gained through informal methods, and for creating a larger pool of trainers in the country.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     The project has achieved or exceeded all of its key performance indicator targets, and is on track in closing satisfactorily on June 30, 2017.
     ■■     The project intervention has resulted in about 71.6 percent of graduates from supported programs being gainfully employed for at least six months after the
            completion of training.
     ■■     More than 12,470 youths have been tested and certified on pre-existing skills by the National Skills Testing Board.
     ■■     The proportion of girls, Dalits and disadvantaged Janajatis enrolled in supported institutions has increased to 55.1 percent.
     ■■     A total of 2,109 lead and assistant trainers, 150 master trainers, 449 skills test managers, and 5,770 skills test assessors have been trained.
     ■■     Around 4,470 students, selected using a means-testing method, have received or are receiving scholarship support, and around 71,550 youths have received
            short-term training through results-based and voucher-based modalities. This includes a special window for providing short-term skills training exclusively to
            women in non-traditional trades.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Nepal accords high priority to education. This is evidenced by the large share of the country’s national budget allocated to the education sector. These investments
have produced some encouraging results in access and equity. The relatively new and small, albeit fast expanding, higher education (HE) sector has not been able to
adequately meet the human resource needs of the economy. This is attributed to weak relevance, low quality, internal inefficiency, inequity and inadequate financing.
The development objectives of the Project are “to support reforms in selected institutions for improving quality, relevance and efficiency of higher education; and
to assist under-privileged students for equitable access”. The Project is expected to support reforms in Tribhuvan University, other public universities and about 150
constituent and affiliated campuses using results-based financing (Disbursement Linked Indicators). The intervention will benefit over 500,000 current and future
students, including scholarships for 9,500 students from poor families with preferential treatment to female students, and support for research, development and
innovation to more than 500 students and faculty members selected through a competitive process.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The progress of the project is being monitored through achievement of yearly targets for seven Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) corresponding to systemic
reforms, five key performance indicators (KPIs) measuring outcomes, and intermediate indicators.
■■     In the first year, the progress towards achieving the DLIs and key performance indicators (KPIs) (year one ended on July 15, 2016) is modest owing to the impacts
       of April and May 2015 earthquakes and the trade disruptions, as well as some procedural delays in selection of new academic programs.
■■     Out of the seven DLIs, the progress of three DLIs (DLI 4, DLI 6, and DLI 7) is in between 90 to 100 percent of year one targets; progress of DLI 1, DLI 2 and DLI 3 is
       60 to 70 percent, and DLI 5 is lagging behind with an achievement of only 20 percent of the target.
■■     Out of six key performance indicators, progress of three indicators is on track, progress of the two other indicators is 60 percent of the target, and one of the
       indicators is yet to be reported.
■■     DLI 1 - A Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency (QAAA) with functional autonomy established at University Grant Commission (UGC) - is still pending.
■■     Since accreditation of HEIs can be handled by quality assurance and accreditation division (QAAD) at UGC, the failure to establish QAAA would not have impact
       on disbursements. The downside of not establishing QAAA is the perceived conflict of interest in UGC having the dual role of funding and accrediting agency.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project supports the government strategy to expand energy generation capacity and reduce system loss. The system loss of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA)
     was estimated at 26.3 percent in 2014, incorporating both technical and commercial (non-technical) losses. Many activities have been carried out to reduce the system
     losses. However, the distribution system needs to be rehabilitated to further reduce the technical losses. The non-technical losses, such as leakages, are also deemed
     high. NEA is trying to engage an ambitious program of expanding access to and improving the quality of electricity service. A key aspect of this program is to curtail
     power system losses to acceptable levels.
     The project development objectives are to:
     ■■     Increase solar photovoltaic generated electricity to supply to the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) grid
     ■■     Reduce NEA’s distribution losses in selected distribution centers. The Project has two components. Component 1: (Grid-connected Solar PV Farms Development)
            Component 2: (Distribution System Planning and Loss Reduction).

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     The operations became effective in June 2016 with the hiring of the owner’s engineer, which was a condition for moving forward. The procurement for an Engineering,
     Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract of a 25 MW grid connected solar farm (estimated cost $50 million) is ongoing.
     International competitive bidding for an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract for design, supply, installation and initial operation of a 25 MW
     grid connected solar farm (estimated cost $50 million) is concluded and a bid evaluation report is being finalized for Bank’s review and clearance. Owner’s Engineer
     will supervise the EPC contractor. The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the loss reduction master plan have been cleared by Bank and the procurement process will be
     initiated soon.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Kabeli A Hydroelectric Project (KAHEP), 37.6 MW, jointly financed by IDA and IFC including IFC–Canada Climate Change Program (CCCP) with a local sponsor group,
would demonstrate development of hydropower through public private partnership (PPP). The KAHEP is consistent with the joint IDA/IFC Country Partnership Strategy
for Nepal (FY14-16), which stresses the importance of increased supply of electricity and improved access to reliable and affordable electricity to increasing economic
growth and competitiveness. It is also consistent with the government’s strategy to deal with the current energy crisis and to attract private investments in hydropower
in Nepal. If successful, the project will demonstrate the viability of future hydro power projects through proper PPP arrangements and attract investors and financiers
to the country and the sector.
The project development objective is to add hydropower generation capacity to supply the NEA grid through public private investments. KAHEP has three components:
■■     The KAHEP component ($102.6) with IDA, IFC and CCCP funding in credit terms to construct the hydropower project including a diversion dam, intake, settling
       basins, a headrace tunnel, a semi-underground powerhouse and a tailrace canal;
■■     The Ministry of Energy (MOE) component ($2 million), with IDA funding in grant terms to support implementation and compliance;
■■     The Investment Board Nepal (IBN) component ($4 million), with IDA funding in grant terms.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project just became effective, and procurement contracts have just be awarded to work on the construction or rehabilitation of hydropower to achieve the target
of generation 37.6 MW.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project aims to support the addition of transmission capacity to the Integrated Nepal Power System, and to provide access to electricity and cooking fuel to
     communities in the area of the Kabeli 132-kV transmission line. The project has three components:
     ■■     Construction of a new 132 kV transmission line in eastern Nepal, with associated substations;
     ■■     Community-based rural electrification-grid extension;
     ■■     Enhanced rural energy services.
     The first and second components are under implementation by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), while the third is being implemented under the Alternative Energy
     Promotion Center (AEPC).

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Out of the 90 km long transmission line, Section I - 34 km - has been completed.
     ■■     Construction work on sections II and III has already started. For section II, 27 percent foundation and 7 percent of tower erection has been completed and for
            section III 35 percent of the foundation is completed.
     ■■     All four substations within this transmission line corridor as planned have been completed.
     ■■     For component 2, work on rural electrification is underway.
     ■■     Under the Rural Enhanced Energy Services component, 227 solar home systems, nine institutional solar systems and 230 bio-gas plants have been provided.
            Micro hydro construction could not be initiated under this component due to difficulty in identifying the suitable community scale micro hydro. Therefore,
            community-based micro-hydro plants has been modified to a mini-grid connecting existing MH plants from Taplejung, Panchthar and Illam, as communities were
            not interested in the MH plants initially identified. 140 kW of existing MH plants are expected to be connected to the mini-grid.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Kali Gandaki A is a 144 MW run-of-river plant. It is the largest single hydroelectric facility in Nepal, providing about 25 percent of the total electricity supply in Nepal
as well as six hours per day of peaking capacity. It is located on the Kali Gandaki River in Syangja district, below the confluence of the Kali Gandaki and Andhi Khola
rivers. The ADB funded the original plant, with a total cost $453 million and it was commissioned in 2002. After 10 years of operation, the plant’s available generation
capacity has sharply deteriorated due to sedimentation, erosion, and cavitation of the power turbines (from silt and floating debris). There are safety issues that need
to be addressed and a plant operations manual to be finalized to improve plant operation performance and dam safety management. The project aims to improve the
reliability of power supply from the plant, through rehabilitation and safety measures, as well as to improve the government’s response capacity in case of an energy
crisis. The project has four components:
■■     Civil works;
■■     Electro-mechanical works;
■■     Technical assistance and capacity-building;
■■     Contingent emergency response.
The rehabilitation program aims to: improve dam safety management; reduce the total quantity of sediment entering into the turbine passage; reduce the cavitation
in the turbine in the dry season; and enhance plant safety by improving the operation of the main inlet valves, as well as by repairing the control systems.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
Significant progress has been made in the electro-mechanical works (comprising 50 percent of the total project financing). Procurement has all been completed and
contracts signed. The implementation of the civil works component has been delayed because of procedural delays in hiring a consultant and the impact of the 2015
earthquake and trade disruption. The earthquake may have worsened the slope stability issues in the headworks area and an early estimate indicates that the remedial
works may require funding beyond what is currently allocated in the project. The geological investigation of the slope by the Soil, Rock, and Concrete Laboratory, NEA
and the Hydraulic Model Testing on headworks are underway and will be completed in late 2016. Investment activities on civil works to enhance the slope stability
and to improve system efficiency will be decided by NEA based on the results of the investigation.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
     The Nepal SREP-Supported Extended Biogas Project (NSEBP) is supported by the Scaling-up Renewable Energy Program in Low Income Countries (SREP) of the Strategic
     Climate Fund (SCF). The National Rural and Renewable Energy Program Document (June 2012) notes that about 85 percent of the total final energy consumption in
     Nepal is met by biomass in terms of firewood (75 percent), agricultural residues (4 percent) and animal waste (6 percent). The rest is met by commercial sources, i.e.
     petroleum products, coal and electricity (around 2 percent). The low level of commercial energy consumption in the country reflects the very low level of industrial
     activities. Nepal has very good potential for expanded biogas production. Biogas can be used on-site for cooking, for industrial thermal heating processes (e.g. steam
     production), and also to produce electricity in retro-fitted generators that can use both diesel and biogas. Frequently identified potential opportunities for commercial
     biogas production on a larger scale include cow farms, poultry farms, pig farms, slaughter houses, beverage industry, fruit processing, sugar mills, distilleries, hotel
     and restaurant kitchen scraps and food waste, and food processing establishments such as noodle factories, among others. At present, firewood or coal is mostly used
     to produce steam during agro-processing, where steam is mechanically injected through pipes to boil and pasteurize food or heat other items, as required. By contrast,
     on-site availability of biogas (if generated from organic waste byproducts of the same production process) could be used instead, to meet thermal energy requirements
     for steam generation.
     The project development objective is to promote large off-grid biogas energy generation in Nepal. The project has two components: technical assistance ($ 1 million)
     and (2) financing of investments ($ 6.9 million). By installing 350 large scale biogas plants (consist of 340 commercial and 10 municipal biogas plants), the project is
     targeting to generate 1,445,000 m3 off-grid biogas for thermal application and 5.73GWh electricity.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     One commercial biogas plant for thermal application completed construction in April 2016 and two sub-projects are under construction.
     ■■     Sixty-nine sub-project applications have been submitted to the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC).
     ■■     The 42 sub-projects that obtained approval to proceed with feasibility studies include 26 sub-projects with less than 35 m3 digester capacity, 10 sub-projects with
            less than 100 m3 capacity, and six sub-projects with more than 100 m3 capacity.
     ■■     The Technical Review Committee (TRC) of AEPC has approved feasibility studies of 11 sub-projects.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
This regional program has the long-term vision to stabilize and, if possible, increase the population and habitats of critically endangered animals in Asia. Since wildlife
and habitats cross administrative boundaries and because knowledge and capacity vary widely across and within countries, a regional approach is being taken to
address cross-border issues, build synergies, share skills, knowledge and experiences and build regional collaboration for the conservation of critical habitats and
ecosystems.
The project aims to assist the participating governments to build or enhance shared capacity, institutions, knowledge and incentives to collaborate in tackling illegal
wildlife trade and other selected regional conservation threats to habitats in border areas. The project focuses on select country-specific initiatives as well as key mutually
agreed regional activities that are crucial to attaining the regional strategic goals. The project comprises three components. Component 1 supports capacity building
for addressing the illegal trans-boundary wildlife trade. Component 2 promotes wildlife conservation in Asia; and Component 3 provides for project coordination and
communication.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The Nepal component of the project continues to perform well in all aspects of implementation. Even during the difficult times of the trade disruptions and fuel
shortages, progress has been consistent and the project is on track to achieve its development objective. Key achievements in Nepal include:
■■     The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) has been established at a central level and 22 district-level WCCBs established at field level. (Kathmandu Valley WCCB
       has been effectively working on wildlife crime control);
■■     Capacity building in wildlife forensic of NAFOL (National Forensic Laboratory) and DPR (Department of Plant Resources);
■■     International training on an ‘Environmental Enforcement Information and Intelligence Management Course’ together with INTERPOL for 28 participants from 11
       countries; Wildlife Crime Database – Management Information System (WCD-MIS) is in place;
■■     Judicial dialogue on wildlife crime with the judges of Kathmandu Valley joined by 83 participants;
■■     Revisions to local legislation to ensure effective compliance with Nepal’s obligations under CITES have been drafted and are in the process to receive parliamen-
       tary approval;
■■     127 park staff trained in topics of Tiger and Prey base monitoring, Routine patrol based monitoring, Smart Patrolling, Scene of crime, and wildlife forensics;
       sub-projects are under implementation with a focus on Human Wildlife Conflict, Habitat Management, Anti-poaching and Wildlife Crime Control. The South Asia
       Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN) statute has been ratified by Sri Lanka, India, Nepal and Pakistan.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     As part of the scaling-up nutrition movement, the Government has realized the need to address malnutrition across multiple sectors, and has developed and endorsed
     a multi-sector nutrition plan for the country. The plan envisages an equal role of nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions in realizing the nutrition goals
     during the first 1,000 days of a child’s life. Motivated by this initiative, the Bank has extended support to the implementing agency through the “Sunaula Hazar Din
     Project” to address community-wide risk factors that contribute to malnutrition. The project was restructured to also address the emergency nutrition needs in the 14
     critically affected districts following the 2015 earthquake. To cater to the needs of the earthquake affected districts, the project development objective was revised to “to
     improve practices that contribute to reduce under-nutrition of women of reproductive age and children under the age of two and to provide emergency nutrition and
     sanitation response to vulnerable populations in earthquake affected areas.”

     The Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MOFALD) implements the project by rolling-out a social mobilization initiative through a community-driven
     Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives (RRNIs), where each ward in a selected Village Development Committee (VDC) will commit to a series of pre-defined nutrition-
     relevant goals, each to be met within a 100-day period. The achievement of the goals will be the responsibility of RRNI teams (one for each ward), supported by a coach
     who will support all RRNI teams in one VDC. The RRNI approach will be rolled out in a sequenced manner across the original 15 project districts. An impact evaluation
     is built into the project design. The earthquake relief component is being implemented through an assistance from UNICEF, which signed an agreement with the
     MOFALD to support the delivery of essential evidence-based emergency nutrition interventions to protect the lives of children, pregnant women and breastfeeding
     mothers in the 14 affected districts.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■     Approximately 3,920 sub-projects have been completed and more than 1,000 are undergoing completion review in the communities.
     ■■     In FY2016-17, an additional 7,500 projects are expected to be completed.
     ■■     With support from UNICEF, 2,685 severely acute malnourished children 6-59 months old were treated and 17,384 moderately acute malnourished children 6-59
            months old were provided support with supplementary food.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
On April 25, 2015, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Nepal, together with the aftershocks, resulting in 8,700 deaths and around 25,000 injuries. A Post-
Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), completed on June 15, 2015 estimated damages to be around $7 billion with reconstruction needs of about $6.7 billion. Of
the 490,000 houses destroyed, most were traditional brick or stone structures built with mud mortar, inhabited by the rural poor, whereas another 265,000 were
rendered at least temporarily uninhabitable. Thus, the largest single need identified in the PDNA was housing and human settlements, estimated to be around $3.27
billion or almost half of the total needs. The Project is being financed from the IDA Crisis Response Window (CRW), enabling the reconstruction of about one-tenth
of the housing destroyed. An accompanying Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) was established to facilitate development partners interested in contributing to housing
reconstruction. So far the MDTF has contribution commitments from USAID, Switzerland, and Canada totaling USD 20.54 m. JICA is providing parallel financing of
around $100 million for housing reconstruction. Government of Nepal has established the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) as the apex institution to develop
reconstruction policies and oversee its implementation. The governance structure of the Authority is headed by the Prime Minister, whereas a Chief Executive Officer
leads the management. Implementation modality is owner-driven reconstruction. Eligible beneficiaries, whose houses were severely damaged or destroyed during
the earthquakes, will receive subsidies of approximately $2,000 each to be disbursed in three installments of approximately $500, $800 and $700, contingent upon
completion of their houses, in compliance with approved construction standards.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) completed a census of the rural areas affected by the earthquake, whereas it is in process in three districts of Kathmandu
       valley. The survey covered over 700,000 households and led to collection of damage and socio-economic data to determine eligibility for subsidy. The survey is
       being funded by WB managed Trust Funds.
■■     The NRA has issued guidelines for distribution of housing subsidies, mobilization of international NGOs, grievance redressal, environmental impact, land acquisi-
       tion, procurement, etc. The NRA also prepared the Post Disaster Recovery Framework that presents the government’s reconstruction roadmap for the next 5 years.
■■     As of August 2016, out of 188,093 eligible beneficiaries, 131,557 have enrolled in the Project area and 30,448 have received the first installment into their
       individual bank accounts; 316 engineers, 105 sub-engineers and 140 assistant engineers have been deployed in the Project area to support reconstruction.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Nepal is highly exposed to a range of hydro-meteorological hazards such as floods and droughts, the frequency and intensity of which are expected to increase with
     climate change. The poorer sections of the population particularly, women and rural populations – are typically the worst-affected and have the least capacity to deal
     with such risks. A well-functioning hydromet network, forecasting and early warning system is crucial for strengthening resilience to such risks. The existing observation
     network is mainly manual and the capacity to forecast weather, extreme events and long term climate changes is limited. There is also limited capacity to provide
     weather based services to users such as farmers and flood/hazard vulnerable communities. The Building Resilience to Climate-Related Hazards Project is one of the
     four projects financed through the Nepal Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) under the Strategic Climate Fund. Implementation of this project is supported by
     the World Bank. Other development partners participating in the Nepal PPCR program include the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation.

     The project’s main objective is to enhance government capacity to mitigate climate-related hazards by improving the accuracy and timeliness of weather and flood
     forecasts and warnings for climate-vulnerable communities, and to support development of agricultural management information system services to help farmers
     mitigate climate-related production risks. The project has four components:
     ■■     Institutional capacity strengthening of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM);
     ■■     Modernization of hydro-meteorological observation networks and forecasting;
     ■■     Enhancement of DHM’s service delivery system;
     ■■     Creation of an agriculture management information system anchored at the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MOAD).

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■     DHM is in the advanced stages of the bid evaluation process for a majority of goods packages. In the coming year, significant progress is expected in the instal-
            lation of hydromet observation systems and improvements in forecasting.
     ■■     The bid evaluation process for upgrading DHM’s new building is ongoing and construction is expected to commence in November 2016. Additionally, DHM
            is undertaking several initiatives to strengthen its institutional capacity including drafting of a hydromet law, developing a new organizational structure and
            strengthening its technical staff capacity to support the modernization process.
     ■■     MOAD, in collaboration with the National Agricultural Research Council (NARC), has started issuing agro-advisory bulletins to three districts namely Banke, Bara
            and Rupendehi and expects to scale up delivery to additional districts this year.
     ■■     A mobile application (Hamro Krishi) is already being used by farmers and a SMS alert system has been established in coordination with Nepal Telecom.
     ■■     An important achievement is the strong collaboration between DHM, MOAD and NARC through a technical working group. The agencies are actively collaborating
            in the development and delivery of agro-weather advisories through exchange of agricultural information, weather data and forecasts.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The project marks the re-engagement of the World Bank in the urban sector in Nepal after an absence of more than 10 years. It aims at developing a sustainable
approach for strengthening the planning, implementation, and revenue-raising capacity of six emerging towns (each 30,000-70,000 population) located in the
Western and Eastern regions of Nepal. The municipalities have been selected based on their growth potential and their strategic location along the North-South
transport corridors (highways).
The project objective is to improve the capacity of the participating municipalities to plan, implement, and fund urban development activities. It has three components:
■■     Strengthening municipal planning capacity through provision of grants to the municipalities;
■■     Provision of financing for municipal infrastructure sub-projects to improve municipal capacity to implement infrastructure investments;
■■     Institutional development and project management support to the participating municipalities and project agencies.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Municipalities have been receiving the additional grants based on the minimum condition performance measures set by the Government of Nepal and have
       used the grants to carry out small projects, such as road upgrading, with at least 35 percent of the grant resources earmarked toward activities benefiting women
       and disadvantaged groups.
■■     Municipalities have prepared and adopted Revenue Enhancement Plans (REPs), Operations and Maintenance (O&M) plans as well as Investment Plans (IPs).
■■     Implementation of billing software for revenue collection and building by-laws are also under way.
■■     Construction of six municipal sub-projects, ranging from market areas, parks and roads, have been completed and the remaining nine sub-projects are expected
       to be completed before the project closing date.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The existing bridge stock in Nepal is over 35-40 years old and in urgent need of rehabilitation and maintenance. There are still many gaps in the Strategic Roads
     Network (SRN) caused by lack of bridges. This contributes to a substantial lack of physical access to economic centers and social services, particularly in remote areas.
     Nepal’s topography and geology also complicate efforts to provide adequate transport infrastructure. The lack of physical access is seen as one of the root causes of the
     high level of poverty incidence in remote areas. The Bridges Improvement and Maintenance Program (BIMP) has been designed by the government to address these
     issues. The Program aims to provide safe, reliable and cost-effective bridges on Nepal’s Strategic Roads Network. It supports the government’s initiative using a new
     lending instrument: the Program for Results. The Program is the first of its kind in infrastructure that received Bank’s loan under the new lending instrument. The scope
     of the program encompasses three primary activities: (i) planning, technical design and quality control of bridges; (ii) major and minor maintenance of existing bridge
     assets; and (iii) new bridge construction. It has six disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs).

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     Two DLIs are already achieved: DLI-2 (minor maintenance) and DLI-4 (Program performance management). The Bank is anticipating a government restructuring
     request to readjust two DLI targets. Following are some results achieved. PDO level results indicators:
     ■■     Percentage of bridges on SRN rated as being in good or fair condition – 57.1 percent (Target: 75 percent);
     ■■     Percentage of bridges on SRN rated as structurally unsafe – 3.74 percent (Target: 1 percent);
     ■■     Percentage of bridge works completed on planned schedule – 63 percent (Target: 50 percent).
     Intermediate Results Indicators:
     ■■     Completion of major maintenance of bridges: 5,680m achieved (target 17,125); (
     ■■     Completion of minor repairs of bridges (all target 3500m achieved);
     ■■     New bridges built or improved: 5,736m completed (target 6,000);
     ■■     Two other indicators: Bridge Management System and Grievance Redressal Mechanism are progressing well and all targets are likely to be achieved.
     The Program is on course to achieve its targets barring one, and there is a concern regarding the achievement of DLI 1 (major maintenance).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Nepal has the second lowest road network density in the Region. Only two-fifths of the population has access to paved roads within a 20-minute walking distance. The
substantial lack of accessibility to economic centers and social services in the remote areas is seen as one of the main impediments to poverty reduction and economic
development. By 2016, the Government of Nepal aims for 86 percent of the population to live within two hours (in the plain districts) or four hours (in hilly districts)
walking distance to a paved road. Connection of all district headquarters with all-weather roads has been one of the key elements of the Road Sector Priority Investment
Plan of 2007. The Road Sector Development Project has been designed against this backdrop to support the Strategic Roads Network.
The original project outlay was approximately $43 million. The Project received an additional financing of $75m in end-2010. However, in June 2015 an amount of
SDR4.5m ($6.75m) was cancelled as requested by the Government. In the aftermath of the devastating 2015 earthquake, the project closing date was extended by a
year to end-June 2016. Further, to complete the project’s incomplete activities, which were hampered by the unofficial trade blockades, the closing date was extended
for another one year: June 30, 2017. The Project’s Second Additional Financing of 55 million has been approved by the Board on August 25, 2016. The Second
Additional Financing will be implemented until mid-July, 2019. The Project seeks to provide all season road access to the residents of beneficiary districts, reducing
travel time and improving access to economic centers and social services. The Project aims to connect eight remote district headquarters in the mid-western and
far-western regions of Nepal. The project components are road development (utilizing 83 percent of the funding) and institutional strengthening and policy reform.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     All eight district headquarters of Mid and Far-Western regions are now connected.
■■     A 2012 survey showed that the number of paved roads in poor condition had been reduced to 11.3 percent, well below the target of 15 percent.
■■     An analysis using the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) shows that the target of increasing the population’s access to all-weather roads (6 percent) has been
       achieved.
■■     The Project has overachieved the periodic maintenance target (target – 2,550 km; achievement – 2,595km).
■■     All upgrading contracts under the project are now complete -- 690 km of roads have been upgraded against a target of 700 km and 30 km of road sections are left
       incomplete due to the slope instability. This operation is being undertaken under the second additional financing of the project.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Over the past decade, poverty has reduced significantly in rural areas of Nepal, where 83 percent of the population lives. In order to maintain this positive trend and to
     achieve significant development gains, it is necessary to continue the effort to improve transport connectivity in rural areas. Nepal’s topography and geology, combined
     with rural population distribution, significantly complicate efforts to provide all-weather transport links to many rural communities. Improving connectivity throughout
     Nepal is key to ensuring that economic growth reaches rural areas. The Project has been designed to enhance physical access to markets and social and economic
     services, as well as assistance during emergency events. Initially, 33 districts are eligible to participate, which covers more than half of the total population of Nepal. It
     is the third IDA operation to support Nepal’s rural transport sector in the past 15 years. In the aftermath of the devastating 2015 earthquake, three more quake-affected
     districts were added to 33 existing districts.

     The project objective is to enhance the availability and reliability of transport connectivity for rural communities in participating districts. Components call for
     institutional strengthening and technical assistance ($19.7 million) and civil works ($155.7 million). The first will fund
     ■■     Institutional strengthening and technical assistance;
     ■■     Beneficiary monitoring of physical works of the project;
     ■■     An impact study of selected project interventions.
     The other component will support districts in upgrading or rehabilitating rural transport infrastructure, and maintaining rural transport infrastructure.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     The project is on course to achieve its objectives and has accomplished several noteworthy milestones.
     ■■     The progress of output-based maintenance sub-component is satisfactory, with routine maintenance (RM) achievements ahead of the plan (Year 3 target:
            2,389km; achievement as of July, 2016: 5,969 km).
     ■■     The project has made some progress in periodic maintenance related activities. It is not expected to achieve its Year 3 target (1,235 km).
     ■■     The Project currently employs over 2,500 full-time road maintenance group members, and the overwhelming majority of them (roughly three-fourths) are
            women.
     ■■     There has been significant improvement in occupational health and safety practices of routine maintenance groups.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Transport costs in Nepal are high and the country depends almost entirely on India for transit routes. Sharing an approximately 1,800-km-long border and 26 border
points, India is often considered Nepal’s “natural” trading partner. The port complex of Kolkata-Haldia in India has been serving as Nepal’s access to the sea and is a
major transit point for Nepal’s third-country trade. India also provides a large market for Nepali goods and services, and is Nepal’s largest trading partner, with about
60 percent of Nepal’s trade going to or coming from India. Despite its proximity and deep economic relations with India as well as China, Nepal’s trade outcomes have
been poor. Since 2007, exports have been stagnant while imports have increased by more than 50 percent. That suggests an urgent need for an action plan to improve
export competitiveness particularly by focusing on reducing inefficiencies and bottlenecks that increase the cost of exports on regional and international markets. The
main development objective of the Regional Project is to decrease transport time and logistics costs for bilateral trade between Nepal and India and transit trade along
the Kathmandu-Kolkata corridor for the benefit of traders by reducing key infrastructure bottlenecks in Nepal and by supporting the adoption of modern approaches
to border management. The strategy includes:
■■     Reducing the time and cost of trade-related transactions through efforts at simplification, harmonization, and automation;
■■     Building the capacity of domestic trade-related institutions, including for sanitary and phyto-sanitary inspections, trade negotiations, logistics, and monitoring
       and regulating trade-related sectors;
■■     Enhancing the government’s ability to coordinate trade-related institutions and development partners.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Pavement works at Bhairhawa Inland Clearance/Container Depot have been completed.
■■     Three contracts for Narayanghat Mugling road improvement works were awarded, with about 25 percent of the work completed.
■■     The contract for Birgunj shed works was awarded, and about 10 percent of the work has been done.
■■     The feasibility and detail design for Kathmandu-Naubise-Mugling road improvement works and of the ICD/ CFS at Kathmandu (Chovar) is in progress.
■■     The development of National Trade Portal under TEPC is in progress, the bidding process for the development and implementation of National Single Window is
       in progress and a Study on the Axle Load Control and Road Transport Safety has been completed.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Government of Nepal’s continuing efforts to expand road access to a greater number of districts has often omitted safety-related considerations. Statistics from
     the Nepal Police Traffic Directorate estimate that in FY2012/13 there were over 13,500 road traffic accidents in Nepal. The challenges posed by road safety outside the
     Kathmandu valley tend to be more severe than in the valley itself. For example, in FY2009/10, the rate of fatalities per 10,000 registered vehicles in regions outside
     Kathmandu ranged from 7 to 33 times higher than the rate of fatalities observed in the valley. In many instances, this disparity are result of mass-casualty events from
     vertical drops that are a common feature on roads in Nepal’s hill and mountain districts. In this context, the Road Safety Support Project has been designed with the
     support of Global Road Safety Phase 2 Multi-Donor Trust Fund to improve the safety features of the IDA supported Road Sector SDP roads. RSDP has been serving as
     a key program in developing Nepal’s strategic road network in the Far and Mid-Western regions. The grant closing date was extended for a year from July 15, 2016 to
     July 15, 2017 to enable the government to complete all its planned activities in order to achieve its development objectives which was not possible within the original
     closing date. This is as the post-earthquake uncertainties and unofficial trade blockades have substantially hampered the project’s implementation.

     The Project objective is to reduce the risk of roadway departure crashes on selected sections of Road Sector Development Project (RSDP) roads and to strengthen the
     Government of Nepal’s capacity for improving road safety. There are two components:
     ■■     Component A – Capacity strengthening for the Implementation of Road Safety Action Plan ($ 0.80 million equivalent).
     ■■     Component B – Improved physical safety of RSDP roads ($ 6.67 million equivalent). This Component funds procurement and installation of crash barriers in high
            risk sections of RSDP roads.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     Both components of the project have made good progress. One area of concern is the achievement of the intermediate outcome indicators, which is the establishment
     of a dedicated unit for managing road safety. The Government is making an effort to establish the unit within the project period. All major contracts under Component
     B (improved physical safety of RSDP roads) have been procured and their implementation has started. They are linked to the installation of approximately 70km of
     steel W-beam crash barriers. Under the institutional strengthening component:
     ■■     All targeted activities of the Nepal Road Safety Action Plan (2013), barring the Road Safety Council related activities, have started and are expected to be achieved;
            progress on Nepal Road Safety Council & Secretariat operationalization has been insignificant;
     ■■     All contracts for Piloting road safety are procured and implementation has started.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Rani Jamara Kulariya Scheme is one of the most prominent farmer-managed irrigation schemes in Nepal, with a cultivable command area of 14,300 hectares (the
project area), of which about 11,000 hectares are currently being irrigated. The project focuses on modernization of the higher-order irrigation infrastructure (especially
intakes and feeder and branch canals), as well as the preparation and initiation of an agricultural development program. The project has four components:
■■     Scheme modernization;
■■     Strengthening Water Users Associations;
■■     Agricultural production support;
■■     Project management.
There is a proposed second phase that would focus on the modernization of the lower-order irrigation infrastructure (sub-branch and tertiary canals and water courses)
and implementation of a comprehensive agricultural improvement program. The project development objective of phase 1 is to improve irrigation water delivery
and management in the project area. This is being achieved by improving performance of the irrigation systems and strengthening community-based irrigation
management. These activities seek to build resilience through more efficient water delivery and management against water-induced hazards such as droughts, floods,
and changes in water availability during the agricultural seasons. The project also supports the agricultural development that will result in a modest increase in yields,
especially in the upper part of the command area.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Irrigation infrastructure is gradually being completed and is starting to have an impact on agricultural production.
■■     Road improvement to ease access to the scheme and river training to reduce the chance of flooding in the project area are substantially completed.
■■     Training of Water Users Associations (WUA) continues and four WUA offices are either complete or under construction.
■■     Agricultural demonstrations and farmers field schools continue to be conducted.
■■     Based on crop cutting samples, average yields (ton/ha) of main crops are showing increases (baseline in brackets): paddy (winter) 3.0 (2.8); paddy (monsoon)
       3.1 (2.6); wheat (2.2 (1.7); and maize 2.1 (1.6).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     While Nepal has achieved the Millennium Development Goal (2015 Joint Monitoring Program), the country is off target for access to improved sanitation. The true
     situation in rural areas may be worse, as surveys conducted by the National Management Information Project (NMIP) show that 44 percent of the existing rural water
     systems are in need of repairs or rehabilitation, with no system in place to support the communities to do so. Therefore, the national targets for universal access by
     2017 is unachievable. Nepal also has many challenges to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDG); that is, to ensure availability and sustainable management
     of water and sanitation for all. The Project supports efforts to adopt an inclusive, community driven approach in which local communities play the lead role in planning,
     design and implementation of schemes, as well as in the operation and maintenance of services. The Project also aims to support the long term sustainability of water
     supply systems in selected districts. The development objectives of the Project are to: (i) increase sustainable access to improved water services and promote improved
     sanitation and hygiene practices in rural areas; and (ii) develop and implement a long-term support mechanism to promote the sustainability of water supply schemes
     in selected districts.

     The Project is implemented in 55 districts (out of 75 districts), selected based on objective ranking with respect to their access to safe water and sanitation. Thus, the
     Project has a strong poverty focus, as it also reach out the unserved areas. The Project comprises four components:
     ■■     Provides access to improved water supply and sanitation and promotion of improved sanitation and hygiene practices.
     ■■     Supports district level institutional strengthening, with aim to promote the long term sustainability of schemes in selected districts through enhancing institu-
            tional arrangements and strengthening linkages among key agencies during planning, implementation and post construction of such schemes.
     ■■     Supports Technical Assistance/Capacity Building and Project Management.
     ■■     The Contingency Emergency Response with zero allocation. Following the 2015 earthquakes, the project was restructured in August 2015 to include activities for
            “early recovery and rehabilitation of Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) services” in the affected districts.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Out of 379 schemes in Batch IX under retroactive financing, 280 were completed, 7,220 community water points were constructed providing over 246,000
            people (49 percent female) with access to safe water.
     ■■     The remaining 99 schemes are under implementation at various phases to be completed by December 2016. With completion of these schemes, an estimated
            330,000 people will have access to safe water.
     ■■     Development Phase for Batch X started in July 2016 and contracts were signed with 107 Support Organizations to implement about 550 water supply schemes.
     ■■     The Sanitation Revolving Loan Fund (SRLF) approach is adopted for retroactive schemes which are carried over from RWSSP-II. A total 30,385 household and 94 in-
            stitutional toilets were constructed. From Batch X onward, the Community-Led Total Sanitation approach will be followed. Under Batch X, an agreement was made
            with 92 Support Organizations for 124 Village Development Committees (VDC) for ODF (Open Defecation Free) and 225 VDCs for post ODF and work started.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Nepal Public Financial Management (PFM) Multi-donor Trust Fund (MDTF) was activated in December 2010. It is administered by the World Bank and jointly funded
by the following donors: UK Department for International Development (DFID), the Governments of Norway and Denmark, Australia DFAT, USAID (United States Agency for
International Development), the European Union and the Government of the Swiss Confederation. The decision to extend the MDTF has been adopted at the last steering
committee in April 2016.

The objective of the MDTF for PFM is to support Government of Nepal’s Public Financial Management reform Program, Phase II (PFMRP II) which builds on the progress of the
first phase of PFM reform (PFMRP-I), findings of the second PEFA assessment and the priority PFM areas identified by the Government of Nepal (GoN). The key results expected
from the projects to be funded through the MDTF are
■■     Improved resource management as a result of strengthened PFM systems and processes
■■     Increased awareness and oversight of government PFM processes by diverse constituencies.
Furthermore better knowledge of value for money challenges and PFM governance gaps, contributing to improved design of PFM intervention at the country and sector level
have been expected.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The MDTF has funded several sub-projects, analytical activities and technical assistance initiatives that have helped modernize various PFM sub-systems of the budget
cycle and accountability framework and also strengthened the institutional capacity of the institutions performing these functions. It has also contributed to increased PFM
awareness among stakeholders and a better coordination among development partners around PFM reform support, as evidenced by the second Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment report concluded in 2015. The MDTF has also supported the implementation of a consolidated Treasury system for the entire
government, leading to the closure of thousands of accounts in commercial banks and substantial savings for the government. Treasury systems have been strengthened by
the implementation of a Financial Management Information system (FMIS), called Single Treasury System of Accounts, to process and monitor budget expenditure spending
from central government to the 75 districts with a current coverage of 100 percent. A tax collection module (RMIS) has been added to TSA. A budget preparation FMIS
called Line Ministry Budget Information System (LMBIS) has been developed and is being mainstreamed in line ministries. Furthermore, the Office of the Auditor General
(OAG) has been strengthened in terms of compliance with professional standards. In addition, an IT software has been developed which is used to support the conduct of
audit and the processing of the various documents and audit files. OAG has also benefited from a partnership with the Pakistan Auditor-General (SAI) to conduct an audit of
post-disaster relief. Additionally, citizen engagement in PFM has been strengthened through the implementation of various social accountability tools at community level
(Village Development Committees) like Grievance redress mechanisms (GRM), expenditure tracking and citizen awareness of the local budget process. Citizen engagement
in the external audit process has led to pilot experiments of participatory audit with the OAG and the adoption and publication by the OAG of a Participatory Audit Guidance.
In addition, the PEFA Secretariat’s capacity to lead the various stakeholders in PFM reform as well as to enhance awareness and knowledge on PFM reform issues has been
strengthened.
