1. Implementing a Unique
Business Identifier in
Government: Guidance
Note for Practitioners
Executive Summary
In an increasingly online world, governments are realizing that previous silo
approaches to implementing information technology (IT) systems have cre-
ated barriers to the sharing of information among business regulators. As they
undertake efforts to increase tax compliance, streamline business start-up,
enhance data sharing, improve public service delivery, reduce administrative
burdens, and monitor the health of financial systems, governments are imple-
menting unique business identifiers (UBIs) as part of their larger approach to
achieving these goals and realizing the related benefits. A UBI provides the
foundational information related to legal entities, enabling government and
business to uniquely identify legal entities in various transactions and regula-
tory interactions (see box 1.1).
  This guidance note draws on a set of nine case studies looking at individual
country efforts to implement a UBI. Based on the country cases examined in
this assessment, two general approaches for the implementation of the UBI
have emerged:

••    In some cases, the implementation of the UBI is part of a large-scale
     ­administrative reform, which may include streamlining business
      start-up ­procedures, integrating government-to-business (G2B) service
      delivery as well as establishing a technical infrastructure to support
      interagency communications and data sharing. These cases involve lead-
      ership from the executive branch of government and will typically start
      with a core group of agencies (for example, tax and company registry).
      However, most have a clearly defined implementation plan to include all
      other ­business-related agencies and processes. Examples include Albania
      and New Zealand.
••    In other cases, the approach can best be described as evolutionary—­starting
      with a similar core group of agencies but without a clearly defined (or man-
      dated) strategy for extending the use of the UBI to other agencies (that is,
      those involved with licensing, permitting, and inspections). Here, expansion
      occurs organically over a longer period as the agencies realize the benefits of
      the UBI, undergo their own process optimization or technology upgrade, or
      implement an e-service that requires a unique i  ­dentifier. This evolutionary
      approach, in some cases, follows the progression of the “once-only, simplifi-
                                        digital by default” strategies as outlined in
      cation, and personalization” and “­
      the European Union’s (EU’s) Study on eGovernment and the Reduction of

     Box 1.1  What Is a Unique Business Identifier?
     A Unique Business Identifier (UBI) is typically an alphanumeric code (potentially with hyphens
     or periods as separators) that can be used to distinctly identify a legal entity (for example, com-
     pany or sole proprietorship). UBIs provide benefits across both the public and private sectors.
     For businesses, the UBI can be used in legal and financial documents and contracts to uniquely
     identify the entities involved. In the public sector, these unique identifiers allow governments to
     more readily share entity information, which then enables them to more effectively regulate the
     activities of businesses within their jurisdiction. At the same time, UBIs can help minimize the
     compliance burden caused by redundant requests for similar information from multiple agencies.

     UBIs are intended to replace all other identifiers within a jurisdiction that government, the pri-
     vate sector, and the public use to reference a legal entity. While replacing all other identifiers may
     be achievable in greenfield or large-scale reforms, there is typically a need to maintain previous
     identifiers in legacy back office systems and internal processes. However, it is the UBI that should
     be promoted for use outside of the organization.

     Unique business identifiers may also be known as unique business numbers, common business
     identifiers, or common business numbers. The basis of a UBI might be the tax authority’s identifi-
     cation number (TIN), business registration number, or another existing identifier.




      Administrative Burden (EU 2014). This evolutionary approach has occurred
      in Canada, Georgia, Jordan, Norway, the Philippines, Rwanda, and Serbia.
   Analysis of the country cases revealed a number of common issues encoun-
tered during implementation and operation of the UBI solutions. These
include a general resistance to change, external stakeholder criticism, lack of
trust, inadequate institutional capacity, unclear or ill-communicated vision
and goals, legislative challenges, and privacy concerns. In addition, at the
technical level, challenges also arise when trying to resolve data conflicts from
multiple information sources that may be considered authoritative (for exam-
ple, tax and business registries).
   This note explores the emerging good practices that these countries have
employed in addressing these challenges. Effective implementations begin
with creating a clear vision as well as strong governance and leadership struc-
tures for both the implementation effort and the longer term operation of the
solution. In addition, it is recommended that a legal review occur in the proj-
ect’s early stages because existing laws and regulations often need to be
updated to permit full use of the UBI. As the case studies for Norway and
New Zealand highlight, effective data governance1 and public access to UBI-
related information is critical to adoption of the UBI by government agencies
and within the private sector. Also, it is important to understand that adopt-
ing agencies will require assistance during implementation to understand
potential legal and process changes that they may need to enact, as well as
support, in mapping their information on businesses to the UBI solution.
Finally, good practice for the technical solution to support interoperability,

data sharing, and unfettered access to the UBI information includes imple-
menting a high-availability, standards-based architecture. This reflects an
understanding that the technology landscape is typically not homogenous;
therefore, UBI-related information must be available in a way that corre-
sponds with the needs and capabilities of the participating organizations.



Introduction
This note summarizes the findings from a study of nine countries that have
implemented, or are in the midst of implementing, a UBI. It outlines emerg-
ing good practices in the development of a reliable and efficient identification
mechanism for businesses.
   While much focus has been given to establishing universal digital legal identi-
ties for individuals, the establishment of authentic unique legal identities for
businesses and corporations is equally important. The existence of UBIs is criti-
cal because governments are increasingly partnering with businesses to deliver
services such as health and education, to build roads and digital infrastructure,
and to implement innovations designed to bring greater prosperity. UBIs are
also important in enabling businesses in the developing world to compete effec-
tively in global markets, where such identifiers are increasingly used in manag-
ing counterparty risk and obtaining services in highly interconnected financial
and trading systems. The issue is often that a business is not clearly identified in
contracts—be they financial market transactions, government procurement
contracts, or licenses. For example, the name of a business can be represented in
multiple ways, can change, and can be reused by different legal entities, leading
to a proliferation of “ghost companies” that siphon off scarce resources or avoid
taxes and duties. In an open data world, this also means that government data
sets cannot be easily combined or matched with the corresponding ­        company,
leading to data silos, regulatory failures, corruption, and criminal ­  activity—as
shown in the World Bank’s Puppet Masters report (de Willebois 2011). In the
financial sector, regulators believe that the inability to uniquely identify a firm
was a significant contributory factor to the 2008 financial crisis.
   This paper explores the adoption of UBIs in nine countries and outlines the
impacts and benefits of their introduction, including:

••   Improved regulatory governance by enabling data exchange among the
     business registry, tax and customs authority, business regulators, and
     other relevant government agencies;
••   Greater transparency of business structure and links among business
     entities;
••   Reduced need to provide the same company information multiple times
     to different parts of government;
••   Improved public health and safety as well as consumer protection through
     better information sharing among business regulators;
••   Ability to share company data across borders through the use of interna-
     tional business identifier formats (where applicable);

••    Enhanced safety and efficiency of the financial system by enabling robust
      credit reporting systems that can leverage reliable identification of
      businesses, their promoters, and their key executives; and
      ­
••    Reduced counterparty risk in commercial transactions and government
      procurement through easy and transparent identification of the business
      entities involved.
   In addition, this note outlines the key institutional, legal, and technology
issues and challenges involved in implementing a UBI, and explores
approaches that governments have taken to address them. Finally, the paper
provides a high-level roadmap that identifies the common activities to sup-
port the delivery of a UBI implementation—including governance structures
(both implementation and operational); legal, capacity, privacy, and organiza-
tional assessments; monitoring and evaluation approaches; and technical
architecture and solution design.


The Case for Change
The motivating factors for governments to implement a UBI vary from coun-
try to country; however, several common themes emerge across the nine
studied in this note:
••    Canada implemented its UBI to improve tax compliance. The Canada
      Revenue Agency (CRA) introduced the UBI to identify businesses in its
      core business programs, including Corporation Tax, Goods and Services
      Tax (GST), Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), and payroll levies.
••    Initiatives in Georgia, the Philippines, Rwanda, and Serbia targeted
      streamlining business start-up by reducing the number of processes (see
      table 1.1) that a business must complete. Through integrated registration

a. Implementations in Canada and Norway predate the Doing Business surveys. Pre-UBI information
reflects the first available year (2004). World Bank (2011) states, “Before centralization, registration of a
new business could take up to 1 year.”

     with the company registry, tax, and pension authorities, these countries
     seek to improve their business environment and become more compet-
     itive destinations for investment. In Georgia, improved data sharing and
     exchange within government was also identified as an objective early in
     the project.
••   In Albania, Jordan, New Zealand, Norway, and the Philippines, the main
     objectives have been to improve government services and reduce the
     administrative burden on businesses. The UBI in these countries is an
     enabler and a foundational aspect of larger initiatives such as regulatory
     reform, online transactional portals, and service integration—enabling
     data sharing and links across multiple agencies within government. In
     New Zealand, the objective also includes enabling timesaving adminis-
     trative solutions for trade and procurement across government, busi-
     nesses, and their respective suppliers.
  Some other motivating factors that appear unique within the countries
studied include the following:
••   Albania noted that the UBI was part of a larger effort to reduce the infor-
     mal economy and therefore increase compliance.
••   The location of the UBI register in Norway (the Central Coordination
     Register for Legal Entities) was selected as part of economic develop-
     ment strategy to improve infrastructure within the country. The
     Brønnøysund Register Centre is located in Brønnøysund, which is
     roughly 850 kilometers from Oslo, with a population of 4,924.2
••   Regional and international initiatives provided partial motivation for
     the introduction of UBIs in some countries. European Union members
     are required to disclose and report information about businesses per
     the EU Directive 2013/34/EU.3 In Norway and Serbia, the preexistence
     of  a UBI made adhering to these directives and joining the European
     Business Register (EBR) easier. Although somewhat related, the Global
     Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) (see box 1.2 for more information) is primar-
     ily used for global financial transactions.
   At the heart of all these initiatives, a common objective was to create an
authoritative source of information on business entities using an immutable
UBI. The UBI is a foundational building block for other initiatives because it
supports the sharing and linking of data across agencies, integrated registra-
tion, and improved regulatory and tax compliance.
   As with the motivating factors, the benefits realized, or expected to be real-
ized, vary from country to country, but several common themes still emerge:
••   Georgia, the Philippines,4 Rwanda, and Serbia stated that a key objec-
     tive was to streamline business start-up. Based on Doing Business
     data and this study, these countries have had varying degrees of success
     in reducing the number of procedures involved; however, all have seen
     significant reductions in the time to start a business—ranging from 17
     percent in the Philippines to 92 percent in Georgia. Table 1.1 provides
     details on the changes in procedures and time for each country, while

     Box 1.2  Global Legal Entity Identifier
     According to the Legal Entity Identifier Regulatory Oversight Committee (http://www.leiroc​
     .org/), “the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a 20-digit, alphanumeric code, used to uniquely iden-
     tify legally distinct entities that engage in financial transactions.” The LEI was created by the
     Committee, which is a group of over 60 public authorities from more than 40 countries that was
     established in January 2013 to coordinate and oversee a worldwide framework of legal entity
     identification, the Global LEI System.

     The LEI is based on the “ISO 17442:2012, Financial Services—Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)” stan-
     dard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 2012).

     The LEI is a more recent initiative than the UBI implementations in this study and is focused on
     regulatory oversight in the trading of stocks, bonds, securities, and other financial instruments.
     Although none of the participating countries addressed LEI in the context of their UBI imple-
     mentations, there will likely be increased links between the LEI and the UBI in the future.




      annex 1C highlights the changes in the Doing Business starting a busi-
      ness and distance to frontier (DTF) indicators during the periods the
      UBI was being implemented.
••    Most countries noted an increase in compliance related to the imple-
      mentation of a UBI. In particular, countries noted increases in tax
      compliance, adherence to government procurement practices, and the
      ­
      number of businesses registered.
      •• All countries noted an increase in tax compliance, which is not
          unexpected because it is typically the business registry and tax agency
          that are key government sources of information on businesses.
          Increased data sharing has helped reveal many tax avoidance schemes.
      •• Most countries reported an increase in adherence to government
          procurement rules.
      •• Finally, Georgia and Norway reported an increase in the number of
          businesses registered. This increase typically occurs in countries
          where business registration is also simplified (including moving the
          process out of the court system) during UBI implementation. Norway
          indicated that the “number of registered businesses under the Register
          of Business Enterprises has more than doubled since 1998”: In 1998
          there were less than 100,000 registered businesses, but as of 2010 that
          number had increased to over 400,000.
••    Reduced administrative burden on businesses and increased efficiency
      for government were identified by all participants as important benefits.
      This is evidenced by reductions in the number of processes and amount of
      time to register a business as well as decreases in the number of times a busi-
      ness has to provide the same information to different government agencies.
••    New Zealand, Norway, and Rwanda all referenced use of the
      UBI  and  its  related information within the private sector for

                    business-to-business (B2B) transactions. This includes financial institu-
                                                          companies using the UBI to obtain
                    tions, credit-reporting agencies, and ­
                    and catalogue information on potential borrowers and trading counter-
                    parties. New Zealand noted that its UBI is being used by businesses in
                    areas such as exports and invoicing.



               Emerging Good Practices
               Analysis of the experiences of the nine jurisdictions in implementing a UBI has
               identified a number of emerging good practices. These can be organized in the
               following categories: (i) leadership and governance, (ii) legislation, (iii) project
               planning and management, (iv) data governance, (v) accessibility, (vi) imple-
               mentation support resources within government, and (vii) technology.
               1.	 Ensure effective governance, leadership, and vision. The implementation
                   of a UBI can either be part of a large-scale reform project or be an evolu-
                   tionary process carried out through successive discrete initiatives over a
                   period of years. In either case, it is critical that a clearly articulated vision
                   and ­governance structure be defined, and that a strong senior leader be
                   identified to champion the project. It is also important that the vision out-
                   line the expected high-level phases of the implementation—this provides
                   the ­ability to communicate relevant process or administrative changes
                   to stakeholders in easily definable and actionable tasks. The governance
                   structure must be adaptable to align with project phases and involved
                   stakeholders because the latter will likely grow in number over time. Other
                   reforms that can leverage a UBI initiative to maximize overall impact
                   encompass areas such as business registration, licensing, income and value
                   added taxes, customs, business inspections, and land and other asset regis-
                   trations. Box 1.3 summarizes the common data elements in a UBI solution.
               2.	 Carry out a legislative review early in the project. A majority of countries
                   required legal reforms to implement the UBI. Examples of such reforms
                   include legislation to support the creation of a dedicated UBI register;
                   amendments to existing legislation to allow for the collection, use, and




Box 1.3  Common UBI Data Elements
In addition to the unique business identifier itself, the following data is also commonly main-
tained in the UBI data set: business name, business entity type, business entity status, registration
date, business addresses (civic and mailing), industry sector(s), officers, directors, and contact
information.

Some jurisdictions also maintain the foreign business identifier(s), country of origin, beneficial
owners, number of people employed, tax identification number, and financial information.

Finally, Norway provides the ability for agencies to add program-specific information.

      sharing of information; creation of a new public entity; and l      ­egislation
      to mandate the use of the UBI. Based on the empirical evidence from
      this study, those countries that mandated the use of the UBI experienced
      a shorter implementation timeline—across all of government. In other
      countries, where UBI usage was not mandated, the adoption by govern-
      ment agencies continues—even years after the initial implementation.
      Each country situation will be unique given its current legislation and
      system of government.
3.	   Plan for implementation as well as long-term management of the UBI
      solution. UBI implementations can take years to complete and will be
      operational for an indefinite period of time. Over the lifespan of a UBI
      solution, in addition to changes in staff, skill requirements, and process
      changes, governments must also plan for a continuous evolution of the
      technology solution and associated infrastructure. This includes stan-
      dard maintenance and updates of hardware and software, as well as major
      upgrades, and potential revisions based on partner system upgrades.
      It also includes provisioning for data migration to new platforms and
      secure data archiving and long-term preservation. It is critical to ensure
      that sufficient funding sources are identified for both the implementation
      of the UBI and its long-term operation.
4.	   Implement effective data governance policies. A number of r      ­ espondents
      identified data governance as a critical success factor for the UBI. In a
      typical UBI architecture, the information related to a UBI does not come
      from a single, authoritative source (for example, business registry or tax
      authority); rather the information may come from multiple authoritative
      sources, or multiple nonauthoritative sources. Thus, the UBI solution
      owner is a custodian of information. For example, it is clear that the busi-
      ness registry is the authoritative source for a business’s name; however, it
      is less clear who (other than the business itself) is the authoritative source
      for such data as addresses and key contacts. A well-defined data gover-
      nance model must be developed, outlining rules for access to and mod-
      ification of UBI-related information, in order to maintain data integrity.
5.	   Information should be available and accessible to all. With appropriate
      limitations, the UBI and its related information should be available for
      use by the public and private sectors as well as by the general public. Most
      of the jurisdictions studied have implemented, or are planning, multiple
      channels to the UBI data. To become a ubiquitous identifier, UBI usage
      should be common in government-to-government (G2G), G2B, and
      B2B interactions (for example, invoicing, payment, and export). In New
      Zealand, although still only in the early stages of UBI implementation
      and adoption, the fact that the UBI is publicly available (through APIs
      and websites) and uses a numbering system based on international stan-
      dards has contributed greatly to early adoption within the private sector
      in B2B and G2B transactions.
6.	   Ensure adequate implementation support resources within govern-
      ment. A number of the respondents have created internal organizations
      that assist stakeholder agencies within government in adopting the UBI.

8	                         Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
    They help agencies by guiding them through a standardized process that
    includes identification of potential legal reforms, process changes, change
    management, and mapping of existing databases to the UBI.



Technology and Architecture Considerations
There is no standard UBI technical solution; in all nine jurisdictions these
were custom-developed to fit the needs and circumstances of their own gov-
ernment technology environments. However, they all leveraged commonly
available commercial or open source technologies to address their specific
challenges. Following are some common elements of the technical approaches
employed:

1.	 Message broker model with a central UBI database. The majority of
    governments studied implemented their UBI solution with a central
    database—which consolidates information provided by other systems—
    ­
    with any updates provided back through either a push or pull mecha-
    nism through a message brokering service (that is, enterprise service bus).
    The message broker provides services to allow the central database to
    receive updates from other source systems, as well as for source systems
    to send and receive updates from the central database. Two models for
    the location of the UBI central database were observed: (i) within one
    of the authoritative sources (for example, tax or business registry) with
    additional information from other (authoritative and non-authoritative)
    sources provided through update interfaces and (ii) a separate database/
    solution within one of the primary agencies that consolidates information
    (authoritative and non-authoritative) as provided through the update
    interfaces.
2.	 UBI conversion and mapping. In the jurisdictions covered in this
    study, five of the UBIs were based on the existing tax identifier, three
    countries implemented a new identifier, one was based on the busi-
    ness registration number, and one was based on a statistical identi-
    fier. Regardless of the approach selected, the implementation of a UBI
    requires other ministries, departments, and agencies to convert or map
    existing identifiers to the UBI. In an ideal situation, the stakeholder
    agencies are able to convert to the UBI and abolish the use of the pre-
    vious identifiers. Typically, however, there is a need to maintain pre-
    vious identifiers in legacy back office systems and internal processes.
    The approach to mapping or converting legacy identifiers to the UBI
    will differ in each jurisdiction on the basis of cost, timing, technology,
    or legislative constraints. For example, in Rwanda, the government was
    already requiring businesses to re-register with the company registry
    as part of the implementation of a new online system, so the new UBI
    (tax ID) was assigned as part of this updated registration. Regardless of
    the approach taken, the goal is to promote the UBI as “the identifier”
    within government and to the public.

3.	 Standards-based approach to support interoperability. As noted
    above, all UBI solutions studied were custom-built solutions based on
    either commercial or open-source platforms or products. However, the
    jurisdictions studied largely adopted standards-based tools and tech-
    nologies to facilitate interoperability in their typically heterogeneous
    and complex application landscapes. For example, most respondents
    have developed a standard application program interface (API), or set of
    interfaces, or have implemented via service-oriented architectures using
    an enterprise service bus, web services, or message queues. Additionally,
    some respondents are using a public key infrastructure for encryption,
    authentication, and authorization. Box 1.4 illustrates key elements of
    Norway’s approach.
4.	 Key nonfunctional requirements. As a critical cornerstone of
    the business regulatory environment, the UBI solution must be




  Box 1.4  Norway’s Innovative Approaches
  Of the jurisdictions studied, Norway’s Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities (CCRLE)
  is the most inclusive of different types of legal entities—including public institutions, companies,
  and sole proprietors. The UBI and related information is freely available through the Brønnøysund
  Register Centre’s (BRC’s) website at http://www.brreg.no/.

  Introduced in 1995, the CCRLE coordinates information on business and industry that resides in
  various public registers, and ensures that all the information is collected in and provided from one
  place. The critical success factors for CCRLE were

  •	   Unique identification of legal entities;
  •	   Extensive and frequent use of the organization number;
  •	   High data quality; and
  •	   Easy access to registered information.

  The Brønnøysund Register Centre has developed a number of innovative services, including
  ELMER (https://altinnett.brreg.no/no/ELMER/), which is a set of user interface guidelines for
  Internet forms, and Altinn (https://www.altinn.no/), which is the public web portal for govern-
  ment services providing interdepartmental cooperation and a toolbox for public authorities and
  agencies to produce and operate their forms and services. In addition, Norway developed the
  innovative SERES (SEmantikk Register for Elektronisk Samhandling), a metadata repository
  for modeling information within a domain in the context of a public operator, service provider,
  or subject. SERES was developed to meet the expectations from individuals, business, politicians,
  and media that information is easily exchanged with and between public institutions. For exam-
  ple, when an entity notifies a public institution of changes of address, all other public institutions
  must be notified of the change.

    designed and developed to support the following key nonfunctional
    requirements:
    ••   High availability. The solution will typically require 24 × 7 availabil-
         ity to support access by all participating government agencies and
         businesses.
    ••   Scalability. The solution must be designed to support expected
         transaction volumes within stated maximum response times and
         ­
         provide the ability to scale (typically through cloud, virtualization, or
         load-balancing technologies) and to meet future needs as transaction
         ­
         volumes increase as a result of broader adoption.
    ••   Reliability. To garner trust, the solution must be reliable and depend-
         able, providing consistent results within an expected response time.
    ••   Recoverability. Backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity
         should be key design and implementation considerations. Downtime
         due to system failure or natural disasters should be avoided.
    ••   Security. The solution must include mechanisms to prevent unautho-
         rized or unintended access to systems, as well as to UBI data while in
         transit or at rest.
    ••   Long-term availability and integrity (aka digital preservation). The
         solution must include mechanisms to ensure that the data remain
         available and trustworthy over time (see ISO 16363 and ISO 14721
         [ISO 2012]).



Challenges Encountered
The governments involved in this study encountered a number of challenges
during or after the implementation of the UBI. The following provides an over-
view of those that were most common or potentially posed the greatest impact:
1.	 Resistance to change. Government organizations and agencies may be
    resistant to implementing the necessary changes to leverage the UBI for
    a number of reasons: inability to see the benefit for their organization,
    impacts to business processes, general opposition to the project, differing
    political agendas, and lack of funding or resources. These challenges can
    be overcome through strong governance, strong senior leadership, and
    change management supported by a clearly articulated and communi-
    cated vision. Depending on the impacts to the organization’s processes
    and technologies, the UBI project may need to make funds and resources
    available to the organizations to facilitate change to adopt the UBI.
2.	 Capacity constraints. In consolidating business registration into a one-stop
    shop, some jurisdictions noted a lack of capacity to deliver the service because
    of unqualified or untrained staff. Again, the project plan and budget should
    explicitly address the need for capacity building to support both the UBI
    solution as well as G2B services being enhanced through the larger reform
    initiative. Some countries, such as Canada, created specialized support units
    to assist stakeholder agencies in capacity building and change management.

3.	 Lack of stakeholder engagement. Normally, the key stakeholder agencies
    involved in the project will understand the long-term vision and benefits
    as well as the objectives and phasing of the project plan. However, other
    agencies and regulators may not share this understanding—leading to
    confusion or resistance. Continuous stakeholder engagement, education,
    and awareness building throughout the project will aid in reducing this
    confusion by enabling participants to understand the larger benefits to
    their agency and to government as a whole.
4.	 Legal roadblocks. Where the UBI is based on an existing identifier (for
    example, tax ID), existing legislation may limit the access to the UBI
    and related information to government organizations—thus preclud-
    ing access to the information by the private sector. Further, the enabling
    legislation for the existing identifier may be limited in scope, requiring
    other agencies adopting the UBI to make further changes in their own
    governing legislation. Although not insurmountable, the need to make
    legislative changes must be factored into the overall project schedule.
    Also, adequate staff and financial resources need to be made available
    to accommodate the required legal reviews and enactment of amended
    legislation or regulations.
5.	 Source data conflicts and lack of trust among stakeholders provid-
    ing business information. Source data for a UBI solution may be based
    on multiple existing systems—primarily tax and business registration
    authorities—that will need to be reconciled, de-duplicated, and cleansed.
    Aside from manual and automated matching routines, one option for
    resolving data conflicts may include the re-registration of all businesses
    during a transition period. In addition, resistance may be encountered
    in some organizations in trusting data updated by other organizations.
    During the establishment of the data governance model, the business
    processes of the various organizations will need to be assessed and data
    updating protocols developed based on the maturity of these processes.
    Tracking of data provenance is essential to ensure trustworthiness of data.
6.	 External stakeholder criticism. This was sometimes observed in coun-
    tries where larger scale reforms were taking place (that is, licensing
    and permitting streamlining in addition to UBI deployment). External
    ­
    stakeholders—especially those from professional associations affected
    by the changes (for example, lawyers and notaries)—can be highly crit-
    ical and may be able to sway their professional communities against the
    initiative. It is important to engage all stakeholders earlier in the devel-
    ­
    opment of the vision to ensure their buy-in to the project. If warranted,
    a more proactive education and awareness campaign as part of a change
    management strategy should be implemented.
7.	 Privacy concerns. Providing access to officer and director i ­ nformation—
    particularly when it is personally identifiable information (for ­ example,
    national ID, name, address, phone numbers)—may pose ­                privacy
    concerns. This is especially true for sole proprietors/traders because
    ­
    the information about their business is directly linked to their personal
    information. Privacy impact assessments should be conducted on the

12	                     Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
    UBI-related information to confirm that appropriate compensating
    controls are in place to reduce or prevent the exposure of personally
    ­
    ­identifiable information.
8.	 Sole proprietors/traders. In some countries, the tax agency may treat a
     sole proprietor/trader with many operating names as a single entity with
     a unique tax identification number (TIN), which may conflict with the
     assignment of UBI when other registries and agencies recognize the com-
     ponent businesses as separate enterprises. Care should be taken during
     the design of the UBI solution to account for potential conflicts such as
     this, adjusting the design to fit the situation.
9.	 Requests for customization of data and business rules. Organizations
     adopting the UBI may insist that they have a unique situation or need for
     additional data, or further customization of data elements or business rules.
     While change is inevitable, it is important to limit customizations for multi-
     ple organizations as it may lead to data maintenance issues in the long term.
     Clearly defined data and IT governance structures and ­     decision-making
     processes will assist in resolving such customization requests.


Implementation Roadmap and Maturity Model
for UBI Deployments
A UBI implementation is normally undertaken in the context of a larger
reform or government simplification initiative, so a standard approach is dif-
ficult to define. However, a set of key activities and issues to be considered in
developing and implementing a UBI have been identified below, organized in
accordance with standard ICT project phases.
1.	 Project Initiation, Organization, and Governance
    •• Ensure the business case for the overarching project includes the
       objectives of introducing a UBI along with critical success factors
       (CSF) and key performance indicators (KPI). For example, one
       objective could be to improve interoperability between government
       organizations. The related CSFs could be the adoption of an interop-
       erability framework and interoperability implementation, position-
       ing the UBI as one of the core enablers. The KPI could be the number
       of government organizations that are exchanging data in providing
       G2G and G2B services.
    •• Analyze whether an existing identifier can be leveraged as the UBI or
       a new business identifier should be introduced. Approaches that pro-
       mote an existing identifier to a UBI (for example, TIN, business regis-
       tration number, or statistical number) require analysis on what steps
       should be taken ensure the uniqueness of this existing number. Also,
       alternative approaches to mapping existing numbers at the agency
       level to the UBI should be evaluated, as well as the required changes
       or upgrades to legacy information systems in these organizations.
    •• Analyze regulatory processes, particularly within the business regis-
       tration ecosystem, including those that are being changed as a result

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                        13
           of the larger reform program. The introduction of the UBI typically
           supports the ­ integration of these processes, for example, allowing
           business, tax, and social security registrations to be consolidated into
           one online application and back office workflow.
      ••   Identify regulations related to existing identifiers, and assess the
           need for legislative changes to introduce a UBI, including possible
           alignment with regional or global initiatives (for example, European
           Union Identifier, GS1 Global Location Numbers [GLN], Legal Entity
           Identifier Regulatory Oversight Committee). An introduction of
           a UBI usually has an impact on identifiers for natural persons (for
           example, sole proprietors); therefore, legislation related to protection
           of personal information and information security also has to be taken
           into account.
      ••   Obtain support for UBI development and deployment at the highest lev-
           els of government and establish the necessary stakeholder support and
           governance structure to ensure its successful implementation. The steer-
           ing group should contain a cross-section of legal and technical knowl-
           edge and adequate organizational representation to address the initial
           UBI deployment; plus, it should be flexible to accommodate future
           expansion of UBI usage. Private sector representation in project gover-
           nance is also beneficial because the UBI should also be an enabler for
           improvements in B2B and B2G transactions in trading and procurement.

2.	 Project Scoping and Requirements Definition
    •• Define the scope of UBI deployment, UBI service delivery model,
       and digital preservation requirements, including the UBI issuer, ser-
       vice providers, interoperability requirements, and organizations that
       will ultimately exchange data and deliver services leveraging the UBI.
       The model selected should specifically address issues around the
       application of UBI to sole proprietorships and mapping with existing
       identifiers (for example, TIN). Another important scope consider-
       ation is whether a UBI should be assigned to public institutions and
       nongovernmental organizations.
    •• Develop use case requirements for the UBI that cover the end-to-end
       process of assigning and canceling a UBI to the differing types of busi-
       ness organizations, including interoperability between the involved gov-
       ernment agencies. In many countries, there are still multiple registries
       across governments registering limited liability companies, sole pro-
       prietorships, and other forms of business and nonprofit organizations.
    •• Ensure nonfunctional requirements for a UBI technical solution partic-
       ularly address availability, reliability, and information security require-
       ments. By nature, a UBI service has to have high availability and provide
       maximum protection of business-sensitive and personal information.
    •• Develop and communicate the overall implementation approach and
       plan. This might be presented in two general phases: implementation
       and deployment. The first phase should cover implementation of a
       UBI issuer service in parallel with the necessary legislative changes

14	                        Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
         and assignments of UBIs to all organizations according to the project
         scope. The second phase should include mapping of existing num-
         bers to the UBI in parallel with the implementation of interoperabil-
         ity across the relevant government ­ databases to achieve higher level
         of data and services quality. This second phase should be planned
         with multiple subphases or iterations to address in a tailored fashion
         the transition of each agency to the UBI.
3.	 Solution Design, Selection, and Acquisition
    •• Design the UBI number according to the business requirements
        identified, considering alignment with regional and global business

                   initiatives. To align with global initiatives, a UBI should be
        identifier ­
        designed to have a country code as a prefix, followed by a business ID
        and possibly a code for the specific registry, and a check digit as a suffix.
    •• Establish or select an agency that will act as the UBI issuer, and design
        an interoperability solution that will act as a hub in assigning UBIs
        through service providers and in enabling updates of key business
        information as well as notification of UBI cancelations.
    •• Design a technology infrastructure that meets the nonfunctional
        requirements for a UBI implementation identified earlier in this note.
    •• Draft legislative amendments needed to introduce the UBI, to address
        interoperability requirements and privacy protection.
4.	 Solution Development, Configuration, and Testing
    •• Develop, configure, and test the UBI issuer solution and an interop-
        erability hub according to the agreed design.
    •• Adopt the legislative amendments needed to implement a UBI.
    •• Make adjustments within existing information systems to be able to
        accept a UBI and map it to existing numbers according to the agreed
        deployment approach.
    •• Develop procedures to enable data conversion from existing sys-
        tems to the UBI.
5.	 Solution Implementation and Rollout
    •• Implement the UBI issuer solution and an interoperability hub enabling
        data exchange with the business registry(ies) and service providers.
    •• Perform data conversions and data cleanup to introduce the UBI
        across participating agencies; assign UBIs to existing organizations
        according to the agreed deployment approach.
    •• Assign UBIs to newly registered organizations according to the
        agreed protocols.
    •• Implement communications and promotional activities regarding
        the UBI and any new integrated services (for example, streamlined
        business registration) introduced along with the UBI solution.
6.	 Post-implementation and Operations
    •• Perform a post-implementation review, and analyze the adequacy,
        benefits, return on investment, and follow-up activities related to the
        ­
        UBI implementation.

      ••   Ensure the sustainability of the UBI solution by ensuring that the
           necessary resources for operations, digital preservation, technology
           improvements, and future enhancements are provided.
  Figure 1.1 below presents a maturity model for UBI implementations based
on the experiences of the countries analyzed for this note.



Conclusions
This note highlights the important legal, operational, and technical consider-
ations for implementing a UBI across government and the approaches taken
by different countries to ensure that their technology solutions met stakehold-
ers’ requirements and were technically and financially sustainable. The country
experiences also provide valuable insight into the non-technological factors
that must be addressed, including the importance of stakeholder engagement,
capacity building, change management, and public communications to the
success of these initiatives. The evidence collected in this analysis indicates
that the successful implementation of the UBI is a significant contributor to
larger efforts at streamlining and integrating G2B service delivery and reduc-
ing compliance costs for the private sector.

countries. The information includes the following:
­
••    2015 Doing Business Ranking. The 2015 Doing Business ranking with
      the change from 2014 ranking within parentheses.
••    UBI Basis. Indicates if another identifier was used as the basis for the
      unique business identifier (UBI).
••    Primary Organization. The primary organization responsible for the
      implementation or management of the UBI.
••    Income level. Based on 2011 gross national income per capita (GNIPC)
      and the following range definitions:
      •• Low: $1,025 or less
      •• Lower middle: $1,026 to $4,035
      •• Upper middle: $4,036 to $12,475
      •• High: $12,476 or more
••    Pop. (M). Population in millions.
••    Impl. Year. The year of initial implementation.
••    Number of UBIs Issued by Entity. As reported by the countries, the
      number of UBIs issued and maintained by type of entity. In some
      instances, these numbers are estimated, while in others these are actuals
      as of a specific date and time.
••    Private Sector. Indicates whether the private sector has access to the
      UBI-related information (N = no; Y = yes).

                                                           a. The Canadian Income Tax (ITA) limits the use of the Business Number (BN) and associated business information to government entities. Thus, the private sector has no legislative authority to require the
                                                           disclosure of the BN; however, this does not prevent the private sector from requesting this information. The value of obtaining this information is unknown because the CRA does not permit the private sector to
                                                           validate or query the CRA on the accuracy of the information disclosed by the business.
                                                           b. The implementation started in 2005, after the State Revenue Service took over the registration procedure from courts. The digitization of existing business registry was done between 2006 and 2007.

Annex 1B UBI Numbering
Schemes
The following provides a sampling of the unique business identifier (UBI)
numbering schemes used in some of the countries included in this study.


Canada
The Canada Revenue Agency Business Number (BN) (figure 1B.1) is made up
of three parts:5
••    A nine-digit BN (BN9) to identify the business at the national level;
••    A two-letter “program identifier,” used to identify the program type,
      which includes information about the specific province and regulatory
      authority using this extended 15-digit identifier; and
••    A four-digit reference number to identify each account a business may
      have within a program type, allowing for subsidiaries of businesses to be
      uniquely identified but still associated with parent companies.

Georgia
In Georgia, the UBI for companies is a nine-digit number. Sole traders are
also assigned an ID, but their ID is the same as their personal identification
number—an 11-digit number.


Jordan
The National Business ID (NBI) in Jordan is a nine-digit number that is pro-
vided by three main directorates based on the type of business (table 1B.1).
The starting digit indicates which directorate assigned the number as well as
the type of business.

                      New Zealand
                      The New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) is a new number using the
                      Global Location Number (GLN) numbering system, which provides busi-
                      nesses with a number that is globally recognized on the basis of interna-
                      tional standards. The use of the GLN standard has the additional benefit of
                      enabling international supply network operations—as evidenced by the
                      early adoption of the NZBN in the private sector to enable B2B ­transactions.
                      The NZBN is a 13-digit number6 consisting of a New Zealand ID (always
                      94 to represent New Zealand), the 10-digit Business Entity ID, and a single
                      check digit.

Annex 1C Doing Business
Impacts
The following sections are supplied to indicate the potential impact that a
unique business identifier (UBI) implementation has in relation to the
Doing Business distance to frontier (DTF) indicator for each country. The
starting a business, getting credit, and paying taxes DTFs were selected
given typical alignment with a government’s motivating factors for imple-
menting a UBI.



Starting a Business DTFs and UBI
Implementation Milestones
The implementation of a UBI in some of the participating countries appears to
have a corollary impact on the country’s starting a business DTF ­  (figure 1C.1).
Given the link between motivating factors (that is, streamlining business start-up
and improving the business environment) and DTF, the benefits appear to have
been realized.



Getting Credit DTFs and UBI
Implementation Milestones
Looking at the getting credit DTF indicator, there does not appear to be a
corollary impact related to a country’s UBI implementation (figure 1C.2).
In fact, in some instances (for example, Albania and Serbia), there is a
decrease in the country’s “Getting Credit” DTF in the year following a UBI
implementation. On the basis of the information collected through this
study, there is insufficient evidence to identify the potential cause for these
decreases.



Paying Taxes DTFs and UBI
Implementation Milestones
Looking at the paying taxes DTF indicator, there does not appear to be a cor-
ollary impact in most countries related to their UBI implementation
(figure 1C.3). The exception is Georgia, which implemented e-filing capabili-
­
ties for all taxes in 2009, leveraging its UBI.

◆ Milestone markers are used to denote when the UBI was implemented for each of the countries. Please note that
implementations in Canada and Norway predate the Doing Business surveys; thus, there are no milestone markers.

2. Albania Case Study
Background
Albania is a parliamentary republic in southeastern Europe in the west of the
Balkan Peninsula with a population of 3.162 million.1 The gross national
 income (GNI) per capita is US$ 4,700, and the income category is ­       upper
­middle income.
    Albania is ranked 68th out of 189 economies in the 2015 Doing Business
 report. Its ranking in the starting a business indicator is 41st, requiring
   procedures and 4.5 days.2 Albania is ranked 97th out of 144 economies in
 5 ­
the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index 2014.3
    According to the information from the Institute of Statistics of Albania
(INSTAT 2015) at the end of 2015, Albania had 112,537 active business
entities, of which 21,153 are limited liability companies and 85,654 sole
­
proprietorships.
    The unique business identifier (UBI) in Albania was introduced between
2005 and 2007 as part of a wider government program (under the Millennium
Challenge Account Threshold Agreement, or MCATA), with goals to improve
Albania’s performance in the control of corruption, fiscal policy and business
start-up indicators (see Chemonics International Inc. 2008). By establishing
the National Registration Center (NRC) in 2007 as one-stop shop for business
registration, the government is able to assign a UBI to any type of entity being
registered at the NRC.4 The UBI is based on the former Tax Number (NIPT)
and is still being issued by the General Directorate of Taxation (GDT); how-
ever, that is now done through the integrated business registration process at
the NRC, allowing for s  ­ imultaneous tax, social insurance, health insurance,
and employment registration.
    The UBI in Albania has 10 characters and is made up of three parts, as illus-
trated in figure 2.1:
••   The first six characters represent a registration date, of which the first
     two represent a year (for example, L0–L9 is 2010–19, L5 is 2015, and
     L19 is 2019), the second two the region and month of registration (for
     example, for Tirana the range is between 13–24, 13 is Tirana in January
     and 24 is Tirana in December), and the last two a registration day.
••   The next three digits represent a sequence number assigned according to
     an algorithm defined by the GDT.
••   The last character is a checksum letter.



Organizational Approach
To manage the MCATA program implementation, a task force was e    ­ stablished
by the government, to be led by the prime minister. The agencies most
involved in the Business Registration Project implemented within the MCATA

program were the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of
Justice. At an operational level, during project implementation, the NRC
worked extensively with the GDT, commercial courts and municipalities.
    By establishing the NRC, the business registration in Albania has been
transferred from the courts to an administrative procedure, contributing to
Albania’s 49-place improvement in the 2009 Doing Business rankings.5 The
NRC began operations in September 2007 and, in addition to the headquar-
ters in Tirana, operates 32 service windows across the country (in munici-
palities and regional Chambers of Commerce and Industry).6 The NRC
service windows only serve to receive applications and dispense final
papers, while the actual decision to approve or reject applications is per-
formed centrally at the NRC office in Tirana. The NRC registration system
allows businesses to be registered within 24 hours. According to the NRC
Annual Report for 2014, 40 percent more businesses were registered in
2014 compared to 2013. As figure 2.2 shows, a similar increase in 2014 was
recorded by INSTAT (2015), with exception that besides registrations done
by the NRC the statistics also include a smaller number of entities that were
registered only by the GDT.
    The NRC information system enables online access to registry informa-
tion (search and extract from the registry) as well as online application
forms and status tracking. Following the implementation of electronic
­signatures, ­e-legislative changes passed in Parliament in February 2015, and
 implementation of the Government Interoperability Platform and e-Albania
 portal, the NRC now offers a range of e-services to businesses including the
 full online business registration and issuance of an electronic registration
 certificate.
    Within the same government program (MCATA), the Business Licensing
 Project has been implemented that resulted in the formation of the National
 Licensing Center (NLC) in 2009. The NLC is a one-stop shop for licensing
 and administers applications for business licenses, permits, and ­authorizations.7
The NLC registry of licenses includes the UBI.
    By establishing the National Agency on Information Society (NAIS) in
2007 (officially inaugurated in May 2008), the government of Albania pro-
vided a counterpart to the NRC and NLC, a national agency that became
the e-government service center (Chemonics International Inc. 2008). The
establishment of the NAIS enabled sustainability of the e-government

                                                   Legislative and Administrative Considerations
                                                    The NRC was established and functions based on Law no. 9723, dated May 3,
                                                    2007, “On the National Registration Center,” as a new Central Public
                                                    Institution. According to Article 60 (“Unique Identification Number of the
                                                    Entity”) in the Law, entities are given a unique identification number. The
                                                    same article prescribes that the UBI is valid for the identification of the entity
                                                    for the purpose of registration in the Register, as well as for the purpose of
                                                    registration with the local and national tax authorities, the social security and
                                                    healthcare schemes, and employment and for any other statistical or identifi-

                                                    and termination of companies is Law no. 9901 “On Entrepreneurs and
                                                    Commercial Companies,” effective as of May 21, 2008 (KPMG Albania

all entrepreneurs and commercial companies that carry out business activ-
ity in Albania should register with the Commercial Register maintained by
the NRC.



Implementation Approach
The establishment of the NRC included the following activities (see box 2.1
for an outline of the planned outcomes):
••    Legislative changes (discussed within the previous section)
••    Purchase of hardware for the main facility and the design of an integrated
      network system of regionally located service windows
••    Preparation of standardized forms for business registration
••    Implementation of the registry information technology (IT) platform
••    Migratration of existing registration records from commercial courts
••    Development of service level agreements with municipalities and
      chambers
The IT platform at the NRC that includes the e-Register system and web
portal was implemented using the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software
­
product10 (discussed in annex 2C). The data exchange interfaces were
established between the GDT and the NRC to enable issuance of the UBI and
­
exchange of the registration records. For the registration of a new business
entity, the UBI is delivered automatically from the GDT to the NRC using
web services. The registration of a business with the NRC also includes inte-
grated registration with the social and health insurance authorities and the
labor ­inspectorate. The UBI is used for all these registrations. Figure 2.3
provides an overview of the revised process.
­
  Implementation of a new business registration system required migration
and digitization of existing registration records from commercial courts,
which dated from 1991 and included over 1 million pages.




     Box 2.1  Planned Outcomes
     The planned outcomes of the Business Registration Project include

     •	 Streamlined business registration processes;
     •	 Reduced cost and time required for business registration and related matters;
     •	 Decreased administrative discretion in business registration;
     •	 Decreased size of the informal economy;
     •	 Improved fiscal posture through increased collection of taxes and social security contribu-
        tions; and
     •	 Reduced corruption in business registration and the judicial system.

   The Business Registration Project was aligned with the national informa-
tion and communication technology (ICT) strategy and framework for
2008–13. The Strategy on the Information Society was approved by the
Council of Ministers by Decision No. 59 dated January 1, 2009. The Cross-
Cutting Strategy, among other initiatives, has followed the eSEE Agenda Plus
(Regional Cooperation Council, Electronic South Eastern Initative 2007) that
puts emphasis on the development of the national interoperability frame-
works in the context of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF).



Challenges Encountered
The following challenges were encountered within the Business Registration
Project that implemented the UBI in Albania:
••    Resistance to transforming registration into a purely administrative
      process, mostly by lawyers and the courts. Also, certain institutions were
      ­
      reluctant to forgo their powers. For example, support of the GDT for the
      reform was secured partly because the tax ID was selected as the UBI and
      continues to be issued by the GDT, although now as a part of the one-stop
      registration procedure provided by the NRC.
••    Linking the new NRC registration system with the legacy systems of the
      GDT and other registration agencies, so that information in these agen-
      cies could be updated daily.
••    Transfer, automation, and integration of existing registration records,
      which dated from 1991.
••    Lack of internal capacity within the NRC, which required intensive
      capacity building.
Three critical success factors were identified:
••    Government showed great persistence and commitment to achieving
      project goals.
••    Government put in place new policies, created new institutions, and
      reoriented other institutions toward the efficient delivery of public
      services.
••    Government emphasized the use of IT to improve the transparency and
      efficiency of public services.



Benefits Realized
The following benefits have been realized as a result of the integrated registra-
tion and implementation of the UBI:
••    Reduced time to register a business from 25 days to 1 day.
••    Increased efficiency and customer service through the integrated regis-
      tration procedure, including tax registration, registration for social insur-
      ance and health insurance, and registration with the labor inspectorate.

                     ••   Increased transparency in government and the private sector, including
                          publicly available company information and financial statements.
                     ••   Increased data sharing across government agencies and implementation
                          of a range of government e-services over the e-Albania portal that use the
                          UBI (application for a business license, company information and finan-
                          cial statements, and online business registration).



                     Summary
                     Reform of the business registration process in Albania was a significant step
                     toward achieving the overall goal of improving the business environment.
                     The introduction of the NRC and implementation of the UBI produced a
                     streamlined, less expensive, and faster process for business registration, allow-
                     ing for simultaneous tax, social insurance, health insurance, and labor direc-
                     torate registration, using a single, standardized application procedure and a
                     UBI issued to all business entities.
                        The success of the introduction of the NRC is reflected in significant
                     improvements on a series of indicators, including the World Bank’s Doing
                     Business Indicators. As a result of the reform, Albania was named as “Top
                     Reformer of the Year” for 2009 by Doing Business. The improved environ-
                     ment for business registration led to a surge in new business registrations
                     after the NRC was implemented in 2007, posting an initial annual growth rate
                     of close to 20 percent (Melikyan 2012). Table 2.1 shows the indicators, base-
                     line, target, and reported results by the Albania Threshold Programs.
                        The Business Registration project and the UBI implementation provided
                     the ability for the implementation of the e-Albania portal and the Government
                     Interoperability Platform, which enabled the integrated e-government
                     services in Albania.

Annex 2C Architecture and
Technology
At the National Registration Center (NRC), the e-Register software applica-
tion supports the back office registration process. It resides on the NRC local
area network (LAN) and the service windows in municipalities are con-
nected via wide area network (WAN). The system also includes a public
portal (www.qkr.gov.al) as well as a series of web services that facilitate data
­
transmission between the NRC and the Public Procurement Agency (PPA),
the General Directorate of Taxation (GDT), and the National Licensing
Center (NLC).11 The technology used consists of Web Assembler.NET®
Application Server from the DotGov Solutions (formerly Alfa XP Web
Software Alpha XP BPMS COTS platform), Microsoft Windows 2003 Server
(Standard Edition), and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 (Standard Edition).
   The National Agency on Information Society (NAIS), supported by the
European Union (EU), has implemented the Government Gateway project

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                           35
3. Canada Case Study
Background
Canada is a high-income nation, with a federal parliamentary government
comprising 10 provinces and three territories and a population of 35 million
people. Although Canada has not implemented a unique business identifier
(UBI), the use of the Canada Revenue Agency’s (CRA’s) Business Number
(BN) across business programs, at all levels of government, has given the BN
the look and feel of being the UBI for Canada. There are c­ urrently 6.5 million
businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, trusts, associa-
tions, societies, religious bodies, unions, universities/schools, hospitals,
financial institutions, and municipal governments) in Canada.
   Canada ranks 16th out of 189 economies in the 2015 Doing Business report1
and second in the starting a business indicator, requiring only one procedure
to register a business. In the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global
Competitiveness Index 2014,2 Canada ranks 14th out of 144 economies.
   The BN was first introduced in 1994 by the CRA to identify its core ­business
programs, including Corporation Tax, Goods and Services Tax (GST),
Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), and Payroll Tax. Since its initial ­implementation
as a tax program identifier, the service has evolved to include three federal
programs, six provinces, and one municipality, which have adopted the BN
to  provide integrated registration, reduce the administrative burden on
­
businesses, and uniquely identify businesses within their regulatory
jurisdictions.
   The BN is made up of three parts, as shown in figure 3.1. (CRA, n.d.):
••   A nine-digit BN (BN9) to identify the business at the national level
••   A two letter “program identifier,” used to identify the program type,
     which includes information about the specific province and regulatory
     authority, using this extended 15-digit identifier
••   A four-digit reference number to identify each account a business may
     have within a program type, allowing for subsidiaries of businesses to be
     uniquely identified but still associated with parent companies
Currently, there is an initiative underway to investigate the ability to fully
leverage the BN as a UBI within Canada—a testament to the evolutionary
aspect of the UBI journey in Canada.



Organizational Approach
The CRA was the sole government entity involved in the implementation of
the BN in the early 1990s. Within the CRA, the BN required the introduction
of both headquarters and field office units to support the policy and opera-
tional administration of the BN within CRA; this function has subsequently
evolved to support the BN partners as well.

Source: CRA, n.d.


  Today, the CRA leads the operational organization and has created two
committees, comprising partner representatives, to govern strategic and
operational aspects of the BN:
1.	 The BN Partnership Committee includes director-level participation
    across the jurisdictional members and meets twice per year to discuss
    strategic topics.
2.	 The BN Operational Committee, comprising partner/jurisdictional
    operational management, meets monthly to discuss day-to-day issues
    and topics as necessary.
Currently, the BN Partners include Industry Canada (IC); Public Works and
Government Services Canada (PWGSC); the Canada Borders Services
Agency (CBSA); the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,
Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia; and the municipality of Winnipeg
in Manitoba.


Legislative and Administrative Considerations
As previously noted, the CRA required additional staff to manage policy and
operational needs of the BN. The federal Income Tax Act (ITA),3 Excise Tax
Act,4 and Excise Act 20015 did require amendments to allow the BN and asso-
ciated information, which is defined as taxpayer information, to be provided
to other government entities.
   In addition to federal legislative changes, each implementing partner/­
program must also assess its legislative instruments to determine what
changes are required to allow it to receive the BN and associated business
information from the CRA. For example, the Province of Nova Scotia origi-
nally enacted the Business Electronic Filing Act6 and the Business Registry
Regulations7 to allow programs to adopt and use the BN and related
information.


Implementation Approach
Essentially a tax identifier, the BN is commonplace within the programs (for
example, corporation tax, GST, HST, and payroll) of the CRA; however, as
time has passed, the BN has been adopted by other government entities at all
levels of government. While the implementation and migration differs by

38	                            Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
partner, guidelines and services have been developed to assist partners adopt
the BN, including the following:

••   Advice on the order of adopting programs (incorporating bodies,
     business/company registry, tax, workers’ compensation)
     ­
••   Estimated implementation timelines
••   Data mapping and search services
••   Architecture (application, communications, and information) requirements
••   Operational responsibilities

Additionally, the CRA works with each new partner to guide it through the
process and provides services to assist in data matching (automated or ­manual)
and testing. Regarding data matching, CRA will work with p     ­ artners to match
existing business entities to records within CRA based on the ­   partner’s infor-
mation. The partner itself may not have recorded (or  been p         ­ ermitted to
record) the BN. Therefore, matching may be based on business entity names,
addresses, officers, and so on. Once a match has been identified, the BN part-
ner sends an electronic message to the CRA to request that a 15-digit BN be
created for each client record.
   The CRA BN architecture is multilayered hub and spoke with the CRA act-
ing as the hub and each province, territory, or federal partner as a spoke on
the wheel. Provincial programs, including municipalities, within each prov-
ince or territory must connect through the provincial or territorial hub. The
CRA’s recommendation is that the provincial or territorial ­        incorporating
authority—or the business or company registry—be one of the first programs
to adopt the BN because they are a primary ­    information source on business
life events. However, partners have elected  to begin with other programs
because of their state of readiness or funding issues.
   The CRA BN communications architecture allows for bidirectional com-
munication (through web services and message queues) between the spokes
and the hub to maintain information related to businesses, including business
name, business trade name, business status, director information, and pro-
gram status. Programs that have adopted the BN retain the ability to access
and modify their program-specific data within their own systems, but updates
to the BN are limited to authoritative sources and the CRA.
   Currently, the BN information (in particular, owner information) is not
linked to any national individual identifier, nor is it used in the private sector
such as in credit registries or mortgage or moveable collateral ­        registries.
However, the BN is widely used by business for interacting with government
counterparts such as company registries, workers ­      compensation and safety
agencies, and licensing, permitting, and ­  inspection agencies.



Challenges Encountered
The CRA and its BN partners experience issues in being unable to share the
BN and associated business information among all business programs that
would like access to this information. The ITA limits the use of the BN and

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                         39
associated business information, which is considered taxpayer informa-
tion, to government entities (see box 3.1 for definition). This means that
the private sector has no legislative authority to require the disclosure of
the BN—neither the CRA nor any of the BN partners provide a means to
search by or for the BN. However, this does not prevent the private sector
from requesting this information. The value of obtaining this information
is unknown because the CRA does not permit the private sector to validate
or query the CRA on the accuracy of the information disclosed by the
business.
   Additionally, each new partner that wishes to use the BN as its identifier
must make legislative changes to be able to receive this information from
the CRA. For example, the Province of Nova Scotia originally enacted the
Business Electronic Filing Act8 and the Business Registry Regulations9 that
limited, by act, the programs that could use the BN. Nova Scotia is cur-
rently reviewing this legislation to enable broader usage by government
entities.
   Finally, since its inception in 1994 and initial adoption by Nova Scotia
in the late 1990s, other partners have adopted the BN. However, a clear set
of partnership models that governed the relationship, services, data
model, and business rules was not initially developed; as a result, there
have been a number of custom integrations across all aspects of the tech-
nology solution to accommodate partner requirements. CRA is working
toward creating standardized models to more effectively integrate new
partners.




  Box 3.1  Government Entity Definition
  According to the Income Tax Act, p 3021-2, government entity means

  	   (a)	 A department or agency of the government of Canada or of a province,
  	   (b)	 A municipality in Canada,
  	   (c)	 An aboriginal government,
  	   (d)	A corporation all of the shares (except directors’ qualifying shares) of the capital stock of
           which are owned by one or more persons each of which is
  	        (i)	 Her Majesty in right of Canada,
  	        (ii)	 Her Majesty in right of a province,
  	        (iii)	 A municipality in Canada, or
  	        (iv)	 A corporation described in this paragraph, or
  	   (e)	A board or commission, established by Her Majesty in right of Canada or Her Majesty
           in right of a province, that performs an administrative or regulatory function of govern-
           ment, or by one or more municipalities in Canada, that performs an administrative or
           regulatory function of a municipality.

Benefits Realized
The success of the BN, even with challenges related to government entity
usage and legislative change, has enabled the CRA and its partners to realize
numerous benefits:

••   Reduced time to register a business through integrated registrations with
     partners. Businesses can incorporate or register with a jurisdiction, and
     basic business information is transmitted to the CRA to complete pro-
     gram registration. Conversely, after registering with the CRA, businesses
     can also register or apply for Ontario, Nova Scotia, and British Columbia
     program accounts.
••   Reduced administrative burden for entrepreneurs by allowing businesses
     to spend less time dealing with government and more time building their
     business and creating jobs. Over 100 program areas have adopted the BN
     across Canada. The number of programs that have adopted the BN varies
     across the provinces, as highlighted in table 3.1.
••   Increased government efficiency—the business community is supportive
     of initiatives that result in a leveling of the playing field and better
     service.
••   Increased data sharing among participating programs within the legislative
     framework. In some provinces (for example, British Colombia, Manitoba,
     and Nova Scotia), the BN is used as the identifier across workers’ compen-
     sation and safety agencies, and licensing, permitting, and inspection solu-
     tions to reduce duplicate data entry and identify potential compliance issues.
With a continued adoption of the BN by agencies, the benefits realized are
expected to grow.

Summary
The BN was implemented to provide business entities with a simplified, acces-
sible, and faster process to register with the CRA—to facilitate reduction of
red tape for businesses. Although the use of the BN is not mandated, the CRA
regularly receives inquiries from potential partners (typically the remaining
provinces and territories, and larger municipalities) as they are embarking on
other initiatives (for example, back office redesign or enhancements, online
portals, and so on) where an existing UBI could be used or leveraged to meet
their objectives.
   Finally, the CRA is involved in a federal initiative related to increasing the
adoption of the BN by federal government departments and programs that may
see the realization of the BN as a truly common business identifier—the BN and
its associated information being the foundation of a business entity’s identity.

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                      47
4. Georgia Case Study
Background
Georgia is a democratic republic situated at the crossroads of Western Asia and
Eastern Europe. It is bounded to the west by the Black Sea, to the north by
Russia, to the south by Turkey and Armenia, and to the southeast by Azerbaijan.
The population of Georgia is 4.476 million,1 the gross national income (GNI)
per capita is US$3,570, and the income category is lower ­   middle income.
   Georgia ranked 15th out of 189 economies in the 2015 Doing Business
report.2 The ranking in the starting a business indicator is fifth, requiring two
procedures and two days to start a business. Georgia is ranked 69th out of
144 economies in the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness
Index 2014.3
   According to information received from the National Agency of Public
Registry (NAPR), in the first quarter of 2015, Georgia had 155,065 companies,
388,804 sole proprietorships, 20,007 nonprofit companies, and 8,445 other
entities.
   The unique business identifier (UBI) in Georgia was introduced as part of
a  wider government program, which started with the Business Registration
Reform Project in 2006. Besides the business registration reform, the pro-
gram  included the establishment of the centralized tax system in Georgia,
digital  civil registry, digital property registry, development of the Georgian
­
Governmental Network and establishment of the Data Exchange Agency
(DEA) (Gvenetadze 2011). One of the key issues tackled in the Business
Registration Reform Project was the practice of issuing two unique identifi-
cation numbers to every business at registration (Chemonics International
Inc. 2009).
   When the project started, the responsibility for business registration had
just been transferred from the courts to the former Ministry of Finance Tax
Department, transforming business registration from a judicial to an admin-
istrative procedure. However, starting a business in that time still required
that both business and tax registration be done as two separate administrative
procedures, resulting in the issuance of two business identifiers to every
business. The registration required two (largely redundant) application
­
procedures and involved a laborious process of 21 days, requiring eight
­
­
documents, notarization, payment of minimum capital, and fabrication of an
official company seal, resulting in the low rate of business registration in
Georgia. As a result of the transfer of business registration to the State Revenue
Service (SRS) as well as the unification and the streamlining of the business
and tax registration processes, Georgia witnessed a significant increase in the
number of businesses registered: from 222,421 on October 1, 2005 to 370,902
by May 31, 2009, for an increase of 67 percent. Figure 4.1 shows the annual
growth since NAPR was established in 2010.
   This was followed by establishment of the NAPR under the Ministry of
Justice, which from 2010 took over the registration of sole proprietorships and

  other legal entities (for example, limited liability companies, joint stock com-
  panies, partnerships, and cooperatives) through its one-stop shop. Sole propri-
  etorships are provided with their UBI by the SRS; this is the same as the owner’s
  personal identification number and contains 11 digits. The NAPR provides the
  UBI for other legal entities within a single registration for both registration
  and tax purposes. The UBI issued for legal entities contains nine digits and is
  issued electronically using the NAPR registration software. The UBI numbers
  provide a more transparent, flexible system and reduce the likelihood of
  inaccuracies. The UBI is unchangeable; it can only be canceled as the result of
  ­
  the termination of the entity (liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy).
     The NAPR registration service is available in the municipal community
  centers, the territorial registration offices, at the Public Service Hall, and
  online though the my.gov.ge portal. The Public Service Hall (http://psh.gov.ge)
  is a modern, electronic one-stop shop in Georgia for most public services (for
  example, passport, visa, birth registration, property registration, enforcement
  services, archive services).



  Organizational Approach
  In 2004 the Office of the State Minister on Reforms Coordination was estab-
  lished to serve as the central coordination point for all reforms instituted
  across the government. The decree signed by the prime minister at that time
  created the project steering committee of deputy minister–level officials from
  all government agencies concerned with the business environment.

   The legislative changes that streamlined business and tax registration allow
for a single-window registration and one unified business and tax identification
number. The Law on the SRS united the tax, customs, and financial police within
one agency under the Ministry of Finance. The SRS took over the responsibility
of business registration from the courts in 2005, and since 2010, the NAPR has
become the single registration authority for all legal entities in Georgia.
   System interoperability was initially implemented in 2009 between NAPR,
SRS, and the civil registry; when an NAPR registrar enters a citizen or busi-
ness identification number into a form, the other business information is
automatically entered from the civil and business registry databases. Electronic
data exchange, also introduced through legislation and improved informa-
tion technology (IT) systems, enabled communication and information shar-
ing between the tax administration and other government agencies, financial
institutions and the public.
   In parallel with other reform initiatives, between 2006 and 2009, the
­
conceptual and legal basis of the DEA were established. The DEA was estab-
lished in 2010 and implemented the government data exchange hub (G3, or
Georgian Government Gateway), which integrated and unified all govern-
ment services and enabled implementation of the citizen-centric approach
to the delivery of public services. The following government-to-business
(G2B) systems were implemented in Georgia that use the UBI: e-Procure-
ment, e-Auction, e-Filing, e-Invoice, e-Appeals, e-Stamp, e-Construction
Permits, e-Notary, online business registration, business and property
e-abstracts and other online registries. Figure 4.2 describes the e-Govern-
­
ment management model in Georgia.



Legal and Administrative Considerations
The Law on the State Revenue Service established the SRS agency under
the Ministry of Finance that took over the registration procedure from the
courts in 2005 and streamlined the registration procedure by using a single

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                     51
UBI number. The NAPR, a legal entity under the Ministry of Justice of
Georgia, was established according to the Law of Georgia on State Registry
of  June 1, 2004, and took over the business registration from the Revenue
Service in 2010.
   The assignment of a unique business identification number is regulated
under Article 12 of the Entrepreneur (legal) Persons Registration Regulations
(December 31, 2009, Minister of Justice Instruction N241); amendments
to  the Law on Entrepreneurs have facilitated the process for starting a
business.



Implementation Approach
The following activities are directly related to the reformed business and
tax  registration process that also introduced the single UBI (Chemonics
International Inc. 2009):
••    Expedited business start-up and exit procedures through the new legal
      framework for business start-up and closure provided by the Law on
      Entrepreneurs
••    Implementation of unified, streamlined business and tax registration,
      which streamlined two registration processes (business and tax) into one
      process, one unique number, and one application form
••    Implementation of an online business registry database, that included the
      digitization of paper-based information received from the courts
••    Availability of electronic abstracts for business registration, allowing
      information exchange automation between the government and banks
   The NAPR has an online business portal and provides online access to
information about registered legal entities (such as initial registrations,
changes in registration and in key officers and directors, reorganization of a
business). Any person may inspect the information provided by the registry
and obtain an extract from the Registry data.4 The NAPR is one of the first
state bodies to introduce an ISO/IEC 27001 information security ­management
system.
   Any information about the UBI is available on the portal and is free of
charge. A request to prepare an extract from the registry can be submitted
online by an interested person, and this e-service is cheaper than the offline
price.5
   During the period 2005–09, there were many other related ­  e-Government
                                                                  e-signatures,
and interoperability initiatives, including the implementation of ­
data exchange interfaces between government agencies and adoption of rele-
vant e-legislation. The e-Document and e-Signature laws were adopted in
2007, and e-ID cards were introduced with digital identities and electronic
signatures. Planning and establishment of the DEA was also undertaken.
   The e-Georgia Strategy and Action Plan 2014–18 was developed with six
mission statements derived from the vision, which led to eleven thematic
priorities. Within the Enabling Frameworks & Governance thematic priority
­

52	                      Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
is the establishment of a proper interoperability framework, which ensures
smooth interaction among the actors in e-Government and exploitation of
the full potential of government data.
   The European Union (EU) twinning program “Promote the Strengthening
of E-Governance in Georgia,” supported the implementation of the interoper-
ability framework for Georgia6 and the introduction of the interoperability
framework according to the European Interoperability Framework as part of
the e-Georgia Strategy and Action Plan 2014–18 (Krabina et al. [2013]).



Challenges Encountered
The transfer of business registration to the SRS and unification with the tax
administration gave rise to several problems because the SRS lacked the
institutional capacity required to deliver streamlined business registration.
Starting a business required both business and tax registration—two separate
processes, in two different locations, requiring two (largely redundant) appli-
cation procedures, resulting in the issuance of two unique identification
numbers to every business. Line officers were unprofessional, unqualified,
and inexperienced in registering businesses, resulting in guidance and imple-
mentation that were often arbitrary, burdensome, and unpleasant. The SRS
relied upon an unstable and largely insecure IT system that used illegal soft-
ware and was incapable of performing basic business processes effectively.
The entire registration process was paper based. Archives from the courts,
including more than 50,000 registrations, were received in boxes full of
poorly organized documents. No electronic services were available, and no
electronic registration data were kept internally, let alone available to other
agencies or the public.
   With legal and regulatory streamlining as well as improved technology, the
SRS developed its institutional capacity to handle business registrations. Line
officers were trained in customer service and improved business registration
procedures. The SRS also implemented recommended initiatives on IT per-
formance optimization and security measures, and procured hardware and
licenses for software, which ultimately created a fully electronic business
registry. The project digitized all prior paper-based registrations so that the
­
e-registry was completely current, listing all registered businesses in Georgia.
The online business registry allowed for the printing of electronic abstracts
that have the same legal enforceability as paper documents.
   The SRS has established mechanisms for engaging the public in dialogue on
business registration procedures, including the following:
••   A trained cadre of journalists are more capable of reporting accurately
     on starting a business in Georgia, both informing the public of reforms
     and informing the public and tax administration of challenges and
     reform needs.
••   The SRS started communicating with businesses regarding new electronic
     services provided to taxpayers and received comments from the business

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                     53
       sector on how to improve those services. Several meetings and trainings
       have occurred with banks, private companies, and taxpayers to educate
       them on electronic services offered by SRS.



Benefits Realized
The following benefits have been realized:
••     Reduced time to register a business (from 25 to 2 days) and reduced
       ongoing administrative burden for entrepreneurs
••     Introduction of risk-based compliance monitoring, resulting in improved
       tax compliance
••     Better adherence to public procurement rules by implementing an
       e-Procurement system that uses the data from the business registry to
       ­
       validate vendor information
••     Increased efficiency for government by implementing a citizen-centric
       approach to the delivery of public services through my.gov.ge portal
••     Increased data sharing by implementing the G3 government data exchange
       hub—leveraging improvements in the Georgian Governmental Network,
       business and property registration, and number of successful IT projects
••     Improved data accuracy
     Figure 4.3 summarizes the G2B services enabled with support of the UBI.


Summary
The introduction of the UBI contributed to the highly successful imple-
mentation of the interoperability platform (G3) and improved G2B service
delivery. Today, Georgia has one of the most advanced, citizen-centric array
­
of e-Government services in the world.

Annex 4C Architecture and
Technology
The technologies used include cloud, enterprise service bus, digital signature,
master data management, mobile, notification support, and custom-­   developed
and commercial off-the-shelf software. Since the beginning of the business
registration reform and introducing of the unique business identifier (UBI),
a number of technological improvements were made to enable government
e-services, interoperability, and information security. The Data Exchange
Agency (DEA) implemented an advanced interoperability ­platform—Georgia
Government Gateway (G3) that represents a universal infrastructure con-
necting government agencies, businesses, and organizations into a single
network (see figure 4C.1). Key technologies used are Microsoft Windows,
­
BizTalk Server, and SQL Server. In 2012 all e-services available for citizens
and ­business were united using the portal www.my.gov.ge.
   The National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) introduced a cloud infra-
structure using Open Stack. In addition, the DEA created, in accordance
with the Law on Unified State Registry of Information, the unified Registry
of  Registers that centralized information about databases, services, and
information systems within the public sector. This supports streamlined and
­
seamless data exchange among government agencies.

5. Jordan Case Study
Background
Jordan1 has a parliamentary system of government with a hereditary monar-
chy2 and is situated on the East Bank of the Jordan River. The population is
7.009 million,3 the gross national income (GNI) per capita is US$4,950, and
the income category is upper middle income.4
   Jordan is ranked 117th out of 189 economies in the 2015 Doing Business
report. Its ranking in the starting a business indicator is 86th, requiring 7 proce-
dures and 12 days to start a business. Jordan is ranked 64th out of 144 econo-
mies in the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index 2014.5
   According to the information received from the Companies Control
Department6 (CCD), in the first quarter of 2015 Jordan had 57,400 compa-
nies and about 100,000 sole proprietorships.7
   There are two registries managed by the Ministry of Industry and Trade
(MIT): (i) the sole proprietor registry, which is managed within the Ministry,
and  (ii) the company registry managed by the CCD. In 2005 the government
decided to introduce the National Business ID (NBI) to reduce duplication in
business identifiers and better enable government partners to share data. This
effort was mandated through a Prime Ministry8 circular and implemented in 2008.
   The NBI in Jordan is a nine-digit number, and there are three main
directorates in Jordan that provide the NBI based on the type of business. The
­
CCD provides the NBI for companies that register (the NBI starts with “2”), the
MIT provides it for sole proprietorships (the NBI starts with “1”), and the Free
Zones Company (FZC)9 provides it for businesses under their jurisdiction (the
NBI starts with “3”). The main goals of the NBI are summarized in box 5.1.


Organizational Approach
The mandate from the Prime Ministry authorized MIT, CCD, and FZC to
issue the new NBI and also required its adoption across all government agen-
cies. The MIT and CCD led this effort, in cooperation with related depart-
ments and partners. Chambers and associations were also part of the Steering
Committee,10 which included the following:
••   Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MOICT)
••   Free Zones Company (FZC)
••   Income and Sales Tax Department (Tax Department)
••   Jordan Customs (Customs Department)
••   Social Security Corporation (SSC)
••   Greater Amman Municipality (GAM)
••   Jordan Chamber of Commerce (JOCC)
••   Jordan Chamber of Industry
••   Department of Statistics (DOS)
••   Representatives of municipalities

  Box 5.1  Goals of Introducing the National Business ID in Jordan
  The main goals of introducing the NBI in Jordan were to

  •	   Remove duplications and data errors in existing registrations;
  •	   Enable information sharing among government institutions;
  •	   Reduce time and costs for new registrations; and
  •	   Create more efficient and precise ways to search for information about business entities.




The NBI implementation did not result in organizational changes; the MIT
assigned e-service officers to process online applications, and online access
was made available for partners to provide their inputs.



Legal and Administrative Considerations
There have been no legislative changes required thus far; the initiative was
implemented under a mandate from the Prime Ministry. However, many
legal and regulatory changes to enable online interactions with government
were separately implemented.
   There may be a need for further legal changes as professional businesses
(for example, doctors and lawyers) are currently required to register with the
Chamber of Commerce, which uses the tax ID number as the business
identifier.



Implementation Approach
MIT and CCD worked in cooperation with the MOICT (e-Government
Program and the National Information Technology Center) to develop and
deploy the technology architecture supporting the NBI. This was part of a
larger project that established a new online platform for business registration,
which was implemented in 2007; as of January 1, 2008, the NBI was assigned
to all Jordanian businesses.
   The MIT and CCD were the lead implementers, working with the Tax
Department, GAM, Customs Department, and SSC. The project was divided
into phases in order to cover all the types of businesses being registered. The
first phase involved sole proprietors and companies, followed by the imple-
mentation of the FZC registrations. However, the next phase, which will
introduce the NBI for other businesses (for example doctors, lawyers, and
engineers), has not yet commenced.
   In deploying the NBI, the MIT and CCD in 2007 started issuing it to any
existing company requesting a service. As of January 1, 2008, the NBI was
assigned to all registered businesses. The CCD automatically assigned the


60	                       Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
NBI to all companies that they knew to be active. Using the Jordan Business
Newspaper, local newspapers and other media channels, companies were
requested to visit the CCD to update their registration and obtain the NBI.
The CCD and its partner agencies also agreed that any services related to
registering a new business would require the NBI.
­
   As MIT and CCD connected their systems with those of their partners,
mapping of the NBI to the citizen ID and other legacy identifiers was under-
taken. For example, a search in the tax registry can now be done using a
personal ID or a tax ID number, and the result will display the NBI and other
­
related information. Likewise, searches using the NBI would reveal the tax ID
and related information.
   The government partners can directly access the MIT and CCD databases
to obtain the information data they need, and some are able to change a busi-
ness entity status flag in the system. Government partners use this to enforce
compliance; for example, if a business entity is suspended by the Tax
Department, the MIT and CCD systems can be updated to reflect this. The
business owner then cannot obtain services at the MIT or CCD until the issue
is resolved.
   An additional initiative that supported the NBI implementation came from
the MOICT e-Government Program, which introduced an interoperability
scheme under which government entities that require information from the
commercial registry must use the NBI. There are several government entities
accessing data using a direct connection to the MIT and CCD IT systems,
including the following:
••   GAM through the e-License system using a web service
••   Tax Department
••   Amman Chamber of Commerce
••   Royal Court
••   Department of Statistics
••   Jordan Customs
In addition, e-services of certain government agencies that are currently
being developed are being designed in a way to use the NBI, including the
following:
••   Department of Land and Surveys
••   Ministry of Labor
••   Ministry of Health
••   Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities
••   Investment Portal
Also, the e-Government Program is currently working on integrating web
services using the enterprise service bus (ESB) that provides a central middle-
ware for data exchange; the Amman Chamber of Commerce is already
benefiting from the MIT web service over the ESB.
­
   For all users, the CCD has enabled online access to the registry through
its Internet portal.11 The various search options include company name,


Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                    61
partner name, NBI, registration date, personal ID, nationality, and so on.
The MIT also implemented an online service to register sole proprietor-
ships.12 The national portal (Jordan.gov.jo) provides a gateway to all
governmental ­
­              services provided to citizens, businesses, visitors, and
other users.



Challenges Encountered
The resistance to using the NBI as a main reference ID came mainly
from government agencies that did not want to adapt their legacy systems.
The Prime Ministry circular was enforced and helped to overcome this
challenge; however, even today there is resistance to expanding the use
of NBI.
   One other challenge was classifying sole proprietors because MIT allowed
one individual to register more than one business. The Tax Department sees
the owner as one taxpayer regardless of the entities he has registered under his
name. This required much effort from the Tax Department to map the identi-
fiers. They internally introduced the concept of a “tax line” to distinguish
from which source taxes are received from a given taxpayer.



Benefits Realized
The introduction of the NBI should be considered partly successful, ­especially
in removing existing duplications within the CCD and MIT registries. In
addition, the following benefits were identified:
••    For the Tax Department, the NBI improved communications with stake-
      holders, reduced costs, and supported improved tax compliance.
••    For financial institutions, the NBI is used in accessing required informa-
      tion about businesses.
••    For businesses, the time and cost of registering a business have decreased.
••    Other benefits include reduced corruption in public procurement,
      increased efficiency within government, increased data sharing, and
      increased data quality in many institutions.



Summary
Even though the introduction of the NBI brought certain benefits, the
project is not yet finished; the business registration process requires more
streamlining and improvements. Interoperability within government
increased by introducing both the NBI and the ESB; however, it seems that
the lack of the interoperable IT solutions in some government agencies
has prevented the government from realizing the full potential of the
platform.


62	                       Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
   The overall level of cooperation among stakeholders during the NBI rollout
was not optimal because many had to change their existing systems and the
way they worked.
   Certain businesses are not assigned an NBI (for example, engineering
offices, government entities, doctors, and lawyers); therefore, a complete
migration and transition to the NBI as a single unique ID for all businesses is
not yet completed.

Technology
The technologies used include enterprise service bus (ESB), custom-­
developed, and commercial off-the-shelf software. The ESB is maintained at
the national level by the Ministry of Information and Communication
Technology (MOICT) e-Government Program. Currently, the ESB has 21
e-services implemented, including MIT and CCD services. The MOICT
e-Government Program developed the ESB, which provides a service-­oriented
infrastructure that enables large-scale implementation of the SOA principles
in a manageable, heterogeneous environment, as summarized in Figure 5C.1.
The ESB implements other value added capabilities such as delivery assurance
and security.
  The e-Government Strategy for 2014–16 does not explicitly include the
National Business ID (NBI) initiative. However, it is embedded in other high-
level concepts and initiatives.

6. New Zealand Case Study
Background
 New Zealand is a unitary parliamentary government with 67 territorial
 authorities and 11 regional councils, and a population of 4.6 million.
 ­
 New Zealand is ranked 1st out of 189 economies in the starting a business
 indicator in the 2015 Doing Business report.1 Its overall ease of doing
­business ­ranking was ­second. In the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global
 Competitiveness Index 2014, New Zealand is ranked 17th out of 144
 economies.2
    New Zealand started the implementation of a unique business number
 (UBI) in 2013 in the form of the NZBN (New Zealand Business Number), as
 part of its Better Public Services3 program—a plan that outlines 10 priority
 results. In particular, the NZBN is a critical enabler for Result 9 (“Improving
 Interaction with Government”) by providing a secure and authoritative way
 for businesses and agencies to link information about an enterprise, enabling
 service integration and innovative time-saving administrative solutions
 between businesses, their suppliers, and government.
    Implementation requires legislative changes, the implementation of gov-
 ernment directives, and the consequent participation by the whole of govern-
 ment and the private sector.
    At the heart of NZBN is an “ecosystem,” which electronically collates core
 information relating to businesses (known as primary business data) in one
 place. This ecosystem is part of New Zealand’s answer to a one-stop shop.
    In an economy of New Zealand’s size, government has taken a pragmatic
 approach that aims to leverage investments made in both the public and pri-
 vate sectors for the implementation of the NZBN and the sharing of primary
 business data. The NZBN ecosystem will sit in the middle, allocating NZBNs
 to businesses and managing the creation, update, and dissemination of pri-
 mary business data between government agencies, from within those agen-
 cies or from private sector intermediaries.
    In addition, the NZBN ecosystem approach has the benefit of implementa-
 tion speed; building services will happen concurrently across the public and
 private sector using current technologies or through existing technology
 transformation programs.
    In terms of future proofing, the NZBN ecosystem approach avoids the need
 for large technological upgrade programs with associated time and cost bur-
 dens. Instead of relying on one single system providing the entire solution,
 the ecosystem is a collection of public and private sector offerings connected
 by web services (application program interfaces, or APIs) that will evolve
 independently over time.
    In December 2013, 1.1 million companies received NZBNs. The program is
 a catalyst to change the way government works, breaking down administra-
 tive and technical barriers and allowing information to flow.


Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                     69
   Legislation is going through the parliamentary process during 2015.
It includes proposals to extend the NZBN to other entities such as sole trad-
ers, trusts, societies, and partnerships. Government directives are in the con-
sultation phase and, if adopted, will require government agencies and other
state sector agencies to recognize and integrate the NZBN within processes
they undertake with businesses.
   NZBN uses the Global Location Number (GLN) numbering system, glob-
ally recognized and based on international standards. The following agencies
have started limited use of the NZBN: the Ministry of Business, Innovation
and Employment (MBIE); the Ministry of Primary Industries; Statistics
New Zealand; New Zealand Trade and Enterprise; and Callaghan Innovation.



Organizational Approach
MBIE is the lead agency and custodian of the NZBN. The general manager of
MBIE’s Business Integrity Services branch is the current chair of the NZBN
Executive Steering Group. MBIE is responsible for managing the allocation of
NZBNs and for hosting and disseminating primary business data. It coordi-
nates cross-agency and private sector activities to assist or guide the adoption
of the NZBN.
   The NZBN Executive Steering Group’s purpose is to ensure the successful
mainstreaming of the NZBN. It comprises a mix of the key government
agencies that interface with businesses and representation from the Result
9 team and the State Services Commission. Membership is reviewed every
six months to align with current and near-term tasks and activities.
   In addition, the NZBN External Reference Group, composed of businesses
from a wide variety of private sector industry sectors, provides a forum for
businesses to participate in the positioning, design, and development of the
NZBN ecosystem and services.



Legislative and Administrative Considerations
The implementation of the NZBN is a key initiative of the Better for Business
Program, which focuses on reducing the costs to businesses of dealing with
the government. However, the NZBN Bill,4 introduced to Parliament in
March 2015, will extend (if enacted) the NZBN across all business entities
and create the NZBN register and NZBN registrar role.
  Proposed government directives were issued to 186 agencies and other state
sector entities in July 2015 for consultation. If implemented, these directives enable
the public sector to use NZBN to deliver benefits to businesses. The directives will
require departments and other Crown entities to initially recognize the NZBN in
their systems and later integrate it into how they operate with businesses.
  MBIE has created the NZBN custodianship team that, in addition to
managing data accuracy of NZBN information, is responsible for onboard-
ing partners—providing advice and guidance on the adoption of the NZBN.

                         Implementation Approach
                         Many agencies and private sector organizations—including software vendors
                         of customer relationship management and accounting systems—see the
                         potential of NZBN to increase data-sharing capabilities and reduce the
                         administrative burden on businesses.
                            The uptake by each agency of the NZBN will vary depending on the nature
                         of its relationships with business. For some organizations and agencies, adop-
                         tion is expected to be quick and completed in a single stage, while others will
                         gradually phase in the NZBN. Figure 6.1 outlines the program timeline.
                            The architecture of the NZBN solution is based on open-source, ­standards-​
                         based technologies and products to provide access to the NZBN information
                         through publicly available web services and a mobile responsive website.
                         Access to NZBN information will be provided through an OAuth5-secured,
                         service-oriented solution to search, view, and update information as well as
                         to subscribe to receive updates and notifications when business entity infor-
                         mation changes.



                         Challenges Encountered
                         The implementation of the NZBN is still in its infancy. In general, the NZBN
                         implementation thus far has gone smoothly, though a few challenges have
                         been encountered:
                         ••    The long-term vision and benefits and phased approach, while under-
                               stood by those involved, are not always clear or understood to those
                               not closely involved in the NZBN program. The NZBN program’s com-
                               munications and change management plans aim to address some of
                               these issues through online publications, and education and awareness
                               components used to inform stakeholders.

••    To overcome expected issues with onboarding agencies, MBIE has
      created the NZBN custodianship team to assist and provide guidance to
      ­
      agencies as they progress through planning, transition, and operational-
      izing the NZBN. In addition, the NZBN Executive Steering Committee
      will also transition from a focus on implementation to more emphasis on
      continuing operations and future strategies.
••    The privacy of sole traders is a concern to some given the direct associa-
      tion with an individual. The NZBN bill includes provisions to protect sole
      traders’ data privacy.
••    Data management will provide challenges given the ability to exchange
      information with any agency. Authority controls are being incorporated
      into the architecture and design of the NZBN solution and ecosystem
      to  ensure the updates are managed effectively and data quality is
      maintained.



Benefits Realized
Even in these early stages of implementation, there are signs the NZBN will
be a success as the following illustrates:
••    Early adopters in the private sector are finding uses for the NZBN in areas
      such as export documentation and invoicing.
••    Some public sector agencies are eager to use the NZBN, adopting it under
      their current regulatory frameworks.
••    NZBN, through increased interoperability, will reduce the costs for busi-
      ness to interact with government by enabling businesses to “tell govern-
      ment once,” so their primary business data will then be shared. As the
      NZBN implementation continues and additional agencies adopt the
      NZBN, additional benefits are expected.



Summary
The NZBN is on its way to be a very successful UBI implementation—­
providing benefits to the public and private sectors. It is already beginning
to be adopted for use in business-to-business (B2B) transactions. If legisla-
tion passes, the NZBN will include all business entities (for example, sole
traders).
   As the relevant ministers have said in media releases, “The NZBN will be a
key building block for fundamentally changing the way businesses interact.
It  will give government agencies better data, which means that they can
improve the quality of the services they provide.”

76	                     Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
7. Norway Case Study
Background
Norway is a unitary parliamentary government in the Scandinavian Peninsula
that is divided into 19 counties and 430 municipalities and has a population of
5.1 million. Norway ranks 6th out of 189 economies in the 2015 Doing Business
report1 and 22nd in the starting a business indicator, with four procedures and
five days to start operating a business. In the World Economic Forum (WEF)
Global Competitiveness Index 2014,2 Norway ranks 11th out of 144 economies.
   Introduced in 1995 (as part of the Brønnøysund Register Centre [BRC]),
the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities (CCRLE) coordinates
information on business and industry that resides in various public registers
and that is also frequently requested on questionnaires from the public
authorities. The CCRLE ensures that all the information is collected in and
provided from one place. The critical success factors for CCRLE were:
••   Unique identification of legal entities;
••   Extensive and frequent use of the organization number across govern-
     ment and the private sector;
••   Management of data quality; and
••   Easy access to registered information.
As described in box 7.1, the CCRLE includes a wide range of legal entities
within Norway—including public institutions, companies, and sole propri-
etors. Currently there are 1.1 million legal entities registered.
  Implementing the CCRLE began in 1995 and required the merging of
different business registers into one, and the need for a new organization
­
number (ON)—the Norwegian unique business identifier (UBI). The ON is a
nine-digit number that is issued in sequence and does not differentiate
between legal entity types.
  Based on a legislative mandate, the CCRLE’s ON is used across all levels of
government in Norway. The ON is also used within the private sector as the
CCRLE registry information is all publicly available.



Organizational Approach
Business registration reform and, to some extent, the implementation of the
UBI began in 1988 with the creation of the Register of Business Enterprises
and the establishment of the BRC under the Ministry of Justice. Through the
years, the organizations involved have changed during the implementation of
various registers, including the CCRLE; however, the BRC has remained as
the organization that administers and operates the CCRLE.
  The steering group for the initial CCRLE implementation included the
Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Government Management, the Ministry of Justice and the BRC. The reference

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                    77
group advising the steering group had representatives from the Ministry
of  Finance, the Federation of Norwegian Commercial and Service
Enterprises,  the Postal Bank Check Agency, the National Insurance
Administration, the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise, the Modernization
Agency, Norges Bank, the Norwegian Savings Banks Association, the
Association of Norwegian Insurance Companies, the Directorate of Customs
and Excise, Statistics Norway, and the Directorate of Labour. The project
implementation team consisted of representatives from the BRC, the Ministry
of Finance, and the Directorate of Taxes (World Bank 2011).
   The current operational structure is as outlined in figure 7.1 wherein the
BRC reports into the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries.




   Box 7.1  Entities Included in CCRLE
   The CCRLE contains basic data about entities that are under reporting obligations to the Register
   of Employers, the Value Added Tax Register, the Register of Business Enterprises, the Business
   Register of Statistics Norway, the Corporate Taxation Data Register, or the County Governors’
   Register of Foundations. The Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities and The Register of
                                                                                              ­ umber.

                         Legislative and Administrative Considerations
                         Norway’s legal reform related to business registration, and thus its UBI, dates
                         back to 1985 with the review, reform, and centralization of business registra-
                         tion that arose from the Business Enterprise Registration Act3 and the Business
                         Name Act.4 The establishment of the CCRLE required legal provisions
                         (the CCRLE Act5) to introduce the general legal obligation for public author-
                         ities to use the ON and for associated registers to share key information. Since
                         1997, additional acts have been introduced that provide further authorities
                         related to sharing and providing information:
                         ••     The Act Regarding the Register of Reporting Obligations6 (June 6, 1997)
                         ••     The Electronic Signatures Act7 (June 15, 2001)
                         ••     Act on Electronic Communication With and Within the Public
                                Administration8 (June 25, 2004)
                         The primary administrative impact of implementing the CCRLE ON is the
                         transition of business registration from the Brønnøysund District Court
                         (Ministry of Justice) to the BRC.


                         Implementation Approach
                         The implementation of the CCRLE in 1995 was the result of merging the
                         ­
                         various business entity registries into a single registry of legal entities. During
                         the merger, the ON was assigned and verified by the following means:
                         ••     Statistics Norway allocated the nine-digit ON based on chronological
                                order of registration of entities across all registries and linked the ON to
                                that registry information.
                         ••     Businesses were not required to reregister but were asked to verify that
                                the information related to their business was correct.
                                                                                                  example,

reporting], the Norwegian  Semantic Register for Electronic Collaboration
[SERES]) for the implementation of the current UBI implementation in Norway.
   The original registers within the BRC were custom-built solutions devel-
oped on minicomputers from a Norwegian vendor; however, by the time the
CCRLE was developed, the BRC was shifting away from minicomputers to an
architecture based on UNIX-Sybase-PowerBuilder. Since its initial develop-
ment, the CCRLE has seen many upgrades and is now primarily a Java-based
solution running on Linux, providing access to information through web
applications and web services.
   In Norway, data privacy is culturally less of concern than in other jurisdic-
tions, thus the CCRLE ON and related information is openly accessible. There
are access controls in place to control who can update the information.


Challenges Encountered
Norway, as one of the early adopters of the UBI, has encountered and over-
come challenges in the past 20 years. These challenges include the following:
••    The long-term funding of operations, maintenance, and enhancement of
      the CCRLE was not necessarily understood during the initial stages of the
      CCRLE’s implementation and operation. The CCRLE contains business
      identity information and is considered one of the central building blocks9
      of government information, and needs to be appropriately maintained and
      enhanced to ensure access to this information. As government administra-
      tion changes, it is important to inform and educate administrators to be able
      to maintain (that is, fund and operate) the UBI as a central building block.
••    While establishing the CCRLE, Norway encountered mistrust and resis-
      tance from the registrars involved. The registrars expressed “a general
      skepticism whether information registered by other public authorities
      ­
      was relevant for their needs and whether the quality of this information
      would satisfy their demands. Mapping the information on the records
      and the information needs represented a first step to reduce this skepti-
      cism” (World Bank 2011). In addition, establishing and maintaining
      cooperation and trust with stakeholders is critical to long-term success.
••    Maintaining data quality and currency of data is always a challenge. To
      address this challenge, Norway has adopted the principles of the “good
      circle of use of information” to increase the quality, value, and currency
      of the CCLRE ON and related information.


Benefits Realized
Norway has seen many benefits related to the implementation of the CCRLE,
including the following:
••    Reduced time to register a business—prior to the CCRLE and central-
      ized registration, it could take up to one year to register a business. Now,
      electronic registrations are processed within one day.

80	                       Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
••    Increased regulatory compliance—for example, the CCRLE is linked to
      the Disqualified Directors Register, thus preventing these individuals
      from entering into another business. Also, filing compliance has increased
      from 56 percent in 1980 to 97.5 percent in 2009.
••    Reduced administrative burden on businesses—Norwegian businesses
      need only remember their organization number to access government
      information and services. Through Altinn (https://www.altinn.no/), the
      Norwegian one-stop shop, businesses can access most common govern-
      ment services.
••    Businesses refer to the BRC as the Registry, thus inferring that the BRC is
      one transparent entity.



Summary
     When the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities was opened in 1995 it was
     applauded as one of the most important measures to improve efficiency in public admin-
     istration in recent years.10

UBI implementations and operations are continuous. Norway started in the
1980s with business registration reforms, implemented a UBI in 1995, and is
still involved in improving processes and access to UBI-related information.
CCRLE’s focus now is improving the information services themselves—
through integration with the national ID gateway, improved messaging
services, and increased use of data semantics.

                       measurement. The DTF shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,”
                       which represents the best performance observed on each of the indicators
                       across all economies in the  Doing Business  sample since 2005 (please see

                       Norway first introduced the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities
                       (CCRLE, Norway’s version of the unique business identifier [UBI]) in 1995,
                       which predates the Doing Business indicators.

Annex 7C Architecture and
Technology
Norway’s solution is a hub-and-spoke architecture that interacts and
exchanges data with various other government registers (including the
Register of Employers, the Register of Business Enterprises, the Register
of  Foundations, the VAT [Value Added Tax] Register, Statistics Norway’s
Central Register of Establishments and Enterprises, the Corporate Taxation
Data Register, and the Register of Bankruptcies). Norway’s Central
Coordinating Register for Legal Entities (CCRLE) architecture leverages the
following technologies and standards to implement the solutions:
••     Enterprise service bus (BizTalk)
••     One-stop portal (Altinn, https://www.altinn.no/), providing access to
       CCRLE information and online transactions
••     ELMER, a framework for web-based forms (acronym, in Norwegian, for
       “easier and more efficient reporting”), http://www.brreg.no/elmer​
       /­elmer2-english.pdf
••     SERES, the Norwegian  Semantic Register for Electronic Collaboration
       (SERES) contains metadata that describe the semantics and information
       structure of data that are exchanged by and within the public sector,
       http://www.brreg.no/english/registers/seres/index.html

just an Internet portal. Altinn is an Internet portal, but Altinn’s strength lies
in the platform itself—a digital infrastructure that links registers, public agen-
cies, municipalities, enterprises, and the country’s inhabitants. Altinn is based
on open standards and open interfaces and on a shared understanding of the
data, what is known as semantic interoperability. This is why the Brønnøysund
Register Centre (BRC) has also invested so much in SERES.
   In the future, the BRC and Altinn can and should be a foundation on which
to facilitate innovation and create value in the private sector and in the public
sector.

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                          85
8. Philippines Case Study
Background
The Philippines is a presidential republic in Southeast Asia with a population
of 100 million, an average age of 23, and roughly 1,600 local government units
(LGUs). The Philippines is ranked 95th out of 189 economies in the 2015
Doing Business report.1 Its ranking in the starting a business indicator is
161st, requiring 16 procedures and 34 days to start a business. The Philippines
is ranked 52nd out of 144 economies in the World Economic Forum (WEF)
Global Competitiveness Index 2014.2
   Introduced in 2010, the Philippines Business Number (PBN) has been
issued to roughly 1.5 million sole proprietors. The Philippines Business
Registry (PBR) administers the PBN and—in partnership with the Bureau of
Internal Revenue (BIR), Social Security System (SSS), PhilHealth (PHIC),
and Home Development Mutual Fund (IBIG)—has introduced an integrated
registration process for new businesses.
   Intended to link data on enterprises across government agencies, the
Philippines government has introduced the PBN to support and maintain a
competitive business environment in the Philippines. The key objectives in
implementing the PBN include
••   Improving customer service and efficiency;
••   Increasing transparency;
••   Implementing interoperability; and,
••   Improving international rankings3 for registering a business.
As described in box 8.1, there are multiple registries involved, based on the
type of legal entity. At present, the PBN is used only for sole proprietors; it is
not issued to companies, cooperatives, or other entities. However, a new
government project, the Medium-Term Information and Communication
­
Technology Harmonization Initiative (MITHI), is developing a UBI that will
encompass all legal entities in the Philippines, which will also promote
improved interoperability and interagency cooperation, while reducing
redundant data submission requirements for businesses and increasing
transparency.



Organizational Approach
For the current implementation of the PBN, a memorandum of agreement
governed the activities of steering and technical committees that involved
the following organizations: PBR, SSS, BIR, SSS, PHIC, and IBIG. These
are also the organizations that are involved in the operational management
of the integrated business registration process that was implemented in
Phase 1.

  Box 8.1  Business Entity Registration Authorities
  In the Philippines, the registration of legal entities falls under two different agencies: the
  Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Department of Finance. The following table
  outlines the authorities, the type of entities registered, and to which department they report.

        Table B8.1.1  Registration of Legal Entities
         Authority                                      Entity type(s)              Department

         Securities and Exchange Commission             Companies                      DF
         Cooperative Development Authority              Cooperatives                   DF
        Source: Case study interviews.
        Note: DF = Department of Finance; DTI = Department of Trade and Industry.




   The next phase of UBI development for the Philippines will be guided by
the MITHI Business Cluster,4 which will involve the following organizations:
DTI, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Cooperative Development
Authority (CDA), BIR, SSS, IBIG, PHIC, and LGUs and other permit- and
license-issuing agencies.
   MITHI’s vision for the future UBI includes an integrated system for all
entities that encompasses all aspects of the business lifecycle—from starting a
­
business to operating it and winding it down.



Legislative and Administrative Considerations
The PBN was implemented by the partner organizations through a memoran-
dum of agreement, and did not require legislative or administrative changes.
The MITHI Business Cluster is in early stages of conducting its analysis, but
initial indications are that major legislative reforms will not be necessary;
however, existing acts or regulations may require amendment to enable
­
­electronic submissions and the use of revised or consolidated application forms.
    Since MITHI is still in early stages, the administrative impact cannot be
 quantified and will depend on the approach adopted for the delivery of services
 (for example, online or in person). At this time, however, there are not expected
 to be any large-scale administrative or organizational changes to implement a
 full UBI solution that encompasses all legal entities in the Philippines.



Implementation Approach
To this point, PBR, SEC, and CDA have been working separately; but the
introduction of the MITHI Business Cluster will bring these registration
authorities together in a standard, focused approach to the implementation of
a UBI for the Philippines.

88	                         Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
   Regarding standardization of the PBN across SSS, BIR, IBIG, and PHIC, a
data-matching exercise was conducted with each organization to map
existing entity IDs to the related PBN.
­
   DTI’s implementation of the PBR leverages an enterprise service bus and
web portal to facilitate the integrated registration process across the partner
organizations. DTI collects the registration requests and dispatches them to
the partner organizations for processing. The result is a centralized registra-
tion solution, which reduces the amount of time it takes to register as a sole
proprietor.
   The target architecture for UBI will align with the national information and
communication technology (ICT) strategy and framework, and will leverage
public key infrastructure to ensure data security, as well as secure and reliable
online transactions.



Challenges Encountered
There are a number of challenges that have been, or are expected to be,
encountered:
••   DTI, SEC, and CDA did not have a shared mandate (either through a
     cabinet directive or other official instruction) to implement a UBI, thus
     leading to the development of integrated registration through the PBR
     that did not include companies or cooperatives. As noted in box 8.1, these
     organizations report to different Departments and Secretaries. The cre-
     ation of the MITHI Business Cluster is expected to move the UBI forward
     across all legal entities.
••   The PBR contributes a government objective to move people to online
     channels to reduce administrative costs; however, there is currently low
     uptake of the online channel because 80 percent of transactions are com-
     pleted in person. There is no quantitative evidence that provides a clear
     answer to why this is the case. Subjectively, it could be a lack of awareness
     of the online channel, culture cultural, level of ICT literacy, or access
     to  computers—the initial indication is that the PBR site (http://www​
      business.gov.ph/) is not mobile friendly.
     .­
••   Expanding the use of the UBI to LGUs for licensing, permiting, local
     taxes, and so on may prove to be a challenge because there are roughly
     1,600 LGUs in the Philippines. Careful planning will be required in all
     dimensions (legal, process, people, and technology) of the UBI to ensure
     accessibility and the necessary data governance.



Benefits Realized
As yet, the PBN is not used within the private sector; however, within the
­
public sector it is used by the five organizations involved in integrated regis-
tration of sole proprietors. To measure success, a number of performance
metrics are being tracked: registration time; transactions by channel (that is,

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                      89
web vs. teller); and transactions by scope, gender, region, civil status, payment
method, and transaction source.
  For the five partners, and the private sector, the introduction of the PBN
and integrated registration process has resulted in the following benefits:
••    Reduction in the time to register a business
••    Increased formalization and tax compliance
••    Reduced administrative burden for entrepreneurs
••    Increased efficiency for government
••    Increased data sharing



Summary
The Philippines has implemented a common identifier for sole proprietors as
well as an integrated registration process across five organizations. The next
step in the process, under the mandate of the MITHI Business Cluster, is to
extend the PBN across all legal entities and leverage it across other agencies
and organizations (for example, licensing and permitting), and LGUs.

Additional Notes
The World Bank’s starting a business indicator measures the time and costs
for companies registering at the SEC; sole proprietors are excluded. The PBR
in its current implementation includes only sole proprietors; therefore, any
gains that have been made in registration time are not reflected in the Doing
Business results.

Annex 8B Doing Business
Distance to Frontier
Figure 8B.1 provides an overview of Philippines distance to frontier (DTF)
measurement. The DTF shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,”
which represents the best performance observed on each of the indicators
across all economies in the  Doing Business  sample since 2005 (please see
http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/distance-to-frontier for further details).
The Philippines Business Registry (PBR) and the Philippines Business
Number (PBN) were introduced in 2010 for sole proprietors; however, the
Doing Business measurements in the Philippines apply to companies only.
Thus, the DTFs are provided as reference only, but it is expected that the
Medium-Term Information and Communication Technology Harmonization
Initiative (MITHI) will expand the PBN across the remainder of the major
types of legal entities.

Annex 8C Architecture and
Technology
The integrated registration solution that the Philippines Business Registry
(PBR) has implemented is based on a broker architectural pattern; as a broker,
the PBR collects the registration requests and dispatches them to the relevant
partner organizations for processing. To implement the solution, the PBR has
leveraged the following technologies:
••   Enterprise service bus
••   Web services
••   Public key infrastructure for message-level encryption
••   Web portal for integrated registration

9. Rwanda Case Study
Background
Rwanda is a low-income nation, organized as a constitutional republic,
whereby the president of Rwanda is both head of state and head of govern-
ment within a multiparty system. Rwanda’s parliament has two chambers,
the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. It has a population of 12 million
and gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 of $16.368 billion. The country
ranked 46th in the 2015 Doing Business report. As of the end of June 2014,
there were 11,361 businesses (sole proprietorships and corporations) in
Rwanda.
   The unique business identifier (UBI) is based on the tax identification
number (TIN), and was implemented as part of a major reform and automa-
tion of business registration procedures in 2010. The current TIN in Rwanda
was established in 2005 and is a nine-digit number, consisting of an eight-
digit sequential number + a one-digit check digit. The nine digits are made up
of the following parts: (i) the first digit is 1; (ii) the next seven digits are
sequential from one to 9999999; and (iii) the last digit is a checksum. No busi-
ness type or regional identifier is included because previous experience
showed that these characteristics can change during the life of the business.
It  was implemented based on International Monetary Fund (IMF) best
practices for TIN implementation.
­
   Rwanda has undertaken many far-reaching reforms to improve the quality
of the business environment and to improve its standing in the Doing Business
Rankings. The effort to unify business identification numbers began in 2009
through the Single Business Registration project, primarily to support more
efficient registration and tracking of businesses. The use of the UBI has
steadily expanded into other parts of government as well as being used by the
­
private sector in obtaining information on potential borrowers and trading
counterparties.



Organizational Approach
A government working group comprising five agencies (later expanded to
seven) was established during the implementation of the automated company
registry and integration of registration processes.
  The initial five agencies included
••   The Office of the Registrar General (ORG);1
••   The Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA);2
••   The Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB);3
••   The National Institute of Statistics;4 and
••   The National ID Agency.5



Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                     95
     The working group was then expanded to include
••    The Central Bank of Rwanda and
••    The Ministry of Finance
  The basic approach as laid down by the memorandum of understanding
(MOU) governing their cooperation is as follows:
••    The TIN as generated and assigned by RRA will be used as the unique
      identifier of companies and enterprises.
••    Applications for registration or amendments hereto will be based on the
      online submission of a consolidated registration form covering all
      information required for registration with the cooperating institutions.
      ­
••    One single registration certificate will be issued, providing legal certifica-
      tion of the incorporation and registration with the other institutions.
••    Value added tax (VAT) registration and certificates will not be covered by
      the integrated service (however, VAT registration was subsequently
      integrated in October 2015).
      ­
••    The mandates of the respective institutions for the management and
      maintenance of their respective registers are not impacted under this
      agreement.
••    Cross-checking of personal ID with the national ID register will be
      ­carried out to validate applicant identities, as well as those of other ­officers
       and directors, if applicable.
  The ongoing governance is limited to quarterly meetings of the stakeholder
agencies but will likely expand in the future as more agencies begin to adopt
the UBI.



Legislative and Administrative Considerations
The integrated registration services and UBI were implemented under an
MOU dated December 31, 2009, and signed by the cooperating institutions
named in the previous section. Their senior executives agreed to elevate the
TIN as the UBI following a technical recommendation from a working group
representing the seven institutions. No changes in laws were necessary; the
TIN was already established under the tax law.



Implementation Approach
As noted previously, the initial objective for developing a UBI was to stream-
line the process of registering businesses through a streamlined electronic
procedure, which was being implemented in part through the automation of
the company registry. This implementation has since given rise to a number
of additional activities to leverage the UBI in other government databases to
more efficiently map information against specific business entities; however,
this has been largely an evolutionary effort.

96	                         Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
   The initial effort was conducted in 2009–10 in essentially one phase, during
the implementation of the online company registry. Since then there has been
a series of discrete projects to expand the use of the UBI in other government
databases and services.
   As part of the automation process, the Company Registry required all
­
businesses in Rwanda to reregister, allowing them to then adopt their existing
TIN number as the UBI. The RSSB still has its own business identifier, but the
database of all entities registered with RSSB includes the TIN so the two num-
bers are mapped to each other.
   Since the initial launch in 2010, there has been a continual evolution of
other applications of the UBI to improve interoperability of government
­
databases, including land and collateral registries, in addition to its use by the
National Institute of Statistics for analysis of businesses. For example, the
Rwanda Development Board uses UBI information to support registration of
mortgages, and the land registry employs the UBI in registering transfers of
land titles involving businesses.
   The UBI is also required from government suppliers participating in
­
tenders and claiming payment at the Treasury. Commercial banks, the move-
able collateral registry, and the new credit bureau all use the UBI for company
identification.
   In addition, personal identification numbers have been integrated into the
company registry, so owners, directors, and officers are validated against the
national ID system during the registration and update process.
   The use of the UBI will likely be expanded as a new initiative to move 100
services online through an e-Government public-private partnership,
Rwanda Online, implemented with an initial launch in June 2015. The initia-
tive will also include shared services such as single sign on and e-­    payment
capabilities. In addition, use of UBI will likely be expanded to include local
governments, as RRA has now been mandated to collect many local govern-
ment taxes and fees, such as business operating licenses and property taxes.


Challenges Encountered
The initial UBI effort was driven by government efforts to improve the start-
ing a business indicator through automation and integration of business
­registration processes.
   One of the key challenges was to establish a clean registry of businesses,
 which was accomplished through requiring all businesses to reregister with the
 ORG. Previously, the paper records of company registrations were stored in
 courts across the country; the new company law established a central registry
 agency and stipulated that all businesses must reregister with this new entity.
   There was also an initial reluctance for businesses to use the new online
 processes. In 2014 registration online was made mandatory but free, and
 promotional efforts were undertaken to encourage people to use Internet
 cafes and personal computers in district government offices to submit their
 registration. Interfaces are being developed in French and Kinyarwanda to
 accommodate all citizens because the initial interface was only in English.

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                       97
Benefits Realized
For government, the following benefits have been realized:
••    Reform of business entry procedures—this and other reforms have
      resulted in a reduction in the number of days required to start a business
      in Rwanda from 16 in 2008 to 6.5 in 2015 (Doing Business data; World
      Bank 2015); note the time to register the business with the ORG, RRA,
      and RSSB is less than one day.
••    Improved tax compliance—combined with national ID, this has enabled
      regulators to identify beneficial owners of businesses where multiple
      TINs are employed to mask their taxable activities.
••    Reduction in government administration costs—for example, annual
      account filing for the company registry has been combined with the busi-
      ness tax filing, which is all done through RRA’s online filing capability.
  The private sector has also realized a number of benefits, including the
following:
••    Reduced compliance costs—initially through the business start-up
      reforms noted above; however, these will increase as the UBI is employed
      to facilitate the delivery of other government-to-business (G2B) services
      through Rwanda Online.
••    Improved information on private sector counterparties—this has been
      realized through the use of the UBI in the secured asset registry operated
      by ORG as well as information sharing with the new credit-reporting
      bureau being established in Rwanda. As noted in annex 9B below, this has
      contributed to a significant improvement on the getting credit indicator.



Summary
Although the initial objectives for implementing a shared business identifier
were limited, the government has since identified many other ways to use the
UBI to integrate government databases, improve regulatory oversight, and
enhance public service delivery. These efforts have also laid the foundation for
a much more ambitious effort under Rwanda Online to develop an integrated
online service delivery platform for government, the benefits of which will be
realized over the next several years.

Additional Notes
The Rwanda TIN number has been implemented on the basis of the following
guidelines:
1.	 The length of a TIN should be as short as possible to make it user friendly to
    both the taxpayer and the tax administration. Statisticians have indicated
    that only 11 digits can be used to uniquely number the entire population
    of the world (Casanegra de Jantscher and Silvani 1991). The U.S. govern-
    ment uses a nine-digit number for social security numbering, which is

98	                      Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
    aimed at more than 350 million applicants. It is often recommended to
    use a nine-digit number together with a tenth computer-verifiable check
    character or check digit. For verification purposes, a check digit is com-
    monly incorporated into the TIN. The use of a check digit permits the
    TIN to be self-checked through use of a mathematical formula with the
    TIN and the check digit for consistency. This protects against any attempt
    to fabricate a number based on knowing the TIN structure.
2.	 The TIN may be structured in such a way that some of the digits carry
    coded information that specifically identifies the TIN holder. This was
    the case for the TIN used in Rwanda before 2004. It is strongly recom-
    mended not to attempt to code the number in relation to any of the
    ­particulars like location or nature of business, as these are likely to change
     from time to time.

Annex 9C Architecture and
Technology
The Office of the Registrar General’s (ORG’s) Business Registration System
located in the government data center connects to the Rwanda Revenue
Authority (RRA) by using a private secure connection. A RRA server
dedicated to receiving exchange messages is always available to the ORG’s
­
message-sending server. Virtual private network (VPN) services on the
Internet between the Business Registration perimeter firewall and the RRA
firewall and router equipment have also been established. Similar data
exchange capabilities have been established with the other partners.
   Information sharing between the stakeholder agencies takes place as
follows:
1.	 A business is registered at ORG; ORG verifies national ID information
    using the National Identification Agency (NIDA) database through web
    service calls. ORG also sends the new business information to RRA and
    the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB) using web services.
2.	 RRA receives the business information and also verifies the national
    ID  information using NIDA database through web service calls. Once
    this checks out RRA generates a tax identification number (TIN) for the
    new business and sends it back to ORG via web services.
3.	 RSSB receives the business information, generates the needed social
    security information, and sends it back to ORG via web services.
    ­
4.	 ORG stores TIN and social security information in its database.
  The exchange of information is performed through the Message Queue
application program interface (API), and the data format is XML format and
UTF-8 encoding.
  Figure 9C.1 illustrates the overall architecture.

10. Serbia Case Study
Background
Serbia is a parliamentary republic situated at the crossroads between Central
and Southeast Europe covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and
the central Balkans. The population of Serbia was estimated at 7.2 million in
2011,1 the gross national income (GNI) per capita is US$5,730, and the
income category is upper middle income.
   Serbia is ranked 91st out of 189 economies in the 2015 Doing Business
report2 and 94th out of 144 economies in the World Economic Forum (WEF)
Global Competitiveness Index 2014.3
   According to the information received from the Serbian Business Registers
Agency (SBRA), in the first quarter of 2015, Serbia had 116,500 companies,
215,000 sole proprietorships, and 37,000 associations.
   The main objective in introducing the unique business identifier (UBI)
was the improvement of data quality in national databases, contributing to
increased data and process transparency and improved interoperability in the
public and private sectors. On the basis of an assessment conducted in
2001/2002, the ­ government decided to focus initially on business registration
reform, including the establishment of the SBRA. These reforms were imple-
mented between 2002 and 2006 and were led by SBRA, sponsored by the
Serbian government and supported by the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry
of Finance, and the Ministry of Science—IT (Information Technology)
Directorate. As a part of the reform (see box 10.1), it was decided to promote
a statistical number already being issued by the Statistical Office (RSO
hereinafter) to a UBI at the national level (eight-character number). Starting
­
in 2005, this number has been assigned by SBRA to all newly registered busi-
ness entities. According to the Business Registers Interconnection System
(BRIS) directive initiative4 and European Business Registers (EBR) Registered
Entity Identifier (REID), Serbia is one of the countries that have implemented
the REID.5
   As part of the reformed business registration process in Serbia, the SBRA is
responsible for comprehensive and consistent mapping of the UBI and tax
identification number (TIN). The SBRA acting as a hub assigns both the UBI
and TIN to newly registered business entities. See figure 10.1 for a conceptual
representation of UBI issuance in Serbia.
   In 2009 the World Bank supported the establishment of the Central
Registry of Compulsory Social Insurance (CROSO) with three objectives:
(i) to establish unified CROSO registry and interoperability with other
registries related to insurance payers and insured persons; (ii) to pro-
­
vide  additional social insurance supervision; and (iii) to establish the
reporting system in this area. The CROSO initiative introduced a unique
Central  Registry (CR) number (12  digits), prescribed by the Law on
CROSO,6 which is assigned to each insurance payer (for example, company,

   Box 10.1  Business Registration Reform in Serbia
   One of the main goals of the Business registration reform, initiated in 2002, was to promote a
   “real” UBI that will be

   •	 A number issued in a way that will make it unique, with no exceptions;
   •	 A mandatory element of identification for all legal persons and entrepreneurs in all public
      sector databases and strongly suggested to any other information system in Serbia; and
   •	 A primary key for all databases in the registries maintained by SBRA which will make it
      reliable, secure, open and interoperable.

  Organizational Approach
  The business registration reform was initiated by the Serbian government as
  a part of a larger set of public administration reforms initiated after the polit-
  ical changes in Serbia in the year 2000. The management of the steering com­
  mittee was delegated to the Ministry of Economy; and, for the information
  communication technology (ICT) aspects of the reform, the Ministry of
  ­
  Science—IT Directorate was involved. Other ministries involved in the
  reform included the Ministries of Finance, Labor, Health, and Internal Affairs;
  Public Funds (pension and health); the National Employment Service; and
  the National Bank of Serbia. The SBRA played a key role in the implementa-
  tion of this reform.
     The business registration reform required complete organizational change
  and establishment of one national registry institution (SBRA) with an
  ­
  integrated, centralized electronic platform for all registries. The reform also
  required transferring business registration from the courts to the SBRA and its
  conversion to an administrative procedure, along with consolidation of regis-
  tration for all business entities. Figure 10.2 summarizes the resulting changes
  in registration volumes since 2005. In particular, these reforms involved:
  ••                              Transferring registration of companies from 18 commercial courts to the
                                  central SBRA Company Register and
  ••                              Transferring registration of entrepreneurs from 170+ municipalities to
                                  the central SBRA Entrepreneur Register.
    The establishment of the CROSO and introduction of the CR number were
  coordinated by the Ministry of Labor in cooperation with the Ministry of
  Finance and Health and the Pension Fund. The Ministry of Labor initially
  supervised the work of the CROSO, but in 2014 the Ministry of Finance took

over this role. CROSO was first organized as a government service and in
2010 became a public institution, fully responsible for the CR registry and
related interoperability.
   The steering committee for the implementation of the new e-Government
Strategy (2015–18) is the Council for Public Administration Reform headed
by the Prime Minister with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of
Public Administration and Local Self-Government as a vice president, while
the members represent most of the ministries, the Government Secretary-
General, and directors of the republic secretariats for legislation and public
policy. The new e-Government Strategy focuses on enabling interoperability
through the introduction of the government service bus.



Legal and Administrative Impacts
The UBI implementation in Serbia was part of the reform of business registra-
tion in Serbia and was based on the following key legal instruments:8
••     New Company Law, Business Registration Law, and amended Law on
       Local Government (2003/2004)
••     Government decision on “One-Stop Shop for Registration” (2008)
••     Improved Company Law (2012)
  There are also a number of government decrees and rulebooks related
directly to the CROSO, adopted to define the application process for compul-
sory social insurances; the method to migrate and transfer data to form the
CROSO registry; the way to assign user privileges; the methodology for
recording, editing, and accessing data; and the structure of the CR number.



Implementation Approach
The UBI was initially implemented by the SBRA as a mandatory and unique
attribute for all entities in the Register of Companies, operating since January
2005, and the Register of Entrepreneurs, which has been operating since
January 2006. The UBI was applied to all businesses in a process of mandatory
reregistration carried out at no cost to businesses. The business registration
reform in Serbia had the following initial phases:
••     Phase 1 (2004–05): Establishment of the SBRA and forming the ­company
       and entrepreneur registries
••     Phase 2 (2005–06): Reregistration of all businesses in the “new” SBRA
       company registry
••     Phase 3 (2007–09): Implementation of the “One-Stop Shop for
       Registration” (from May 2009)
   In Phase 1, SBRA accepted the “Unique Legal Person/Entrepreneur ID”
issued earlier by the Statistical Office as a UBI, which was also later extended
by SBRA to other legal entities (associations, NGOs, and so on). Formally, the

108	                     Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
              number is still being issued by the Statistical Office; however, SBRA receives
              the unused numbers in blocks and assigns them to registered entities. Also, in
              Phase 1 the initial mapping of the statistical number to the TIN was carried
              out. In Phase 2 a massive reregistration process was implemented whereby
              approximately 70,000 business entities reregistered in the new SBRA com-
              pany registry (the remaining 150,000 inactive business entities were struck off
              the register). The mapping of the statistical numbers continued in Phase 3
              by mapping them to the Pension Fund, Health Insurance Fund, and National
              Employment Service numbers.
                Further improvements of the SBRA have been realized in the following
              phases:
              ••   Phase 4 (2010–12): Additional improvements in the SBRA information
                   system and business processes were undertaken under the “KOICA
                   project” (donation of the Republic of Korea). New partners were added,
                   ­
                   including the National Bank of Serbia, all commercial banks, and the
                   Republic Geodetic Authority, all of which started using the UBI.
              ••   Phase 5 (2012–13): The SBRA “universal web services” were developed
                   providing data access and data search services to both the public and
                   ­private sector.
              ••    Phase 6 (2013–present): Implementation of the CROSO registry and
                    mapping of the UBI with CR number.
                 The CROSO electronic registry of insurance payers and insured persons was
              established in August 2013 as a result of data migration from the source data-
              bases of the Health Insurance Fund, Pension Fund, National Employment
              Service, and Tax Administration. The registry of SBRA was used as a control
              mechanism. Also, as part of the data integration process, all source data-
              bases  (Health Insurance and Pension Funds, Employment Service, and Tax
              Administration) received the newly generated CR numbers of businesses that
              were mapped to the existing internal ID numbers. The formation of the CROSO
              registry took two years. The CROSO is electronically linked to eight state bodies,
              including the Ministry of Interior, Tax Administration, Statistical Office, Health
              Insurance and Pension Funds, SBRA, and the Ministry of Public Administration.
                 As noted in Box 10.2, the SBRA online business portal9 is widely used
              for the public search of registered entities using the UBI or the entity name.



Box 10.2  UBI Outcomes in Serbia
Starting in 2005 the SBRA gradually became the main source of business entity status information
for the entire public sector in Serbia.

The SBRA UBI is used as a primary identifier of all companies and entrepreneurs in the majority
of ministries, government agencies, and regulatory bodies. In addition, a growing number of
partners from public and private sector use SBRA web services for UBI-based access to the data
in the registries.



              Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                         109
The CROSO Internet portal10 has online services that enable registration of
social insurance payers and insured persons and submission of social
insurance applications. This service requires using qualified electronic
­
certificates, and currently most of the applications are submitted online
­
through the portal.
  The new Strategy on the Development of the e-Government in the
Republic of Serbia for the period 2015–18 defines improved interoperability
in the public sector (government to government [G2G] and government to
business [G2B]) as one of the main objectives, with the full implementation of
the UBI as one of the key preconditions. This strategy includes both the
national level and local governments, and the linking of existing and planned
national registries through the government service bus. Also, as a prerequisite
for these further actions, the government of Serbia in early 2014 adopted the
national interoperability framework based on the European Interoperability
Framework.11


Challenges Encountered
Historically, the eight-character business identifier formally issued by the
RSO was used throughout the former Yugoslavia, including Serbia, but had
the following major drawbacks as a UBI:
••     It was issued in practice by many sources (ministries, local authorities,
       specialized institutions), so it was not reliable and consistent, or even not
       unique.
••     It was not mandatory; therefore, it was not used for company or entrepre-
       neur identification in many important information systems in the ­country.
       Instead of that number, many organizations used their own “internal
       entity ID” or “entity name,” which made any interoperability difficult.
  The most important challenges within the business registration reform in
Serbia were the following:
••     Registration reform in the period between 2004 and 2006 was a com-
       pletely new model of public administration reform in Serbia because it
       was service-focused, independent, and self-sustainable, and as such was
       to some extent isolated from other public services, making it difficult to
       implement certain reform activities (for example, interoperability with
       the Tax Administration).
••     There was reluctance to reforms by certain project participants, in partic-
       ular the Tax Administration in the implementation of the business regis-
       tration one-stop shop in the SBRA.
••     There was insufficient support from top levels of government to keep the
       SBRA as a self-sustaining agency within the government structure. The
       SBRA was established as a self-sustaining agency, and hence had no
       excess staff and a salary scale closer to private sector norms, unlike other
       public agencies. The government did not take this into consideration
       when implementing across-the-board austerity measures.

110	                       Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government
     Measures taken to address these challenges included:
••    Patiently securing support from senior management of the relevant
      agencies, based on clear laws, bylaws, or government decisions;
      ­
••    Continuous encouragement of partners who were not active enough in
      the project;
••    Engagement with local and foreign partners, consultants, ICT providers,
      and donors to provide necessary funding and expertise; and
••    Close cooperation with the Chamber of Commerce of Serbia and
      Belgrade, key ICT companies in Serbia, and business associations (includ-
      ing the National Alliance for Local Economic Development, Foreign
      Investors Council, and the American Chamber of Commerce of Serbia)
     Buy-in from the private sector has been achieved through
••    Ever growing customer base for SBRA data services (on-demand and
      regular data delivery services for a fee) to the private sector;
      ­
••    Expansion of the use of SBRA web services by the private sector, starting
      with the largest enterprises, leading to broad and comprehensive applica-
      tion of the UBI at the national level; and
••    Continuous improvement of SBRA data delivery services, based on
      customer responses, complaints, and requirements.

Benefits Realized
As a result of the initial business registration reform, Serbia was named “Top
Reformer of the Year” for 2005 by Doing Business; and, after implementation
of the “one-stop shop” reforms, the Doing Business performance was further
improved. The following benefits have been realized as result of the improved
business registration processes and introduction of the UBI in Serbia:
••    Reduced time to register a business (from 52 to 5, and then to 1–3 days)
••    Improved risk-based tax compliance due to accurate and updated data
      about business entities
••    Increased adherence to public procurement rules though better informa-
      tion on vendors
••    Reduced administrative burden for entrepreneurs (same information is
      not requested by different institutions) and better efficiency of govern-
      ment as a result of increased interoperability
••    Increased data quality in many institutions
   A main benefit in the private sector is reduced administrative burden,
especially for small businesses, and the opportunity to obtain information on
­
potential partners and customers quickly, easily, and inexpensively. Also, the
entire banking sector is using the UBI and company data from the SBRA reg-
isters according to the Law on Accounting from 2012. SBRA has experienced
growing demand for its information from the private sector, including
SBRA  data services (fee-based, on-demand, and periodic data feeds) and
web services, which are used by many large enterprises in their interactions

Implementing a Unique Business Identifier in Government	                   111
with vendors, leading to broad and comprehensive application of the UBI
across the public and private sector.
   Before establishment of the CROSO, business representatives had to go to
several institutions to submit their social insurance applications; now this
activity can be finished in one step online. The CROSO publishes online
statistical information;12 for example, these showed an increase from 46,582
online applications in January 2014 to 188,695 in December 2014.



Summary
Although implementation and achievement of desired objectives was a
step-by-step process that occurred over a number of years, the UBI project in
­
Serbia can be considered very successful. The main accomplishment is that
the current level of UBI implementation will enable unimpeded development
and implementation of services based on interoperability in the public and
private sectors, in accordance with the new national interoperability frame-
work and new Strategy on Development of e-Government in the Republic of
Serbia 2015–18.

Additional Notes
Serbia, within the business registration reform, decided to promote a
statistical number to a UBI at the national level. After the reform, from
2005, the number is being assigned by the SBRA to all newly registered
business entities. The SBRA still receives from the Statistical Office the
unused numbers in contingents, which could be understood taking into
account the fact that certain organizations are not registered at the SBRA
(for example, public institutions that also must obtain this number in the
registration process). Regardless, this national business identifier ensures
uniqueness in the identification of business entities even as many institu-
tions kept their own numbers (for example, Tax ID, Pension Fund ID,
Health Insurance Fund ID). However, by introducing the CROSO, the
other numbers lost their importance (especially Health and Pension Fund
IDs). The Tax ID is still in use as an external business identifier together
with the UBI because the payments to the state made by business entities
must make reference to the Tax ID.
