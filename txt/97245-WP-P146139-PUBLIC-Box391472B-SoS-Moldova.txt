         Key Water and Sanitation Sector Challenges
         XXImproving     access to piped water and adequate sanitation. In rural areas, 1.5 million inhabitants
              do not have access to piped water and 1.8 million do not have access to flush toilets. Thus,
              access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation is one of the major challenges for the water
              sector in Moldova.
         XX Financing     investments to upgrade the water and wastewater sector infrastructure. Over the next 15
              years, €705 million will be needed to accomplish the goals of the New Strategy for the water sector.
              This will require increasing current investments by a factor of five.
         XX Addressing      affordability issues regarding water and sanitation prices. Affordability of water is
              potentially an issue for a majority of the Moldovan population, with the average share of potential
              water and sanitation expenditures at nearly 5%, raising concerns about the feasibility of extending
              utility networks toward unserved populations. The upcoming investment efforts, which will require
              tariff increases, could exacerbate the affordability issue in the future.

Economy. Moldova, whose economy relies heavily on agriculture, is one of the poorest countries in Europe. Moldova
is a small country (33,843 km2) located in south-eastern Europe between Romania and Ukraine. Agriculture, including
agroprocessing, represents about 30% of Moldova’s GDP and accounts for 40% of employment and about 60% of total
exports. Moldova is a predominantly rural society; 55% of its 3.56 million inhabitants live in rural villages and 45% in urban
areas. Twenty percent of the population lives in Chisinau, the capital (BNS 2013). With a per capita GDP of US$4,669 (PPP),
Moldova is the poorest country in Europe (World Bank 2015). Poverty is most severe in rural areas, and especially among
the Roma minority, who represent 0.4% of the population (UNDP Moldova 2007). The relationship between Moldova and the
EU is shaped through the European Neighbourhood Policy; the two entities signed an Association Agreement in 2014.

Governance. The Republic of Moldova is a unitary parliamentary representative democracy. The country is divided
into 32 districts and has 982 incorporated localities (5 municipalities, 61 cities, and 916 communes) (BNS 2014).
In addition, some 699 rural villages, which are too small to have their own administrations, are attached to nearby
cities or communes (BNS 2013). Water and sanitation services provision has been decentralized to municipalities,
according to the Law on Public Services of Communal Management (2002) (PRM 2002). However, there is currently a
trend toward the development of regional operators supplying services at the district level.

Water resources. Moldova is facing important quality issues for both surface and underground waters, which
climate change may worsen. The basin of the Dniester River and its tributaries covers about 67% of Moldovan
territory and the Pruth River basin approximately 24% (Mediu 2009). The water quality of both rivers has improved
with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the slowing of economic activity. But although the water quality is relatively
stable, it deteriorates downstream due to discharges from industries and households. Most internal rivers are highly
polluted and contain large amounts of minerals that make them unsuitable for drinking water purposes. Other surface
waters include artificial and natural lakes and ponds, with a tendency for high salinity and mineralization, which often
leads to eutrophication. More intense transboundary water management is still needed among Moldova, Transnistria,
and Ukraine to coordinate water resources preservation and water pollution control. More than 90% of Moldovan wells
have one or more chemical constituents that exceed national drinking water standards, including hardness (90%),
total dissolved solids (65%), nitrates (55%), sulfates (55%), selenium (40%), fluoride (15%), and chloride (10%). Over
80% of the wells have positive and high concentrations of E. Coli (OECD 2007).

In 2013, the EU financed a study on the impact of climate change on water supply sources and services in Moldova.
Floods and droughts were identified as major risks for water and sanitation services, as were other weather- and
water-related hazards such as storms, extreme winter temperatures, and landslides. The immediate impact of
floods on water infrastructure relates to increased water stream at intake facilities that require proper physical
protection, and to flooding of treatment facilities and/or pumping stations located close to rivers or in exposed
areas. Droughts also impact water quality, because they result in lower dilution of pollution loads, especially in the
Prut and Nistru Rivers (KPC 2013).

Water supply sources. Surface water is the main source of drinking water supply for urban areas, and underground
water is the main source for rural areas. Currently, 65% to 70% of total water is used for industrial heating and
cooling and for hydropower production, 15% to 20% for drinking and domestic purposes, and 5% to 10% for irrigation
(UNDP 2009). All internal rivers are seasonal, becoming dry during summer months, with a high level of mineralization
and pollution, making them unsuitable for conventional drinking water sources. Underground water is the main source
of raw water to produce potable water in Moldova, and it supplies 100% of the rural population, 30% of the urban
population, and 65% of the total population in the country (Mediu 2009). Surface water is used for water provision
in 70% of urban areas. Continuous degradation of drinking water quality is due to increased livestock raising in
households, agricultural and municipal waste storage and landfills, and infiltration of polluted waters.

provision. Currently, 52 municipally owned operators provide               and market shares
water and sanitation services to 43% of the population
mainly located in urban areas. The rest of the population
relies on self-provision (Figure 1).

Capacity and training. Improvement of water utility staff training and capacity is key to enhancing water utility
management and performance. The water sector in Moldova suffers from a lack of specialized staff with experience
in water infrastructure management and implementation of investment projects. Municipal representatives appoint
utility management staff who have no specific qualifications or competencies. Technical water sector staff receive no
training. The national water association, Asociatia Moldova Apa-Canal (AMAC), created in 2000, has limited coverage
over the Moldovan territory and little capacity to promote knowledge and best practices. Incentives should be created
to foster sector performance as a key element of utility governance.

Economic regulation. Tariffs are regulated through a revenue cap methodology. The water sector in Moldova is
regulated by the National Energy Regulatory Agency, a multisector regulator created under the 2002 Law on Public
Service of Communal Management, which received the responsibility to oversee the water services sector in 2014.
Tariffs are revised upon request of utilities, which submit a new tariff proposal to their local authority. The new tariff
proposal is reviewed by the National Energy Regulatory Agency according to a revenue cap methodology devised in
2004 for tariff calculation for water supply, sewage, and wastewater treatment.

Ongoing or planned reforms. Access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation is among the main goals of the
New Water Strategy. Within the context of ratification of the Association Agreement between Moldova and the EU, the
government adopted a new water supply and sanitation strategy for 2014–2028. The strategy sets targets regarding
the extension and rehabilitation of the water and sanitation infrastructure, and objectives for information provision
and the water governance framework, with the long-term goal the regionalization of water utilities. The main goal of
the New Water Strategy in the short term, however, is to ensure, on a phased basis, access to safe drinking water, and
to adequate sanitation in all settlements throughout the country.

Equity of access to services. Access to water supply and sanitation facilities is very low for Roma households
and for the poorest segment of the population. Only 27% of the bottom 40% of the population has access to piped
water, and 15% to flush toilets (BNS 2010). Only 10% of the poorest share of the population—those living on less
than $2.50 a day—has access to piped water supply and 5% to flush toilets (BNS 2010). According to a 2007 UNDP
report, housing deprivation of Roma households is much higher than for the rest of the population. One-third of Roma
households live in an insecure dwelling, and more than 80% do not benefit from basic housing conditions such as
potable water supply and sanitation facilities (UNDP Moldova 2007).

Service infrastructure. Water infrastructure is deteriorating, but efforts are being made to halt the deterioration.
The water sector in Moldova is operating with an outdated infrastructure. Equipment is in poor condition and has
limited capacity. In 2009, there were 644 water supply systems, of which only 562 were operational. By 2012, the
situation had improved, with 677 of 742 water systems operational. However, 83% of the 271 pumping stations are in
unsatisfactory condition. There are 158 wastewater sanitation systems of which 110 are operational. The water and
sewage distribution network is 8,994 km long, of which 3,725 km are in bad condition (Mediu 2014a and AMAC 2015).

Quality of service. Although quality of service has improved, drinking water quality remains a priority for public health.
Water service continuity has nearly doubled over the last decade to 21.3 hours per day in 2012 (Figure 4) (IBNet 2015 based
on a sample of 41 water utilities). However, drinking water quality remains a major issue in Moldova; 10% to 14% of samples
fail to comply with microbiological requirements (Mediu 2014b). An estimated 22% to 25% of diarrheal diseases, 15% to
20% of viral hepatitis A, and 100% of fluorosis are caused by poor drinking water quality (Mediu 2014b). This situation is
aggravated by the lack of adequate laboratories to regularly test tap water quality.

Customer satisfaction. The satisfaction of the population with the service provided in their country is low, at 61%.
This number is lower than in most countries in the region (Gallup 2013).

    Overall efficiency. Water utilities are steadily increasing their efficiency, but there remains room for improvement.
    Overstaffing is a persistent issue in Moldovan water utilities, as shown by AMAC statistics, which include data
    from member utilities. With an average of 13.3 staff per 1,000 connections in 2012, staff productivity remains low
    compared to international best practices of 1 to 2 staff per 1,000 connections (AMAC 2015). The metering level
    of customers is high, at 80% in 2012 (IBNet 2015), as is the billing collection rate, which was 92% the same year
    (AMAC 2015). This shows a capacity to recover billed invoices and generate revenues for the service. Yet most
    water operators are in a negative spiral of rising costs of water supply and sewerage, deterioration of fixed assets,

insufficient spending on efficient technologies and equipment, high unit costs of electricity, and high nonrevenue
water (41% in 2012) (IBNet 2015). Efficiency varies considerably among utilities, and there are important contrasts
between the well-performing and improving Chisinau utility and the rest of the urban utilities, which are much less
efficient and whose condition is deteriorating.

Recent trends. Water and sanitation services have achieved significant efficiency gains over the last decade, which
should continue. Although water and sanitation services operate with limited operational and financial capacity, they
have been able to significantly increase their efficiency over the last decade. From 2001 to 2012, the metering level
has been multiplied by 2.5 (Figure 5) (IBNet 2015). Such an evolution seems to have encouraged rational consumption
behavior on the part of consumers, since water consumption decreased by 40% over the same period (AMAC 2015).
Overstaffing has gradually diminished since 2003, dropping from 23.6 to 13.3 staff per 1,000 connections (Figure
6) (AMAC 2015). This increase in productivity, partly deriving from the revenue cap methodology for tariff setting,
has lowered the burden of staff expenditure on overall operating expenditures, but overstaffing needs to be further
reduced. The level of nonrevenue water has remained stable over the last 10 years, showing no improvement in
network maintenance or replacement. Clearly, efficiency gains are still needed in this area (IBNet 2015).

Overall sector financing. Tariffs are the main source of funding, and they cover operation and maintenance
costs. However, since tariffs are being kept low, they only allow for minimal operation and maintenance. To fund
investments, revenues collected by utilities are augmented by subsidies from both national and local budgets, and
some international grants and loans (Figure 7).

The main sources of funding of water and wastewater utilities are described in Figure 8 , using the OECD three Ts
methodology (tariffs, transfers, and taxes).

Investment needs. A significant increase in investment is planned over the next 15 years. Within the framework
of the New Strategy for the water sector, investment needs have been assessed for the next 15 years. They amount
to €705 million, of which €194 million should be invested in the next five years (2014–2018), or €11/capita/year.

According to New Strategy supporting documents, this should be achieved by an average annual increase of 5% in
consolidated grants from national and local budgets, assuming a stable contribution from foreign funding sources
(€19 million to €21 million/year). Among other objectives, these investments aim at extending water and sewer
networks, increasing the number of users connected to water and sewerage public utilities, and rehabilitating and
building water and wastewater treatment plants (Eptisa 2012).

Investments. The current level of investment is too low to match water sector needs. During 2009–2013, €12
million was invested annually in the water sector in Moldova, which represents a very low contribution of only €2/
capita/year (AMAC 2015). This amount is only 0.02% of nominal GDP compared to the 1.2% to 6% recommended by
the OECD for low-income countries (OECD 2011). Two-thirds of the investments were financed by international donors
and one-third by national and local budgets. National grants are allocated on a first come-first served basis, with no
rational long-term planning strategy or any requirements regarding economic and technical assessment of projects.

 Tariffs. In the last 10 years, water tariffs have increased above inflation and are still expected to increase. In 2012,
 the mean residential water and sanitation tariff was €0.85/m3 (AMAC 2015), which is in line with the Danube regional
 average. Water service provision represents 67% of the overall price, and wastewater service 33% (AMAC 2015). Since
 2004, tariffs have doubled, while the average inflation rate was 9% per year, resulting in a real term increase of 2% to
 3% per year (Figure 9). Tariffs are expected to continue to increase, given the significant investments and associated
 operating costs planned in the New Strategy for water and sanitation services for the next 15 years (Eptisa 2012).

Affordability. On average, potential water and wastewater charges represent 4.5% of household income. This
matches the upper acceptable threshold proposed by the OECD. For the bottom 40% of the population, water
charges potentially represent more than 6% of household monthly income, and for the poorest decile, 14% (Authors’
elaboration). This may introduce serious affordability issues, especially in light of the upcoming investment efforts
requiring tariff increases. However, few households from the poorest decile are currently connected to public water
services.




Water Sector Sustainability
and Main Challenges
To evaluate and reflect the sustainability of services in the region, an overall sector sustainability assessment was done,
taking into account four main dimensions: access to services, quality of services, efficiency of services, and financing
of services. Each of these dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators. For each indicator,
best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the region, and countries closest to those best
performers are deemed to have a more mature sector. A more complete description of the methodology to assess the
sector sustainability is included in the Annex of the State of the Sector Regional Report from the Danube Water Program.
The outcomes of this assessment for the Moldova water sector are presented in Figure 11, which also shows average
and best practices in the Danube region. The Moldova sector sustainability score is 50, which is below the Danube
average of 64, and is among the lowest scores in the region. The assessment shows that, on average, the country
performs well in terms of collection ratio, nonrevenue water, and continuity of service. The main deficiencies of the
Moldova water sector identified through the sector sustainability assessment are access to piped water and flush toilets,
affordability, and investment level (Figure 10).

The main sector challenges are:

XXImproving   access to piped water and adequate sanitation. In rural areas, 1.5 million inhabitants do not have
   access to piped water and 1.8 million do not have access to flush toilets. Thus, access to safe drinking water
   and proper sanitation is one of the major upcoming challenges for the water sector in Moldova. These efforts
   are necessary to reduce health risks and environmental pollution through untreated discharges. In urban areas,
   extensions to existing systems and improvements of their reliability and efficiency will also provide health benefits
   to the population through the supply of safer drinking water and adequate sanitation.

XXFinancing   investments to upgrade the water and wastewater sector infrastructure. Over the next 15 years, €705
  million will be needed to accomplish the goals of the New Strategy for the water sector. This will require a major
  funding effort multiplying current investments by a factor of five. This increase should be covered by an average
  annual increase of 5% in consolidated grants from national and local budgets, assuming a stable contribution from
  foreign funding sources (Eptisa 2012). Efforts must also be made to improve the quality of drinking water, since the
  compliance rate is only 86%, and the effective level of wastewater collection and treatment.

XXAddressing   potential affordability issues regarding water and sanitation prices. The potential affordability of
  water is already an issue for a majority of the Moldovan population, with the average share of potential water and
  sanitation expenditures of nearly 5%. The upcoming investment efforts, which will require tariff increases, could
  exacerbate the affordability issue in the future.
