     Box 1—  How Government Supports Livestock Insurance in Mongolia
     Since 2005, the World Bank has supported the Government of Mongolia in setting up a public-private partnership with domestic insurance
     companies to offer affordable and cost-effective insurance coverage to herders. Today, 16 percent of the approximately 1 million herders in the
     country are insured under the Index-Based Livestock Insurance Program (IBLIP).

     While the Government of Mongolia significantly subsidizes the national program, the subsidization does not take the form of direct premium
     subsidies. Instead:

     1. The Government pays for the collection of all data used in the livestock insurance scheme, and provides audited data to accredited insurance
     companies in a timely manner.

     2. The Government also provides a “social layer” of reinsurance to all farmers at no additional cost. While farmers purchase insurance priced
     commercially against relatively frequent shocks, the social layer protects against infrequent catastrophic losses when the insurance is exhausted. In
     other words, the Government guarantees payouts in extreme natural disaster situations, allowing insurance companies to offer affordable premiums
     to policyholders. Additionally, thanks to this publically funded extra layer of insurance, policyholders possess additional coverage beyond that of the
     insurance they purchase.

     3. Finally, government extension workers provide education to herders about livestock insurance and its potential use as part of a holistic approach
     to herd risk management.

               Box 2—  Improving the Quality of Yield Data in India
               For the past eight years, the Government of India has been working on improving its agricultural insurance programs, which
               cover approximately 34 million farming households with the support of technical assistance from the World Bank. The National
               Agricultural Insurance Scheme suffered from a number of problems, including a lack of consistency in the way crop cuts were
               conducted and recorded, a scarcity of trained personnel, and insufficient monitoring of crop cuts. As a result, the Scheme suffered
               from significant delays in paying claims to farmers, and did not always pay claims when farmers had been severely affected.

               To address these challenges, the Agricultural Insurance Company of India joined forces with the World Bank to establish a
               pilot program where crop cuts were video recorded with GPS-tagged footage using mobile phones. The data, along with the
               yield estimates, was then provided to insurance companies by text message at the time of the crop cuttings to allow real-time
               monitoring. This innovative use of technology greatly improves the quality of data collected and thus the trust of insurers and
               reinsurers and ultimately lowers the insurance and reinsurance premium. It is also an example of how the speed and auditing of
               data can be significantly improved through using developments in technology.

     Box 3—  Setting Up A Coinsurance Pool in Turkey
     Prior to 2006 only 0.5 percent of farmland in Turkey was insured. A number of private insurance companies provided limited crop and greenhouse
     insurance, while livestock insurance was as-yet poorly developed. At the time, the Government did not support agricultural insurance, but rather
     provided limited ad hoc post-disaster relief to crop and livestock producers after catastrophic losses.

     In 2006, the Government of Turkey established the Tarsim Agricultural Insurance Pool. Established by law, it comprises 16 private commercial
     companies, each with a 6.25 percent share in the company. Tarsim underwrites crop and livestock risk on the behalf of coinsurers. The
     Government subsidizes half of most premium payments. No other companies are allowed to offer agricultural insurance. With Tarsim operational,
     the number of policy sales has increased from 218,938 to 744,093 (an increase of 240 percent) and premium income for participating companies
     has increased from TL 47 million to TL 273 million (USD 23 million to USD 131 million, a 482 percent increase). Turkey has grown to be the third
     largest agricultural insurance market in Europe by premium volume.

     The advantages of Tarsim include:

     •	 Cost savings, since administrative and operating costs of all insurers are shared through the pool;

     •	 Better reinsurance rates, as the pool can buy coverage for a more diversified portfolio than if each insurer tried to do it individually;

     •	 The ability to maintain underwriting and data quality standards;

     •	 Easier coordination of government support.
