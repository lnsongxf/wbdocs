Preface
At the invitation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of Myanmar, a World Bank (WB)
team comprising José De Luna-Martínez (Financial Systems Global Practice) and Ratchada
Anantavrasilpa (East Asia Financial Sector Department) conducted a mission in Myanmar in
2013. The mission’s main objective was to prepare a diagnostic report of the Myanma
Agricultural Development Bank (MADB), the largest financial institution serving the
agriculture and rural sector of Myanmar, and formulate a series of proposals to strengthen
it. The team met with the senior management members of MADB who kindly provided data,
annual reports, and other internal guidelines and policies of MADB. They also arranged a
visit to select branches in rural areas.

The team presents this document as an initial assessment of MADB. The report aims to
provide the basis for dialogue between authorities, domestic stakeholders, and the donor
community in Myanmar about the challenges faced by MADB and potential options to reform
it.

Once more data and information on the agriculture and rural sectors in Myanmar become
available, a second report will be prepared. The new report will take into account the results
of the stakeholders’ consultations on MADB. Moreover, it will sharpen some of the
recommendations by aligning them to Myanmar’s long-term vision and strategies to
modernize the agriculture, rural, and financial sectors, which are currently in the formulation
process.

This initial report was generously funded by the Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund
(LIFT), a multidonor fund established in Myanmar in 2009. The donors to LIFT are Australia,
Denmark, the European Union, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland,
the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

The team is grateful to the senior management members of MADB who enthusiastically
engaged in productive discussions and shared their valuable insights. The team also
received valuable comments and suggestions from a group of technical experts from the
World Bank, including Paavo Eliste, James Seward, Steven Jaffee, and Sergiy Zorya, as
well as experts from LIFT, including Barclay O’Brien (former LIFT) and Myint Kyaw.

The team expresses its gratitude to Ulrich Zachau (World Bank Country Director for South
East Asia), Tunc Uyanik (World Bank Director, EASFP), Kanthan Shankar (World Bank
Country Manager for Myanmar), Julia M. Fraser, Hormoz Aghdaey, Constantine Chikosi,
Nang Htay Htay for their valuable guidance and support. The team received excellent
logistical support from Piathida Poonprasit.

Executive Summary
Myanmar is an agricultural country. It is estimated that the agriculture sector represents      s
between 35 to 40 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and that up to 70 percent of the
labor force (of 32.5 million) is directly or indirectly engaged in agricultural activities or
depend on agriculture for their income. Moreover, it is estimated that agriculture products
generate between 25 and 30 percent of total export earnings. Given agriculture’s important
contribution to the economy, the modernization of the agriculture sector is a top priority in the
economic and social development agenda of the Government of Myanmar.

Looking forward, Myanmar’s agricultural potential is enormous given the country’s rich natu-
ral resources and favorable geographical location. Myanmar’s diverse topography, climates,
water resources, and eco-systems offer farmers and investors the opportunity to produce a
wide range of cereals, pulses, horticultural products, fruits, livestock, and fish. Because of its
strategic location between the two enormous regional markets of India and China, and easy
access to buoyant markets in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
Myanmar’s agriculture sector is well positioned to grow, develop a dynamic agribusiness
industry, and provide people with the opportunity to improve their living standards.

Among the government institutions supporting the agriculture sector, the Myanma Agricul-
ture Development Bank (MADB) plays an important role. MADB was established in June
1953 by the Government of Myanmar to support the development of agriculture, livestock,
and rural enterprises in Myanmar. MADB is currently the largest financial institution serving
the rural areas and financing agriculture activities. At the end of 2012, MADB served 1.87
million customers, mostly farmers, and had a network of 206 branches (which accounted for
23 percent of all banks’ branches in Myanmar). Since its creation, MADB has played an
important economic and social role by providing loans to a large segment of low-income
households engaged in agricultural activities.

Despite the existing limitations in its information technology (IT), infrastructure, and opera-
tions platform, every year MADB disburses a large volume of short-term loans to farmers
both during the monsoon and the winter agricultural seasons. Moreover, despite the inher-
ent risks of the agriculture activities and lack of financial instruments to mitigate risks in its
loan portfolio, MADB has historically had a strong track-record in loan recovery thanks to the
various mechanisms it has put in place with local authorities to exert pressure on delinquent
borrowers.

Notwithstanding its past success, MADB is in need of a profound reform to ensure that the
institution is able to contribute to the modernization of the agriculture sector in a meaningful
manner. Currently, MADB faces various weaknesses, such as the following:

Lack of diversification of MADB’s portfolio: Despite the high volume of loans disbursed
by MADB every year, MADB’s loan portfolio is heavily concentrated on a single type of client
(farmers) and one commodity (rice). MADB finances only up to 10 acres per farmer. Most
farmers financed by MADB are engaged in subsistence agriculture and use rudimentary
cultivation techniques that prevent them from reaching high yields for their crops. MADB
does not finance large farmers engaged in commercial agriculture or other agribusiness
firms. Furthermore, MADB does not serve traders, exporters, transport firms, warehouses,
equipment sellers, and other type of firms along the agricultural value chains.

MADB finances the production of a limited number of crops and commodities nationwide,
including paddy, groundnut, sesame, beans, cotton, and corn. In fact, 88 percent of MADB’s
loan portfolio is concentrated in paddy farmers. MADB does not finance the production of
fruits and vegetables with a higher added value. More worrisome is the fact that MADB does
not finance livestock, fish, the production of processed food or beverages, seeds, fertilizers,
or any other high value-added products.

Limited range of financial products: Most loans granted by MADB are designed to sup-
port the working capital needs of the customers it serves by covering a fraction of the
production cost. However, if MADB decided to expand business focus, it would have to offer
a wider range of financial instruments and services to its clients, including: savings products,
new types of investment loans, factoring, trade finance, warehouse receipt finance, leasing,
letters of credit, loan guarantees, and so forth, which are already allowed under the MADB
law but not yet implemented.

Risk management: The capability of MADB to measure, manage, and mitigate risks as
other agriculture banks in other parts of the world do is limited. To start with, MADB’s interest
rates on loans and deposits are not set by MADB itself but by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Irrigation (MAI) with no consideration to the risk profile of borrowers. Currently, the annual
interest rate for loans is 8.5 percent, which is a subsidized rate (the market interest rate is
12 percent). Moreover, the total volume of credit to be disbursed by MADB each year is also
set by MAI. MADB does not conduct any analysis nor does it take any measures to mitigate
its risk exposure by commodity or region.

Although MADB has put in place an effective system for quick loan disbursement, in practice
MADB carries out no credit analysis on existing or prospective borrowers. Loans are
approved automatically after proper documentation has been reviewed by village credit
committees, which are composed of representatives of local authorities, MAI staff, and farmers’
representatives. MADB staff does not participate in the credit committees at village level,




                                                                                               8
                                                                  al and credit
review of loan applications, and does not take part in the appraisal     c    t
decision-making process.

Most loans granted by MADB are not collateralized. Farmers are required to join a group of
5 to 10 farmers to collectively guarantee each individual loan. Agriculture insurance products
are not available yet in the marketplace. Thus, MADB’s entire loan portfolio remains
exposed to the occurrence of natural disasters, plagues, and commodity price fluctuations,
which may severely affect the ability of borrowers to repay.

Unsustainable funding model: Funding is a major challenge faced by MADB. Although the
business operations of MADB have remained profitable thanks to the ability to access funds
at subsidized interest rates from the state-owned Myanma Economic Bank (MEB) and
collect loans in full through pressure from local authorities on delinquent borrowers, MADB
would not be able to remain financially sustainable without the access to cheap funding.
MEB raises deposits from the public at 8 percent per year, but it lends to MADB at 4 percent.
The ultimate cost of this funding scheme is borne not by MEB but by taxpayers, because the
Government ultimately needs to compensate MEB for the subsidies it passes on to MADB.
Thus, in the long term, MADB’s access to subsidized credit from the Government or MEB is
not a sustainable scheme and poses a growing fiscal burden.

Inadequate regulation and supervision: Even though MADB is established as a develop-
ment bank, it is not licensed as a full-fledged bank. MADB is functionally and legally an arm
of MAI. As a result, MADB is not regulated and supervised by the central bank as the other
state-owned or private commercial banks are. Moreover, the prudential standards—on
capital, loan classification and provisioning, accounting rules, liquidity, risk management,
and so on— applicable to other commercial banks or financial institutions are not applied to
MADB. MAI and the Auditor General Office of the Union are responsible for supervising the
operations of MADB and auditing. In practice, however, both institutions lack the capability
to assess the risks and potential vulnerabilities faced by MADB.

Weak corporate governance: The corporate governance of MADB is weak and far from
the standards followed by the banking industry. MADB’s internal control system is
rudimentary and there is no audit committee. The internal audit function reports directly to
the bank’s management team, not to the board. The entire board is composed of
government officials from MAI with no independent members. “Fit and proper” requirements
for board members or senior management do not exist. Board meetings are few and far
between and management is subject to strict administrative controls by MAI. Accountability
of management and board members is limited. Transparency and information disclosure are
extremely limited as well. MADB has not published its annual report for many years. MADB’s
accounts are not audited by a third party, and MADB’s financial statements are not prepared
according to international standards.

Information technology and operations: MADB operates with a rudimentary IT and
physical infrastructure. Communication between headquarters and branches takes place
through the post offices or fax machines due to the lack of an internal communication
platform. Most files are not digitalized; they are kept physically in the branches with the risk
      mag or loss. Reporting processes for management and clients is slow due to the
of damage
      ce of information
absence     in          technology. Cash management is also rudimentary with potential risk of loss.


                                                                                                  9
                                                            i l infrastructure
Overall, MADB is in need of major investments in IT and physical                  a
                                                                 i f t t re to be able to
perform as a modern full-fledged bank.

To address the weaknesses and challenges of MADB, this report proposes various actions.       s
In the short term, authorities should focus their efforts on ensuring that MADB is able to
operate in a sound manner. MADB needs to become financially self-sustainable and able to
operate in the agriculture sector without crowding out other financial intermediaries willing to
serve the same segments of the market of MADB. To achieve that, MADB must be given the
power to set and modify as necessary its interest rates on its deposit and lending products,
reflecting the real cost of funding and risk profile of borrowers.

It could be argued that smallholder farmers would not be able to pay higher interest rates. In
practice, however, MADB’s current annual interest rate on loans (8.5 percent) is
substantially lower than the annual interest rates charged by informal lenders (72 percent to
120 percent) operating in rural areas. In addition, before 2012 MADB charged higher
interest rates, in the range of 13 to 18 percent per year. A gradual return to the 2011 interest
rate levels, accompanied by an improvement in the quality of services, is desirable.

In addition, the following short-term actions are proposed:

        Under section 10 of its law, MADB is required to transfer 75 percent of its profits
        to the Government, leaving almost no resources to fund the much-needed
        modernization of MADB.

For the long term, authorities will have to decide what type of institution MADB should
                                                                                    ou
There are at least three possible scenarios. Under the first one, MADB could maintain its
focus on smallholder farmers while improving its funding structure and addressing
operational deficiencies. Under the second scenario, MADB could be transformed into a
microfinance-type institution, such as Bank Rakyat Indonesia, allowing it to serve more
clients in the agriculture and rural sectors while addressing its weaknesses in funding and
operations. The third option proposes to gradually transform MADB from a simple loan
disbursement agency into a financially self-sustainable development finance institution able
to support the modernization of the agriculture sector through a wide range of financial and
advisory services.

Certainly, these options are not the only ones feasible for MADB, and authorities could
explore new options for strengthening this institution. Policy makers should discuss what
type of financial institution they need to reach the Government’s objectives in the agriculture
and rural sectors, taking into account the institutional context of Myanmar and valuable
lessons and sound practices adopted from similar institutions in other parts of the world.

When thinking about the future of MADB, many issues should be considered: What role will
private financial intermediaries be expected to play in the agriculture finance market in the
future? To what extent and how fast will the Government liberalize the financial system?
What are the key obstacles facing agriculture finance markets (e.g., bankruptcy regime, land
ownership issues, creditors’ rights, credit bureau, use of movable assets as collateral, and
so on)? Which agriculture activities and subsectors have the most promising outlook in
Myanmar? Who will finance the much-needed infrastructure for the agriculture sector (e.g.,
irrigation systems, rural roads, warehouses, sanitation centers, laboratories, ports, and so
forth)? Who will provide the capital needed by MADB to grow (e.g., government, private
sector, foreign investors, international finance institutions, or others)?

Most of the challenges faced by policy makers in Myanmar have also been faced by other
policy makers around the world at different points in time. In fact, the World Bank has
assisted countries in various regions of the world to reform their state-owned financial
institutions. The report presents three successful cases of reform of large agriculture banks
owned by the state, which could be useful references for Myanmar: Bank for Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) of Thailand, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, and Financiera
Rural of Mexico.

The reform pattern followed by each of these three institutions is not uniform. Nonetheless,
given the initial circumstances and problems that they faced, the reform outcomes are
positive and have contributed to turning insolvent institutions into profitable banks with the
capability to serve the agriculture sector on a sustainable basis and contribute to improving
the living standards of farmers and raise the competitiveness of their agricultural
sub-sectors.

Building a successful state-owned agriculture bank is not an easy task. Historically, several
agriculture banks around the world have failed due to poor corporate governance, inadequate

1. Diagnostic of MADB
1.1 Overview of the Agriculture Sector and the Role of MADB

Agriculture is the largest economic sector in Myanmar.1 The agricultural sector, includ-
ing livestock and fisheries, is estimated to contribute between 30 and 40 percent to gross
domestic product (GDP) (figure 1). In terms of employment, approximately 70 percent of the
labor force (of 32.5 million) is reportedly engaged in agriculture or dependent to a significant
extent on agriculture for its income. The agriculture sector also accounts for 25 to 30 percent
of total exports by value. Pulses, rice, rubber, and fisheries constitute the main agricultural
export commodities of Myanmar.

Paddy dominates the agriculture sector, accounting for around 60 percent of the net
sown area and around 80 percent of the total value of sector production (Vokes and Goletti
2013). Other key crops include pulses, oilseeds, and rubber. The country also produces,
sugar, maize, a wide range of fruit and vegetables, palm oil, and coffee. Livestock currently
is a relatively small sector of agriculture, contributing only 7.5 percent of total agricultural
GDP.

Farmers generally grow lower value crops such as paddy, pulses, and oilseeds on
relatively large surfaces, while high-value horticulture and fruit crops take place on much
smaller plots. Paddy, pulse, and oilseed farmers cultivate an average of 4.0 to 5.0 acres per
holding. In contrast, onions, garlic, and potato fields average about 1.5 acres each, while vegetables
and cut flowers are grown on plots ranging between 0.6 and 0.7 acres in size (USAID 2013).

investment, including in basic infrastructure such as roads, warehouses, electricity,   elect ricity,
irrigation systems, research, sanitation centers, and extension services, among other basic
infrastructure, resulting in low productivity in the sector and low rural incomes. It is estimated d
that agriculture annual income per worker in Myanmar was only US$194 in 2012 compared
to US$6,680 dollars in Malaysia and US$706 in Thailand (table 1).

Agriculture finance remains underdeveloped due, in part, to the small size of the
banking system. The banking system of Myanmar is composed of 4 state-owned banks
with a network of 547 branches, 19 domestic private banks with a network of 347 branches,
1 private-owned finance company, and 16 foreign bank representative offices. In 2012,
domestic bank deposits and private credit accounted for only 17.9 and 7.9 percent of GDP,
respectively, according to data from the Central Bank of Myanmar (2013). Myanmar has 2
bank branches per 100,000 adults and 123 bank accounts per 1,000 adults. In all these
indicators, Myanmar lags behind its neighboring countries, as shown in table 2.

MADB is a relatively small financial institution, with 116.3 billion kyats in assets
(around US$130 million) at the end of March 2012, which accounted for only 1.3 percent of
total assets in the banking system. However, in terms of outreach and number of branches,
MADB is the second largest state-owned institution in the banking system, after Myanma
Economic Bank (MEB). At the end of 2012, MADB served 1.87 million customers, mostly
smallholder farmers, and had a network of 206 branches (which accounted for 23 percent of
all bank branches in Myanmar).

MADB was established in June 1953 by the Government of Myanmar to support the
development of agriculture, livestock, and rural enterprises in Myanmar. It is currently
owned and supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI). Since its establish-
ment, MADB has played an important economic and social role in Myanmar by providing
loans to a large segment households in rural areas engaged in agricultural activities. Most
MADB loan products are designed to cover the short-term working capital needs of farmers,
such as purchase of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides; payment of salaries for farm workers;
and lease of agriculture equipment. MADB lends at subsidized interest rates, following the
lending policies and programs issued by MAI.

During the past three years, MADB has grown rapidly. From March 2010 to March 2012,
MADB’s loan portfolio grew from K 20,392 million to K 116,275 million, an increase of 470
percent. As discussed in subsequent sections of this report, this increase was driven mainly
by a substantial increase in the amount of money that MADB lends per acre and not by a
substantial expansion in the number of customers the institution serves or a significant
increase in the number of acres financed by MADB.

As of March 2012, MADB’s capital adequacy, liquidity, and reserve ratios stood at
10.91 percent, 17.46 percent, and 5.14 percent, respectively. The loan-to-deposits ratio
was 96.13 percent (table 3). However, these ratios should be taken cautiously, because
MADB does not comply with the same prudent standards applicable to commercial banks,
as described in subsequent sections of the report.

1.2 MABD’s Mission and Policy Mandate

MADB’s mission is clearly stated in its law (article 5), which requires MADB to “sup-
port the development of agriculture, livestock, and rural socioeconomic enterprises
in the country by providing banking services.” However, in practice MADB’s business
operations are not properly aligned to this goal; in fact, MADB’s current lending portfolio is
heavily concentrated on farmers engaged in only four commodities, leaving the rest of activi-
ties, products, and services in the agriculture sector completely beyond its business focus.

MADB provides loans to farmers to cover a fraction of the production costs for up to
their first 10 acres. Most of MADB’s borrowers are engaged in subsistence agriculture
using rudimentary cultivation techniques that prevent them from reaching high yields for
their crops. MADB does not support medium or largeholder farmers engaged in commercial
agriculture or other agribusiness firms, traders, exporters, and other type of firms along the
entire value chain, although the MADB law allows it to lend for production, processing,
storage, distribution, and marketing activities relating to the agricultural and livestock
enterprises. Even when its clients grow and diversify their business activities, MADB does
not support them.

Moreover, MADB finances the production of only a limited number of crops and com-
modities nationwide, such as paddy, groundnut, sesame, beans, cotton, and corn.
MADB does not finance the production of fruits and other vegetables with a higher value in
the marketplace. More worrisome is the fact that MADB does not finance livestock, the
      ction of
production  o seeds, fertilizers, processed foods, beverages, forestry activities, or any other
      alue-adde product.

in Myanmar amounts to only 7.9 percent of GDP, a low figure compared to other neighboring
countries, such as such as Bangladesh (48.6), China (127.4), India (50.6), Lao PDR (20),  )
and Thailand 108.6), as illustrated in table 2.

Although a growing number of microfinance institutions and informal lenders are
serving farmers, they have limited capital, and the demand for credit in the agriculture
sector remains largely unmet. Moreover, informal lenders usually lend at interest rates of
6 to 10 percent or more per “month,” or 72 to 100 percent per year, creating a trap for many
debtors who have become highly indebted and unable to repay their loans. Reportedly,
many farmers actually borrow from MADB simply to roll over debt or payoff the high interest
loans provided by informal lenders (Ashe Center 2011).

There is plenty of room in the marketplace for MADB and several other private (or
state-owned) banks, microfinance institutions, specialized financial institutions, and
so forth (see table 4). In fact, it is estimated that more than 3.5 million farmers are not
served by MADB due to lack of land titles. Moreover, the provision of modern instruments
for agriculture finance, such as warehouse receipts financing, contract farming, supply chain
financing, factoring, leasing, and trade finance is still at an incipient stage in Myanmar. The
provision of loan guarantees, insurance products, and long-term credit for large
infrastructure projects and land acquisitions is still unavailable.

                              production cost. All farmers receive the same loan amount. The larger the land

Therefore, it is advisable to lift all the administrative restrictions that prevent MADB
from serving a wider range of clients and activities in the agriculture sector of
Myanmar as mandated by its 1990 law. By doing so, MADB could have a higher develop-
mental impact in the agriculture sector, leverage its extensive branch network in a more
productive manner, diversify its sources of income, and mitigate risks.

1.3 Lending Operations

Loans are the main financial product offered by MADB to its clients. MADB offers two
types of loans to its customers nationwide: the seasonal crop production loan and the term
loan, which account for 98 percent and 2 percent of total outstanding loans in 2012,
respectively. See table 5.

Seasonal Crop Production Loan (SCPL) and Term Loan (TL)

The SCPL is designed to cover the working capital needs of smallholder farmers at
the beginning of the agriculture season. Loans are divided into three categories:
monsoon, winter, and premonsoon loans, with the first being the most important type of loan
for MADB. Loan maturity is up to one year and full repayment is expected at harvest time.
The loan amount varies according to the number of acres owned or leased by the farmer
and the intended crop. (See table 6 for all loan types.)

TLs are classified in three subgroups: Short-term loan, farm machinery loan, and
special project loan. Most TLs are collateralized. The short-term loan is provided to finance
sugarcane plantations, tea processing, and solar salt production. The farm machinery loan
is the only type of loan that requires compulsory savings by the farmer. This type of loan is
granted for the purchase of machinery for agricultural purposes and is given with a
three-year maturity period. The repayment is divided into three installments, with an option
to repay with the compulsory deposit at the end of each year. The last subgroup is the
speciall project
         pro     loan, which is a loan granted by MADB to finance rubber plantations under
      overnmen border area development projects.

Breakdown of the Loan Portfolio

Monsoon loans dominate the lending portfolio. As illustrated in figure 2, the monsoon
subtype of loan accounted for 85 percent of the total MADB’s lending portfolio in 2012,
followed by the winter season loan (11 percent). The remaining part of the loan portfolio is
composed of term loans in their different modalities.

(5 percent), and sesame (3 percent) are the top three crops financed by MADB underer the
SCPL in the agricultural year 2011–12. The average loan amount per borrower is    s kyat
195,000 (equivalent to US$230).

Loan Guarantees

Most of MADB’s loans (99.9 percent) require a joint guarantee of borrowers instead of
collateral. Individual farmers must join a group of 5 to 10 members and collectively
guarantee each individual loan. MADB grants loans to farmers only in townships with full
repayment history. As a result of this strict requirement, up to now MADB has reported a high
loan quality.

Despite the effectiveness of group guarantees and the historical high repayment ratio
reported by MADB, MADB should treat these loans as unsecured loans and adopt
more stringent standards on capital and provisioning. MADB may face serious financial
difficulties due to its undiversified loan portfolio especially in the event of a widespread
weather-related problem affecting the crops being financed. This means that MADB should
maintain a higher capital adequacy ratio and accumulate more provisions to be able to deal
with unexpected losses, whenever and wherever they arise.

Machinery loans require collateral. Under the farm machinery loan, which accounted for
only 0.02 percent of total loans, the machinery is taken as collateral, and in addition and a
compulsory savings of 40 percent is required for machines sold by the Government and 50
percent for machines sold by the private companies. Tea-processing and coffee plantation
loans are guaranteed by the Government under its special projects.

Loan Amount per Farmer

The size of the land that a farmer has the right to use for agricultural activities deter-
mines the loan amount granted by MADB to each farmer. Each farmer can get a loan for
a maximum of 10 acres. Every year, MAI estimates the total production cost for each type of
crop and the percentage of it that MADB will finance (usually less than 40 percent of the total
production cost). For the agricultural year 2013–14, MAI mandated MADB to significantly
increase its individual loan amount from K 50,000 to K 100,000 per acre for paddy and sugar
cane, and from K 10,000 to K 20,000 per acre for other crops such as sesame and peanut.

The current loan amounts used by MADB do not cover the total cost of farming. For
low-quality rice, for example, the production cost is estimated at around K 200,000 per acre
and K 400,000 for high-quality rice such as Pearl Thwe rice. The labor contribution from
family members is excluded from the aforementioned costs.

The significant increase in the loan size per acre explains the rapid increase in the loan
portfolio of MADB in the past years. As shown in table 7, the loan amount per acre for paddy
production increased from K 10,000 in agriculture year 2009–10 to K 40,000 in year 2011–12,
an increase of 300 percent. During the same period, the total number of acres financed by
MADB increased only by 18 percent as there was a loan cap of 10 acres per farmer.

1.4 Credit Policies

Credit policies at MADB are weak and far from international best practices. To begin
with, MADB is not fully involved in the credit decision-making process. MADB delegates the
credit decision to the loan screening committees at the village level. Each village has its own
committee. Each branch of MADB covers several villages in that particular township and
manages several such committees, each of which is composed of the head of village, the
representative from the Land Record Department, the representative from the Department
of Agriculture, the representative from the Industrial Crop Department, and the representa-
tive from the farmers. There is no representative from MADB in these committees.

To apply for a loan, farmers have to submit a loan application to the loan screening
committee at the village level for approval. MADB requires farmers to have a good credit
history, to join a group of 5-10 farmers to mutually guarantee their loans, and to submit the
Farmer Registration Book issued by the village authorities. The book is required to verify the
farmer’s right over the land leased from the Government year by year; it could not be used
as a guarantee. However, a new farm law was recently passed by the parliament under
which farmers will be issued ownership certificates, which could be transferred and thus
pledged as collateral. Issuing certificates is under way, and MADB will need to adapt its
lending terms and conditions to these new circumstances.

the committee reviews and approves all loan applications that meet the conditions.      onditions.
MADB’s branch managers sign off the loan application after the committee’s approval.         roval.
MADB staff is not allowed to travel to the villages for loan operations; farmers must come to
the bank in town to take out and to repay loans, incurring in considerable travel related
costs. Loan screening committees also help to ensure that farmers pay off their loans on due
dates. They exert pressure on delinquent borrowers with the argument that if a single
borrower fails to repay its loan, the entire village will not be able to borrow from MADB in the
next season.

Since the committee takes on the credit decision and monitoring process, MADB
virtually performs only an agent role by acting as a money distribution channel for the
Government. In the event of default, all members in the group are liable for repayment. If
the group cannot repay, MADB has to bear the resulting losses. The branch manager at the
township level is held responsible for following up with the delinquent borrowers and
guarantors.

At the end, MADB is responsible for the loss even though MADB is not involved in the
credit decision-making process. Clearly, this is not a healthy arrangement for the banking
business. MADB must be fully involved in the credit decision-making process and the loan
officers must be held accountable for their decisions.

1.5 Pricing and Funding

Interest rates for MADB’s lending and deposit products are set by MAI with no consid-
eration to the risk profile of borrowers, the need for MADB to reach profitability, or
other prevailing conditions in the marketplace. In recent years, the Government of
Myanmar has aimed at supporting smallholder farmers by providing loans through MADB at
subsidized interest rates. As shown in table 8, in 2012 the lending interest rate dramatically
dropped from 13.0 to 8.5 percent per year, while the interest rate for retail deposits remained
unchanged at 8.0 percent. As a result, the interest rate margin for MADB has narrowed
drastically. While in 2011 the interest rate margin was 5.0 percent, in 2012 it was only 0.5
percent. The current margin is clearly insufficient to cover operating expenses and absorb
losses and it is also the major reason why MADB has stopped savings mobilization in spite
of its specific objectives under section 6 of its law. In fact, historically MADB used to mobilize
and accumulate a large base of compulsory and voluntary savings. But in 2011 up to 90
percent of retail deposits were returned on concerns at the parliament about difficulties with
withdrawals, which practically wiped out the sizable capital base and liquidity of MADB.

MADB depends on MEB funding. To deal with the drastic decline in the interest margin
and avoid the bankruptcy of MADB, the Government has mandated the MEB, the largest
state-owned commercial bank in Myanmar and one with very high liquidity, to provide
subsidized funding to MADB. Thus, the MEB places a wholesale deposit with MADB at
the rate of 4.0 percent so that MADB can lend at 8.5 percent which is far below market
rate (market interest rate for loans in Myanmar is 12.0 to 13.0 percent) and thus could
achieve an interest margin of 4.5 percent.

The subsidized funding provided by the Government through MEB has allowed
MADB to remain afloat and continue its business expansion. Moreover, MADB’s
sources of funding have been changing rapidly in favor of the cheap funding provided by
the Government through MEB. In 2013, it was expected that practically all funding to
MADB would come from MEB.

The current funding model, however, is unsustainable for all parties involved.
MEB raises deposits at the rate of 8 percent, but lends to MADB at 4 percent per year.
Ultimately, to minimize losses, MEB needs to be compensated by the Government for
the annual losses it incurs in this scheme. As a result, the ultimate cost of this funding
scheme is being absorbed by taxpayers. See box 1 for more on this.




                                                                                              24
                    Box 1. Fiscal Burden of MADB’s Operations

                                                                                    ully
  Because of its status as a state-owned institution, MADB’s total liabilities are fully
  guaranteed by the Government of Myanmar. In other words, the Government is
  expected to honor MADB’s borrowings from financial institutions and other domestic
  and foreign creditors in the event of default.

  In 2012, the operations of MADB posed a contingent liability to the Government in
  an amount equivalent to 0.1 percent of Myanmar’s GDP. However, because MADB’s
  lending to farmers is predominantly granted on a short-term basis (six months or
  less), MADB’s borrowing needs from MEB and other creditors are actually higher
  than its outstanding liabilities at the end of each fiscal year. In 2012, the contingent
  liabilities of MADB, calculated on the basis of its accrued total borrowings during the
  fiscal year, would have reached 0.2 percent of Myanmar’s GDP. Both ratios are
  small, which reflect the small size of MADB’s balance sheet.

  Also, every year the Government of Myanmar must compensate MEB for lending to
  MADB at the subsidized interest rate of 4.0 percent per year, when MEB pays
  depositors 8.5 percent per year. In 2012, it is estimated that the Government spent
  approximately K 10 billion in compensations to MEB.

  Although MADB’s does not seem to pose a significant fiscal problem for Myanmar
  at this time, in the future this situation can change, as MADB’s lending operations
  continue to grow, unless MADB’s funding model is replaced with a financially sus-
  tainable one.


The practice of providing subsidized lending to smallholder farmers should end
soon. This practice cannot be the basis for MADB’s future growth. Such subsidies
create long-term market distortions, hook farmers in cheap loans, and prevent any com-
mercial financial institutions from ever entering the market.

As shown in table 8, MADB had previously been borrowing from MEB at higher
interest rates and operated on a commercial rate for many years up to 2011. MADB
should borrow from other financial institutions on market terms, and perhaps in the
future also be able to raise money in the capital markets and even from outside the
country as allowed by its law in section 20 (e). Like other agricultural banks in the region,
MADB could also raise savings deposits from its clients as a source of capital. To do so,
MADB must be allowed to lend to its clients at market interest rates, pricing its lending
products according to the risk profile of borrowers or activities to be financed.

A transition from the current subsidized interest rates to future market-based interest
rates should be done on a gradual basis to ensure that the provision of financial services
to low-income farmers is not disrupted. Even at market rates, the loans provided by
MADB would be by far much cheaper than the loans currently provided by informal lend-
ers, which impose annualized interest rates of 72 to 120 percent to borrowers in rural
areas, ca
       causing a serious problem in terms of indebtedness for many of them.



                                                                                          25
1.6 Risk Management

Currently, MADB has no written guidelines on risk management. It is recommended     ended
that MADB establish a risk management strategy in line with international principles       s
to support its business growth. This risk management practice can ensure sustainable
profitability and minimize adverse effects in the course of business difficulties. This risk
management framework should cover all relevant risks related to MADB’s business
operations, such as credit, interest rate, liquidity, and operation risks.

The biggest risk faced by MADB is credit risk, namely the possibility that a farmer
defaults on the loan agreement. Such a default may be caused by the client’s deliberate
intention not to honor the loan agreement due to political and/or other instigations or simply
by the clients’ inability to repay because of financial encumbrances caused by natural
disasters or volatility of commodity prices, among other factors.

So far, credit risk has been contained by MADB’s ability to exert pressure on
delinquent borrowers through local authorities. Despite MADB’s strong pressure on
borrowers to repay, MADB’s loan portfolio remains heavily at risk. MADB’s loan portfolio is
undiversified and uncollateralized. Loans are homogenous in nature, because they are
concentrated on a few commodities. Even though MADB tries to diversify the loan book by
crop type, there is high possibility of significant volatility in the bank’s loan book due to high
levels of covariant risk, especially in the case of natural disaster. In 2012, 99.9 percent of
MADB’s loans are short-term seasonal crop production without any collateral, only joint
personal guarantees, which in a systemic event—plague, drought, or other weather
event—will not likely be honored by farmers. Only 0.02 percent of the loan portfolio, namely
loans for farm machinery, is partially protected, by at least 40 percent compulsory savings.

MADB has strict rules and grants loans only to farmers with full repayment history.
The MADB requires joint guarantee in a group of 5 to 10 borrowers and farmer registration
book. The newly passed farm law will give farmers certificates of ownership of their farms,
which are transferable and MADB, like all other banks, will be able to take these certificates
as collateral.

MADB also needs to substantially increase its capital and create more reserves to
meet the growing demand and be able to absorb losses whenever they arise. Looking
forward, MADB should also take actions to estimate the probability of default in the different
segments of its loan portfolio. Moreover, MADB could develop insurance products for
farmers, set limits to its exposure to borrowers likely to default, and diversify its lending
portfolio by serving new types of clients and financing a wider range of commodities and
activities in the agriculture sector.

Market risks may arise from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, securities
prices, and unstable commodities prices. These changes affect the bank’s present and
future income. In the case of MADB, the interest rate is the only prominent market risk that
MADB may face at the current level of operation.




                                                                                               26
The MADB so far does not have any exchange rate risk since its business           base on
                                                                            ss is based   n
                                                                                  posi from
local currency. In terms of sources of fund, both retail deposit and wholesale deposit
MEB are denominated in kyat currency. The bank has never borrowed from overseas for its
banking operation, although it is allowed to do so. In term of the use of funds, the MADB B
offers only kyat currency loans to farmers.

MADB does not have a clear legal framework to access liquidity in extraordinary
circumstances. Liquidity risk is defined as the risk caused by the MADB’s inability to meet
its obligations when they come due. This may be because of an inability to convert assets
into cash or to obtain sufficient funds to meet cash needs at appropriate costs within a
limited time frame. Due to a change in funding strategy, the MADB has shifted its funding
from retail deposits to wholesale deposit from MEB. As a result, MADB has less pressure
from retail depositors. However, in the unlikely event that MEB calls back its short-term
wholesale deposit, MADB would face significant difficulty in recalling thousands of small
loans from individual farmers before harvest time. Moreover, MADB cannot automatically
rely on MAI for financial support, nor can MADB go to the CBM as lender of last resort,
because MADB is technically not a supervised bank.

Finally, MADB faces significant operational risks. The bank’s documentation is in
paper-based format, which is prone to loss, fire, termites, humidity, and so forth. The bank
lacks a functioning IT system. These factors may result in unexpected losses to MADB.
Therefore, it is recommended that MADB address this matter in the near term.

1.7 Corporate Governance

In practice, MADB serves as an instrument of MAI to reach a wide range of economic
and social goals. MAI dictates the strategic direction of MADB, determines and adjusts
interest rates at its own discretion, establishes lending programs, sets the annual growth
rates for the bank, and so forth. Under this system, MADB’s managers have, in
practice, limited operational autonomy.

As the owner of MADB, the Government through MAI has the right to control and
provide the strategic direction that the bank should follow. However, a certain degree
of operational autonomy is needed to allow senior management to run the institution in an
efficient manner and ensure its solvency. Managers do not have sufficient operational
autonomy. Managers of MADB have no capability to mitigate the credit exposure of their
institution to risky sectors and borrowers, as they must comply every year with the ambitious
targets set by MAI in terms of volume of credit and number of borrowers receiving credit.

Three managing directors (MDs) of MADB were selected and replaced by the central
Government during the past three years. The MD of MADB is ranked equivalent to a
director general position in the central Government. Dating back to 1996, all MDs were
retired military officials without any banking business exposure. The general manager (GM)
who manages and controls the bank is internally promoted within the bank. The current GM,

                                                                          i MADB      tw y

                                                                                ant general
managers some of whom, now retired, were also retired military officials. They         y are
responsible for the main aspects of the banking business, including bank operations,       s
lending operations, accounting functions, and administrative areas. The middle management
is responsible for the daily work of MADB.

Board

According to MADB’s law section 12 (b), the board of MADB is composed of nine
members, all of them appointed by the Government:

introducing independent members and establishing strict fit and proper criteria for all board

Internal Control System

MADB has set up a simple internal control system. 7KH3UH$XGLW'HSDUWPHQW

divisions, states, districts and townships and then reports all findings to the board of
directors through the bank’s senior management team. There is no audit committee to
oversee the audit function in MADB. This structure results in a weak internal control system.




                                                                                                     28

members. This committee should be independent of the management of the bank          bank and
                                                                                         le
                                                                                         l and
responsible for (1) reviewing the bank’s financial reports to ensure that they are reliable
adhere to generally accepted accounting principles; (2) reviewing the internal control       ol
systems and risk management systems of the bank; (3) overseeing the internal audit
function of the bank, which includes ensuring that the function is adequately staffed, has a
plan of operations, and maintains its independence of management; and (4) reviewing
regulatory compliance, which includes ensuring that the bank complies with all relevant laws
and regulations, including conflicts of interest.

External Audit System

MADB has never been audited by the central bank. MADB, like other state-owned
enterprises, is audited by the Auditor General Office, which is responsible for financial and
compliance audit for all state enterprises. The Auditor General Office does not have to
comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). The Central Bank of Myanmar
(CBM) has never audited the MADB. In order to gain trust from the public and improve
transparency, it is important that the MADB be audited in accordance with the ISA by a quali-
fied external auditor. The external auditor should express his or her opinion on the bank’s
financial situation. It is recommended that MADB adopt the key principles of International
Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and
also be audited under the ISA.

MADB discloses little information to the public. For many years MADB has not
published its annual report. A simple annual report is produced every year and submitted to
the central bank and MAI. MADB does not have a website. Going forward, MADB should
disclose more information to the public. As a state-owned institution, MADB is accountable
to the people, and it is expected that beginning from this fiscal year its audited annual report
will go to the parliament for public scrutiny.

Another major weakness is related to the lack of a monitoring and evaluation framework
to enable the Government, in particular MAI, to assess the performance of MADB and the
social and economic impact of its lending operations. Such a framework is needed to assess
on a periodic basis the performance of MADB and its contribution to the development of
Myanmar’s agriculture sector.

1.8 Operations

MADB’s operational infrastructure is rudimentary. All documents in the MADB system,
including loan documents and customer’s information, such as signature record and identity
card, are paper based and thus in danger to loss or damage (e.g., by fire, termites, and so
forth). The record-keeping system is outdated and inefficient. There is no electronic loan
tracking system. The data processing is fully manual and not able to produce information in real




                                                                                             29
                                                                     t to
time. With the current database system, it is difficult for management    f ll utilize its own
                                                                       t fully
information system for bank operations, internal management purposes, and planning.nning

As a result of its lack of IT infrastructure, the bank has a limited management              nt
information system. All internal reporting has to be performed on simple spreadsheets and
shared between offices by fax and telephone. This comes at the cost of reliability, timeliness,
and accuracy of the data. In term of customers’ reporting, the bank should provide written
documents/invoices to notify customers of their debt burden, including payment deadlines,
outstanding debt, interest, and other charges. However, with the current operational system
it is difficult for MADB to manage customers’ accounts and notify customers of their debt
burden. With the existing system, it is hard for the bank’s management to perform its
business functions and manage risks. It is urgent that the bank upgrade its IT infrastructure.

Since there is no Treasury Department in the MADB headquarters, branches have to
manage their own cash inflows and outflows. Some branches install safe deposit boxes
at the nearby police station. The cash flow of MADB is heavily dependent on MEB’s cash
flow position. So far, adequate communication and coordination between both institutions
has helped to resolve the liquidity needs of MADB’s branches. However, in the long run, as
MADB continues to grow, it should upgrade its cash management policies and practices and
diversify its sources of funding.

1.9 Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory Regime

Even though MADB is established as a development bank, it is not licensed as a
full-fledged commercial bank under the financial institutions law and operates under
its own law. MADB was transferred from the Ministry of Finance to the MAI in 1996. As a
result, MADB is not regulated and supervised by the central bank as are the other
state-owned or private commercial banks, although the addendum to its law stipulates that
it must submit to inspections by the central bank. Moreover, the prudential standards—on
capital, reserve ratios, loan classification and provisioning, accounting rules, liquidity, risk
management, and so forth— applicable to other commercial banks or financial institutions
are not strictly applied to MADB. MAI and the Auditor General’s Office are responsible for
supervising the operations of MADB. In practice, however, both institutions lack the
technical capability to assess the financial risks and potential vulnerabilities faced by MADB
in a comprehensive manner.

1.10 Accounting and Financial Reporting

MADB is not in compliance with the International Accounting Standards. MADB, like
other banks, follows bank practice and the double entry bookkeeping system and closes its
books daily. However, its financial statements do not indicate which accounting standards
were used for their preparation. It is clear that the MADB’s financial statements do not strictly
comply with the IAS. Even though compliance with the IAS is voluntary, many countries encourage their

In their current form and contents, the financial statements of MADB do not provide    de
sufficient information to management, owners, or analysts. It is hard to identify the risk
areas in the bank business. As a result, the existing financial statements of MADB are of
limited value from both a management and financial perspective. It is recommended that
MADB adopt key principles of the IAS practices, especially for revenue recognition,
borrowing cost calculation, assets’ impairment, and provisioning.

Similarly, the current annual financial report of MADB provides marginal information
on capital fund, loan portfolio, income, expenditures, prudential ratios, and observance
of anti-money laundering requirements. In terms of financial data, the report provides
itemized figures of MADB balance sheet account, income statement, and cash flow
statement. The audited accounts of the MADB do not contain the level of detail that would
be required to meet the IFRS.

Human Resources

As of April, 2013, there were 2,688 staff members working in MADB Bank, comprising
254 officers and 2,434 administrative staff members. The officers hold a bachelor degree.
The administrative staff must have a high school degree as minimum requirement but most
of them are bachelor degree holders. On average, an officer and 10 administrative staff run
a branch.

MADB needs to put in place a comprehensive human resources framework to be able
to attract, retain, motivate, train, and develop their staff. Currently, MADB follows the HR
policies established by the central Government in terms of staff recruitment, compensation,
and promotion. Going forward, MADB will require more autonomy to develop its own HR
policies that are commensurate to its business needs.

MADB faces huge challenges and opportunities. As discussed in the previous section,
MADB is facing enormous challenges, and a serious effort is required to ensure that the
institution is able to fulfill its development role on a sustainable basis. At the same time, there
are enormous opportunities in the agriculture sector, because the demand for credit is huge.
Loans are required not only by existing MADB clients, which would prefer MADB to finance
a larger percentage of their production costs, but also by the other 3.5 million smallholder
farmers who so far have not received financing from MADB due to the lack of ownership
certificates.

Myanmar ’s agricultural potential is enormous given the country’s resource
endowments and favorable geographic location. As water availability becomes scarce in
various part of the world, and particularly in neighboring China and India, Myanmar’s water
resources offer a significant agricultural competitive advantage. In addition, the country’s
diverse topography and eco-systems enable farmers to produce a wide range of cereals,
pulses, horticulture, fruits, livestock, and fish. Given its strategic location between
two enormous regional markets—India and China—and easy access to buoyant markets in
ASEAN, Myanmar’s agriculture sector is well positioned to grow.




                                                                                                                            32
Moreover, loans and financial services are required by practically all other pa       partici-
pants along the entire value chain: seed producers, fertilize companies, processingsing firms,
transportation and equipment, traders, exporters, retailers, and so forth. Furthermore,e, the
                                                                                            n
demand for credit in other subsectors, such as forestry, fishing, and livestock, is unmet. In
terms of infrastructure, the need to finance new roads, warehouses, silos, markets,
laboratories, dams, power plants, and so forth will exist for many years.

But MADB also faces various threats. Managing the inherent risks of agriculture—namely
weather, pests, and volatility of prices—may prove difficult in the absence of a domestic
financial system able to provide participants with risk mitigation tools. MADB’s overall risk
portfolio remains at risk. Moreover, problems with electricity supply and the lack of modern
payment and settlement systems in Myanmar may limit MADB’s ability to modernize its
banking functions.

Farmers are used to subsidized credit from MADB and might find it difficult to accept
a market rate system in the future. Nonetheless a market interest rate system is absolutely
needed to achieve sustainability of MADB. Instead of a single interest rate, MADB could
adopt multiple interest rates for its lending operations to better reflect the different risk
profiles of borrowers, the commodities being financed, the sectoral risks, the proposed used
of the loan, and the overall profitability of the investment project.




                                                                                           33
2.Options for the Transformation
of MADB
2.1 Strengthening MADB in the Short Term

Building a successful state-owned agriculture bank is not an easy task. First, the agriculture
activities entail various risks such as weather, plagues, and price volatility, among others.
Second, around the world, there have been plenty of state-owned agriculture banks unable
to fulfill their policy mandates. Many agriculture banks have become vulnerable to undue
political interference in their lending decisions, causing them to generate enormous
numbers of nonperforming loans. Moreover, many banks have been simply captured by
their own clientele demanding subsidized loans or debt forgiveness. In various cases,
state-owned agriculture banks are unable to survive without the financial support of the
Government (World Bank 2013).

MADB should avoid following that path. Instead, it is important that authorities transform
MADB into a stronger institution, following the sound practices adopted by successful agriculture
banks that are well administered, able to withstand undue political interference, financially
strong and self-sustainable, and able to fulfill their development mandate. To achieve that,
several actions are recommended.

 0$'%QHHGVWREHILQDQFLDOO\VXVWDLQDEOHDEOHWRJHQHUDWHDQGDFFXPXODWHHQRXJK
           profits to finance its business operations without any government assistance. To achieve
           that, MADB must be given the power to set and modify as necessary the interest
           rates on its deposit and lending products. Moreover, MADB’s very small capital base
           of K 1 billion must be substantially raised to at least K 30 billion and it must be allowed
           to retain a major part of its profits to fund its own modernization and expansion.

      MADB needs to be able to operate in the agriculture sector without crowding out
       other financial intermediaries. In particular, MADB should not prevent other banks
       and microfinance institutions from serving its market. MADB lending products such
       as heavily subsidized interest rates should not make it impossible for any private
       institution to compete with it. MADB should encourage and facilitate the participation
       of other formal intermediaries.

      MADB should operate with the highest standards of transparency, integrity and
       accountability and be regulated and supervised with the same standards applicable
       to the rest of the banking system.

      MADB must establish a strong risk management function able to identify, quantify,
       monitor, and recommend actions to mitigate risks.

      MADB must invest in the modernization of its IT platform and operations.

      MADB must invest significant resources in staff development and training.

years.

Given the existing fiscal limitations in Myanmar, authorities will probably need to consider er
new sources of funds that are compatible with the Government’s objectives in the agriculture
sector.

2.2 Issues to Consider for MADB’s Long-Term Transformation

In the long term, authorities will have to assess and decide on what type of institution
MADB should be. Should MADB play a more active role in the much-needed modernization
of the agriculture sector of Myanmar? Should MADB remain as a bank only for smallholder
farmers, or should it broaden its business activities to support other participants in the
agriculture sector? Should MADB be just a financial institution or should it become a
development agency with broader tools (e.g., advisory services) to support the agriculture
sector?

A broad spectrum of issues needs to be carefully considered by authorities. Providing
detailed proposals for the long-term restructuring of MADB is not the goal of this report. That
can happen only through a process of extensive consultations among authorities and other
stakeholders. Nonetheless, to lay the ground for future discussions and consultations, this
report outlines several questions and issues that need to be carefully analyzed by policy
makers and other stakeholders in Myanmar, including the following:

Agriculture Financing Needs
      To achieve the Government’s objectives in the agriculture sector, what are the total
       investments needed in the next five years (e.g., in dams, irrigation infrastructure,
       energy plants, warehouses, new roads, silos, ports, wholesale markets, sanitation
       centers, laboratories, agriculture research institutes, and so forth)? Where are the
       required investments expected to come from and who will finance them (e.g., private
       sector, government, international finance institutions, MADB, or others)?

      Given the fiscal constraints faced by the Government, how many resources can the
       Government devote from the budget for the modernization of the agriculture sector in
       the upcoming years? How many resources will be specifically devoted to carry out
       new investments?

      What is the total number of farmers in Myanmar and what percentage of them are
       subsistence farmers, smallholder farmers but with commercially viable activities,
       medium sized firms, and large farmers?

      How many farmers in each of the previous categories do not have access to finance
       from licensed financial institutions (including savings, deposits, loans, guarantees,
       insurance, and other financial products)?




                                                                                            36
     What is the total number of formal and informal SMEs operating in the agric ure
                                                                          e agriculture
      sector that require access to finance?

     Are there specialized institutions already serving the agriculture market (leasing,
      factoring, insurance companies)?

     Will the agriculture finance market be open to new domestic and foreign investors?

Business Environment
     Are there any restrictions in laws that prevent other private financial institutions in
      Myanmar from serving smallholder farmers (e.g., interest rates floors and caps,
      administrative barriers to serve agriculture firms, licenses, and so forth)?

     Are there any administrative barriers that prevent MADB from serving new segments
      of the market, such as medium-sized SMEs, processors, traders, retail companies,
      and so on?

     Are creditors’ rights properly addressed in the existing legal framework? Is there a
      proper bankruptcy law with an agile judicial system?

     Are there any land ownership issues that prevent expansion of rural finance in Myanmar
      (e.g., execution of collateral, availability of land titles, cost and speed to transfer land
     ownership, and so forth)?

     Is there a credit bureau in Myanmar with sufficient and reliable information about
     farmers?

     Can movable assets (agricultural equipment, grains, livestock, fertilizers, and so
     forth) be pledged as collateral in Myanmar?

Mandate of MADB
     Should MADB remain focused only on smallholder farmers or should it broaden its
      business operations to cover the rest of the market in the agriculture sector? Which
      new market segments should be covered by MADB? Who will cover the other
      remaining segments of the market?
    
      What are the specific value chains in the agriculture sector that the Government is
      planning to actively support in the future?

     Is it appropriate to prevent MADB from financing agriculture-related activities such as
      livestock, fisheries, or forestry?

     Is it appropriate to prevent MADB from providing export finance? Is this the role of
      another state-owned institution?

     Is there
         th      potential for merger between MADB and other state-owned financial
      institutio
      institutions with similar mandates?

                                                                                               37
Business Model

     Should MADB be allowed to raise deposits as in the past? If so, should  d the
      Government guarantee deposits at MADB? If so, what should be the limit?

     Other than deposits, what other sources of funding should MADB have?

     Does MADB need long-term sources of funding to provide long-term credit? Should
      MADB be allowed to issue bonds or get credit from other domestic (and international
      banks)?

     How should MADB lend in the future (e.g., retail lending, wholesale lending, or a
      combination of both approaches)?

     Should MADB be allowed to lend only to households and private sector firms? Or,
      should it also be allowed to lend to other state-owned enterprises and government
      agencies? If so, what is the maximum percentage of its loan portfolio that could be
      allowed for lending to state-owned enterprises and government?

     What other financial services should MADB offer to its clients: payments, treasury,
      cash management, insurance, leasing, factoring, trade finance, export finance, loan
      guarantees, and fiduciary services, among others?

     Are extension services needed to enhance the projects financed by MADB? If so,
      who could offer them?

     Should MADB offer extension services to its clients?

     Is the number of existing MADB branches sufficient to accomplish its new mandate?
      Would more branches be needed? If so, where?

     What are the insurance products currently available for farmers? Who offers them?
      What is the coverage? What types of risks are covered? Is this a market for MADB?

Other
     Once MADB starts to adopt IAS, what is the expected impact on its capital?

     What is the amount of new capital needed by MADB, including the resources
      to increase the loan portfolio and fund new investments in the modernization
      of the bank (IT, operations, staff training, and so forth)? Where is the new
      capital going to come from (government, international financial institutions,
      donors, private sector, or others)?

     Would partial privatization of MADB be desirable in order to increase the
      capital of the institution?

     Would the temporary use of experienced international managers working
      under performance contracts and accountable to the Government of Myanmar
      be an option for the transformation of MADB?

     Should MADB be rated annually by an internationally recognized agency?

                                                                                      38
3. Lessons from
International Experience
Most of the challenges faced by policy makers in Myanmar have also been faced by
other policy makers around the world at different times. In fact, the World Bank has
assisted countries in various regions of the world to reform their state-owned financial
institutions. There is an array of valuable international experience from countries in Central
and Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia that have undertaken the task of reforming
and strengthening their large state-owned agriculture banks with success.

MADB should benefit from existing international experience and draw useful lessons
from other countries. This section presents three successful cases of reform of large
agriculture banks owned by the state, which could be useful references for Myanmar:

The reform patterns are not uniform and certainly these institutions could still find
areas for improvement and do better. Nonetheless, given the initial circumstances and
problems that the banks faced, the reform outcomes are positive and have contributed to
turning insolvent institutions into profitable banks with the capability to serve the agriculture sector on a
sustainable basis and contribute to improving the living standards of farmers and raising the
competitiveness of their agricultural subsectors.

3.1 Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives

BAAC was established in 1966 by the Thai Government. BAAC’s original policy mandate
was to provide agricultural credit to farm households. During almost four decades, BAAC
has gone through a process of transformation from being a specialized agricultural lending
institution to becoming a diversified rural bank. There were four major phases of reform:

BAAC has achieved impressive results in terms of outreach and institutional viability.
In 2013, BAAC served a total of 7.27 million farm households or 95 percent of total farm
households in Thailand. BAAC has now a total of 19,922 officers and staff in 77 provincial
offices and 1,118 branches throughout Thailand. BAAC’s reform has been guided by two,
sometimes conflicting, objectives: outreach to all farm households as its political mandate
and financial viability in the bank’s own interest. Important elements in the reform process
have been the following:

total loan portfolio, with the rest coming from wholesale credit to farmer institutions,
consisting of agricultural cooperatives and farmer associations.

In addition, BAAC provides personal accident insurance, health insurance, funeral
aid, and services to help Thai Muslims undertake their Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.
BAAC now goes beyond savings and loans to reach sustainable development. A concept of
credit plus technical assistance has been implemented by BAAC to promote value addition
activities with knowledge dissemination.

As of February 2013, BAAC had recorded total assets of 1.18 trillion baht or US$39
billion with loans outstanding of 949 billion baht or US$31 billion. The growth of BAAC
assets is due mainly to growth of lending as a result of greater improvement of access to

and forced savings from commercial banks as sources of funds. Later, BAAC started

3.2 Bank Rakyat Indonesia

BRI used to operate with enormous subsidies from the Government of Indonesia.          nesia.
Until 1983, interest rates in Indonesia were regulated, the financial sector was dominated by
state banks, and BRI was the main provider of agricultural credit through a network of sub-
district units, heavily subsidized. When oil prices dropped and GDP fell, the Government
offered the bank two options: close or reform. In 1983, interest rates were fully deregulated,
and BRI was placed under new management, which decided to commercialize the 3,600
rural outlets of hitherto subsidized credit into self-sustaining profit centers.

New products were introduced. With technical assistance from the Harvard Institute for
International Development, the bank crafted two new commercial products. One was a scheme
of voluntary savings that could be withdrawn at any time with a lottery component,
SIMPEDES, which proved to be immensely attractive and at the same time served as an
instrument of resource mobilization at the village level. The other one was a nontargeted
credit scheme, KUPEDES, open to all and for any purpose, the only credit product offered
by the units. Its features included simple procedures, short maturities, regular monthly
installments (mainly from nonagricultural income), flexible collateral requirements and
collateral-free microloans, incentives for timely repayment, repeat loans contingent
upon successful repayment of previous loans, and market rates of interest amounting to 2
percent flat per month (equal to an effective rate of 44% per year - 11% for timely repayment
= 33% p.a.) to cover all costs and risks.

BRI has a large outreach and strong financial performance. As of December 2012, BRI
served 42 million customers through 9,052 outlets that are connected in real time and
59,241 e-channel networks (ATMs, kiosks, and so forth). In 2012, the bank reported a
capital adequacy ratio of almost 17 percent and return on assets of 38 percent. For more
than six years, BRI has successfully maintained its position as the bank with the biggest
profit and holds second position in terms of assets within the nation’s banking
industry (Bank Rakyat 2012).

There are various factors that have contributed to the success of BRI  including the
following:
      In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, the Government of Indonesia gave BRI
       sufficient autonomy to restructure itself.

      In 2003, BRI went public and has continued its commitment toward the MSME. The
       Government of the Republic of Indonesia is the majority shareholder of BRI with a
       56.75 percent share, while the general public holds the remaining 43.25 percent.

      The bank also made major investments in corporate governance, adopting high
       standards for board and management selection and performance and raising its
       standards on information disclosure, internal controls, and accountability.

      Huge investments in information systems and risk management have enabled the
       bank to get real-time information from all branches and outlets and thus properly
       identify and mitigate risks.

      A wide range of financial products tailored to its clients’ needs was introduced.

      Major investments were made in staff development and training, as well as competi-
       tive remuneration.

3.3 Financiera Rural of Mexico

A new agriculture bank was created in 2002. At the end of 2002, Mexico decided to close
and liquidate the old agriculture bank Banrural due to its huge number of nonperforming
loans (40 percent), growing losses, capture by its own clientele, and failed attempts to
recapitalize and turn around the institution (Meade 2002). To replace Banrural, the
Government established a new agriculture bank called Financiera Rural with the technical
assistance and financial support of the World Bank. This new institution was established
with a completely different set of features in the world of agriculture finance, including the
following:
      The bank’s board and management were required by law to preserve the capital of
       the new bank. Thus, board members and senior managers had to reprice all lending

      products to achieve profitability, discontinue nonprofitable activities, and fully adopt
       commercial principles for the bank’s operations.

      The bank was banned from taking deposits and borrowing from other financial institu-
       tions. As a result, all lending had to be funded by the bank’s own capital.

      Law prevented the Government from ever capitalizing the bank again. In the event of
       failure, no fiscal resources would be used to bail out the bank.

      The mandate of the institution was revised to focus it only on the rural sector and
       agriculture activities.

      The institution was placed under the regulation and supervision of the Banking and
       Securities Commission with no exception to rules and regulations given its status as
       state-owned financial institution.

                                                                                            42
                                                                       ensur the
In addition, the senior management of FR undertook various measures to ensure  e
success of the bank, such as the following:

      Recruitment of experienced managers from the private sector

      Major investments in risk management, enabling the institution to quantify risks by
       subsector, activity, region, size of firm, ownership structure, and so on and price
       lending products according to the risk profile of individual clients

      Adoption of conservative appraisal criteria for collateral and maximum loan to value
       ratios of 80 percent

      Strict loan exposure limits by client, sector, region, and commodities

      Prohibition to lend to other state-owned enterprises or local governments—only
       private sector SMEs and individual farmers can be served by FR

      Use of innovative financial instruments to reach out to customers in rural areas

      Mandatory use of insurance products for borrowers, whenever available

      Huge investments in market intelligence, including production costs per commodity,
       price fluctuations, yields per hectare, consumer demand, and so forth

Since its establishment 11 years ago, FR has remained a profitable institution with a
growing ability to serve the market and crowd in other private financial sector
intermediaries. The institution operates as a retail financial institution as well as a whole
lender to microfinance institutions. As of December 2013, FR had a lending portfolio of
US$1.3 billion and a nonperforming loan ratio of 4 percent. It served more than 200,000
farmers in practically all agriculture value chains and supported through its wholesale
lending operations more than 300 private sector nonbank financial intermediaries.

Even though there are differences among the business models adopted by the three
institutions, there are also common some similarities in their restructuring efforts.
A first common element is that all three institutions maintain autonomy from government. At
different times, they have been able to withstand political pressure and even say no to
government. BRI even became a partially privatized institution. A second element is that
they all adopted strong corporate governance practices based on high standards on
information disclosure and accountability of board and management. BRI and FR made use
of private sector managers to turn around the institutions. Finally, a third important element
in the success of these institutions has been the emphasis on risk management. All three
institutions invested heavily in IT infrastructure to be able to capture, measure risks, and
calibrate their interest rates in accordance to the risk profile of borrowers. Thus, a combination
of managerial autonomy, professionalized management, sound disclosure practices, and
strong risk management capability have been key ingredients in the success of these three
agriculture banks. These ingredients should be present in MADB’s transformation plans.




                                                                                               43
4. Conclusions
The modernization of the agriculture sector is a critical element for poverty alleviation      on
and shared prosperity in Myanmar. It is estimated that the agriculture sector represents
between 35 to 40 percent of GDP and that up to 70 percent of the labor force (of 32.5 million)
is directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture activities or depend significantly on agriculture
for their income. Moreover, it is estimated that agriculture products generate between 25 to
30 percent of total export earnings.

Among the government institutions supporting the agriculture sector, the Myanma
Agriculture Development Bank plays a key role. MADB is the largest provider of credit to
rural households engaged in agricultural activities. However, MADB needs to be deeply
restructured. The way in which it currently operates is no longer sustainable; it poses a
growing fiscal burden due to its access to subsidized funding and the practice of granting
loans at subsidized interest rates. Its subsidized loans distort the market by discouraging
private formal lenders from entering into the rural credit markets.

The agriculture sector remains largely underserved by MADB. MADB is excessively
concentrated on the financing of rice farmers, leaving the financing of other crops and
products with a high added value outside its business scope. Moreover, MADB is not financing
other participants in the value chain, such as food processors, traders, retail companies,
seed companies, and so forth. Firms in related activities, such as forestry, fish, and
livestock, are not targeted by MADB.

Several weaknesses of MADB have been identified in the report in the areas of funding,
pricing of lending products, risk management, corporate governance, operations, IT
infrastructure, regulation and supervision, and HR. Addressing those weaknesses should
become a priority for authorities of Myanmar.

Looking forward, MADB is expected to play an important role in the much needed
modernization of the agriculture sector of Myanmar. Following successful international
examples, MADB could be transformed from a simple loan disbursement agency into a
full-fledged bank able to provide a wide range of financial services to the rural population on
a financially sustainable basis without crowding out other financial intermediaries.

However, building a successful state-owned agriculture bank is not an easy task.
Historically, several agriculture banks around the world have failed due to poor corporate
governance, inadequate risk management capability, unsustainable business models,
capture by their own clientele, or undue political interference in their lending decisions.
Therefore, authorities should ensure that MADB is transformed into a sound,
well-administered, and financially sustainable institution, able to withstand undue political
interference and able to operate with the highest standards of corporate governance and
transparency.
