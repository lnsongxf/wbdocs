Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a
          longer-term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over
          the period, the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social
          welfare. Second, the IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and
          policy issues, and analysis of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is
          intended for a wide audience, including policy makers, business leaders, financial market
          participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s
          evolving economy.
          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office and receives editorial and strategic
          guidance from an editorial board chaired by Rodrigo Chaves, Country Director for
          Indonesia. The report is compiled by the Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global
          Practice team, under the guidance of Ndiame Diop, Practice Manager, and Hans Anand
          Beck, Senior Economist. Led by Masyita Crystallin, with responsibility for Part A, and Kelly
          Wyett, with responsibility for editing and production, the core project team comprises
          Magda Adriani, Arsianti, Indira Maulani Hapsari, Ahya Ihsan, Taufik Indrakesuma, Dhruv
          Sharma, and Violeta Vulovic. Administrative support is provided by Titi Ananto.
          Dissemination is organized by Jerry Kurniawan, GB Surya Ningnagara, Kurniasih Suditomo,
          Nugroho Sunjoyo, and Suryo Utomo Tomi, under the guidance of Dini Djalal.

  Executive summary: Pressures easing




Indonesia’s economy   Global growth was sluggish in the first half of the year, driven by weaker than
remains resilient     expected growth in advanced economies. In addition, China’s growth eased as
despite weaker than   expected as the economy continues to rebalance from investment- to consumption-
expected global       led growth, and as excess industrial capacity is reduced. However, import demand
growth                from China was weaker than expected. On the upside, the global financial market
                      volatility leading up to and in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June has
                      moderated significantly. Lower volatility in financial markets has contributed to the
                      Rupiah’s stabilization against the US Dollar (in line with most other emerging
                      market currencies). Indonesia’s growth remained resilient in Q2, partly supported by
                      government expenditure, and is forecast to pick-up gradually on the back of
                      stronger private investment supported by investment climate reforms and credible
                      fiscal policy. This resilience stands in contrast to the performance of several other
                      emerging market commodity exporters.

Fiscal risks have     Domestic fiscal risks have eased recently given announced expenditure adjustments
eased; downside       for 2016 and a more achievable 2017 draft Budget. Recent efforts by the
risks to growth are   Government contributed to strong revenue collection from the tax amnesty
mostly external       program by the end of phase 1 (of IDR 93.4 Trillion, 56.6 percent of target) and also
                      helped moderate fiscal risks. This revenue is projected to raise public capital
                      spending and hence have a positive impact on growth. On the other hand, external
                      downside risks remain. These risks stem from the possibility of continued
                      disappointing growth in major economies, the impact of a faster than expected
                      slowdown in China’s growth, and heightened US monetary policy uncertainty and
                      the potential for consequential financial market disruption.

GDP growth picked       GDP growth accelerated to 5.2 percent year-on-year (yoy) in Q2 from 4.9 percent
up to 5.2 percent yoy   yoy in Q1, due to strong government consumption. Private consumption remained
in Q2 supported by      resilient while government consumption accelerated, growing at 6.3 percent from
government              2.9 percent in Q1. Fixed investment grew at 5.1 percent yoy in Q2, from 5.6 percent
consumption             in Q1, supported mainly by public investment, implying subdued private
                        investment. Despite government spending cuts announced in August of IDR 134
                        trillion, public capital expenditure from January to August was 19.3 percent higher
                        than its level over the same period last year. Net exports did not contribute to
                        growth in Q2, as both exports and imports continued to contract yoy.

Benign inflation        A lack of inflationary pressure has provided room for Bank Indonesia (BI) to cut its
provided room for       policy rate six times this year. In September, headline inflation continued its
monetary policy         downward trajectory, measuring 3.1 percent yoy, while core inflation was 3.2 yoy.
easing                  The decline in inflation was partly due to more stable food prices, particularly for
                        rice, and lower transportation costs attributable to the Government’s fuel price
                        reductions earlier in the year. BI moved to a new policy rate, the 7-day reverse repo,
                        in August in an effort to improve the transmission mechanism between the policy
                        rate and bank rates. However, the impact of this change on interbank credit lines
                        and the uneven distribution of liquidity in the banking system has so far been
                        limited.

The overall balance     The overall balance of payments recorded a USD 2.2 billion surplus on the back of
of payments             strong capital flows and a narrowing current account deficit. The current account
recorded a moderate     deficit narrowed marginally to 2.0 percent of GDP, driven by an improvement in
surplus                 the trade balance. Exports increased quarter-on-quarter (qoq) for the first time since
                        Q2 2015. This growth was driven by manufacturing exports, which were the only
                        export category to also increase over the year. Imports also increased in Q2 but are
                        still down over the year. Both raw material and capital goods imports, leading
                        indicators for private investment, are showing signs of a small pick-up. The financial
                        account expanded due to strong public sector borrowing. External financing needs
                        remain stable, although foreign ownership of government debt is increasing as a
                        share of the total.

The Rupiah has          Relatively stable global financial markets and a BOP surplus helped stabilize the
stabilized              Rupiah, which regained some of the ground lost in Q2, and has since appreciated.
                        Most other emerging market currencies have not performed as well. Domestic
                        financial assets also performed relatively strongly compared with regional peers in
                        Q3. The downward trajectory in credit growth in Indonesia has also stabilized partly
                        due to BI’s monetary easing.

A sharp pick-up in      The Government’s tax amnesty program saw a sharp pick-up in revenue collection
tax amnesty             just prior to the end of the first phase of the program. Tax collections under the
proceeds helped         program reached IDR 93.4 trillion, 56.6 percent of the target, by the end of phase 1

                         side, the Government expects that the planned revisions to the general tax law,

                         duty law, as well as further increases in excise tax, will increase tax revenue and help
                         achieve the 2017 revenue target. On the expenditure side, changes in the allocation
                         of spending include: better targeting of electricity subsidies and the rice for

                         driver of this reduction was a reallocation of total national consumption from the

                       system which is more RICE: (i) Reliable, (ii) Inclusive, (iii) Competitive; and (iv)

outcomes                 Recognizing this, the Government implemented a teacher certification program
                         designed to improve teachers’ qualifications and motivation to perform, and
                         increase the desirability of teaching as a profession. The program provides certified
                         teachers with a generous professional allowance, which effectively doubles their
                         salary. Certification requirements include a university bachelor’s degree and a
                         portfolio of other training and experience. Importantly, requirements to
                         demonstrate competency were dropped during the design phase. Potentially as a
                         result, a recent evaluation found that the certification program had no impact on
                         student test scores, even though many teachers were incentivized to upgrade their
                         qualifications. Looking ahead, the hope is that the certification program has helped
                         to lay the groundwork for further essential reforms in the sector. In particular, the
                         certification program should shift to a system of teacher management and
                         continuous professional development. Such a system would prioritize demonstrated
                         professional competencies over education level and seniority. Without such
                         improvements, the huge fiscal cost of the program would turn out to be “double for
                         nothing”.

                        Rupiah stabilized against the US dollar (in line with most other emerging market
                        currencies). Reflecting a pick-up in global comodity prices, the prices of Indoneisa’s
                        six major commodity exports continued to grow in Q3 relative to Q2 (with the
                        exception of crude oil which declined slightly). In year to date terms, the prices of all
                        six commodities have risen strongly.
                  2. GDP growth picked up on the back of stronger government consumption
GDP growth picked       Real GDP growth picked up to 5.2 percent year-on-year (yoy) in Q2 from 4.9 percent
up to 5.2 percent       yoy in Q1, due to strong government consumption. Total consumption growth
yoy…                    remained robust in Q2, growing at 5.2 percent yoy. Despite government spending
                        cuts of IDR 134 trillion announced in August, government investment accelerated;
                        by the end of August, public capital expenditure was 19.3 percent higher than its level
                        over the same period last year. Despite Bank Indonesia (BI) cutting its policy rate five
                        times since the beginning of this year, the impact on credit growth has been limited.
                        The World Bank’s forecasts for Indonesia’s GDP growth remain at 5.1 and 5.3
                        percent in 2016 and 2017 respectively. However, the outlook is subject to increased
                        external risks, and will depend on the ongoing resilience of private consumption and
                        a pick-up in private investment.

... driven mainly by    Private consumption expenditure was stable in Q2, supported by lower inflation on

consumption…            seasonal impact of Ramadhan. It grew by 5.1 percent yoy in Q2, slightly above the
                        5.0 percent yoy growth recorded in the three previous quarters. Government
                        consumption, however, was the main driver of the growth pick-up in Q2, growing at
                        6.3 percent yoy, up from 2.9 percent yoy in the first quarter (Figure 2). Government
                        consumption’s contribution to yoy GDP growth was 0.5 percentage points in Q2
                        compared to a contribution of 0.2 percentage points in the previous quarter.

…while private      Total fixed investment spending growth was 5.1 percent yoy, down from 5.6
investment remained percent in the last quarter, and contributed 1.6 percentage points to yoy growth. In
subdued             contrast, public investment spending (deflated by the total investment deflator) grew
                    by 45.7 percent yoy in Q2, indicating continuing improvement in expenditure
                    disbursement. However, given Indonesia’s relatively small fiscal multiplier (see Box
                    1), the positive impact of this investment is likely to be small and temporary.
                    Therefore, it is essential that increased public capital expenditure is accompanied by
                    improvements in public investment management. Not only to improve the short-
                    run impact of such investment on growth, but more importantly, to improve
                    productivity in the long-run.

Export and import       Net exports did not contribute to growth in Q2, as both exports and imports
growth seems to         continued to contract yoy. However, the pace of contraction is slower than in Q1
have bottomed out,      this year. Real exports contracted 2.7 percent yoy in Q2 compared with 3.5 percent
but the contribution    yoy in the first quarter. Similarly, real imports contracted by 3.1 percent yoy in Q2
of net exports to       compared with -5.1 percent in Q1.

The World Bank’s            The World Bank’s projection for GDP growth remains at 5.1 percent for 2016 and

unchanged since the         revised Budget and initially increased the fiscal deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP,
June 2016 IEQ at 5.1        converging to the June 2016 IEQ estimates of IDR 236 in expenditure cuts and an
percent for 2016…           IDR 316 revenue shortfall. Private consumption is expected to remain resilient in line
                            with benign inflation, a relatively stable Rupiah, and local election activities due to
                            start in Q4. However, the effect of recent monetary easing has remained muted. Given
                            a likely high base effect from high government investment growth this year the
                            outlook for Q4 2016 and beyond will depend on a pick-up in private investment.

…subject to                The baseline growth scenario is subject to significant downside risks stemming from
significant downside       both domestic and external factors. Major external risks include slower than expected
risks                      growth in major advanced economies, and the uncertainty around the timing of a US
                           interest rate hike which could divert capital flows from emerging economies and
                           possibly increase global financial market volatility. This risks will mainly affect 2017
                           growth given that there is only one quarter left in 2016. Domestic risk factors include
                           a lower than expected recovery in private investment, and a higher than expected
                           revenue shortfall, which could in turn negatively impact the Government’s
                           infrastructure plans. On the other hand, as identified in the June IEQ, the upside risk
                           to government revenue from the tax amnesty program has partly materialized. Tax
                           amnesty revenues reached IDR 93.4 trillion (56.6 percent of the target) by the end of
                           phase 1 (see Box 2). Additional revenue from the tax amnesty program that translates
                           into government spending supportive of growth remains an upside risk to 2017
                           growth.

Box 1: What happens when the Government boosts public investment in Indonesia?
Within the context of subdued global demand, the Indonesian Government has boosted public investment
with a view to supporting demand in the short-run and increasing supply side capacity in the long-run by
focusing on infrastructure spending specifically. Such a decision is currently considered particularly attractive
by many governments because of low borrowing costs and benign inflationary pressures.

A review of the relevant empirical literature suggests that in emerging and developing economies fiscal
multipliers (the impact of increased public spending on growth) are much smaller than in advanced
economies, mainly due to public investment inefficiencies, relatively immature financial markets and a lower
ability to sustain higher levels of public debt due to a lack of fiscal credibility. These studies generally show
that boosting public investment generates a small positive multiplier in emerging and developing economies.

The World Bank has analyzed the size and timing of the economic impact of public investment spending
using a similar empirical approach to that outlined in Blanchard and Perotti (2002), Ilzetzki et al (2009) and
Tang et al (2010). The approaches uses a vector auto regression (VAR) framework and the following
variables: CAPEX as proxy for public investment, real private investment, real government consumption
expenditure, the policy interest rate, and real GDP.

The analysis found that a one percent increase in public investment increases economic growth by
approximately 0.2 percent (similar to the results in Tang et al (2010)) and that this impact tends to dissipate
after four quarters.

                   3. Inflationary pressures are lower due to stable food prices and declining
                     transportation costs
Both headline and            In September, headline inflation continued its downward trajectory, measuring 3.1
core inflation               percent yoy, while core inflation was 3.2 yoy (Figure 4). The decline in inflation was
continued to decline         partly due to more stable food prices, particularly for rice, and lower transportation
on the back of               costs attributable to the Government’s fuel price reductions earlier in the year. The
moderating food              moderation in rice price inflation was partly due to Government food price
prices                       management. These efforts included managing Bulog’s rice stock, timely rice
                             imports, and direct distribution of rice to the market.

Domestic rice price           While domestic rice price growth has moderated recently, they remain higher than
stabilization efforts         international prices. In September, the average domestic wholesale (IR64-I) rice
have been effective           price was IDR 10,010 per kg, while the comparable Thai (5 percent broken) rice
                              price was IDR 5,495 per kg. The gap between the domestic and international
                              wholesale rice prices remained high, hovering around 80 percent in September,
                              from 57 percent in May. Looking ahead, the Indonesian Weather and Meteorology

                   4. The current account deficit narrowed slightly in Q2 2016
Strong public                 An increase in portfolio investment resulted in a moderate balance of payments
portfolio inflows             surplus in Q2, following a small deficit in the previous quarter (Figure 6). The current
drove a moderate              account deficit narrowed marginally to 2.0 percent of GDP, driven by an
BOP surplus                   improvement in the trade balance. The financial account expanded due to strong
                              public sector borrowing. External financing needs remain moderate, although foreign
                              ownership of government debt is increasing as a share of the total.

The current account           The current account deficit improved slightly to 2.0 percent of GDP, from 2.1
deficit narrowed              percent in the previous quarter. The trade surplus expanded to USD 1.7 billion in
marginally to 2.0             Q2 as exports increased by 7.2 percent—the first qoq increase since Q2 2015. This
percent of GDP in             growth was driven by manufacturing exports, which were the only export category
Q2 2016 and the               to also increase over the year (Figure 7). For the most part, commodity exports
trade surplus                 moved in line with their prices—down over the year but up in the quarter. Imports
increased                     also increased in Q2, but fell by 7.8 per cent over the year, driven by volatile fuel
                              imports. Raw material and capital goods imports similarly increased in the quarter
                              but were down over the year.

                         expected to remain strong in H2 as international investors search for yield in a low

                         taper off in H2 given the already high levels of government borrowing in H1.

                         conditions showed some initial signs of easing but this was not sustained despite
                         Bank Indonesia (BI) moving to a new, lower policy rate and retaining its easing bias.

                      over the course of this year. The recent pick-up in credit appear to have been short-

                    6. Policy responded to weak revenue collection
The Government                Revenue collection picked up significantly in Q3, due to the implementation of the
introduced further            first three months of the tax amnesty program. Tax collection under the program
measures in                   alone reached IDR 93.4 trillion, 56.6 percent of the target, by the end of phase 1 on
response to weak              30 September4 (see Box 2). Nevertheless, the Government announced an expected
revenue collection            overall revenue shortfall of IDR 219 trillion in 2016. At the same time, the
early in the year             Government announced further expenditure cuts of IDR 134 trillion to the 2016
                              revised Budget and increased the fiscal deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP (from 2.2
                              percent of GDP in the 2016 Budget)5. With a view to improving credibility, and
                              reducing the likelihood of such mid-year expenditure cuts, the 2017 draft Budget
                              (currently under discussion in the Parliament) features more realistic revenue targets.

The tax amnesty has           Revenue realization in the first nine months of 2016 increased significantly by 9.2
led to a pick-up in           percent yoy in nominal terms (Figure 13), mainly driven by a sharp increase in non-
year-to-date revenue          oil and gas income taxes. Such taxes contributed 12.0 percentage points to yoy
collection                    growth compared to 2.6 percentage points over the same period last year. This pick-
                              up is mostly due to increased collection of corporate income taxes (CIT) and
                              proceeds from the tax amnesty program (recorded under other non-oil and gas
                              income taxes) (Figure 14). On the other hand, oil and gas-related revenues
                              continued to detract from nominal growth in total revenue (by 5.5 percentage
                              points), but at a lower rate than in the corresponding period last year (-9.5
                              percentage points), reflecting a slower decline in oil and gas prices this year.
                              Domestic VAT increased significantly by 36.1 percent yoy, in line with reasonably
                              robust private consumption growth. Import VAT continued to decline, but at a
                              slower pace than last year, reflecting a smaller contraction in imports.

                        77 percent. At 63 percent, disbursement of regional transfers was slightly lower due
                        to the delay of revenue sharing and DAU transfers, which were part of the recent

announced               spending (through self-blocking) and postponement of transfers to subnational
expenditure cuts,       governments (SNGs). In addition, the Government increased its fiscal deficit
and expanded the        forecast to 2.5 percent of GDP (from 2.4 percent of GDP in the revised 2016
fiscal deficit          Budget), and to 2.7 percent of GDP again in September10. These measures are

Budget…                is 2.7 percent lower than the revised 2016 Budget target but 10.9 percent higher
                       than the revised revenue outlook announced by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in
                       July 2016. The projected nominal decline (relative to the revised 2016 Budget) in
                       revenue is mainly driven by a decline in natural resource non-tax revenues and
                       income tax revenues. The draft 2017 Budget assumes all tax proceeds from the tax
                       amnesty program will go towards the 2016 Budget balance. The Government
                       expects that the planned revisions to the general tax (KUP) law, Income tax law,
                       VAT law and stamp duty law will increase tax revenue and help achieve the 2017
                       revenue target. However, the Government has not provided any details on the
                       potential impact of these planned revisions. The Government is also planning to
                       further increase the excise tax on cigarettes by 10.5 percent in 2017.15

expenditure            percent lower compared to the revised 2016 Budget, driven by a projected decline in
                       revenue sharing (16.7 percent) and DAK (16.4 percent). However, transfers to
                       Village Funds are 27.7 percent higher (from IDR 47 trillion to IDR 60 trillion). The
                       draft 2017 Budget also includes a proposal to further improve the targeting of
                       electricity subsidies for 450 VA and 900 VA customers categories16 and RASTRA

projects 2016          (although now with greater downside risk), and realized outturns from the tax

including the tax      significant boost to revenue collection of IDR 93.4 trillion. Since the outturns of the
amnesty proceeds       second and third phases of the program are still uncertain, the World Bank revenue

                         than the World Bank’s projection for 2016 revenue. This projected increase assumes

2.8 in 2017              assumes the revenues from tax amnesty are used to fund higher productive
                         expenditure than previously projected (June 2016 IEQ), in particular capital

Box 2: The Indonesia tax amnesty program
Design of the program
The Indonesian Parliament passed a tax amnesty bill on June 28, 2016 (effective on July 18, 2018) to help reach the
ambitious 2016 Budget revenue target by expanding the tax base, and to accelerate economic growth through asset
repatriation. The tax amnesty program offers reduced tax liabilities for declarations made between July 2016 and March
2017 of previously undeclared assets, with lower tax rates for earlier declarations and for onshore and repatriated offshore
assets (compared to non-repatriated offshore assets). 18 Tax payments made on previously undeclared assets are referred
to as redemption fees (Uang Tebusan). The revised 2016 Budget projected that the program would generate IDR 165
trillion (1.3 percent of 2016 GDP) in revenue from redemption fees paid on declared and repatriated assets (based on the
assumption that IDR 1,000 trillion of assets would be repatriated). This estimate was higher than that of the Bank of
Indonesia’s (IDR 54 trillion revenue, IDR 560 trillion repatriated) and market estimates ranging from IDR 40 to 70
trillion.19

The Government was confident that the program would achieve its objectives due to pressure from the implementation
of the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) legislation between countries by 2018, which requires the global
disclosure of assets. The incoming AEOI legislation incentivizes tax evaders to take advantage of the tax amnesty program
before the risk of being detected increases.

The tax amnesty program is being presented as a one-time opportunity, and it sets much higher penalties for
underreporting of assets or assets declared outside of the amnesty period. Underreported assets or assets declared outside
the amnesty period will be treated as additional income and bound by provisions in existing income tax laws and
regulations. These include an additional penalty of up to 200 percent of the additional income for underreported assets.
An additional feature of the program is that repatriated funds have to be invested in domestic assets for a minimum
three-year period. Similarly, declared domestic assets cannot be transferred overseas for a three-year period. A breach of
this commitment would result in the declared assets being liable to standard income taxes.

Progress to date
The first phase of the program received significant interest, with IDR 3,824 trillion in assets declared by October 11th
and IDR 93.4 trillion in redemption fees collected (0.7 percent of GDP) (Table 4). In addition, the Directorate General
of Tax collected a further IDR 3.1 trillion in tax arrears (payment of tax arrears is an eligibility requirement for the amnesty
program).

The progress in tax collection, through both redemption fees and collection of tax arrears, suggests that the Government’s
objective of increasing revenue collection in 2016 via the tax amnesty program will be partly met. However, meeting the
other objectives of the program—expansion of the tax base and boosting economic growth and investment through the
repatriation of assets—will be more challenging as the value of repatriated assets remains very low. Thus far, the
macroeconomic impacts of the tax amnesty have been benign. Fears of inflationary pressure, rapid exchange rate
appreciation and “hot money” inflows have not materialized.

                              19 The AEOI is expected to come into effect starting 2018. AEOI requires Reporting Financial

                                Institutions (RFI's) to report to the tax authority (TA) of their country, which will then exchange the
                                information with the TA of another country. As of November 2015, 96 countries have committed to
                                begin the AEOI in accordance with the Standard by 2017 or 2018 reciprocally and with appropriate
                                partners; 74 countries have signed a multilateral competent authority agreement ("MCAA") which
                                permits participating countries to enter into agreements that provide for the AEOI. According to
                                different sources, most of Indonesian off-shore assets are located in Singapore. As of now, Singapore
                                has committed to the AEOI but has not signed the MCAA. Once both countries have signed the
                                MCAA, RFIs in Singapore would then have to report information to Singapore’s Tax Authority. The
                                information would then be exchanged with Indonesia’s tax office. Source: Credit Suisse, 2015.

Stable food prices,      Moderating inflation and stable food prices (see Section 3 above) have also
particularly for rice,   contributed to poverty reduction (since food prices feed into the calculation of the
contributed to           poverty line). In particular, improved management of rice imports and market
poverty reduction        operations by the government in late 2015 and early 2016 curbed rice price inflation
                         during a typically volatile time of year. Between October 2015 and March 2016,
                         Indonesian Bureau of Logistics (Badan Urusan Logistik, Bulog) imported 1.49 million
                         tons of rice and channeled over 177,000 tons through open market operations. As a
                         result, the March 2016 poverty line increased by only 7.2 percent yoy to IDR
                         354,386 per 6-month semester, lower than the poverty line increases between 2014-
                         2015 (9.26 percent) and 2013-2014 (11.45 percent).

Social assistance        Expansions in social assistance programs may also have driven poverty reduction
expansion could also     over the past year. For example, the Family Hope conditional cash transfer program
have contributed to      (Program Keluarga Harapan, PKH) was expanded from 2.8 million households to 3.5
poverty reduction        million households in late 2015. World Bank simulations suggest that the expansion
                         of this cash transfer contributed as much as 0.1 percentage points to poverty
                         reduction, or nearly one-third of the total observed decline. The planned expansion
                         of PKH to an additional 2.5 million households in 2016 could further boost poverty
                         reduction by as much as 0.4 percentage points.

                          catch up. However, the consumption of the Bottom 40 has not been catching up to
                          either of the other two groups. In fact, their consumption share fell slightly over the
                          year, meaning Indonesia’s growth is still far from equitably distributed.

B. Some recent developments in Indonesia’s economy




                1. Accelerating tourism development
Tourism is a         Tourism is a promising sector that could unlock private investment, foster inclusive
promising growth     and job-rich growth, boost export earnings, and guide a targeted infrastructure
sector in the        investment program in tourism destinations. If planned and managed well, tourism
Indonesian economy   can generate large employment and income multipliers for Indonesia, which can
                     contribute to eliminating poverty and increasing shared prosperity. Ten million
                     additional international tourists and an increase in spending per tourist to Thailand’s
                     level (that is, 1.5 times Indonesia’s current average) would bring USD 16 billion in
                     additional foreign exchange earnings annually. According to the World Travel and
                     Tourism Council (WTTC), in Indonesia, every USD 1 million in travel and tourism
                     spending supports around 200 jobs (of which 67 are direct jobs) and USD 1.7
                     million in GDP (Figure 19).21 With tourism destinations spread across the
                     archipelago, tourism can also help reduce regional disparities within Indonesia.

the booming global        industry is projected to grow by 4.2 percent in real terms per annum over the next
tourism demand            decade, outpacing global economic growth. China continues to lead global
                          outbound travel, which in turn benefits near-by Asian destinations. Spending by
                          Chinese outbound travelers increased 25 percent in 2015 to reach USD 292 billion,
                          as total Chinese outbound travelers rose 10 percent to 128 million, and spending per
                          traveler also rose.23 In 2015, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Australia, and Japan were
                          the top five sources of visitors to Indonesia (Figure 20). International visitor arrivals
                          in Indonesia increased by 8.4 percent in 2015 and the average length of stay
                          increased by 11 per cent to 8.53 days. However, daily expenditures decreased from
                          USD 154 per day in 2014 to USD 142 per day in 2015. Trips by domestic travelers
                          in Indonesia in 2015 increased to 255 million from 251 million in 2014.24

The Government            To fulfil Indonesia’s tourism potential, the Government has identified ten tourism
aims to transform         destinations for priority development, with an emphasis on closing their
Indonesia’s economy       infrastructure gap.25 The Government’s National Medium-Term Development Plan
through an                (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional, RPJMN) 2015-2019, sets a number
ambitious plan for        of objectives to increase the role of tourism in the Indonesian economy. In 2015,
tourism development       the Ministry of Tourism’s budget for promotional activities quadrupled from IDR
                          300 million to IDR 1.2 trillion. In March 2016, the Indonesian Government
                          extended its free visa facility to 169 countries to attract more foreign tourists.
                          However, promotion alone, without policy reform and targeted infrastructure
                          investments for multiple destinations, can overcrowd established destinations such
                          as Bali, erode natural and cultural resources, and spoil the Indonesian “brand”.
                          Recognizing this, in late 2015 President Joko Widodo urged his Cabinet to
                          accelerate the development of the ten priority tourism destinations.
                     a. Improving infrastructure and planning for sustainable tourism growth

Infrastructure            Indonesia ranks in the bottom half of countries on several infrastructure-related
development is            tourism competitiveness indicators (Table 7)—ground and port infrastructure,
required to improve       tourist service infrastructure (e.g. hotels, car rental companies), health and hygiene
the accessibility and     (e.g. access to sanitation), ICT readiness, and environmental sustainability (e.g.
carrying capacity of      wastewater treatment). To address this, the Government plans to invest in air,
tourist destinations...   water, and road connectivity, basic infrastructure and services, and tourism
                          infrastructure and services.

… and should be           Between 2013 and 2015, Indonesia’s performance deteriorated on two tourism
carefully planned to      competitiveness indicators: natural resources (from 6th to 19th) and environmental
ensure                    sustainability (from 125th to 134th). Poor access to basic services, such as water
environmental             supply, sanitation, sewer connections, and solid waste collection, has already eroded
sustainability…           natural assets in some tourist destinations in Indonesia. In addition, rapid
                          unmanaged growth of the tourism industry could further decrease the
                          competitiveness of the assets on which future growth in tourism depends. The
                          experiences of Nepal, Cambodia and Kenya suggests that such an outcome can be

…through integrated The Government plans to prepare integrated tourism masterplans for each of the
tourism masterplans priority tourism destinations, which could provide a strong framework for effective
                    and sustainable tourism development. These will guide the scale and spatial location
                    of future growth, as well as establish policies and practices to ensure key assets are
                    protected and environmental impacts are properly managed and monitored.
                    Masterplans will be informed by detailed tourism demand projections, leading to
                    assessments of the scale and type of public and private investments required to
                    support this future growth. The masterplanning process will also incorporate a
                    comprehensive consultation program, ensuring all stakeholders have a chance to
                    contribute. Strong coordination capabilities and mechanisms are necessary to make
                    this comprehensive consultation happen, but are not yet in place.
                    b. Attracting investors and promoting linkages to the local economy

The Government          The Government expects significant private investment in the tourism sector, and
expects significant     early indicators are promising. Total foreign and domestic direct investment in
private investment in   hotels and restaurants, a relevant indicator of the tourism sector, reached nearly
the tourism sector…     USD 1 billion in 2015—an increase of 45.5 percent compared to 2014, while the
                        number of investment licenses approved in the hotel and restaurant sectors
                        quintupled, from 52 in 2014 to 266 licenses in 2015.26

...but licensing        However, to achieve the Ministry of Tourism’s targeted USD 10 billion in private
processes and           investment in the 10 tourism destinations by 2019, further efforts to attract
promotion efforts       investment are needed. Licensing simplification is one important aspect. As a first
need to be              step, it will be essential to establish an inventory of the number and type of business
strengthened            licenses needed (at the national and subnational level) to establish a tourism-related
                        business. The revision of the Negative Investment List (Daftar Negatif Investasi,
                        DNI)27 earlier this year has further opened the tourism sector to foreign investment,
                        although limitations remain. In other business fields maximum foreign capital
                        allowances have been relaxed, but not removed altogether.28 Moreover, ground
                        transportation rental, a tourism-related business area, has not been opened to
                        foreign investors. This can affect the range and quality of car rental offerings and
                        tour operations.

Increased tourist       Tourist spending can generate significant economic gains in tourist destinations, if

                   2. Why should Indonesia reframe and reorient its food security policy?
Food security is a           In recent years, food security policy has been framed by the Food Law 2012 which
long-standing area of        defined core objectives in terms of (i) ensuring physical and economic access for the
national policy              entire population to food which is diverse, safe and nutritious; (ii) improving the
attention                    welfare of farmers; (iii) minimizing reliance on imports for core staple foods; and
                             (iv) achieving overall ‘food sovereignty’ (that is, being in control of the country’s
                             own food circumstances). Long-standing policy instruments have included public
                             investments, input and credit subsidies, trade restrictions, state enterprise food
                             market interventions and storage, and social safety nets.

Over the past                Indonesia’s total support to agriculture32 is proportionally the highest and fastest

Government has               total support to agriculture in Indonesia was equivalent to 4.6 percent of GDP

spending in order to         countries and regions that are typically thought to provide high levels of protection
achieve food security        and support to agriculture. A significant proportion of Indonesia’s public spending
goals                        for agriculture has gone to subsidize fertilizer and other inputs (Figure 24), while
                             there has been a long-term underinvestment in the types of public goods vital for
                             agricultural productivity and competitiveness. These public goods include: research

                              arising from policy measures that support agriculture. This includes public investments, subsidies,
                              market price support measures, etc. This is a much broader category than ‘public expenditure’ in
                              agriculture.

                       policies and public spending

Indonesia’s              Since the beginning of this decade, domestic retail prices for rice have been 50 to 70
consumers are            percent higher than those in Vietnam, Thailand, and other countries in the Greater
paying exceptionally     Mekong Region (Figure 25). Indonesian consumers are also paying very high prices
high prices for food     for foods rich in protein and micronutrients, including most fruits and vegetables
                         and poultry products. One study found that prices of these higher nutrient foods are
                         substantially higher in Indonesia than in Singapore, a country which lacks an
                         agricultural sector and imports nearly all of its food.34 Furthermore, price levels have
                         continued to diverge. While international prices for cereals have fallen sharply since
                         mid-2012, Indonesia has continued, until very recently, to experience moderate to
                         high food inflation.

Indonesia’s food         The OECD35 estimates that over the 2013-2015 period, Indonesian consumers were
trade restrictions and   ‘taxed’ the equivalent of USD 98 billion as a result of restrictions placed on the
other policy             imports of staple and higher value foods, and the impacts of domestic agricultural
interventions impose     and food market interventions by the Government (Figure 26).36 In 2015 alone, the
a massive ‘tax’ on       cost burden on Indonesian consumers was estimated at USD 36 billion, much
consumers                higher than an estimated burden of USD 22 billion for the entire (28 country)
                         European Union, a region whose long-standing agricultural and other policies have
                         been known to substantially increase food prices for consumers. In per capita terms,
                         the tax on Indonesian consumers was USD 1300 in 2015 compared with USD 437
                         in the European Union, and USD 189 in Vietnam. Such aggregate policy impacts
                         have, at least in the past, undercut Indonesia’s broader efforts to improve food
                         security and nutritional outcomes.




                         33  International experience indicates the superiority of public investment over subsidies in promoting
                           agricultural productivity growth and rural poverty reduction. For example, one study of 15 Latin
                           American countries found that a reallocation of 10 percent of agricultural spending from subsidies to
                           public goods was associated with an increase in per capita agricultural income by 2.3 percent. See: R.
                           Lopez and G. Galinato, 2007, “Should governments stop subsidies to private goods? Evidence from

                           implemented on wheat imports between 2008 and 2014 resulted in the price of wheat flour being 22
                           percent higher than it would have been without such measures. Restrictions on the use of Jakarta port
                           for fruit and vegetable imports, begun in 2012, have resulted in significantly higher prices for certain
                           items in Jakarta in comparison with Surabaya, the required port of entry.

The adverse impacts          According to Susenas 2013 data, the budget share of food for households at the
of high food prices          lowest decile of per capita expenditure was 61 percent. For households up to and
are most significant         including the seventh decile, the budget share of food still exceeded 50 percent
for the poor and near        compared with only 30 percent for those in the richest decile. For the entire
poor…                        population, rice accounted for 8 percent of total spending and 18 percent of food
                             expenditure. For the poorest decile, however, these shares were 22 percent and 35
                             percent, respectively. Nationally, 92 percent of households are net buyers of rice.
                             Even though many of the nation’s poor are rice farmers, more than 87 percent of
                             poor households buy more rice than they sell. High rice prices also crowd out
                             spending by the poor on more nutritious foods.37 As a result, Indonesia has
                             continued to score poorly in national measures of dietary diversity and quality.38
                             Several studies suggest that Indonesia’s poor and near-poor have not been able to
                             afford a nutritiously balanced diet.39




                             37 Analysis by the World Bank suggests that an 11 percent increase in rice prices reduces rice
                               consumption by only 0.08 percent, yet has a spiraling effect of reducing vegetable and fruit
                               consumption by 3.2 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. For an earlier analysis of cross-price
                               elasticities, see A. Widaryono, 2012, “An Analysis of Protein and Calorie Consumption in Central

                             unbalanced (or excessive) nutrient use have likely been exacerbated by fertilizer
                             subsidies, contributing to soil degradation, water pollution and high green-house gas
                             emissions.42

                             This has reinforced a negative cycle that hurts both farmers and consumers. High
                             food prices have put upward pressures on hired labor and rented land costs for
                             farmers, especially in Java. Comparatively high production costs43 (paired with low
                             milling efficiencies and high logistical costs) make Indonesian farmers
                             uncompetitive, seemingly necessitating their protection which, in turn, harms
                             consumers. An entirely different policy approach is needed to break this cycle both
                             now and for the longer-term.

Addressing the farm      Elsewhere in the region, a process of structural transformation is occurring within

require structural       major shifts in (and diversification of) agricultural land use, and large changes in the
changes (rather than     composition of agricultural GDP.44 Many surplus workers are leaving agriculture,
relying on protection    such that the productivity of those who remain is increasing. These structural
and subsidies)           changes have been occurring at a much slower pace in Indonesia (Figure 29 and
                         Figure 30). This is likely due to insecure land tenure, policy-induced distortions in
                         incentives, and a long pattern of underinvestment in critical public goods.

                         Changes in food consumption and expenditure have been relatively slower in rural
                         areas due to access and affordability constraints, yet have nevertheless shown some
                         dynamism. For example, the share of rural food expenditure for processed foods
                         rose from 8 percent in the early 2000s to 19 percent a decade later. As observed in
                         other countries, these trends are expected to continue in Indonesia over the coming
                         decades, giving rise to a structure of food consumption and spending that will look
                         very different from that of today—both quantitatively and qualitatively.46

                         other countries in the region—including China and Vietnam—food safety and
                         animal disease risks have emerged as core food security concerns, and Indonesia
                         may face this prospect in the absence of concerted public and private action.

...as well as flagging   The environmental footprint of Indonesia’s agro-food system has been very
the need to reduce       significant, adversely affecting productivity (for example, through the depletion of
the environmental        fisheries resources), human health (for example, through fires created for land
footprint of the food    clearing), the availability and quality of water for non-agricultural use, and the
system                   agricultural sector’s international and domestic reputation. Another emerging issue
                         is food waste and its adverse socio-economic, environmental and livelihood
                         impacts. There is evidence of growing levels of food waste in Indonesia48 and this
                         will become ever more challenging with further urbanization and the shifts toward
                         processed foods and out-of-home eating. Measures will be needed to improve the
                         incentives and capabilities to apply more environmentally sustainable practices in
                         agriculture and other food value chain functions.

Changing the food        Official statistics indicate that a very high proportion of national requirements for
demand has               rice and maize (for feed) are being met from domestic production, except in
implication for food     exceptional years when adverse weather conditions occur (i.e. the 2015-16 ENSO
trade                    event). Yet, with dietary changes, Indonesia is now experiencing an acceleration of
                         imports for those grain and oilseed commodities for which it is not an efficient
                         producer (i.e. wheat and soybeans). Imports of some higher value foods and
                         multiple (semi-) processed foods have recently been 4 to 6 times higher, in value
                         terms, than combined rice and maize imports (Figure 32). Some of these imports
                         represent complementary supply (i.e. of temperate fruits or certain fish species
                         which cannot be grown in Indonesia); other imports are intermediate products or
                         ingredients which are blended with domestic raw materials to generate final
                         consumer products. Domestic consumers gain access to a wider variety of foods
                         while Indonesia’s food companies can grow and, in some cases, target the rapidly
                         expanding middle class in ASEAN and other Asian countries.

                         While not currently predicted for the upcoming decade49, a future return to higher
                         international commodity prices cannot be completely ruled out. Still, Indonesia’s per
                         capita food imports, in value terms, are low by international standards (Figure 33).
                         While significant competitiveness challenges remain—especially in the primary

                         47 As international evidence points to a link between childhood stunting and the development of
                           obesity and chronic diseases later in life, Indonesia faces the risk of enormous future public health
                           costs and losses in productivity. See for example: C. Victora, 2008, “Maternal and Child
                           Undernutrition: Consequences for Adult Health and Human Capital”, The Lanset, Volume 37, No.

                         48 FAO food balance sheets indicate that Indonesia experiences more than 100kg of food waste per

                           capita per year, a figure two and a half times that of South Korea, a country which has instituted
                           effective programs to prevent or limit food waste. Food waste is prominent in Indonesia’s municipal
                           solid waste, two-thirds of which ends up in landfills. http://faostat.fao.org/site/354/default.aspx

                          c. How should Indonesia strategically re-orient its food security policy?

It would be                  Indonesia has ambitious goals for green economic growth, rising prosperity, and
beneficial for               international competitiveness. Such a vibrant, forward-looking society requires
Indonesia to refine          equally ambitious goals related to its agro-food sector. Meeting targeted commodity
its food policy              production targets is not sufficient. The goal should be to develop a modern food
aspirations—from             system which is more (i) Reliable, (ii) Inclusive, (iii) Competitive; and (iv) Eco-
rice to RICE                 friendly. That is, rebalance attention beyond a dominant focus on rice to pursue a
                             broader concept of RICE. These RICE attributes embody the aims already set out
                             in the Food Law, and place greater emphasis on resilience, flexibility, health-
                             promotion, consumer responsiveness, efficiency, and environmental sustainability.
                             Specific indicators can be defined to fit Indonesia’s distinctive characteristics and
                             values, such that performance can be accurately monitored and measured.

Pursuing this agenda         Food policy is a much broader sphere than simply agricultural policy. A significant
will require a more          proportion of agricultural policy is food-related, yet food policy also includes
balanced and                 various dimensions related to health/nutrition, transport/logistics, trade, social
coordinated effort           protection, and environmental protection. An urbanizing middle income Indonesia
across many sectors          needs a balanced food policy in which there is consistency and synergy among the
                             multiple sectoral policies and programs which impact the country’s food system and

                             50For example, Vietnam continues to expand its exports of a wide range of food and other agricultural
                              commodities, yet over the past 5 to 10 years, its imports of feedgrains and other feed ingredients have
                              surged and now exceed the annual value of its high volume rice export trade. These imports of
                              feedgrains have enabled a large and competitive increase in domestic pork and poultry product
                              production, servicing expanding demand, including from among the poor and near-poor.

                              consumer preferences and food supply dimensions, as well as between primary
                              production and food system challenges beyond the farm-gate. From a dominant
                              focus on cereals production and assuring a diet with adequate calories, future policy
                              should give more balanced attention across food nutrients—carbohydrates, micro-
                              nutrients, and protein—and between the quality of food (and diets) and the
                              quantities available.

more reliable (R) and         production and market performance risks posed by weather, other natural factors
resilient food                affecting plant/animal health, and other ‘external’ shocks (including international
system…                       market developments). Reliability also relates to having accurate information (about
                              production, prices, food safety, etc.). The pertinent policy agenda is multi-faceted.
                              For example, it includes measures to develop more drought and flood-tolerant crop
                              varieties, improve access to irrigation services, strengthen pest and disease
                              surveillance and control, raise the performance and credibility of food safety
                              regulatory oversight, and facilitate farmer and company investments in crop and
                              food storage. A reliable food system is one in which both internal and international
                              trade is supported and facilitated. In that regard, improving port infrastructure, and
                              implementing on-going reforms to enable more competitive markets for freight
                              forwarding, storage, distribution, and auxiliary shipping services will be critical.

…and one which is             An inclusive food system is one which can provide stable and remunerative
more inclusive (I)            livelihoods for many people (in its agricultural, manufacturing and services
and health                    dimensions) and is able to fully meet the food and nutritional security needs of the
promoting                     entire population, especially its lower income segments. This entails a multi-faceted
                              agenda. Protecting farmers should give way to measures which empower farmers
                              (such as collective action in water management and in commercial functions) and
                              facilitate important structural changes (such as land consolidation and agricultural
                              diversification) which will help to increase farm productivity and incomes. A more
                              inclusive food system may require some intensified efforts to develop and
                              implement differentiated food and nutritional security approaches in different

                       access doubling from 24 percent to 47 percent for sanitation, and increasing from
                       61 percent to 79 percent for water supply—a growth rate three times higher than
                       that in urban areas53. Following these achievements, the Government is now

                    b. WASH is a key determinant of stunting

1 child out of every 3   The prevalence of stunting in Indonesia rose to 37.2 percent in 2013, up from 35.6
in Indonesia is          percent in 2010 and 36.8 percent in 2007.63 With almost 9 million stunted
stunted                  children—or 1 out of 3—Indonesia’s stunting prevalence is higher than its regional
                         peers, such as Myanmar (35 percent), Vietnam (23 percent) and Thailand (16
                         percent) (Figure 27). Indonesia is among the five countries with the highest number
                         of stunted children64.

Stunting reflects        According to the World Health Organization65, stunting reflects chronic
chronic                  undernutrition during the most critical periods of growth and development in the
undernutrition           first 1,000 days of life. Stunting is associated with an under-developed brain leading
during the first 1,000   to long-lasting harmful consequences including diminished mental ability and
days of life             learning capacity66. Stunting is influenced by a number of interlinked factors,

                           years, access to WASH has improved overtime. However, this does not negate a relationship between
                           WASH and stunting. The apparent contradiction in the time series data may reflect the deterioration
                           of other important determinants of stunting in the last decade (such as nutrition factors). Further,
                           cross sectional data (stunting rates and access to improved sanitation by province) do show the
                           expected negative correlation (Figure 37).

                     Indonesian data have shown a strong relationship between improved sanitation and
                     reduced stunting (Figure 37). Provincial data show that access to basic sanitation
                     and safe drinking water are associated with taller children69. This gain in height is
                     larger when basic sanitation and safely managed water are accompanied by access to
                     adequate food and health services. An impact evaluation study in East Java showed
                     that children exposed to a Rural Sanitation Program had lower average rates of
                     parasitic infection, as well as improvements in height and weight, compared to
                     children that did not benefit from the program70. Other studies, such as in
                     Cambodia71, Mali72, and India,73 and global econometric studies74 find that children
                     in households that do not practice open defecation (OD) are less stunted. In line
                     with this research, international programs intended to address stunting have started
                     to incorporate a focus on WASH. The Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement,

                          prioritizes WASH as part of a multi-sectoral response to stunting76.

The Government of         The Government of Indonesia has committed to reduce the rate of stunting to 28
Indonesia                 percent nationally by 2019. As such, government and donor funding is being
committed to reduce       directed towards stunting. For example, the Government signed a USD 130 million
the rate of stunting      compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in 2013 to fund the
from 37 percent in        Community-Based Health and Nutrition Program to Reduce Stunting (PKGBM)77.
2013 to 28 percent by     PKGBM is currently being implemented in 64 districts in 11 provinces and aims to
2019                      tackle stunting by integrating a nutrition program with the STBM approach to rural
                          sanitation.
                     c. An integrated approach to WASH is required to reduce stunting and poverty

Some collaboration        An integrated approach across water, agriculture, health and nutrition is required to
among practitioners       address stunting and poverty. Collaboration between some of these sector is already
in different sectors is   taking place in selected areas within the STBM, PAMSIMAS and PKGBM
already taking place      programs. For example, PAMSIMAS (water program) and PKGBM (nutrition
to address stunting       program) have integrated the STBM approach to rural sanitation to generate
and poverty               consumer demand for toilets and strengthen the supply of sanitation goods and
                          services.

Harmonization of          Harmonization of monitoring and reporting systems is another way to ensure that
monitoring and            WASH objectives are considered in nutrition projects (and vice versa). The
reporting systems         PAMSIMAS MIS now draws on data collected through the STBM program to

integrated service        program initiated a joint data analysis forum to generate statistics around the
delivery                  determinants of undernutrition, including: sanitation, nutrition, maternal and child
                          health, and infectious disease.

Demand for services       Triggering activities have traditionally been used to stimulate an emotional response

                         has an impact on overall economic development in communities. The supply side of
                         rural WASH is continuously improving through the adoption of new technology
                         and training of entrepreneurs. Since 2010, the Government has trained a total of
                         1,945 masons80 to be potential sanitation entrepreneurs, of whom 273 have become
                         active entrepreneurs (Table 8). These entrepreneurs have sold 63,760 healthy
                         latrines worth IDR 90 billion81. Moreover, through sanitation entrepreneur
                         associations, some entrepreneurs have received support from local banks or micro
                         finance institutions to expand their businesses. Improved pit latrines are among the
                         most economic solutions with a unit cost of around USD 30 per household per
                         year. In rural areas, the economic benefits of pit latrines exceed costs by a factor of
                         at least seven82. Overall, supply side WASH activities can not only deliver sanitation
                         services and economic benefits to communities, but can also help set up profitable
                         businesses.

                      d. Continuing progress in rural WASH in order to reduce stunting and poverty

Reducing stunting        Since 2008, increased investment and a strengthened institutional framework have
will require further     improved access to WASH in rural areas. However, service delivery bottlenecks
integration between      remain. Fundamental causes of poor local service delivery include: an inefficient
rural WASH,              allocation of spending at the sub-national government level; technical capacity and
nutrition, and           coordination constraints; and weak incentives and accountability structures for
poverty                  delivering results83. Addressing these bottlenecks, and further integrating WASH
                         programs with other sectors can help reduce stunting and poverty.

Synergies between      Synergies between sectors can be obtained in many ways, including: (i) using
sectors can be         common measurement indicators, benchmarks, and tools; (ii) co-locating programs
obtained in many       in geographies with high rates of stunting; (iii) using existing targeting strategies and
ways                   the delivery platforms of social protection programs to deliver BCC messages about
                       WASH and nutrition at a larger scale; (iv) and using reciprocal arrangements
                       between nutrition and WASH delivery systems to deliver BCC messages. Early
                       global evidence already suggests that including integrated BCC messages in WASH
                       programs can enhance their impact on health and nutrition objectives. Looking
                       ahead, more research is required to develop evidence-based messaging on the
                       linkages between rural WASH, nutrition and poverty for use in integrated BCC
                       campaigns. The synergies in shaping nutrition linked WASH behaviors can also be
                       obtained by utilizing additional tools (such as ‘nudges’ for hand washing and
                       hygiene) that influence choices and actions of the target groups. These can be
                       rigorously tested and evaluated for impact and further scaled-up.

A number of policy     Achieving universal access to WASH will require greater resources and better use of

and improve the        For example, a soft regulatory framework for public-private-community
efficiency of          partnerships (PPCP) will allow engaging private and social enterprises for inclusive
spending               and sustainable delivery of WASH and nutrition services in communities. In parallel,
                       local governments could be incentivised to improve performance by increasing their
                       share of the Special Allocation Fund (DAK). This would further incentivize them to
                       focus on targeted sectors and hold them accountable through a results-based
                       approach. PAMSIMAS already delivers “results-based-financing” to local
                       governments as a reward for delivering rural water services and securing co-funding


                       84For example, an integrated map that overlays poverty, stunting and WASH access would be useful
                        for planning integrated programs.

                     BPSPAMS are a cost effective way for sharing technical knowledge. A similar

teacher certification   Indonesia's answer was the formulation and implementation of Law No. 14/2005
program                 on Teachers and Lecturers (known as the Teacher Law). The flagship program
                        under the new law was a teacher certification program that aimed to reestablish
                        some of the esteem that the teaching profession had lost during the rapid expansion
                        of education in the 1970s and 1980s. The program promised teachers a generous
                        professional allowance, equal to their base salary, upon successful completion of the
                        program. Certification, therefore, essentially doubled teachers’ take-home pay.88 The
                        initial design of the program was such that to qualify for certification, teachers first
                        had to obtain a university bachelor’s degree and second, as additional proof of
                        competency, had to demonstrate their skills through a written competency test,
                        classroom observation, and a portfolio of past training and experience. The idea was
                        that teachers without the right teaching skills would have a clear financial incentive
                        to upgrade their skills to the standard required.

However, diluted        In the early 2000s, political momentum built around the certification program.
certification           However, the regulations proposed in the initial design were significantly watered
conditions              down when the proposed bill was presented in parliament. Under pressure from
undermined the          teacher unions, the requirement to demonstrate competency, through tests and
potential benefits of   classroom observation for instance, was dropped and only a portfolio assessment of
the program             past training and experience was retained.89 Many observers worried that only
                        acquiring a bachelor’s degree from one of the country’s teacher training institutions
                        would not be enough to ensure a minimum level of teacher quality.

                        This concern was partly based on a large body of empirical research that raised
                        skepticism about the benefits of formal academic qualifications for teachers.
                        However, such research typically concentrates on more advanced economies where
                        teachers with a bachelor’s degree are compared with those who have a master’s
                        degree90. The situation in Indonesia was strikingly different, as a quarter of all 2.7
                        million teachers in 2005 (and a third of all primary teachers) had no more than a
                        high-school diploma. In this context, it was not unreasonable to expect that if this
                        group obtained a university bachelor’s degree, the quality of the learning
                        environment would improve.


                        88 Some teachers also receive other allowances in addition to their base pay. In that case, the
                          certification allowance does not double their pay, although it significantly increases it.

                                       91While the base salary of a junior teacher with a university bachelor’s degree roughly translates to the
                                        median wage of all workers with a bachelor’s degree in Indonesia, the base salary and the professional

impact on student            control schools (Figure 43). This likely reflects the fact that teachers in treatment
test scores in               schools (those that participated in the certification program) did not put in greater
language,                    effort in response to the pay increase. That is, there was no difference between
mathematics, or              treatment and control schools with respect to teacher test scores, the likelihood of

                        schools. The increased desirability of teaching as a profession has led to a surge in

                        far the largest education reform in recent decades. The hope is that the program has
                        helped to lay the groundwork for further essential reforms in the sector. Teaching is

improve the quality     proxies. Further, targets and goals should be based on indicators that can be reliably
of teaching             obtained, that are important (ideally, scientifically proven to be so) for better
                        teaching, and that measure competency with reasonable levels of precision. Overall,
                        developing and implementing reliable and effective assessments for the TPMS is a
                        formidable challenge that cannot be resolved overnight.

A continuous system     The Government is currently emphasizing both the short-run goal of improving in-
of re-assessment and    service teacher training programs, with a focus on subject content knowledge, as
performance             well as the medium to long-term goal of improving the teacher selection process
incentives can          through testing new teachers (graduates) on their knowledge, teaching skills,
enhance the quality     learning context skills, and personal skills. Without such improvements, the huge
of teaching             fiscal cost would indeed turn out to be “double for nothing”.

                        101In this regard, competency refers to both subject matter knowledge and pedagogic ability. The
                         evaluation of the certification program has already found that teachers’ subject matter knowledge
                         matters for student performance (see sub-section c). Other studies also show that pedagogical
                         knowledge is an extremely important element of teacher competency. See for example: World Bank,
                         2016, “A Video Study of Teaching Practices in TIMSS Eighth Grade Mathematics Classrooms
                         Understanding What Teaching Practices are Used, Why They are Used and How They Relate to
                         Student Learning”.
