INDONESIA ECONOMIC QUARTERLY
Delivering change

December 2014
Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a longer-
          term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over the period,
          the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social welfare. Second, the
          IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and policy issues, and analysis
          of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is intended for a wide audience,
          including policymakers, business leaders, financial market participants, and the community of
          analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office and receives editorial and strategic
          guidance from an editorial board chaired by Rodrigo Chaves, Country Director for Indonesia.
          The report is compiled by the Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global Practice team,
          under the guidance of Shubham Chaudhuri, Practice Manager, Ndiame Diop, Lead Economist,
          and Ashley Taylor, Senior Economist. Led by Alex Sienaert, Country Economist, and with
          responsibility for Part A, editing and production, the core project team comprises Arsianti,
          Magda Adriani, Masyita Crystallin, Fitria Fitrani, Ahya Ihsan, Elitza Mileva (Part A lead), Michele
          Savini Zangrandi and Violeta Vulovic, with additional editing by Peter Milne and data input from
          Yus Medina, Michaelino Mervisiano, Astrid Rengganis Savitri and Daim Syukriyah.
          Administrative support is provided by Titi Ananto. Dissemination is organized by Farhana
          Asnap, Indra Irnawan, Jerry Kurniawan, Desy Mutialim and Nugroho Sunjoyo, under the
          guidance of Dini Djalal.

          (Section A, poverty and minimum wages), Yue Man Lee, Bernard Myers, Arvind Nair and Violeta
          Vulovic ( Part B.1, Revenues), Ahmad Ahsan (Section B.2, AEC), and Ajay Tandon, Darren
          Dorkin, Eko Pambudi and Puti Marzoeki (Section C, Universal Health Coverage, which is based
          on background work for the National RPJMN 2015-2019). Key data and input were received
          from Cut Dian Augustina, Brasuka Sudjana and Sjamsu Rahardja. The report also benefited from

 Executive summary: Delivering change




Indonesia’s new        Having taken office on October 20, 2014, Indonesia’s new President, Joko Widodo,
government has         and his administration have set out a series of ambitious development goals,
taken positive early   particularly on the improvement of energy and other infrastructure, and social
steps…                 programs. Steps aimed at strengthening governance in key sectors have also been
                       taken, for example, in the oil and gas industry. A third feature has been a focus on
                       implementation and a more centralized approach to policy formulation. Notably,
                       the president took the important decision to raise subsidized fuel prices effective
                       November 18, shoring up Indonesia’s fiscal position and freeing up space for much-
                       needed increases in development spending. These positive steps and commitments
                       in the early days of the new government suggest a willingness to make the hard
                       choices that are required to address many of Indonesia’s long-standing structural
                       priorities.

                       edition of the IEQ: “collecting more”, i.e. mobilizing more public revenues,
                       “spending better”, i.e. improving public service delivery, notably in the health
                       sector, and “facilitating business”, for example, to enable Indonesian firms and
                       workers to seize the opportunities afforded by greater regional economic
                       integration.

commodity prices        a somewhat slower pace of growth. Looking ahead, the global economy is still

oil prices falling      growth forecasts have generally been revised lower, and emerging markets as a
sharply in recent       whole are now expected to grow at rates below those observed over the past
months                  decade. This moderation in global growth expectations has contributed to the
                        continued softening of the international prices of Indonesia’s key export
                        commodities. Crude oil prices have fallen particularly steeply, by approximately one-
                        third since June, to four-year lows. Since Indonesia is a net importer of oil, this will
                        provide welcome support for the terms of trade. However, the impacts on the
                        energy sector and on the fiscal sector (with potential relief for energy subsidy costs
                        but a negative effect on oil-related revenues), will also be crucial determinants of the
                        ultimate impact on the Indonesian economy.

Indonesia’s economy     The pace of economic growth in Indonesia has continued to moderate, weighed
recorded another        down by relatively subdued investment spending, and ongoing export weakness. In
quarter of moderate     the third quarter, real GDP grew at 5.0 percent year-on-year (yoy), down from 5.1
growth due to           percent yoy in the second quarter. In sequential terms, GDP increased by 5.3
weaker investment       percent quarter-on-quarter at a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (qoq-saar), also
and exports             slightly down, from 5.4 percent in the second quarter. Private consumption,
                        Indonesia’s main expenditure growth driver, together with higher government
                        spending, broadly compensated for the drop in the contributions of fixed
                        investment and net exports to year-on-year GDP growth in the third quarter.

Export weakness has     The continued weakness of export revenues, notwithstanding the resumption of
meant only a modest     some mineral exports in the second half of 2014, has meant that Indonesia’s current
narrowing so far in     account deficit has so far narrowed only modestly, despite significant import
the current account     compression. The current account deficit eased to USD 6.8 billion or 3.1 percent of
deficit                 GDP in the third quarter, 1.0 percentage point of GDP lower than the seasonally
                        high level in the second quarter, and 0.8 percentage points of GDP below the year-
                        ago level. Within the wider current account, however, the goods trade balance
                        turned positive, helped especially by subdued imports. On the financial account
                        side of the balance of payments, direct investment and net portfolio investment,
                        notably foreign purchases of government bonds, remained strong.

In the fiscal sector,   In the fiscal sector, total revenue collection growth (10.8 percent yoy in January-
revenue growth has      October 2014) has continued to come in below nominal GDP growth (11.8 percent
remained relatively     yoy in Q1-Q3 2014) despite a lift to exchange rate-sensitive revenues from the
weak, while capital     weaker Rupiah. On the expenditure side, overall budget disbursement rates by the
expenditure has         end of October increased relative to previous years. However, this was mainly
contracted              driven by higher energy subsidy spending, and capital expenditure has significantly
                        underperformed, with only 38 percent of the revised Budget allocation realized.
                        This disbursement rate of capital expenditure is well below the execution rates in
                        2012 and 2013 and, in nominal terms, capital expenditure has declined for the first
                        time in recent years, by 18 percent. In addition to long-standing budget execution
                        challenges such as land acquisition, the substantial mid-year budget revision and the
                        transition to a new government may have also slowed capital project execution.

savings…                 on inflation is expected to be pronounced but temporary, lifting CPI by

                         late next year, resulting in average annual headline inflation in 2015 of 7.5 percent.
                         The projected fiscal savings from the announced fuel price increase amount to more
                         than IDR 100 trillion in 2015 (1 percent of GDP), though, as seen in 2013, this
                         could be eroded by future Rupiah depreciation or a reversal in global oil prices. As
                         emphasized in recent statements by the government, these risks point to the need to
                         secure the dividends of this price increase by establishing a subsidy mechanism that
                         reduces the volatility of subsidy costs.

spending and             fiscal deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2015 is slightly lower than the projected
potential deficit        deficit of 2.4 percent in 2014. The budget is expected to be revised during the first
reduction under a        quarter of 2015, to reflect the priorities of the new government such as
revised Budget           infrastructure for food security and maritime and social protection. An important

Economic growth is       Projected GDP growth is revised down marginally to 5.1 percent in 2014 (from 5.2
expected to stabilize    percent in the July IEQ) and more substantially to 5.2 percent in 2015 (from 5.6
at close to current      percent prior), while in 2016 the World Bank expects GDP to accelerate to 5.5
levels, before picking   percent (Table 1). The outlook reflects disappointing fixed investment and trade
up modestly in           data releases, and the continuing deceleration in credit. A stronger than expected
2016…                    acceleration in fixed investment through 2015 could drive a more rapid economic
                         expansion than in the baseline, but would require that the ongoing disbursement
                         challenges for public capital spending allocations are addressed. The current account
                         deficit narrows gradually in the baseline scenario to 2.8 of GDP in 2015 and 2016,
                         from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2014.

                         difficult to estimate precisely. However, on a medium-term view, Indonesia faces a
                         challenge to address stubborn extreme poverty. Poverty is projected to remain
                         above 8 percent in 2018 in the baseline scenario, unless there is concerted action to
                         support shared growth and to strengthen and expand the social safety net.

government will be       increased district level transfers under the 2014 Village Law, while safe-guarding
critical to create the   Indonesia’s strong commitment to fiscal prudence, will not be easy, especially in the
fiscal space for         current context of more subdued economic growth. Indonesia currently collects just
implementing its         over 11 percent of GDP in tax, and 15 percent of GDP in total revenue, amongst
development              the lowest in the region and in the G20. Under a “no major reform” scenario,
programs…                revenue collection is projected to fall further as a share of GDP to 13.7 percent by
                         2019. Consequently, and as emphasized by the government, a sustained effort to
                         mobilize revenues is critical. Revenue policy reforms to broaden the tax base,
                         simplify tax structures, rationalize tax types, and selectively revise certain rates to be
                         in line with international levels, could help to raise revenues, as well as reduce
                         economic distortions and lower administration costs. In addition, improving tax and
                         non-tax revenue administration and compliance through a more strategic, risk-based
                         approach to compliance management, and additional efforts to increase voluntary
                         compliance, will also help to address this challenge.

…including the           One priority area in need of the additional public spending that could be enabled by
realization of the       mobilizing more revenues is the health sector. Public health spending across all
ambitious goal of        levels of government was only about 1.2 percent of Indonesia’s GDP in 2012 (about
universal health         USD 43 per capita), the fifth-lowest health-spending-to-GDP ratio globally. At the
coverage by 2019…        same time, Indonesia has recently implemented a series of key reforms with the
                         objective of attaining universal health coverage by 2019, a fundamental policy to
                         ensure and sustain inclusive economic growth and accelerate poverty reduction. In
                         order to realize this ambitious goal, there needs to be a focus not just on increasing
                         access to, and end-user affordability of, health services, but also on ensuring that
                         effective health care services exist, especially in the eastern regions of Indonesia and
                         at the primary care level.

…while ongoing           Indonesia also faces challenges, and opportunities, from the prospect of more
moves towards            regional economic integration. In December 2015, the Association of Southeast
ASEAN regional           Asian Nations (ASEAN) will create the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC),
economic integration     aiming for a free flow of goods, services, skilled labor and, to a more limited extent,
offer opportunities      capital. The strategic importance to Indonesia’s economy of seizing the
for Indonesian           opportunities created by more regional market access and increased flows of goods
enterprises              and services has only been increased by the recent downward pressures on
                         commodity prices, highlighting the need to drive export growth through raising the
                         international competitiveness of manufacturing and services firms and finding new
                         markets for Indonesian products. Positioning Indonesia to benefit fully from this
                         opportunity places an additional premium on supporting economic competitiveness
                         by addressing infrastructure and skills gaps, and reforming regulations so as to lower
                         firms’ costs. Close engagement with other ASEAN countries in regulatory
                         cooperation, to reduce non-tariff barriers and regulatory bottlenecks, especially in
                         services, will be necessary to achieve and realize the benefits of closer regional
                         economic integration.

 A. Economic and fiscal update




               1. The outlook for Indonesia’s external environment has weakened
Near-term growth       Near-term global growth forecasts have been revised down and the global recovery
projections have       is projected to be more gradual and more uneven than anticipated at the time of the
been lowered in        last IEQ (Figure 1). Among major economies, activity has picked up in the US but
many emerging          has lagged behind in the Euro Area and Japan. At the same time, China’s economic
markets and            rebalancing has continued, resulting in a somewhat slower pace of growth. The
Indonesia’s main       emerging markets as a group are now expected to grow at rates below those
trading partners       observed before the global financial crisis or during the post-crisis recovery. In line
                       with the revised prospects for global growth and international trade, the outlook for
                       Indonesia’s main trading partners has also weakened slightly, contributing to the
                       World Bank revising down its macroeconomic forecasts for Indonesia as well (see
                       Section 2).

Commodity prices       As a result of the recent faltering of the global recovery, the prices of Indonesia’s
remain under           main commodity exports, except liquefied natural gas (LNG), have recorded
significant pressure   significant declines, moving further below their post-global financial crisis highs of
                       early 2011. In US dollar terms, as of November 2014, the price of rubber is down
                       74 percent from its peak, coal 53 percent, crude palm oil 44 percent and copper 32
                       percent. Over recent months, oil prices have fallen sharply, with the Brent crude
                       benchmark down 33 percent from July 1 to December 2. Global commodity price
                       movements therefore continue to shape the outlook for Indonesia’s economy. As a
                       net oil importer, Indonesia has benefited from a reduced oil import bill, but this
                       benefit continues to be offset by falls in the export values of other commodities
                       (Figure 2). The fiscal and corporate sectors have also been affected, although the
                       large depreciation of the Rupiah from its highs in mid-2011 has acted as a shock
                       absorber, cushioning some of the impact of lower commodity prices on revenues.

The growth in                 In the third quarter of 2014, Indonesia’s real GDP grew 5.0 percent year-on-year
economic activity             (yoy), down from 5.1 percent in the second quarter. In sequential terms, GDP
was again moderate            increased by 5.3 percent quarter-on-quarter at a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate
in the third quarter          (qoq-saar), slightly down from 5.4 percent in Q2 2014 (Figure 3). Private
of 2014 due to weaker         consumption, Indonesia’s main growth driver, together with higher government
investment and                spending, compensated for the drop in the contributions of fixed investment and
exports…                      net exports to year-on-year GDP growth in Q3. Taking into account the latest
                              national accounts and credit market data releases, and the external developments
                              discussed in the preceding section, economic activity in Indonesia is projected to
                              continue to grow at a moderate pace in 2015, picking up somewhat in 2016.

… while private               In the third quarter of 2-14, domestic demand growth remained stable at 4.9 percent
consumption has               yoy, but, in contrast to Q2, it was supported by government spending while

growth                        compared with 5.6 percent in each of the previous two quarters. Sequentially, the
                              growth of this expenditure component actually accelerated to 5.9 percent qoq-saar

since the global              commodity prices, tighter credit conditions and the depreciation of the Rupiah
financial crisis              continue to be felt. In sequential terms, fixed investment growth decelerated to 2.4
                              percent qoq-saar, down from 4.2 percent in Q2 2014. Building investment has
                              remained the main growth driver, contributing 4.5 percentage points to year-on-year
                              fixed investment growth in Q3 (Figure 5). In contrast, foreign machinery,
                              equipment and transportation equipment spending subtracted 1.1 percentage points

                              into account that, in Indonesia, construction investment prices are low relative to
                              machinery and equipment prices. For example, India, the Philippines, Thailand and
                              Vietnam have similar relative price ratios of construction to machinery and
                              equipment to Indonesia’s (equal to slightly more than 0.2) but much lower relative

both exports and                 (Figure 4), but it was again driven by declining imports. Exports of goods and
imports continued in             services declined by 0.7 percent yoy (and by 0.7 percent qoq-saar). Based on trade
the third quarter                volume data for July and August, the decline in exports was caused by a drop in
                                 rubber and coal exports. Lower demand for these commodities from China is
                                 mainly responsible for this decrease in exports. However, in the case of coal
                                 exports, India has offset partly the loss in Chinese demand in recent months.
                                 Despite the resumption of limited copper exports in the third quarter, ores have
                                 remained the main drag on export volume growth. In the same period, overall

Agriculture, mining              From the production perspective, manufacturing and some service sectors

                                 yoy. The growth contribution of most other sectors remained broadly stable, with
                                 agriculture and mining and quarrying rising slightly.

… but some food        After declining significantly between January and August 2014, food price inflation
price pressures have   has risen in recent months to 7.3 percent yoy in November. As a result of lower rice
emerged recently       production this year, due to the dry conditions caused by El Niño, domestic rice
                       prices have increased somewhat since June.2 However, some of the price pressure
                       was offset by rice imports by the government, totaling 425 thousand tons so far this
                       year. The prices of most other food items, except chilies, have declined in the third
                       quarter. Despite its small weight in the food consumption basket (around 1.1
                       percent in 2007), the price of chilies, which has tripled since the end of June, has
                       driven up food price inflation.

The inflation rate is            The 2014 and 2015 projected annual average CPI inflation rate has been revised up
projected to increase            to 6.3 percent and 7.3 percent yoy, respectively, to account for the effect of the

subsidized fuel price            the case with the fuel subsidy cuts implemented in 2013. Moreover, on November
increases                        18, Bank Indonesia (BI) announced a 25 basis points increase in its policy rate (and

                                 expectations. Average annual CPI inflation is expected to decrease to 5.2 percent
                                 yoy in 2016, just above the upper limit of the BI target range (4 percent +/- 1

                       albeit less so than in previous quarters. Despite this, however, continuing import
                       compression supported the return to a positive goods trade balance of USD 1.6

                       debt amortizations was supported by solid capital inflows, with strong inbound

Commodity exports      Goods export growth remained negative at -0.4 percent yoy in Q3 2014, compared
remained weak and,     with -1.6 yoy in Q2. Performance across individual commodities was mixed but, at
while manufacturing    an aggregate level, commodities remained a drag on export growth, contributing -
exports have picked    5.5 percentage points to the drop in goods exports. Rubber and coal exports
up, their momentum     declined significantly on account of both lower prices and volumes. Exports of
is flagging            nickel and copper were very low due to weak volumes related to the raw mineral
                       export ban introduced in January 2014. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude palm
                       oil (CPO) exports grew, the latter driven by strong demand from India (Figure 9). In
                       contrast, non-commodity exports contributed 5.0 percentage points to year-on-year
                       goods export growth, offsetting in part the weakness in commodities. Supported
                       partly by a real Rupiah depreciation, manufacturing exports have recorded positive
                       year-on-year growth in 2014 (Figure 10). However, there are signs that the growth
                       momentum of manufactured exports has flagged in recent months.

Box 1: A Financial Conditions Index for Indonesia points to a tightening since Q3 2013
Accurate and timely monitoring and assessment of financial conditions is an important input to the conduct of sound
macroeconomic policy. A Financial Conditions Index (FCI), estimated using a broad range of variables, is one method
to provide a more comprehensive view of aggregate financial conditions than looking individually across a range of
indicators. According to FCI estimates for Indonesia, financial conditions were broadly neutral in 2013 and have
tightened considerably since the emerging market asset sell-off of 2013 and subsequent policy response of BI.
The FCI outlined in this box is estimated by vector autoregression, as in Osorio et al. (2011)1, using the following
variables: real GDP growth, Bank Indonesia’s policy rate (BI rate), the weighted-average bank lending rate, credit
growth, the Jakarta Composite Index (JCI), the real effective exchange rate (REER), and Indonesia’s sovereign spread
as measured by the JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index Global (EMBIG). The FCI index is calculated as a
weighted sum of standardized financial variables (where the individual weights are derived from the estimated four-
quarter cumulative impact of each variable on real GDP growth). The estimated weights are: BI rate -0.11, bank lending
rate -0.31, credit growth 0.0004, JCI 0.31, REER 0.0016 and EMBIG 0.0007.
A zero value of the FCI indicates neutral financial conditions, whereas positive and negative values mean loose and tight
conditions, respectively. The negative weights show that increases in the BI and bank lending rates are associated with
tighter financial conditions. In contrast, increases in credit growth, the JCI and the EMBIG spread are associated with
better availability of domestic or foreign funding and hence looser conditions. A REER depreciation is associated with
tighter conditions, consistent with the impact of higher external debt servicing costs or balance sheet effects (i.e. access
to foreign borrowing is more difficult when the currency depreciates, because the external debt leverage increases).
Since mid-2013, there has been a tightening of financial conditions (Figure 14), driven primarily by increases in domestic
lending rates and falls in the JCI. These followed the announcement of a possible reduction in asset purchases by the
US Federal Reserve, and the tightening in Indonesian monetary policy. The BI rate was raised by 100 basis points
between July 2013 and September 2014, with bank lending rates up an average of 91 basis points in the same period.
Credit growth also fell from 22.4 to 13.5 percent yoy between July 2013 and August 2014 and the REER depreciated by
16.4 percent in H2 2013. Taking into account the latest data, the FCI shows somewhat less tight financial conditions in
Q3 2014 relative to Q2, mostly due to a better performance of the JCI and an appreciation in the REER.
The tighter financial conditions in Indonesia observed over the past year have been associated with a moderation in
GDP growth. The positive relationship between the FCI and GDP growth is evident in previous years as well (Figure
15). Overall, the FCI appears to be a reasonably good leading indicator of real year-on-year GDP growth.

                       (10.2 percent yoy) than in 2013 (8.3 percent), but still significantly below the growth
                       in 2011 and 2012 (an average of 24.4 percent).

taxes                  VAT refunds in the first ten months of 2014 was 38.0 percent higher than in the
                       corresponding period last year. Excise tax performance may have been impacted by
                       the introduction of a new regional tax of 10 percent on the excise value of certain

revenues               (under Article 21 of the 1983 Income Tax Law)9 has picked up this year, after
                       declining in 2013 mainly on account of an increase in the non-taxable PIT threshold
                       in January 2013. On the other hand, corporate income tax (CIT) collection (Article
                       25/29) has declined, likely as a result of lower commodity prices, but also due to the
                       impact of the implementation of the partial mineral export ban in January 2014.10
                       Freeport, Indonesia’s largest copper producer and one of the largest CIT payers,

                       performance of CIT since 2013 was the implementation from July 1, 2013, of a final
                       tax of 1 percent on annual gross turnover, rather than paying CIT (or VAT), for
                       enterprises with gross turnover of not more than IDR 4.8 billion.12

Box 2: The latest increase in subsidized fuel prices is expected to yield significant fiscal savings in 2015 and
beyond
On November 17, 2014, President Joko Widodo announced an increase in subsidized fuel prices of IDR 2,000 per liter
to IDR 8,500 for gasoline (a 31 percent rise) and IDR 7,500 for diesel (a 36 percent rise) (Figure 18). This is a positive
step which will help to provide some relief to fiscal pressures in 2014 and, more significantly, provide additional fiscal
space for higher spending on development priorities in 2015 and beyond (Figure 19). The impact on poor and
vulnerable households is being cushioned through regular social assistance programs and temporary cash transfers (see
Section 7). The fuel price increase follows on from the increases in electricity tariffs for higher-end customer groups
through 2014 and other measures to restrain expenditures that were introduced in the first half of the year, including
efficiency measures such as a nearly IDR 50 trillion material expenditure cut introduced as part of the revised Budget
2014 (see the July 2014 IEQ).
The World Bank estimates that the projected savings, relative to a baseline of no price adjustment, from the fuel price
increase amount to more than IDR 100 trillion in 2015, or close to IDR 650 trillion cumulatively until 2019. According
to media reports, the Government intends to allocate 60 percent of the fiscal savings to infrastructure projects in the
revised 2015 Budget, but discussions within the new administration are still ongoing.1 Effective use of this additional
fiscal headroom to begin closing the infrastructure gap during the upcoming Budget year will require rapid and
improved planning and implementation.
However, a continuation of the approach of one-off price adjustments leaves sizeable fiscal risks for the budget due to
changes in the macroeconomic environment. For example, the 33 percent subsidized fuel price increase in June 2013
was projected to produce significant fiscal savings but they were quickly wiped out by the Rupiah depreciation.
Therefore, as highlighted by the Minister of Finance, it will be important to build on the recent price adjustment, taking
advantage of current low oil prices, and move towards a rules-based pricing mechanism to lock in the fiscal savings
going forward.2 Such alternative pricing mechanisms have been implemented by Indonesia in the past and by other
countries (e.g. Malaysia3).

The 2015 Budget,         The 2015 Budget, which was formulated and deliberated under the previous
which was approved       administration and parliament, was approved in late September 2014. The approved
in late September        budget projected a fiscal deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2015, slightly lower than
2014, is expected to     the projected deficit of 2.4 percent in 2014. However, the approved budget can be
be revised during the    viewed as a “placeholder budget”, since it does not reflect such priorities of the new
first quarter of 2015    government as infrastructure for food security and maritime and social protection,
                         and was approved prior to the fuel price adjustment. Moreover, the assumptions
                         used in the approved Budget were also relatively optimistic (e.g. GDP was assumed
                         to grow by 5.8 percent and inflation was projected to average 4.4 percent yoy), and
                         requires adjustments to align better with recent economic developments. The
                         approved Budget is therefore expected to be revised during the first quarter of 2015.
                         An important aspect of this revision will be the redirecting of part of the fiscal
                         savings from the subsidized fuel price increase to priority sectors such as
                         infrastructure, health, and social protection, including compensation measures, and
                         the use of the remainder of the fiscal savings to reduce the 2015 fiscal deficit.

The government’s         In terms of financing needs, by early November the government had met its 2014
2014 securities          securities issuance target of IDR 428.1 trillion. Under the current 2015 Budget,
financing plan was       gross securities financing is planned to remain broadly stable next year (at IDR 431
met in November          trillion). In addition, to reduce interest expenses, the government plans to shorten
                         the average maturity of its bonds to 8-9 years from the current 9.9 years.13 In
                         anticipation of higher US Dollar interest costs in 2015 and a risk of lower emerging
                         market capital flows, the government plans to further diversify the issuance of
                         foreign debt, including considering 5-10 year maturities.

The World Bank           The World Bank has revised down its projected fiscal deficit for 2014 from 2.8
projects a fiscal        percent of GDP (July 2014 IEQ) to 2.3 percent (Table 5), in order to take into
deficit of 2.3 percent   account recent macroeconomic trends (notably the recent substantial fall in oil
in 2014, and 2.0         prices), budget execution rates, the year-to-date deterioration in revenue collection,
percent of GDP in        and the above-mentioned revenue and expenditure policy changes. For 2015, the
2015                     World Bank’s projected fiscal deficit under baseline assumptions is 2.0 percent of
                         GDP (or 2.4 percent after accounting for IDR 45 trillion in fuel subsidy arrears). In
                         line with recent government announcements, these projections redirect part of the
                         fiscal savings from the subsidized fuel price increase to priority sectors such as
                         infrastructure, health, and social protection, including compensation measures. In
                         addition, the World Bank projection assumes that a part of the fiscal savings will be
                         used to reduce the 2015 fiscal deficit. The government has also signaled a strong
                         commitment to continuing to restrain consumption expenditures, including an IDR
                         16 trillion reduction in spending on meetings and trips, and more symbolic
                         measures such as not buying new ministerial cars.14




                         13 According to the Director of Debt Management at the Ministry of Finance, in 2014 the cost of servicing the
                            government debt was IDR 121.3 trillion (USD 10 billion), a 7.7 percent increase from last year. At 8.3 percent of

increases are                    measures, increases in fuel and food prices would likely negatively impact poverty.
coupled with                     However, the impact on vulnerable households is being cushioned through social
compensation                     assistance programs (“smart cards”, Kartu Indonesia Pintar, previously Bantuan Siswa
measures…                        Miskin) and temporary cash payments. 15.5 million households with family welfare

                                 400,000 each, distributed between late November and early December. One million
                                 of these households will receive it via a Bank Mandiri SIM-card pilot, with the
                                 remaining 14.5m receiving cash through the post office (PT Pos).

…and, consequently,      The official BPS poverty rate for March 2014 was 11.3 percent, with the September

in a near-term           price increases, coupled with compensation measures, indicates that the poverty rate
increase in poverty…     is unlikely to rise. For example, poverty continued to fall during the 2008-2009 fuel
                         price increase, mitigated by the Bantuan Langsung Tunai (BLT) cash assistance, and
                         essentially stayed flat during the 2013 subsidized fuel price increase due to the
                         Bantuan Langsung Sementara Masyarakat (BLSM) benefits (see the December 2013
                         IEQ). The value and ultimate poverty impact of the new temporary cash support
                         will depend in part on how far into next year it continues, which has yet to be

                         poverty reduction is expected to continue to happen slowly. The baseline poverty
                         trend for March 2015 to 2017, abstracting from the recent fuel price increase, is for
                         declines in poverty to remain below one percentage point per year, as has been the
                         case since 2010. Consequently, poverty is projected to remain above 8.0 percent by
                         2018.

Box 3: Minimum wage increases for 2015: relatively moderate, but still a source of labor market uncertainty
In recent years, minimum wage increases have posed upside risks to inflation in Indonesia, having increased extremely
rapidly in some provinces. For example, between 2012 and 2013, minimum wages increased by 48.9 percent in East
Kalimantan, by 43.9 percent in Jakarta and by 40.3 percent in Gorontalo. However, with the bulk of minimum wage
increases for 2015 now having been agreed, the pace of increase has slowed. Minimum wages have been determined in
29 of 33 provinces, with increases ranging between 7.4 percent and 28 percent, and a simple (unweighted) average
increase of 14.5 percent (compared with higher, 16.6 percent and 18.3 percent simple average increases for the prior two
years). The minimum wage in the District of Jakarta has reached IDR 2.7 million per month, the highest in the country
(Figure 21) and up by 10.6 percent from 2014.

While the increases for 2015 are still sizable and will contribute to cost-push price pressures, they are not so large that
they are expected on their own to pose a major upside risk to inflation. However, the current decentralized system for
setting minimum wages does continue to generate significant uncertainties for both workers and employers about the
level of adjustment that can be expected from year to year. This effect is felt throughout the labor market, because
minimum wages are linked to general wage-setting. There thus continues to be a need to consider how to provide real
protection for workers, without pushing up labor costs relative to productivity, and generating uncertainty, that may
compromise needed investment in labor-intensive industries and the pace of quality job creation in Indonesia.

                         prices may provide a stronger than expected boost to economic activity in oil-

                       improving revenue performance.

between actual and     2013) (Figure 22). This is not due to lower tax potential. By one estimate, Indonesia
potential revenue      is collecting less than 50 percent of its total potential tax revenue, underperforming
                       its peers (Figure 23).16 The IMF has estimated that Indonesia could increase taxes

                       between 13.4 and 16.4 percent of GDP.17

Since dropping                  Between 2002 and 2008, the growth in Indonesia’s fiscal revenues kept pace with

Indonesia’s revenue             especially for oil, surged. As the global financial crisis unfolded, Indonesia’s growth

declining since 2011            2011, both nominal GDP and revenue growth have slowed; however, the latter
                                slowed disproportionately, leading to a renewed decline in the revenue-to-GDP

income taxes and oil    (CIT)—accounted for 29 percent. Oil-and gas-related revenues accounted for 20

to a notable decline    23 percent for 2010-2011 yoy to 8.5 percent in 2012 and 1.1 percent in 2013. Oil

and gas…                2007, declined from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2011 to 3.2 percent in 2013. The decline
                        reflects a combination of a longer-term structural decline in oil and gas production
                        (see Box 4 for details) with a broader weakening in commodity prices since 2011.

…and slowing            Indonesia’s weighted average export commodity price index decreased by
revenues from other     approximately 30 percent over 2011-2014 —a significant, negative terms of trade

international           and 4.4 percent yoy in 2013. Export taxes as a share of GDP fell from 0.4 percent in
commodity prices        2011 to 0.2 percent in 2013. The indirect impact on revenues of the weaker
since 2011…             commodity prices has been through slower nominal GDP growth, which in turn has
                        reduced non-oil-and-gas income tax growth, from an average of 15.8 percent for
                        2010-2011 yoy to 6.6 percent in 2012 and 9.5 percent in 2013. CIT was particularly
                        impacted (growth reduced from 17.5 percent in 2011 yoy to 0.6 percent in 2012 and
                        2.8 percent in 2013). The volatility of commodity-related revenues highlights why
                        broadening and diversifying the revenue base is a priority.

Recent tax policy       Alongside oil and gas sector challenges and macroeconomic factors, recent policy
and administration      and administration changes are likely to have influenced revenue performance.
changes may have        There have been policy changes in CIT (a progressive tax schedule was replaced
also played a role in   with a flat tax rate of 30 percent in 2009, which was reduced to 25 percent in 2010),
the recent revenue      PIT (the top marginal tax rate was reduced and non-taxable income threshold
performance             increased in 2009 and 2013) and in LST (the tax rate was increased in 2009). Several
                        tax administration changes have also been made, including VAT e-filing and the
                        start of the National Tax Census in 2011. The theoretical effect on revenues across
                        these measures is ambiguous, and empirically estimating their impacts is challenging.
                        Because of this and the complex interactions between macroeconomic factors, tax
                        policy and tax administration, further analysis is required to assess the relative
                        contributions of these different factors on revenue performance.

                        18   Some PIT is derived from oil- and gas-related earnings, but the split is not available and so total PIT is treated as
                             non-oil and gas-related, thereby understating the overall share of oil- and gas-related revenues.

                    b. Medium-term revenue outlook under a “no major reform” scenario

In the medium-term,      Looking ahead to the next National Medium Term Development Plan (Rencana
assuming similar         Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional, RPJMN) period, 2015-2019, what is the
macroeconomic            revenue outlook and total resource envelope (revenue plus deficit financing, within
conditions and           the fiscal rule) for spending? To examine this question, a medium-term revenue
structural declines in   outlook was developed by first projecting the revenue base of different revenue
oil and gas              streams under baseline assumptions of moderate nominal GDP growth, slight
production…              nominal exchange rate depreciation, a continuing moderation in oil, gas and other
                         commodity prices, and ongoing structural decline in oil and gas production.19
                         Empirically-estimated elasticities of revenue streams with respect to their revenue
                         base were then applied to project revenue collection over the period 2015-2019.
                         Under a “no major reform” scenario, where there are no significant tax policy and
                         tax administration reforms that would increase effective tax rates, the revenue
                         projections assumed no changes in tax elasticities over the medium term.

                         and non-tax revenue. The fall in oil and gas revenues is due to the projected decline
                         of their revenue bases - the gross production values of oil and gas (see Box 4).

                         Should this scenario transpire, weak revenue performance would thus reduce the
                         size of the resource envelope during the next RPJMN period and constrain severely
                         the fiscal space for spending on the development priorities of the new
                         administration. Consequently, a renewed, intensified effort to increase revenue
                         collection through improvements in tax policy and compliance will be critical.

                           c. Opportunities to lift revenues through policy and administrative reforms

 Reforms to enhance              There is no single “magic bullet” reform that will significantly and sustainably
 policy and improve              increase revenue collection; instead, enhancing policy and improving administration
 administration                  across multiple revenue streams is required. A necessary condition for lifting
 across multiple                 revenues—a clear government commitment to do so—is already in place. The new
 revenue streams are             government has indicated that increasing revenues will be a priority, with President
 needed if ambitious             Widodo pledging to lift the tax-to-GDP ratio to 16 percent by 2019. The remainder
 revenue targets are             of this section briefly discusses potential revenue-enhancing opportunities, drawing
 to be realized                  on international and domestic experience and existing and ongoing analyses. While
                                 the focus is on revenue mobilization, it is important to note that revenue policy and
                                 administration have a large impact on the business climate, influencing investment,
                                 production and ultimately the growth of revenue bases. Sustained improved revenue
                                 performance thus requires reforms that not only mobilize revenues but also
                                 improve efficiency in tax administration and reduce compliance costs.
 Tax policy reforms              Changes to the current tax policy design could increase revenues from income taxes
 could mobilize                  (CIT, PIT), consumption taxes (VAT, luxury sales tax and excise tax) and land and
 additional revenues             building tax in the following ways: 1) broadening the tax bases by reducing
 across several taxes            exemptions and other loopholes; 2) simplifying complicated tax structures and
 as well as reduce               rationalizing the number of tax types, brackets and tax rates; and 3) selectively
 economic distortions            increasing tax rates that are particularly low by international standards. For example,
 and lower                       as in other countries, instead of multiple CIT rates for larger (non-SME) firms, a
 administration costs            single corporate income tax rate could be applied. In another example, changing
                                 from an ad valorem (i.e. percentage on value) to a specific (i.e. fixed Rupiah
                                 amount) tax on motor vehicles would simplify administration and likely increase
                                 compliance. These types of reforms not only raise more revenues, but potentially
                                 reduce economic distortions from exempting certain taxpayers and sectors, reduce
                                 strategic behavior by taxpayers to avoid higher tax rates, and lower administration
                                 costs. Indeed, the interaction between revenue policy and administration is an

                        versus more than 98 percent in other countries). The January 2014 increase in the
                        VAT threshold from IDR 600 million to IDR 4.8 billion has reduced the number of
                        VAT taxpayers (from 385,000 to around 50,000), which should facilitate better

of GDP from 2002 to 2012. Rising oil prices along with a                calculations and projections
depreciating Rupiah offset a decline in lifting but this was
outweighed by a five-fold increase in nominal GDP. As Figure 27 highlights, oil and gas prices rose considerably in this period,
increasing nearly five-fold for oil (from USD 24 in 2002 to USD 120 per barrel in 2012) and four-fold for gas. However, oil lifting
has declined by 30 percent, from 1.26 million barrels in 2002 to 861,000 barrels per day in 2012. Gas production has increased
marginally by 2 percent over the period, reaching 6.95 trillion British Thermal Units (BTU) per day in 2012.

The decline in oil lifting, which is the result of maturing fields and a slowdown in exploration for new fields, is set to continue in the
medium term (Figure 27). The majority of Indonesia’s oil fields are maturing and require expensive enhanced recovery methods to
continue production, which is reflected in the 350 percent increase in operational expenses for oil and gas producers in Indonesia,
from USD 4 billion in 2002 to USD 13.7 billion in 2012, despite declining lifting. At the same time, oil and gas exploration spending
in Indonesia has decreased by 50 percent from the 1998 peak to 2012, even as new exploration is increasingly taking place off-shore
and more expensive.2 Assuming that the lead time from exploration to discovery and production from new fields is at least 5 years,
even if there are new discoveries in the near future, they are unlikely to offset the decline in lifting from existing fields in the medium
term. Therefore, the baseline projection adopted in this section is for a continued decline in oil lifting by 18 percent from 818,000
barrels per day in 2014 to 670,000 barrels per day in 2019.

Gas production has remained steady over the past decade in Indonesia, but the medium term picture is uncertain on account of the
production outlook from major gas blocks. Gas exploration activity has been strong with a ten-fold increase in the number of gas
wells completed from 2002 to 2012; this implies a more positive medium-term outlook for gas production. However, investment in
existing major gas blocks is currently stalled due to regulatory uncertainty over PSCs.3 This is incorporated in a projected decline in
gas production by 12 percent from 2014 to 2019.

In the past two years, oil prices (Indonesia crude price) have declined from a monthly peak of USD 122 per barrel in February 2012,
falling precipitously over September-December 2014 to USD 76 per barrel in November 2014. Indonesian gas prices, which are
driven by Japanese liquid natural gas (LNG) prices, closely track oil prices as contracts for sales are often indexed and have also
declined in this period. This decline in oil prices has been driven by the increase in global supply from unconventional oil sources in
North America and a moderating of demand, especially in the OECD countries.4 The baseline medium-term outlook for the oil price
is around USD 85 per barrel and for the gas price is USD 11-12 per million BTU; however, this outlook is subject to uncertainty on
account of possible disruption of supply in the Middle East, moderation in global demand for oil, and supply responses by producers.

Note: 1 There are five generations of PSCs in Indonesia, which pioneered the concept in 1965, with the latest generation of PSC contracts
enacted post 2001. A simplified illustration of a Production Sharing Contract is that the gross value of production is split into: share of
equity for the contractor, share of equity for government and reimbursement of specified costs to producers (cost recovery). The
contractor is further required to pay taxes on profits generated from its share of equity. 2 Figures for operational and exploration and
production spending from SKK Migas Annual Reports (various years) and see PwC Oil and Gas Guide, 2012, for a discussion on location
of new exploration. 3 The major block for which these concerns are salient is the Mahakam natural gas project, which accounted for
approximately 30 percent of Indonesia’s gas production in 2010. 4 For more details on global energy price projections and their drivers see

                        center of the economic agenda.20 The 1997/98 Asian financial crisis provided
                        further impetus to this agenda, with a larger regional market seen as important in

The achievements of         Although not widely appreciated, ASEAN’s regional integration agenda has already
ASEAN’s regional            made significant achievements, particularly with respect to gains from freer trade in
integration agenda          goods. The recent joint ASEAN Secretariat and World Bank ASEAN Integration

key areas…                  integration; (ii) lowering trade costs; (iii) contribution to service sector development
                            and trade; (iv) helping to attract FDI, both from outside and inside the region; and
                            (v) helping to stimulate reform in lower-income ASEAN economies.24

…including in the      First, ASEAN has achieved a significant degree of trade integration and,
extent, and nature, of importantly, this integration has been trade-creating (i.e. increasing trade with lower
trade integration…     cost partners) and not trade-diverting (reducing trade with lower cost partners). This
                       has happened because, while ASEAN economies have made significant progress in
                       almost eliminating tariffs on trade within the region (to less than 1 percent on
                       average), they have also reduced tariffs on trade with other countries. Further, as
                       intra-ASEAN trade expanded, trade with the rest of the world also increased
                       proportionately (Figure 28).

                    ASEAN trade costs have fallen more quickly (Figure 29), partly as a result of the

Added impetus to          The AEC agenda has also contributed to service sector development and trade by
services                  providing a push for services trade liberalization commitments that go beyond

                          suggest that Indonesia will enjoy access to a far larger market for its goods and for

                          half of this growth in Indonesia. Data do not support concerns that Indonesia will
                          be flooded by skilled workers from other ASEAN members. For example, in 2007
                          Singapore and Malaysia received more skilled workers from Indonesia than vice
                          versa—almost 11,000 Indonesian skilled workers migrated to Singapore and about
                          6,500 to Malaysia, while only about 100 Singaporeans and fewer than 400 Malaysians
                          went to Indonesia.27 A more pressing concern for Indonesia than inward migration
                          is likely to be how to absorb its own large skilled and unskilled labor force.

lowering of                  lowering trade costs. In general, trade costs in ASEAN are high as measured by

                             respectively, are much lower than the levels seen in most ASEAN economies.
                             Indonesia, it would appear, has considerable scope to reduce its relatively high

                      FDI in services is associated statistically with improvements in the perceived

Several specific steps   There are specific steps that the government can take to enhance the capacity of the

in order to better       Many of these steps are required in any case to strengthen domestic economic
prepare the              performance more generally, and are in line with the government’s development
Indonesian economy       agenda. Key areas include addressing infrastructure and skills gaps, enhancing
for AEC                  financial development, and introducing regulatory reforms to lower costs for firms.
                         For example, infrastructure investment in Indonesia (at under 4 percent of GDP), is
                         among the lowest in the region, and energy and freight logistics have emerged as
                         particular bottlenecks. In the key regulatory areas such as obtaining construction
                         permits, paying taxes, and enforcing contracts, firms in Indonesia are subject to
                         much longer delays, cumbersome procedures and higher costs.35

The government can       A recent study of firms across the region suggests that nearly 80 percent of firms are
support Indonesian       optimistic about their prospects under AEC. Indonesian firms are less optimistic:
firms’ preparations      only 45 percent of those surveyed think that ASEAN integration provides an
for integration…         opportunity, while 9 percent think it is a serious threat.36 However, some large
                         Indonesian firms are well positioned. For instance, 9 Indonesian firms have been
                         identified among the 50 firms in the region with annual sales over USD 500 million.
                         An example is Indonesia’s packaged-food company Mayora, which operates in all
                         ten ASEAN countries. In general, firms face the challenge of greater competition,
                         and also the opportunity to sell their products in a larger market and become more
                         competitive by using intermediate goods and services, including finance, investment,
                         skilled labor and technology, from other ASEAN member countries. One challenge
                         will be to prepare small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for the impending
                         competition. Government can play a proactive role in helping firms prepare, as in
                         Singapore and Malaysia where, for example, SMEs receive support for showcasing
                         their products in foreign markets.

…roll back NTMs…         While ASEAN has made remarkable progress in reducing tariffs, the increasing use
                         of NTMs by some ASEAN economies, including Indonesia, threatens to reverse
                         progress in trade integration. To roll back trade-restrictive measures introduced in
                         the past few years, a number of technical steps can be taken, such as (i) improving

                         34Indonesia’s NTMs cover 3,714 out of 8,750 tariff lines at 9-digit HS level, or 42 percent of Indonesia’s tariff lines.

Indonesia has           Indonesians have become healthier over the past decade. Life expectancy at birth

number of health        mortality rate declined from 48 per 1,000 live births in 2002 to 31 in 2012; at current
indicators over the     trends, Indonesia is projected to meet the child-health related Millennium
past decade…            Development Goal (MDG) of an under-five mortality rate of 28 per 1,000 by 2015.

income country…                decline will not be sufficient for the country to attain the MDG MMR target of 108
                               by 2015. In addition, Indonesia’s MMR is one of the highest in the region and is
                               high relative to the country’s income and health expenditures per capita (Table 7).
                               Indonesian children under-five suffer from high rates of malnutrition, with

                         around 2015 (Figure 34). Although the overall trend is towards a rise in NCDs, the
                         burden from some CDs such as HIV is also rising: Indonesia is one of nine

                        comprises three key

                        (who is covered, or “breadth”), service coverage (what is covered, or “depth”), and cost
                        coverage (how much is covered, or “height”) (Figure 35)—in order to ensure that
                        adequate health services are supplied, are of sufficient quality to be effective, and are
                        physically accessible and financially affordable to all.44

Despite attempts to     The key challenges in expanding coverage are: (i) to ensure the poorest 40 percent

                        is declining, recent estimates indicate that this remains a significant issue: almost 20

                             coverage - developing the health financing system”, Geneva. It is important to note that the three dimensions of
                             UHC (“depth”, “breadth” and “height”) are neither independent nor mutually exclusive: ensuring depth of
                             coverage has implications for the breadth and height of UHC as well. Universal availability of the benefit package
                             for all—not just those who are well-off and live in urban areas—is a key aspect of ensuring that UHC is not a
                             hypothetical aspiration but a realized policy designed to enhance health and improve social protection. In
                             addition, high OOP payments—i.e. a low height of UHC—are often a result of poor depth of coverage if
                             patients have to pay OOP for drugs or seek care elsewhere in private facilities that are outside the network.

                         c. Universal health coverage requires adequate health services
Access to health              Access to health facilities has improved substantially over the past decade.46 The
facilities has                number of hospitals almost doubled between 2004 and 2013, and the number of
improved but                  public health clinics (Pusat Kesehatan Masyarakat, commonly abbreviated to
remains a serious             “Puskesmas”) increased by almost 30 percent during the same period, resulting in
challenge in some             an increase in inpatient beds per capita from 7.0 to 12.6 per 10,000 people (Figure
regions                       36 and Figure 37). However, Indonesia’s bed density ratio remains far below
                              WHO’s recommendation of 25 per 10,000, and there is a four-fold difference in the
                              bed density ratio across provinces. Although the median distance to a health facility
                              in Indonesia was only 5 km in 2011, in provinces such as West Papua, Papua, and
                              Maluku the median distance was over 30 km (Figure 38). Over 40 percent of people
                              in West Sulawesi, Maluku, and West Kalimantan took more than one hour to reach
                              a public hospital, compared to 18 percent nationally. Only 2 percent of the
                              population took more than one hour to reach a Puskesmas, but the proportion is
                              much higher in Papua (28 percent), East Nusa Tenggara (11 percent), and West
                              Kalimantan (11 percent). Outpatient and inpatient utilization rates have risen
                              steadily, especially among the bottom 40 percent of the population. However,
                              utilization rates still remain very low by global standards and there remain huge
                              disparities across provinces: Indonesia’s inpatient utilization rate of 1.9 percent was
                              less than one-fifth of WHO’s proposed benchmark of 10 discharges per 100 people
                              and there was a five-fold difference in this rate across provinces.

Table 8: Facility-level data highlights deficiencies, and regional variation, in provision of key health services
 Key services         Examples of level of service provision

 Family               Forty-two percent of Puskesmas lacked one staff member trained in the previous two years in family
 Planning             planning services, and 38 percent lacked family planning guidelines available at the facility. About 60 percent
                      of private clinics lacked combined oral contraceptive pills and about 35 percent lacked injectable
                      contraceptives.

 Antenatal Care       In North Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua, less than 60 percent of Puskesmas were able to diagnose anemia
                      with hemoglobin testing, while urine tests were almost completely unavailable in Gorontolo, North Sulawesi,
                      and Maluku. Only 14 percent of the 30 private hospitals surveyed, and 15 percent of private clinics, were
                      able to conduct hemoglobin or urine tests. This largely explains why only 25 percent of public hospitals, and
                      none of the 30 private hospitals surveyed maintained all eight antenatal care tracer items.

 Basic Obstetric      Only 62 percent of Puskesmas mandated to provide basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care
 Care                 (Pelayanan Obstetri Neonatal Emergensi Dasar, or PONED) had at least one staff trained in this area in the
                      previous two years, only slightly higher than in non-PONED Puskesmas (50 percent). Only 39 percent of
                      public hospitals, and 3 percent of the 30 private hospitals surveyed, maintained all 23 basic obstetric care
                      tracer items.

 Routine              More than 20 percent of Puskesmas in Papua, West Papua, and Maluku reported that they did not have
 Childhood            measles, DPT, polio, and BCG vaccines, while only about a quarter of private facilities, and less than 10
 Immunization.        percent of those in eastern provinces, reported availability of these vaccines.
 Malaria              Antimalarial medicine was not available in 38 percent of Puskesmas and malaria blood tests were not
                      available in 29 percent of Puskesmas in the 10 provinces with the highest malaria prevalence rates.

 Tuberculosis         35 percent of Puskesmas did not have staff trained in TB management, and 27 percent did not have the
 (TB)                 capacity to diagnose TB from sputum samples, while crucial first-line treatment was not widely available
                      either in Puskesmas or public hospitals.

 Diabetes             Only 66 percent of public hospitals, and 27 percent of the 30 private hospitals surveyed, maintained all
                      seven diabetes tracer items. Only 54 percent of all Puskesmas reported the ability to test for blood glucose—
                      a crucial aspect in the management of diabetes—and only 47 percent reported the ability to test urine, with
                      availability of each test well below 20 percent in six eastern provinces (Figure 40).

 Basic Surgery        Very low availability was evidenced for provision of many key basic surgery items, including nasogastric
                      tubes (16 percent), guidelines (21 percent), trained staff (29 percent), adult and pediatric resuscitators (47
                      percent), oxygen (53 percent), and scalpel handle with blade (56 percent). Only 53 percent of public
                      hospitals, and 60 percent of the 30 private hospitals surveyed, maintained all 12 basic surgery tracer items.

 Blood                Only 20 percent of all public hospitals, and none of the 30 private hospitals surveyed, maintained all six
 Transfusion          blood transfusion tracer items. Only DI Yogyakarta (47 percent) and West Sumatra (41 percent) had more
                      than 40 percent of public hospitals with all items, whereas eight provinces had less than 10 percent of public
                      hospitals with all items. Blood typing capacity was largely unavailable in private hospitals (11 percent).
                      Hospitals scored very low on sufficient blood supply (public, 41 percent; private, 13 percent) and blood
                      supply safety (public, 44 percent; private 37 percent).

 Comprehensive        Only 18 percent of all public hospitals, and 33 percent of the 30 private hospitals surveyed, maintained all
 Surgery              nine comprehensive surgery tracer items. Only Bali (62 percent), DKI Jakarta (47 percent), and Banten (44
                      percent) had more than 40 percent of public hospitals with all items. In contrast, a large majority of provinces
                      (25 out of 33, or 76 percent) had less than 30 percent of public hospitals with all items, including eight
                      provinces with zero hospitals reaching this target.

                       largely skewed towards the provinces in Java. There are significant shortages in key
                       health worker positions at public hospitals and Puskesmas, where the shortage of

                       57 percent for adult curative care responded as expected when presented with

                                                       Districts that under-perform could be supported, provided that the problem is a
                                                       weak capacity to deliver. If needed, the central government could consider taking
                                                       over the service temporarily, as it has been done successfully in countries like
                                                       Colombia. Subsequent transfers can also be linked to progress in closing gaps.

Good quality data        The success of the proposed schemes relies heavily on the ability to collect regular
collection is crucial    and relevant facility-level data (in a sample of facilities representative at the district
                         level, including private facilities) and ensure that data collected reflect national
                         guidelines and norms. This would help to shed light not just on where the
                         deficiencies lie but also why they exist. Such data collection efforts would be
                         independent and, ideally, separate from routine administrative data monitoring,
                         which is also crucial. If possible, data would also be collected from a sample of
                         beneficiaries to ensure that service provision is occurring as intended and that
                         patients are receiving the care they are entitled to. There are other dimensions of
                         service delivery—including the ability and effort of providers—that capture higher
                         dimensions of provision of care that could also be assessed and improved
                         systematically and regularly. These could include efforts to ensure that the basic
                         equipment in facilities is not just available but also properly calibrated and utilized,
                         and assessments made of whether or not health workers have the necessary skills
                         and motivation to provide high-quality services.

UHC needs to be          In some cases, the issue is likely not one of additional resources but more to do with
better socialized        greater knowledge of, and ongoing preparations for, UHC among local
among local              governments, beneficiaries and providers. The government could ensure that clear
governments,             supply-side implications are specified based on the JKN benefits package, and that
beneficiaries and        this information is effectively disseminated and fed into operational priorities. This
providers                would cover the equipment, training, diagnostic capabilities, and medicines to be
                         provided at different levels of care. It would also specify accountabilities for this
                         provision and finance appropriate referrals as needed. In this regard, BPJS could
                         consider implementing a regular and independent accreditation process for public
                         and private facilities.

Ensuring adequate        Universal Health Coverage by 2019 in Indonesia would represent one of the world’s
health services is       great health sector achievements. In order to realize this goal and support continued
pivotal to the success   improvements in health outcomes, there needs to be a focus not just on increasing
of UHC in Indonesia      access (breadth) and end-user affordability (height) to health services, but also on
                         ensuring that effective depth of coverage exists, especially in the eastern regions of
                         Indonesia and at the primary care level. Responding to this challenge, and as part of
                         JKN, the government is working to strengthen the supply side, including building
                         the capacity of primary care by setting standards of services and increasing the
                         ability of primary care providers to manage one hundred and fifty-five priority
                         diseases at the primary level. For the comprehensive JKN health benefits package to
                         translate into real improvements in health outcomes for all Indonesians, there needs
                         to be a continued strong focus in years ahead on ensuring that facilities are ready to
                         provide key health services. Without that, UHC could become an empty promise.
