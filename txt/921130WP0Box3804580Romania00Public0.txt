THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        Pursuant to Order No. 839/2009 issued by the Ministry of Regional
        Development and Housing (“Order 839”), approving the
        Methodological Norms to the Construction Law, the following urban
        planning documents are required:
        • The general urban plan (PUG) and the related local regulation
        • The (zone) urban plan (PUZ) and the related local regulation
        • The detailed urban plan (PUD)

        The urban planning certificate provides information on the ownership,
        the public utility service availability, the location within (intravilan) and
        outside (extravilan) the city limits, the urban planning requirements, the
        land use at the time, the allowed uses, and so forth.

        From a technical point of view, the certificate shows the percentage of
        land occupation, the coefficient of land use, the minimum and
   1    maximum dimensions of the plots, the allowed built-up area, utilities,          30 days          RON 17
        and access, necessary parking, alignment of the land and buildings with
        the adjacent streets, and the maximum and minimum construction
        height allowed.

        This certificate does not grant the right to build. Its validity period
        varies but cannot exceed 12 months. Construction must start during
        that 12-month period.

        The urban planning certificate enumerates all the necessary project
        clearances applicable to the warehouse case considered here. The
        municipality has the right to decide which project clearances are
        needed.

      VAT) per cubic meter of waste (although VAT is not taken into account
      in the Doing Business case study). Additionally, for the surface of the
      land in question, a tax of RON 42.00 would also be applicable. The
      minimum of 35 cubic meters must be contracted according to the
      requirements of company.

      * Notarize statement about nonexistence of land disputes

      The company must notarize a statement (in this case, BuildCo is both
      the company and the applicant) stating that there are no disputes
      related to the land. This procedure is not a standard requirement by law
      but is often requested in practice.

7     Each notary charges a different fee, but the fee cannot exceed RON              1 day         RON 15
      30.00 (equivalent to USD 10.00), the maximum notary fee established
      by the National Notaries Union.


      Agency: Notary



      Obtain building permit

      BuildCo must apply for a building permit by submitting the following
      documents:
      • City-planning certificate
      • Property title on the land (there are no requirements as to how recent
      the title must be)
      • Technical documentation which replaced former plans for the
      authorization of construction
      • Necessary approvals, as required by the city-planning certificate
      • Environmental approval
      • Proof of payment of the legally required taxes (receipts from the tax
      authorities)
      • Legalized copy of the title to the real estate or the updated cadastral

      The building permit is issued by the City Hall. For Bucharest, the
      construction permit is issued by the General Mayor of Bucharest if the
      construction is outside the buildable area or if it exceeds a district area;
      or by the relevant district mayor if the construction is located in one of
      the six districts of Bucharest.

      The cost of the building permit is 1% of the value of the construction
      work.

      The schedule of inspections is described in the building permit. By law,
      BuildCo must pay 0.1% of the authorized value to the competent
      territorial inspectorate for construction. In addition, the investors or
      owners must pay the State Inspectorate for Construction a monthly           1 day       RON 12,259

      The examination of the building is performed in all cases through
      inspection of the building and by analyzing the documents contained

      Obtain final assessment of the construction from the Acceptance
      Commission

      BuildCo notifies the local public administration and other relevant
      authorities of the date of completion of construction so that the
      Acceptance Commission may be convened. The Acceptance
      Commission is a body made up of the construction beneficiary
      (BuildCo), officials from local public administration, and technical
      experts. It is legally required to meet and determine that the
      construction meets all applicable legal requirements.

11    The Commission must be convened within 15 days from the date of            90 days       RON 350
      completion of works. The utility connections would have been made at
      this stage. The final assessment can take several days and includes an
      on-site inspection. Within 3 working days from the end of the
      assessment, the Acceptance Commission must submit the notes and
      conclusions to the beneficiary of construction and recommend
      approval (with or without reservations), postponement, or rejection of

        According to the water and sewage authority (Apa Nova S.A.), this
        procedure takes approximately 2 -- 3 months due to a significant
        increase in demand and backlog. The associated costs were increased
        to RON 520.00 for connection fee, RON 62.00 for application fee and

        Register the building with the Real Estate Registry

        The building can be registered once it has been completed and
        approved. There are two stages of approval, and for that reason, the
        building can be registered twice. The first stage is after the Acceptance
        Commission, and the second is when the warranty period has expired,
        after the approval by the Acceptance Commission. The second approval
        applies only when the owner and the builder are different entities.
        Therefore, in the case considered here, it is assumed that only one
        registration is done.

        if the applicant pays an additional fee, the registration time will be
        reduced to 7 days. According to Order No. 39/2009 on the approval of
        fees for performing services by the National Agency for Cadastre and
        Land Registration ("Order 39"), the standard registration fee is RON 120

        The customer has to hire an electrical contractor that will do a technical
        study. The study could also be done by ENEL. The study will give the
        different technical options for the connection works. After the study is

      Obtain design of works, get design approved by ENEL and conclude
      execution contract with ENEL and await end of connection works
      carried out by electrical contractor

      The customer hires an electrical contractor (can also be the same firm as
      under procedure 2) to make the design of the connection. The design
      needs to be approved by ENEL. After the design has been approved, the
      customer goes to the municipality to pay 1% of the utility's invoice. This
      is the fee to obtain the construction permit that the customer has to
      submit for the connection works. The construction permit can be
      obtained by the electrical contractor on behalf of the customer.
      Depending on the municipality, 5-20 permits need to be obtained before
      at other agencies/stakeholders and then submitted to the municipality in
4     order to obtain the construction permit for the connection works. At        120 calendar days    USD 41,943.5
      some municipalities, a geodesic assessment has to be submitted as part
      of the application package. After the construction permit has been
      obtained, ENEL concludes a contract (execution contract) with the
      electrical contractor (that was hired by the customer) and the works start.
      At the same time, the electrical contractor makes a file about the internal
      wiring of the warehouse that confirms that the internal wiring was done
      accordingly to safety standards. The customer pays the cost for the
      connection works directly to ENEL and not to the electrical contractor
      that he hired.

      Receive final inspection of works by ENEL

      At the end of the works, ENEL comes to inspect the works. In the
      technical study (procedure 2), the whole time plan and different steps of
      the connection works are laid out. The electrical contractor has to call
5     ENEL towards the end of the works and usually ENEL comes immediately          1 calendar day        RON 0

      At the end of the works, the customer submits the internal wiring file to
      ENEL for verification. The customer has to go with a notary to ENEL to
      conclude a contract of “use of land” with ENEL. They have to meet the

        The customer concludes the supply contract with ENEL. 48 hours after
        the signature of the contract, ENEL comes to the warehouse to install the
        meter and electricity starts flowing. When the connection to the network

      the work place located at the newly acquired property. If the property is
      a working unit of the company, it has to be registered, as it is mentioned
      in the Commercial Registration Law (Law Number 26 1990). The
      registration includes, among others, environment, sanitary, fire
      protection, labor approvals from various relevant authorities, all located
      in a one-stop shop. The registration is not necessary for the transfer of
      title, but only for making it opposable to third parties and for registration
      as a place of business. The concrete use of the property as a work place
      is not required but the evidences necessary for using it as such are
      needed for obtaining the authorizations within the corporate registration
      process. Stamp tax and registration fees are lump-sum taxes and do not
      depend on the property value. The Trade Register tax and fees could be
      paid either directly to the Trade Register or through special bank                         RON 350 - RON

      accounts organized for such purposes. In summary, the total amount to                           420
      be paid for the registration of a working place is made up of several
      taxes. When the application is filed only for the establishment of the
      working place, the taxes are: • Ascertaining certificate: 30 lei •
      Registration of secondary business place: 30 lei • Registration of the
      standard-form (regarding the fulfillment of the conditions to perform
      activities): 30 lei • Liquidation fund (50% of points 1-3): 6 lei • Bulletin
      fund (10% of points 1-3): 1.5 lei • Judicial stamp duty: 39 lei •
      Commission for the judge’s mention: 60 lei • Transmission of documents
      to be published in the Official Gazette: 20 lei • Official Gazette
      commission (depends on the number of documents, for this example we
      have counted 5): 50 lei • Publication in the Official Gazette (depends on
      the number of rows in the document; only the resolution deciding the
      establishment of the working place is published): 80-150 lei •TOTAL:
      350-420 lei.

data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:

        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
