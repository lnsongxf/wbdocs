Preface

     In 2001, at the request of the ministers in charge of water affairs in the Nile countries, the World
     Bank agreed to establish the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF). It was funded by a group of international
     development partners to support the countries sharing the Nile Basin in pursuing their Shared Vision: to
     achieve sustainable socio-economic development through equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the
     common Nile Basin water resources. Over the next 12 years, the NBTF provided over US$200 million for
     30 projects implemented largely by the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) and its three centers – the NBI Secretariat
     in Entebbe, the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office in Addis Ababa, and the Nile Equatorial Lakes
     Subsidiary Action Program Coordination Unit in Kigali.

     Today, the Nile countries have advanced cooperative water resources management
     and development. The countries have transitioned from having little dialogue or collaboration on water
     resources, to an environment with active information sharing, dynamic regional institutions, and joint
     prioritization, planning, and implementation of investments. The early success of this cooperation and
     its tremendous future potential are evidenced by the pipeline of $6 billion in investments currently being
     advanced by the Nile countries.

     The progress made by the Nile countries would not have been possible without the leadership, commitment,
     and work of the Nile country governments and the NBI. Ten development partners supported these efforts
     through the NBTF, including Canada, Denmark, the European Union, France, Finland, Netherlands, Norway,
     Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the World Bank. Many of the NBTF donors also provided support
     in parallel to and in coordination with the NBTF. Other coordinating development partners included the
     African Development Bank (AfDB), Germany (through GIZ and KfW), the Global Environment Facility (GEF),
     Japan (through the World Bank’s Policy and Human Resources Development Fund), the Swiss Agency for
     Development and Cooperation, the United States, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
     Through the course of the NBTF, the Nile Program at the World Bank was led by David Grey, Barbara Miller,
     Gustavo Saltiel and Eileen Burke; under the guidance of Jeffrey Racki, Jaime Biderman, Ashok Subramanian
     and Jonathan Kamkwalala.

     The Nile Story, comprised of this report and a series of accompanying communication briefs, aims to
     capture the Nile cooperation process since the formation of the NBI – including challenges, responses,
     and achievements facilitated by the Nile Program – to commemorate the support from the NBTF at its
     closing in 2015.

    Executive Summary
    The Nile Story is one of immense challenges and remarkable achievements for the economic development
    of the region. It begins in 1999, when the ministers in charge of water affairs in the Nile countries agreed to
    form the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI). Between 2003 and 2015, the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF) supported and
    coordinated cooperative work in the region, which has been delivered mainly through the NBI. This book –
    commissioned by the World Bank on the closure of the NBTF – captures some insights to this 15 year story,
    the role of the NBI, and how its many achievements have been made along the way.

              Food shortages are already a serious issue,
         especially in downstream countries where droughts
            and flooding have been common. Without food
       security, people are unable to contribute to economic
          growth. When famines occur, for instance as has
      happened over recent years in Ethiopia and Kenya, the
    result is a depletion of natural assets (especially livestock),
     volatility in food prices, and a diversion of resources away
     from potentially productive uses. Future scenarios do not
     look set to improve. This is mostly due to climate change
    and extreme weather events, and long-term global supply/
        demand imbalances driven by increased demand for
         food, combined with scarcity of water, arable land,
             and energy. Today, most Nile Basin countries
               are net food importers, and many depend
                    on food aid during all too frequent
                           humanitarian crises.

cooperative process. This was an
historic moment, taking advantage of
a changing political landscape. There
was emerging stability across the
region, with a growing political and
economic strength of some countries
and a desire of others to demonstrate a
geo-political maturity that would enable
them to engage globally.
The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) –
launched in 1999 – has been able to
transform how the Nile countries work
together, successfully addressing
wider development constraints
and providing opportunities on an
equitable, regional level.
“Before the Nile Basin Initiative,”
recalls Dr. Callist Tindimugaya,
Uganda’s Commissioner for Water
Resources and current Nile Technical
Advisory Committee (Nile-TAC)
member, “no one would talk in
meetings because of the suspicion.
But now we can disagree without
becoming enemies. We can move
forward because we recognize
that we are different, with different
interests, so we need to try to
harmonize them.”
The NBI was launched with a shared
vision to explore opportunities for
maximizing the benefits of the river’s
waters for all the partners. Nile-COM
acknowledged the challenges faced
and lessons from past efforts, and
built on the useful foundations of
TECCONILE. For example:
 TECCONILE’s action plan was used
•
 to shape the policy guidelines of the
 NBI, which focused on enhancing
 cooperation and implementing
 technical support activities to
 generate and share information and
 knowledge, and to help countries
 prepare Nile-based development
 projects that would be regionally
 significant.
 Nile-COM decided to continue legal
•
 negotiations towards a Cooperative
 Framework Agreement (CFA) to
 formalize rights and obligations in
 relation to Nile water development
 and management. However, they
 recognized that this required a
 separate and challenging political

 dialogue, and therefore designed a
                                             inter-governmental partnership led by the Nile

  Institutionalizing the NBI Set up
  to be a transitional organization,
  the NBI is becoming something
  much more. An organization
  provides a function or services,
  but could be replaced. An
  institution is something more
  based on values, something more
  trusted, credible and sustainable,
  something that would be missed
  if it were not there. An institution
  is more attractive to investors and
  financial institutions, because it is
  likely to face less social, political,
  financial, and environmental risks.

                Entrenching the transboundary
                perspective
                Capacity building has helped NBI
                member countries become more
                aware of the impacts their own
                activities may have on neighboring
                countries, for example, building open
                recognition that downstream flooding
                and siltation problems can only be
                solved if upstream countries address
                land degradation and soil erosion.

                    Watershed management and agriculture in the Nile Basin
                    The agricultural sector in the Nile Basin countries is a major contributor to GDP,
                    employment, and food security. However, only about 36% (14 million hectares) of potential
                    agricultural land is cultivated. In addition, productivity remains low in most areas. Nearly
                    90% of agricultural land is rain-fed, which supports predominantly subsistence farming
                    and results in low yields of crops and livestock. There is real potential to address these
                    issues and increase overall productivity.
                    Currently there are only about 5.6 million hectares of land under irrigation, or equipped with
                    irrigation facilities, in the Nile Basin, and 97% of that is in Egypt and Sudan, where crop
                    productivity and water-use efficiency are high in the irrigation schemes. The huge potential
                    of the agriculture (growing and processing) sector in the Nile Basin is underdeveloped.
                    Although more food has been produced over the years, it is still not enough to provide for
                    the growing population and all countries have to import food. There is little trading between
                    Nile Basin countries as few of them generate enough to be able to trade.
                    Watershed programs normally introduce more sustainable and productive agricultural
                    methods, along with soil and water resource conservation measures, resulting in the
                    generation of large numbers of rural jobs. Watershed management therefore has significant
                    potential to improve livelihoods and reduce food insecurity by improving productivity.

                                            Tana-Beles Project
                                            The Tana-Beles Project, situated in Amhara, Ethiopia, has proved very
                                            successful. It was prepared by ENTRO and implementation began in 2011, with
                                            the aim of undertaking a pilot project to rehabilitate degraded lands through
                                            water and soil conservation. The pilot project is being implemented in the
                                            severely degraded Rib, Jema, and Gumera sub-watersheds of the Nile, which
                                            cover approximately 85,000 hectares of land. Significant time was invested in
                                            project preparation with training, workshops, and exposure visits both regionally
                                            and to other water basins in China and India.
                                            The project has a component for livelihood support, including provision of
                                            social services (e.g. health services and access to clean drinking water, which
                                            is significantly reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases within the
                                            community), and introduction of income-generating activities. In fact, the youth
                                            in the community have been so inspired by the project that they have formed an
                                            association that provides a platform to raise credit for building income-generating
                                            activities. Today, the youth are increasingly engaging in improved farming
                                            activities as they see the positive results of the project.
                                            The community is also involved in the monitoring and evaluation processes,
                                            which builds on their sense of responsibility as environmental stewards. As a
                                            result, improvements are already visible, including a reduction in erosion, and an
                                            increase in soil fertility, crop yields, and land restoration.
                                            In addition, sedimentation has been reduced. For example, monitoring at Tana-
                                            Beles has recorded a reduction of around 50% in sedimentation levels since the
                                            project started.
                                            Another success has been the introduction of a no-grazing policy on agricultural
                                            land, since grazing animals often destroy crops and soil fertility. Today, the
                                            Amhara district government has decided to repeat this in the whole province,
                                            and introduced a Community Watershed By-Law in 2014.
                                            The watershed project has been so successful that the district government has
                                            replicated it elsewhere in the province, thus benefiting thousands more farmers.

          Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (Phase II): Truly regional, highly collaborative
          This project was identified by the five East African Community (EAC) states, which requested that NELSAP
          prepare the Rwanda and Burundi component, building on earlier work in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania,
          as well as on other watershed management project preparation work being done for the Kagera sub-
          basin. Investment finance mobilization of US$40 million from the World Bank, Sweden, and the Global
          Environment Facility was done in coordination with the Lake Victoria Basin Commission and the EAC
          member states.
          Lake Victoria and its basin support a large fishing industry (for export and local consumption) and
          hydropower production, and it provides drinking and irrigation water, as well as an important navigation
          route. But these benefits have become threatened and there is:
           Deteriorating water quality – due to increased sedimentation caused by upstream activities (such as
          •
           deforestation and forest degradation), which exacerbate pollution from increasing urbanization and
           industrialization.
           Declining lake levels and river flows – due to increasing extraction of water for irrigation and hydropower.
          •
           Resurgence of water hyacinth growth – due to water quality issues. These plants obstruct waterways
          •
           and contribute to reduced water flows and lower oxygen levels in the water. This excessive growth
           consequently affects aquatic biodiversity.
           Reduced fish stocks – due to pollution, sedimentation, hyacinth growth, and high levels of fish
          •
           harvesting.
          Rwanda and Burundi are part of the upper watershed that drains into Lake Victoria through the Kagera
          River, and activities there influence the problems in the lake. The river contributes about 30% of the
          total flow into the lake, but also brings high levels of sediment from upstream soil erosion, resulting in an
          estimated two hectares additional coverage of water hyacinth every day.
          The project therefore has a strong focus on watershed management (alongside institutional capacity
          building, policy harmonization, and pollution control measures). Over 6,000 hectares of rangelands
          and wetlands are being brought under sustainable land management, hillsides are being restored for
          production and conservation, and community-driven livelihood activities that are less degrading are being
          initiated. In both Rwanda and Burundi, the project is implemented in districts within the Kagera basin,
          working closely with national land and water management programs.

Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project
“Electricity from the Rusumo Falls project will have a major
impact on the economies of Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania,
with more reliable and cheaper energy for thousands more
people.” William Katete, Regional Rusumo Falls Hydro-
Electric Project
Economic development in Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania
is constrained by very low rates of access to electricity –
4%, 13%, and 15% respectively. Sited on the border of
these countries, the Rusumo Falls hydroelectric project is a
flagship example of transboundary cooperation for economic
development.
Conceived over 30 years ago, the project was then unable
to get off the ground. This was due to a number of barriers,
such as funding challenges, political instability, conflicts
between countries, lack of security for investors, and the
lack of a mechanism to coordinate a transboundary project
of this scale.
The NBI has played a significant role in moving the Rusumo
project forward, and it is now the biggest investment being
implemented under the SAPs. By investing in power options
studies and collaborative feasibility studies, the NBI has
demonstrated how the risks related to some of the barriers
can be mitigated.
This has contributed to a level of understanding and
trust among the three countries that has enabled them to
reconsider the viability of the Rusumo concept. In 2005, they
committed to work together to develop the power plant and
sustainably manage the water catchments that supply it.
Eight years later, a US$470 million loan was secured from
investors including the World Bank, AfDB, and European
bilateral development partners. Construction of the power
plant started in early 2015.
The impacts expected are tremendous and life-changing for
many people. In the long term, the Rusumo Falls project will
generate and transmit 80MW of electricity a year, bringing
electricity to 520,000 Burundians, 467,000 Rwandese, and
159,000 Tanzanians. This reliable and cheaper electricity will
be transformative for national and local economies currently
in a position of substantial power poverty.
The social and environmental policy guidance of the NBI has
also helped minimize negative impacts at the local scale.
For example, the countries cooperatively agreed to use a
‘run-of-the-river’ design instead of a large reservoir, so that
fewer local people and less habitat area would be affected
by the development. Meaningful participation of local people
in the planning process meant that they understood and
accepted what the implementation would mean in practice,
recognizing the bigger picture and wider benefits.

For example, in the Lake Kyoga basin
in Uganda there is a high flood risk
in areas of high population densities,
with heavily planted hillsides which
exacerbate the threat of landslides.
In other areas, drought is frequent.
These problems have severe impacts
on livelihoods and poverty. NELSAP
devised a strategy to help reduce
the impacts through structural
interventions, for example, building
water storage and hillside protection
infrastructure, and catchment
management planning. The work is
ongoing through Uganda’s water
management and development
project.


   Key outcomes from disaster
   and flood resilience projects
   At least 350,000 people receive
   early warning messages that
   enable a reduction in flood-related
   devastation for over 2 million
   vulnerable people. And replication
   of ENTRO’s flood forecasting
   work by national governments is
   taking those benefits to millions
   more across the region, improving
   disaster and flood resilience.

     Civil society voices:
     The Nile Basin Discourse
     The Nile Basin Discourse (NBD) is an umbrella organization for national civil
     society organizations (CSOs). It creates a network of organizations in each
     Basin country to interact with the NBI, and to influence the program and
     project designs.
     “Nile Basin Discourse has a network. The aim is to mobilize CSOs towards
     a shared vision. We are the most organized among river basin networks
     and this provides us with a strong platform. Lobbying is important. We are
     the ‘watchdog,’ and governments need to be held to account, for example,
     ensuring that there is sufficient compensation for people for energy projects.”
     Achilles Byaruhanga, Chair, NBD Board
     The NBD has been effective in this role. For example, through the involvement
     of NBD members, the Rusumo Falls project designed to take into account
     issues relating to the number of displaced people. Using a ‘run-of-the-river’
     design, instead of a large-scale dam, the number of displaced people was cut
     from tens of thousands to just over 500. “We are glad that we were consulted
     throughout – and that we will get fair compensation,” says Manuaru Fanuel
     (pictured here), who owns a shop nearby.
     “There was considerable stakeholder participation in the Rusumo Falls project
     – how would people be compensated, and so on. We’ve been able to mobilize
     all sorts of people: elders, women, and youth. People want to know the
     benefits of projects such as hydropower. If you don’t work with the people and
     people cannot see the benefits, the project will not be successful,” explains
     Emerita Mugorewicyeza, NBI, Regional Stakeholder Participation Specialist.

Cooperation in International Waters in Africa
CIWA was established in 2011. It supports riparian countries across sub-Saharan Africa with sustainable development and
cooperative management, through improving the quality and accessibility of information, strengthening institutions, and
providing support for preparing investments with regional benefits. It seeks to build on the successes of, and lessons from,
the joint partner engagement around the NBTF.
CIWA offers strong technical expertise in international waters, as well as continuing to ensure safeguards are in place with
regard to investment projects, which it proposes to place at the center of its ethos. And by supporting communications and
knowledge dissemination, CIWA believes it important to promote the engagement of civil society in consensus building for
regional cooperation on transboundary waters.
