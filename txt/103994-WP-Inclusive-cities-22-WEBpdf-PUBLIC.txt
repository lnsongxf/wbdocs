Urban Development Series



         Produced by the World Bank’s Social, Urban, Rural & Resilience Global Practice,
         the Urban Development Series discusses the challenge of urbanization and what
         it will mean for developing countries in the decades ahead. The Series aims to
         explore and delve more substantively into the core issues framed by the World
         Bank’s 2009 Urban Strategy Systems of Cities: Harnessing Urbanization for
         Growth and Poverty Alleviation. Across the five domains of the Urban Strategy,
         the Series provides a focal point for publications that seek to foster a better
         understanding of (i) the core elements of the city system, (ii) pro-poor policies,
         (iii) city economies, (iv) urban land and housing markets, (v) sustainable urban
         environment, and other urban issues germane to the urban development agenda
         for sustainable cities and communities.

 2.1. Demographics

 Latin America and the Middle East share demographic and urbanization trends: Growth rates
 have declined over the past two decades, but youth constitute a large share of the population
 with the age groups below 25 accounting for 42 percent in Brazil and 51 percent in Egypt (see
 figure 2.1).2 As a matter of fact, large cities in Middle Eastern countries have the largest youth
 cohorts in the world. Improvements in transport and increasing mobility in different cultures
 allow young people to travel from villages to cities and between cities seeking employment and
 access to education and amenities.

                                                                 of Public Space

Whether conditioned by fear of insecurity or lack of social trust, a resurgence has been seen of
semiprivate spaces reserved for selected user groups. Planners and social scientists deplore the
proliferation of gated communities in today’s cities and note their adverse impacts on urban life.
A parallel trend is the multiplication of semiprivate spaces where admission is limited by fees and
special rules, exemplified by shopping malls, ethnic and religious meeting places, and recreation
areas. The public space is thus being gradually stripped of its social function as a space where dif-
ferent social groups and income classes mix, take a walk, stroll, shop in markets, enjoy an outing
in green areas or city parks, or watch local youth play in the community sports field.

In most cities in developing countries, public spaces outside elite areas are not well maintained
and in many cases insecure. In informal settlements they are hostile and often controlled by
gangs, particularly in outlying settlements where roadways are long and narrow with few trans-
versal links. Inhabitants avoid spending time in these spaces beyond their function as circula-
tion paths. Women and youth who are vulnerable to harassment and violence dread them and
hasten to reach home.

In favelas and barrios, women are often forced to pay exactions merely to walk and climb the
steps up the slope to their houses. They constantly face the risk of urban violence, including
vandalism of their homes if they do not pay the exactions demanded. Public spaces are also
hostile when they are too large and neglected. Mothers do not want their children to play in
such spaces despite the small sizes of their houses, fearing for their security.

In many ways, public space shapes the image of a neighborhood (more so than buildings) and
yet receives little attention compared to infrastructure and housing. Despite the landscaping
shown on upgrading and housing project plans, usual cost overruns leave the space unfinished.
Planners and urban designers have led the effort to restore and improve the social function of
public space, especially lower-income neighborhoods.


4.1. Rio de Janeiro’s Program

Rio de Janeiro’s Favela Bairro program (2003–10) ranks among the most ambitious programs
undertaken by a local government to improve living conditions in its lower-income neighbor-
hoods. The program included infrastructure upgrading (water, sewerage, road paving, and
drainage) but also focused on the improvement of public spaces, street lighting, landscaping,
and green areas and the provision of community facilities and sports fields, nurseries, laundry
stations, and community centers. In the second and third phases, funded by the Inter-Ameri-
can Development Bank (IDB), social services were added, including child care, youth training
and activities, and workshop space for income-generating activities and training for women.
The city added, under a separate program, computer stations and youth training, managed by
community associations.

5                                Access to Land: A Critical Factor
                           at the Core of Inclusion and Exclusion

Informal land development occurs because available land options are either unaffordable or
too isolated and the public housing options accessible though government programs are incon-
veniently located or not in line with family asset-building strategies. Small local contractors,
strongmen, and speculators are key drivers of this dynamic, usually working in collaboration
with land owners, municipal officials, and council members. In Latin American cities, they
organize land invasions; in South and East Asia, they settle the poor on marginal, hazardous
sites and along the edges of water bodies (as in Manila); and in Africa they illegally subdivide
tribal lands and settle the very poor opportunistically in vacant and unbuildable spaces.

Continued occupancy of land and incremental construction require constant interaction with
local authorities. Over the years, this has created ubiquitous forms of institutionalized cor-
ruption with some regional variations reflecting the particularities of land laws, local gover-
nance systems, and the dynamics of urbanization in the area. Around the world, the pervasive
corruption in local management of urbanization and its adverse impacts on cities has led to
forceful popular resistance to displacement and loss of rights to ownership or use of land (see
figure 5.1). Sporadically, community-wide demonstrations demand national governments to
take corrective action. Land regularization programs, whether undertaken separately or as part
of an area-upgrading program, require formal recognition of beneficial occupancy, usufruct,
individual ownership of a lot, or common ownership of the site by the occupants.


5.1. Regularizing Tenure in Informal Settlements:
Impacts on Social Inclusion

Countries in the MENA region share legal background regarding land tenure shaped by me-
dieval jurisprudence based on sharia law, local customs and traditions, and the Ottoman land
code of 1858.10 Traditionally, registration of the different categories of tenure rights required a
notarized document attested to by witnesses and filed with the courts, which validated it with
the court seal (Tapu). Being in possession of a notarized document attested to by witnesses
(Hujja) is recognized by the courts and considered a first step in the titling process. All coun-
tries have created a new formal titling system but have not abolished the traditional system,
which remains the most prevalent form of recording rights.

This common legacy has resulted in the similarity of land management laws among Middle
Eastern countries. Although local authorities regulate land use and development, subject to the
powers granted under decentralization and national enabling legislation, tenure and registra-
tion of real estate property along with transactions are regulated by national laws that define
the different categories of primary and derivative rights and detail the procedures for their
transfer through inheritance, sales, rental, and buy back as well as different forms of beneficial
occupancy.

                                                    for Affordable Housing

In the 1950s and 1960s, projects in the Middle East and in most developing countries tended
to focus on slum clearance, urban redevelopment, and public housing.16 By the early 1970s,
the urbanized areas of larger cities and, in particular, the Megacities expanded rapidly while
infrastructure lagged because of technical and financial constraints. The focus of government
interventions shifted to slum upgrading and the regularization of informal settlements.17 De-
centralization and amendments to planning laws gave local authorities the power to delineate
areas to be upgraded and specify the urban planning and design standards that would apply
in these areas.

From the 1980s on, development activities turn to large-scale projects in the emerging met-
ropolitan regions. New development plans and regulations focused on urban regeneration,
satellite cities, and new towns. Morocco and Tunisia assembled compendiums of urban laws,
codes, and regulations. Egypt’s Law 119 of 2008 integrated previous regulations governing
land development and building construction but did not fundamentally amend them.

The general trend became for land development companies and contractors to acquire land
and obtain development permits for large housing estates, which are mostly developed as gated
communities. Sometimes permits are issued pursuant to negotiated agreements with the mu-
nicipalities including clauses making the developers responsible for providing part of the in-
frastructure or building a new school in the area. In Jordan co-operatives acquire land, obtain
permission to subdivide, distribute plots among their members, and request services from
the municipalities. All such activities leave the burden of providing infrastructure and public
services in part or in whole to the government.

Turkey’s urban transformation law (updated in May 2012 by Law 6306) allows municipalities
to clear shanty towns and informal settlements and relocate their residents in public housing
and cooperative apartment buildings. Cities have used the law to clear strategically located sites
that have high redevelopment potential (e.g., the highway corridor from the city center to the
airport in Ankara). The relocation sites are invariably on the outskirts of the cities, resulting in
improved housing conditions but also in spatial segregation. The construction company of the
Greater Istanbul Municipality undertakes urban regeneration projects that replace older neigh-
borhoods with apartment buildings and develop tall buildings on the periurban fringe for the
resettlement of their inhabitants. Municipalities then provide them with infrastructure.18

Sustained demand for housing because of the high rate of household formation has created
pervasive housing shortages for the urban poor and the middle classes. The severity of the
shortages and the rapid appreciation of urban land have led to the emergence of land specu-
lators capitalizing on the inertia or collusion of local authorities to take control of tracts of
land. In Egypt they have tended to claim ownership of publicly owned land, sell apartments
on the basis of a subdivision or design plan to middle-class families, and use the high down
payment requested (40 to 50 percent of the cost) to finance construction. They bet on the

                        Improvements: Land-Based Financing

Municipalities levy development charges referred to as exaction fees paid by developers to cover
the costs incurred to provide infrastructure and public services to developments. Granting de-
velopment rights and allowing for building envelopes larger in height or in bulk than stipulated
in zoning ordinances have been used to prompt developers to undertake public improvements
and social projects. Cross-subsidization and mixing income groups by combining market-rate
serviced parcels and low-cost building lots in urban projects have been widely used.

However, the most creative financing methods rely on infrastructure and land regulations to
open up the development potential of well-located sites and allocate the proceeds of charges
paid by developers to improve infrastructure, housing, and the urban environment in lower-
income communities elsewhere in the city. Linkage programs have been successfully used in
several U.S. cities. Stretching payments over several years allows cities to charge higher fees and
cushions the impact of the business cycle.

In developing countries, the possibilities created by the rapid appreciation of urban land al-
low for more innovative approaches. Well-structured financial schemes can channel the flow
of funds through the private sector (developers, banks, contractors, and NGOs) with limited
involvement by the city if it has the managerial capacity and political will to implement a
community-led program in partnership with CBOs. Risk, however, must be adequately as-
sessed with reference to inflation trends.

Inclusion embodies the concept of equity, which demands that the poor have a right to a share
of the state’s assets. In Middle Eastern and Latin American cities, this share is best delivered by
secure land tenure as a first step in the process of asset building by the poor. Among the lower
middle classes, informal housing construction is mostly funded by remittances. Providing the
poor with access to land and infrastructure requires changes in systems and attitudes within
local government and a marked improvement in the ability of the state to generate revenue
by capturing a share of the appreciation in urban land values created by public investment in
infrastructure.

Urban land is the most rapidly appreciating commodity in Middle Eastern cities, doubling
in price every two to three years since the mid-1970s.22 Yet the tradition of property taxa-
tion based on rental income valuation makes it almost impossible to equitably tax vacant
land and curb rampant speculation that has squeezed out of the informal land market the
nonremittance-receiving households among the middle classes, whose only option is to
rent housing in informal settlements. The property tax could and should be an important
source of public revenue whether it is collected by national or the local governments. Yet
reform of the tax has met with political controversy and operational difficulties that have
impeded any significant progress on the issue. Tunisia is the only country that presumably
uses capital value in the assessment of property taxes. In Egypt, the tax rate was reduced in

Carrying forward the work on social inclusion and exclusion, the team at the Pontifical Catho-
lic University of São Paulo spearheaded the demand that municipalities join forces to promote
inclusiveness. The Statute of the City,24 adopted by parliament in 2001, legally mandated local
authorities to regularize and service the favelas and informal subdivisions. The municipalities’
lack of enthusiasm to implement their new responsibilities led the social movements, political
activists, and intellectuals to rally their forces and develop a declaration on inclusion, the Right
to the City, which was circulated in 2004.

The name captured the imagination of social activists and reform-minded professionals. It
soon became ubiquitous throughout the developing world and was widely referred to in docu-
ments by international NGOs and multilateral and bilateral organizations. It has now become
quasi-synonymous with socially inclusion. However, the concept of the right to the city and
the elements it embodies have been modulated in each region and country to reflect those fac-
tors that are predominantly responsible for marginalization of segments of the urban popula-
tion and exclusion of the poor from access to the assets and services that cities offer. Although
inability to access to land, infrastructure, and public services is the prime cause of exclusion,
the underlying factors vary among regions and cities.


8.1. Implementing the Right to the City in Brazil

In Brazil, a partnership grouping social movements, NGOs, and academic institutions estab-
lished the National Forum for Urban Reform to press for legislation fostering social inclusion.
Their efforts led parliament in 2001 to adopt the Statute of the City (Law 257). The law pro-
vides a framework supporting social inclusion as a collective right. In practice, it provided legal
backing to social movements to press their demands at the state and local levels.

The 1988 constitution strengthening decentralization, the law of fiscal responsibility redirect-
ing municipal finance toward funding education and local services, and the Statute of the City
bringing municipalities together to improve living conditions in the poorer neighborhoods
constitute a powerful legal framework empowering cities to act on reducing disparities and
promoting social inclusion.

Lack of action by the cities prompted the National Urban Reform Movement to issue a plat-
form declaration, “The Right to the City,” which included among its demands that cities
implement the Statute of the City; adopt democratic and participatory management processes;
improve housing quality and environmental sanitation for all their inhabitants; prioritize pub-
lic services, particularly transport, education, and health; provide public security; respect hu-
man rights; promote employment generation; and direct resources to “popular sectors.” The
declaration underscored the fact that national legislation is necessary but not sufficient to
change the situation on the ground.

9.1. Grassroots Initiatives: A Rights-Based Approach

In developing countries, CBOs have limited managerial and financial capacity and are unable
to scale up activities beyond the neighborhood level without the support of local authorities
and national programs. Technical and financial assistance by donors and international NGOs
is often needed to help CBOs undertake a pilot project. International NGOs, foundations,
and UN agencies have recognized initiatives worldwide that focus on poverty reduction and
improvement of the living conditions of poor families. The UN Habitat Best Practices Award
Database and the Building and Social Housing Foundation’s annual World Habitat Awards
databases offer a selection of innovative housing initiatives to improve the living conditions of
poor and marginalized communities. The three examples of practices from Latin America and
the Middle East briefly presented below reflect the diversity of initiatives that adopt a rights-
based approach to housing.

Egypt’s Better Life Local Housing Movement Program, initiated in 1997, has sought to im-
prove housing, basic services, security of tenure, and offer construction training opportunities
to local communities in the Minia governorate. Opting to bring a rights-based approach to
this social mission, Better Life raises awareness of household’s legal rights to housing and land
tenure. To date, Better Life has improved housing for 1,000 families and provided potable
water and latrines to more than 5,900 families in the periurban areas.35

Argentina’s Institute of Municipal Housing (Instituto Municipal de la Vivienda [IMV]) con-
siders housing a social right and works to improve the housing situation of lower-income
families who live in shantytowns in the city of Rafaela. It aims to develop an approach to assist
families who do not meet the eligibility criteria for access to government housing programs.
In 2006 it started a pilot project involving 103 families living in dire conditions. Through the
use of workshops and surveys, IMV led the group to define their housing needs and build their
houses and helped them adapt to their new living environments.36

Brazil’s Association of Tenements in Central Areas was able obtain a 6,000-square-meter plot
of land in the Santos city center, classifying it as a ZEIS with approved city funding. It began
the construction of an initial 113 housing units while securing funds for additional units. In
all 181 families have benefited from the project, and the group is convinced that promoting
the right to adequate housing reinforces the right to the city for all.37

These three organizations and similar NGOs, advocating grassroots, local strategies, have been
successful in empowering and mobilizing communities to improve their livelihoods and their
living conditions. Some of these initiatives are replicable, but securing the financial and human
resources needed to scale them up to the level of citywide programs faces several challenges.

Paralleling the increasing disparities in income and wealth worldwide since the 1980s, cities
in developing countries have witnessed the emergence of a growing divergence of lifestyles,
particularly within the middle classes, reinforced by the widening gap between the quality of
public and private educational and health care institutions, spatial segregation, gated com-
munities, and exclusive semiprivate amenities. This erosion of social cohesion and citizenship
in urban society has sharpened the growing perception and reality of exclusion. Rising levels
of social consciousness and social expectations have led to growing activism among NGOs and
civil society.

Demography has become a key factor shaping the perception of exclusion. Youthful popula-
tions, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, have ushered in an eagerness to abandon
views shaped by cultural traditions in favor of newer distinctions shaped by the lifestyles that
wealth and achievement afford and by technologically defined concepts of modernity. Migra-
tion enables the most desperate and the most entrepreneurial to accumulate savings to invest in
achieving their improvement objectives. The associated remittance-driven real estate dynamics
in sending countries has led to rapid increases in land values.

The availability of the internet in the primary and secondary cities of the Middle East and
Latin America has helped the coalescence of groups who share similar attitudes toward exclu-
sion. In some countries, differences in viewpoints among groups account for the difficulty
of reaching a consensus on an urban agenda and on urban policies promoting inclusiveness.
Brazil’s landmark Statute of the City stands out as a rights-based legal mandate adopted by
parliament. The term “right to the city” has captured the imagination of planners, social activ-
ists, and NGOs worldwide, spearheaded by Latin American social movements and the Porto
Alegre World Social Forum.

In contrast to food security for which social definitions can draw on the precision of medical
research and documentation, definitions of social inclusion have been mired in attempts to
capture its complexities and different manifestations. The desire to ensure comprehensiveness
has blurred the focus needed to give a rights-based approach the legal strength it needs to with-
stand challenges where clarity and precision are of the essence. This weakness is exemplified by
Brazil’s experience, where the courts have consistently sustained the primacy of city regulatory
instruments over inclusion-based initiatives and demands and claims made under the Statute
of the City, particularly in reference to the social function of land.

Municipalities, with a few noteworthy exceptions, have shown remarkably little inclination to
focus on social inclusion despite increasingly visible disparities and civil unrest. Decentraliza-
tion and varying degrees of fiscal autonomy have not significantly changed their outlook. Their
major concerns remain economic competitiveness attracting private investment and promot-
ing real estate development.
