THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        REGIDESO sends an engineer to the site to check the information and
        prepare a pro-forma if the connection is feasible and the energy required
        is available at that place. The pro-forma is sent to the Supervisor

        Purchase the transformer

        A transformer needs to be built to accommodate the 140kVA to pass
        from medium voltage to low voltage. If the utility has transformers in
        stock, the customer simply goes to the warehouse of the utility and
        purchases the transformer. If there is no transformer available at the        105 calendar days         BIF 0

        The client usually signs the supply contract with the utility at the end of
        the external connection works, but can sign the contract also during the
   5    works.                                                                         1 calendar day           BIF 0

      Both parties need to obtain a tax clearance certificate from the
      municipality proving that all city-level taxes are paid. The certificates are
      obtained from the same person from the representatives of the
      municipality at the one-stop shop for both parties and they can be
      obtained at the same time. Both parties must be present at the
      municipality to request tax clearance certificates on both.

      An expert is designated by the Land Registry to check whether the price
      in the sales contract is the correct one. The OBR will also designate an
      expert to inspect the property. The objective of the inpsection is to
      ensure that the price in the sale agrement is not underestimated or
      overestimated.

      After the inspections, the expert of the Land Registry writes a valuation
      report (rapport d'expertise) that is transmited to the Director for
      signature. If for instance the price on the sale agreement is lower, the
      transaction tax will be paid based on the appraisal value provided by the
      expert from the Titre Foncier and not on the agreed price between
      vendor and buyer.

      The expert of the OBR will also write a valuation report (rapport de
      contre-expertise). This report is necessary to issue tax clearance
      certificates for both the buyer and seller (Attestation de non redevabilité
      delivree par les services des impots) showing that all taxes at the national
      level are paid and that neither the seller nor the buyer owes any debt to
      the OBR.

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
