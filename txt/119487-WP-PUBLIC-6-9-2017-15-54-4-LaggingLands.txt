Economic development is concentrated in a few
places. Only 1.5 percent of the world’s land is home
to half of its production. In countries like Japan and
France, Tokyo and Paris concentrate over 40 percent
and 30 percent of their economic activity in less than
4 percent and 2 percent of the country’s land, respec-
tively.1 However, these places have extended the
benefits brought by such economic concentration to
all regions throughout the country; they have been
able to spread high levels of living standards through-
out their territories.
However, not all places have been equally success-
ful in spreading the benefits of concentrated eco-
nomic success. Estimates from more than 100 Living
Standard Surveys indicate that households in the            mental challenges constrain growth in the less popu-

    At the same time, growth and income in cities are not
    homogeneous across different neighborhoods. In Rio
    de Janeiro, for example, poverty and homicide rates
    in the favelas are considerably higher than in the rest
    of the city, and their positive correlation is not acci-
    dental.
    Violence can thus create a dangerous vicious cycle
    that deepens the gap between leading and lagging
    areas. Violent areas are risky for business to invest,
    challenging for basic service provision, and unat-
    tractive for people to move to; they become isolated
    enclaves with perpetuating disparities and a legacy of
    physical and psychological trauma6. Further, violence
    not only poses a barrier to growth in and economic
    integration of the affected regions, it also has a detri-
    mental impact on neighboring areas—both within cit-
    ies and countries and across national borders.                  divisions can facilitate regional convergence in liv-
