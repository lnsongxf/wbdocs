     3.6	 Project Phases
     The project was implemented in three phases. As seen in the following diagram, the service delivery components
     were broken into two to allow for additional flexibility to assess mid-way through the project and incorporate those
     lessons into the remaining programming. Although entirely unintended, this break between phases was scheduled for
     December 15, 2013 and thus the devastating civil unrest did not impact delivery in Phase 1. Phase 2 was postponed
     due to security and services resumed starting April 2014. Implementing Partner Service delivery was finalized by the
     end of July 2014.

     Phase 3 of the pilot was established to ensure that the pilot achieved the learning objectives by imbedding an external
     evaluation and a period of knowledge consolidation and transfer.

     this programme was outlined clearly in DDR policy to professionalize, right-size, and streamline the NOF. This would
     both 1) reduce the potential for idle or underutilized members reigniting conflict by assisting them in establishing
     sustainable alterative livelihoods, and 2) reduce the weight of these salaries on the national fiscus which could in turn
     be used for developmental priorities as outlined in the South Sudan National Development Plan.

     The current events in South Sudan underscore the importance of DDR to the country and its connection to the nation’s
     overall development. At the same time, the conflict also changes the dynamics of DDR in South Sudan by introducing
     additional groups to the potential pool of DDR participants.

     Looking forward, South Sudan DDR programming must now reflect:

     •	   The programmatic and operational learnings of the piloting process;
     •	   Realities of financial costs of the initial strategy design; and
     •	   Recent events in South Sudan which require that the current approach to DDR in South Sudan be assessed.

                 7	       Strategic Recommendations for
                          Future Programming


Matching the findings above with the realities of the recent events, the priority areas requiring attention for a renewed
strategy include:

•	   Increased clarity on categorization of DDR beneficiary groups and numbers of beneficiaries;
•	   Reduced cost;
•	   Increased harmonization of programming in reinsertion and reintegration;
•	   Full national government implementation; and
•	   Continued momentum

Increased clarity on categorization of DDR beneficiary groups and numbers of beneficiaries is necessary given the
recent events in South Sudan. The individuals that may now qualify for DDR programming fall into the following
categories:

•	   Current SPLA & other national organized forces
•	   Former SPLA & other national organized forces (SPLA-IO)
•	   Rebel groups (non-SPLA origin)
•	   Civilians that joined recent fighting (ie. White Army of largely youth, dinka youth who are recruited, etc)
•	   Wounded Heroes / Veterans (loyalties irrelevant)
•	   Women Associated with Armed Forces or Groups (WAAF)
•	   Children Associated with Armed Forces or Groups (CAAF)
•	   South Sudanese Combatants in Foreign Armed Groups

This represents a broad spectrum of experiences and needs and the service delivery modalities for the various groups
may differ to best respond to those needs. For example those with a long military history that are being demobilized
from the SPLA will be in need of an SSR approach while children would be in need of a separate special programme
and the mobilized civilian youth may benefit most from a community based approach. In light of the new actors it
would behoove the people of South Sudan to structure the South Sudan DDR programme to provide appropriate DDR
programming for the varying groups. What had been a programme limited to only former members of SPLA and na-
tional organized forces must now look at attending to a greater variety of groups.

Additionally, recent events will require a reassessment of the numbers of beneficiaries to undergo the DDR process.
Initial estimates for the National DDR Programme suggested the need to process 150,000 ex-combatants. As the
Government of South Sudan has improved internal systems to give more accurate numbers, updated estimates from
late 2013 suggested a significant decrease of the overall initial caseload. Following the events of December 2013 the
numbers will need to be updated.

This situation may require the implementation of DDR at a faster pace or in greater numbers than formerly anticipated
and thus now is the appropriate time to use the knowledge learned to date to assess the reintegration approach through
a highly realistic lens.

The need to reduce costs from the initial design is a second area for attention. While costs of the pilot would be



                                                                                  Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                               Pilot Reintegration Project - TDRP Key Learning Report   33
     expected to reduce with scale, one of the main findings of the pilot was that the approach as implemented was cost
     prohibitive and required further tailoring to be realistic. The programme will achieve the scale and impact desired by
     the Republic of South Sudan only by addressing the financial realities and therein encourages stability and reallocates
     resources as needed.

     The need to more effectively align the reinsertion and reintegration work of the DDR programme is a third area of
     focus which correlates closely with cost. Looking more holistically at the programme allows the government to find
     additional efficiencies in the programme while also providing a stronger programme to beneficiaries.

     The continued development and establishment of full national government implementation of the DDR programme
     is the fourth priority area to be addressed. The initial DDR policy and strategy documents call for national ownership
     which can have programmatic benefits including full national ownership and contextual understanding in programme
     planning, service continuity, and cost efficiencies.

     Finally, it is clear that momentum and motivation are key factors in success. At this time, there is a positive mo-
     mentum on this programme which is an even greater testament to NDDRC and the implementing partners given the
     tense environment they are facing. It is recommended that a transitional pilot project be implemented to harness the
     current momentum and immediately incorporate the lessons learned in this pilot. The Transitional Pilot would segue
     in a paced manner up to the full scale programme.

     In summary, the current events in South Sudan underscore the importance to the country of DDR and its connection to
     the nation’s overall development. As such, it is critical that the country continue and invigorate its work in developing
     a nationally-led well-designed and well-implemented DDR programme. The learnings from this pilot as well as the
     tools developed are relevant and timely as these can significantly contribute to the development of an effective and
     realistic full National DDR Programme.
