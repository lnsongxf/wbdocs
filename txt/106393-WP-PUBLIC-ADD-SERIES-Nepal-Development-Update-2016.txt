C. Special Focus: Remittances at Risk




Summary

 Remittances play a pivotal role in the Nepalese economy and the near-term risk of a possible slowdown has increased.
 Growth of remittances at a global level has contracted in 2015—a first since 2008—primarily as a result of a fall in oil
  prices which has affected activity in remittance-sending countries.
 Inflows of remittances to South Asian economies has declined as well, but inflows to Nepal buckled the trend as remittances
  increased significantly in response to the earthquake in April 2015.
 However, prolonged contraction in departures of migrant workers is an early sign of a potential slowdown in remittances in
  Nepal. A potential slowdown of remittances poses a significant near term risk to Nepal because of its outsized role in the
  Nepalese economy.
 A similar episode occurred in 2011, following the global financial crisis in 2008-09.
 Should the slowdown in remittances occur, an appropriate monetary and fiscal policies responses are required as well as en-
  hanced supervision of the financial sector.
 Furthermore, given the two shocks the country faced in 2015, Nepal’s ability to absorb a potential third shock has dimin-
  ished, requiring a concerted effort to weather it.
