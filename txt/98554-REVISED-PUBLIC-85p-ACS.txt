                                        Executive summary
Agriculture is critical to Moldova’s economy, but the sector faces significant challenges.
Agriculture is vital to Moldova’s economy. It accounts for 14 percent of GDP and employs 25 percent
of the labor force; together with agro-processing, it generates more than 20 percent of GDP. While the
size of the agriculture sector is one of the largest in Europe, it is comparable to other countries at similar
income levels. The sector is also a major foreign exchange earner, with agro-food products comprising
about 60 percent of merchandise exports. While the share of agriculture in value-added and
employment has decreased over the years in Moldova, the sector continues to be both a driver of
growth and an avenue for reducing poverty.

The Government of Moldova (GoM) identifies agriculture as one of the main drivers of growth in its
2020 National Development Strategy. The GoM’s strategic vision is to modernize agriculture to improve
competitiveness and better integrate producers into markets. Improving competitiveness becomes even
more important as Moldova seeks to increase agricultural exports to the European Union (EU) under the
Association Agreement and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA)—a reorientation
that is becoming all the more pressing because of deepening uncertainties about Moldova’s traditional
markets in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). A review of the experience of New EU
Member States shows that agriculture benefited after accession—with the benefit depending not on the
level of public support but on how it was provided. Countries that focused public resources on excessive
price and market support did not gain as much as those that modernized the agro-food sector and adopt
EU standards.

Agriculture in Moldova faces both short-and-long term challenges. While the share of agriculture in
value-added and employment is significant, productivity is low at about 60 percent of average national
productivity. Despite recent improvements, agriculture’s share in employment is twice that in GDP –
implying that labor generates less valued-added in agriculture than in other sectors. Given this low
productivity, agricultural incomes remain modest, leading to much higher poverty incidence in rural
areas (18.8 percent) than in urban areas. Moreover, as a small open economy, real GDP growth in
Moldova is volatile because external economic shocks are more easily transmitted to the domestic
economy. This high exposure to external shocks is amplified by climate-related shocks that affect
agriculture; recurring droughts, coupled with weak risk-mitigation mechanisms, periodically suppress
agricultural output, thus adding to the volatility of overall growth. These climate shocks are projected to
become more severe in the next 40 years. Finally, recent bans on agricultural exports to Russia are
negatively affecting Moldova’s agricultural exports and exacerbating growth volatility.

Increasing public spending on agriculture is not an optimal response to these challenges. Instead, to
make the sector more competitive and resilient to shocks, direct budget spending should be reduced in
some areas and redesigned or increased in others. Tax expenditures could be streamlined to make
them more efficient, cost effective, and equitable.


                                                                                                            2
In Moldova, public spending on agriculture is through direct budget spending and tax expenditures
(foregone tax revenues). Direct budget spending is in the form of subsidies (current and capital) and
services (research, education, food safety, and extension services) and through donor-supported
programs. Tax expenditures are through reduced corporate income tax (CIT), value-added tax (VAT),
social security contributions (SSCs), and health contribution rates. Tax concessions, a type of tax
expenditure, take the form of reduced tax rates, exemptions, and tax deductions.

Direct budget spending at 1.4 percent of GDP is high in Moldova compared to other countries, and
public support reaches about 2 percent of GDP when tax expenditures are added. Moldova spent 1.4
percent of GDP and 3.6 percent of total government outlays on agriculture in 2013— higher than many
countries in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), including new EU member states like Romania and Bulgaria.1
Moldova also spent 0.6 percent of GDP in the form of foregone taxes.

Further increases in public spending are not warranted, especially given overall fiscal considerations.
As in many small open economies, Moldova has a relatively large public sector. Direct budget spending
on agriculture tripled during 2002–14.2 Even though public resources devoted to agriculture have
increased, the sector’s productivity has not gone up much. To ensure fiscal sustainability, government
needs to continue fiscal consolidation to reduce the deficit to 3 percent GDP by 2016. In the medium
term, the government would need to balance demographic spending pressures and pressing needs for
investment to upgrade obsolete infrastructure and reinforce the human capital base. It is thus neither
possible nor necessary to increase public spending on agriculture any more than current levels. So the
challenge for Moldova is to ensure that its direct budget spending is well-used – reduced in some cases,
and redesigned or increased in others. Meanwhile, tax expenditures can be made more efficient, cost
effective, and equitable.

With respect to direct budget spending, allocative efficiency has improved, but concerns about
efficiency and equity remain.
Allocative efficiency in direct budget spending on agriculture has improved. Spending is aligned with
the government priorities reflected in the three main pillars of the National Agriculture and Rural
Development Strategy: (1) enhanced competitiveness of the agricultural and agro-food sector through
restructuring and modernization; (2) sustainable management of natural resources; and (3) better
conditions for living and working in agricultural and rural areas (Table ES.1). More than 80 percent of
direct budget spending on agriculture is directed to the first priority. In particular, a large and increasing
share of capital spending in the budget is directed to upgrading obsolete infrastructure. About 30
percent of the direct budget spending in this pillar is for core services to support agricultural
competiveness, such as research, education, and extension. Under Pillar II, support for sustainable
management of natural resources accounts for less than 15 percent of expenditures; here the largest
allocation is for hail prevention systems. As yet the aspiration of better rural living and working

  3.6 percent is using COFOG for international comparison because it includes fishery and forestry. When it is
limited to local mapping, taking into account a narrower definition, it is 2.6 percent. In both cases, it is high.

  Moldova’s comparator countries reduced spending during that period.


                                                                                                                     3
conditions is not well- reflected in the agricultural budget; what little support this area gets is mainly
provided by donors. In any case, Pillar III involves a wider set of ministries, including agriculture.

Pillar I, enhancing agricultural competitiveness through restructuring and modernization, is supported
by sizable and well-targeted capital spending, mainly in the form of donor programs and investment
support/subsidies to producers. In 2013 capital spending constituted about 60 percent of total
spending on agriculture in Moldova—almost twice as much as in 2010 and far above the 10–30 percent
in comparator countries. Most of the capital spending supports Pillar 1 of the government strategy. The
increase in capital spending in Moldova reflects much better execution of the budget, inflows of donor
funds for investment, and a shift from recurrent to investment subsidies. Investment subsidies

                                                                                                                              4
constitute about 25 percent of spending in support of the competitiveness agenda of agriculture in
Moldova and are used efficiently to address a major need: modern and innovative production and post-
production practices in agriculture, especially in the high-potential high-value-added sector. The
investment subsidies support programs that respond to the modernization needs of the sector. They
have also moved away from a concentration on machinery to smart subsidies that promote technology.
In contrast, recurrent subsidies intended to strengthen agricultural competitiveness (such as credit
subsidies or the land consolidation program) may need to be redesigned. Uptake of land consolidation
programs is very limited and credit is allocated primarily to wealthier farmers and subsidizes agricultural
inputs.

The cost-efficiency and effectiveness of most services supporting agricultural competiveness are
debatable. Government support has been sizable and stable, with about 30 percent of agricultural
spending allocated to research, education, food safety, and extension services. International studies
have proved that these services deliver solid returns on public investments and boost agricultural
productivity and competiveness. However, in Moldova spending on agriculture research and education
is driven by a sizable wage bill and the institutional structure is obsolete, with limited ability to generate
outcomes (quality of education or research spillovers to extension services). For instance, research and
the curricula at agricultural colleges do not respond to farmers’ needs. There are also issues related to
the limited funding for extension services, which have proved efficient and popular (accessed by 50
percent of farmers), and the role and results of the Seeds Commission and the National Food Safety
Agency (ANSA).

Neither amounts nor allocations of funds to programs for sustainable management of resources under
Pillar II look suitable to the challenges confronting the sector. Risk management programs account for
about 15 percent of total agriculture spending, yet the exceptionally high output volatility, driven by
weather-dependent variation in crops and irrigation, are a drag on sector development. Risk is mainly
managed by anti-hail services, subsidies for horticulture production and irrigation, and subsidies for risk
insurance. The largest allocation goes to hail prevention systems, which have not yet proved to be cost-
efficient (World Bank 2007). The results from spending on the irrigation system and insurance subsidy
program are not particularly encouraging. The irrigation system is underutilized and funds for
maintenance are limited. For instance, the system has the capacity to irrigate over 100,000 hectares of
land but annual demand for irrigation services is only about 7,000–15,000 ha). The risk insurance
subsidy, which is based on the traditional multiperil insurance system, has been in place since 2006 but
has not resulted in extensive coverage and is generally not considered well-suited for managing national
systemic risks like drought and frost. There is also anecdotal evidence of fraud related to utilization of
insurance subsidy payments.3

Inequities in access relate to the size and legal status of farms; there are also geographic and gender
dimensions. A comprehensive analysis of distributional implications of public spending on agriculture is
complicated by the lack of data on both small and commercial farms and on the welfare of farm owners.

3
    The subsidy is claimed by the insurance company (50 percent of the premium), not the insured farmer.


                                                                                                            5
There is some evidence, however, that public support is skewed toward large corporate farms in richer
regions and toward male farmers. For the past three years, 75–80 percent of subsidies have been
absorbed by large corporate farms. The only subsidy that largely benefits smaller individual farms
stimulates investment in protected-field vegetable production. These outcomes are inconsistent with
the weight of individual farmers—70 percent—in total agricultural output. Small farmers also seem to
be more in need of public support because they face greater information and monetary constraints in
accessing modern technologies.

Determined improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of Moldova’s spending on agriculture
would build up both its competiveness and its resilience to shocks. Three types of government action
on current programs could make spending more efficient and effective: reduce, redesign, or increase
funding.

                    The authorities should consider reducing spending for the credit subsidy program
                     and the land consolidation program (if uptake remains small), and the anti-hail
                     service.

                    Programs that call for redesign or further reform are research; the agriculture
                     education system (institutional reform); management of the irrigation system (a
                     new model for functioning of the water agency and the water user associations);
                     and support for modernization of the food safety system.
                    Programs that appear to deserve more funding given their importance to the
                     sector or positive results achieved so far are modern risk management programs,
                     after improvement of current programs; extension services that are generating
                     positive results; subsidized investment in post-harvest infrastructure, funded by a
                     reduction of the large machinery program; and ‘smart’ subsidies aimed at
                     promoting use of technology. Increases in these areas, however, need to be
                     implemented in an unchanged overall envelope given concerns about the
                     government fiscal space.
Tax expenditures result in additional generous support but need to be redesigned to more effectively
address the challenges in the agriculture sector.
Agriculture receives highly favorable tax treatment to compensate for its high risks, low profitability,
and high capital intensity. Farmers benefit from such favorable tax arrangements as an alternative to
direct spending. The main tax expenditures are reduced rates for CITs, SSCs and health contributions,
concessions for citizens who acquire farming property, property tax concessions, and VAT concessions.

The fiscal cost associated with this favorable tax treatment is sizable. The annual cost of farming sector
benefits from tax arrangements is estimated at more than 0.6 percent of GDP, with the largest share
being for VAT treatment, followed by direct taxes and social security contributions. Tax expenditures
amount to about 60 percent of tax collections in agriculture and about 40 percent of direct budget
spending on agriculture.



                                                                                                        6
Moreover, tax expenditures do not effectively address the challenges identified for the sector. The
favorable tax treatment of income and real property is likely to slow restructuring of agriculture.
Reduced rates for health contributions for individual farmers and reduced tax rates for corporate
farmers are likely to affect the decisions of farmers and landowners to stay in the industry and are likely
to slow structural transformation of the economy. Moreover, Moldova’s current system for taxing real
property, including transfers of agricultural property, may delay exit from agriculture and raise
impediments to entry, particularly for foreigners. Also, VAT concessions on agricultural inputs (e.g.,
investment and tractors) are not justified by market failures and are likely to have an economic cost by
inducing changes in the pattern of production. There is also evidence that a reduced VAT rate on
selected agricultural products is in general regressive—it accrues mostly to higher-income quintiles.
Thus, it is questionable whether the reduced VAT rate is the best instrument for improving income
distribution.

Tax expenditures could be redesigned to tackle agricultural problems in ways that are more efficient,
cost-effective, and equitable. One option would be to pursue a range of both tax and non-tax
incentives—or removal of disincentives—related to capital investment, farm consolidation, land use,
and income support. The main changes proposed are:

                    Introduce a capital allowance or a tax credit similar to that used in OECD countries.
                     Finance that by returning the CIT rate for agricultural enterprises to the standard
                     12 percent and removing the VAT exemption for machinery and tractors.

                    Provide incentives for better use of land by abolishing the limitation on land
                     acquisition by foreigners; more accurate valuation of land and property, which is
                     vital to adopting value-based taxation; and introducing a special tax on
                     uncultivated land.
                    Introduce a presumptive turnover-based tax, with a low tax burden and
                     compliance costs, to bring low-income farmers back into the tax net and make
                     means-tested social assistance more effective.

                    Limit disincentives to move out of agriculture and consider removing the reduction
                     in the SSC rate for farmers.
                    Reintroduce a unified VAT rate for agricultural products (while ensuring proper
                     compensation for low-income households) to help limit production inefficiencies
                     and administrative costs.

              Chapter 1.            Challenges to Agricultural Development
The share of Moldova’s agricultural value-added and employment is significant and in line with other
countries at comparable income levels. The volatility of agriculture output, mainly caused by extreme
weather, is a major risk factor for agriculture growth and poverty reduction in rural areas. While the
impact of extreme weather cannot be fully mitigated, better land utilization, more efficient irrigation,
and more productive and efficient government outlays on agriculture can help to stabilize agricultural
production.
Moldova’s public support to agriculture is higher than in many other countries at a similar level of
development. Moldova’s public support is about 2 percent of GDP, including 0.6 percent of GDP in tax
expenditures. Clearly, fiscal policy is a key factor in agricultural policy but the government does not have
the space for further increases in spending. Meanwhile, budget preparation and monitoring is yet to
become an effective way to manage public interventions in agriculture.
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. The first part looks at Moldova’s agriculture sector from
an international perspective and provides background on recent trends and developments. The second
part focuses on sectoral policies in agriculture and government priorities for the sector. The third part
outlines the fiscal envelope and previews the size of public support to the agriculture. The fourth part
summarizes conclusions of the chapter.



    1.1.    Economic Perspective
    1. Moldova’s recent economic performance has been strong but dependent on the evolution of the
       agricultural sector. Moldova has registered the highest cumulative growth among regional peers,
       almost 32 percent, from the pre-crisis level of 2007 through 2014. However, as a small open
       economy with a large agricultural sector, its growth has been volatile because of its vulnerability to
       climatic and global economic conditions. As Figure 1-1 and Figure 2 indicate, to a large extent
       recent GDP volatility has been driven by agriculture.
    2. Moldova’s agriculture sector is one of the largest in Europe. It generates about 12 percent of gross
       value-added.4 Neighbors in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), countries in the
       Western Balkans, and some new EU new member states are good comparators for Moldova
       because they have a common external environment. In the global context however, countries like
       Guatemala, the Philippines, Honduras, and Bolivia have very similar economic structures (Box 1.1).
       The large share of value-added reflects the high quality of Moldova’s agriculture land, which is
       considered the country’s main natural resource. In terms of nature and geography, Moldova has
       considerably greater potential for agriculture than many larger European countries. Total

          agricultural land, about 2.5 million ha, represents almost 73 percent of its territory.5 Arable land

    Box 1-1: Benchmarking Moldova’s Agriculture Sector

     Benchmarking Moldova’s economy by taking into account the prominent role of agriculture for both
     growth and employment makes it possible to assess the country’s performance and identify factors
     that differentiate it from its peers. Such an exercise, although performed at a highly aggregated
     level, may be useful for international comparisons, which are a good starting point for sharing
     knowledge and experience. Moldova’s benchmarks are determined by taking into account the
     sectoral composition of value-added, employment by sector, and GDP per capita (PPP terms) using a
     global and European sample. Benchmarks countries in the global sample are Guatemala, the
     Philippines, Nicaragua, Paraguay, El Salvador, Honduras, Sri Lanka, Georgia, Mongolia, Serbia,
     Turkey, Bolivia, and Uzbekistan. European benchmarks used in this report are Armenia, Belarus,
     Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine; Bosnia, Macedonia,
     and Serbia in the Western Balkans; and EU members Hungary, Croatia, Lithuania, and Romania.

     4. As in other countries, the structural transformation of Moldova’s economy has led to a decline in
        the relative importance of agriculture. Over the last 15 years, the share of agriculture in value-
        added dropped from 29 percent in 2000 to as low as 10 percent in 2009, before bouncing back to
        11–13 percent in 2011–14, mostly because of high agricultural prices. At the same time, the share
        of industry declined by some 2 percentage points (pp) to 14 percent of GDP in 2014. Moldova’s
        shift away from agriculture and into services is a typical development pattern, but although its
        relative share of GDP is declining, agriculture continues to exhibit healthy growth rates.

       5. Over 25 percent of Moldova’s labor force is employed in agriculture. While significant, this share
          is lower than among its peers with similar incomes per capita and well below the almost 50 percent
          share in the late 1990s. The decline in agricultural employment reflects massive emigration of
          Moldova’s rural workforce that started in the 1990s and is continuing, though at a slower pace. This
          labor re-allocation episode stands out when compared to both European economies and the
          broader group of emerging market comparators (Figure 1-5).
       6. While productivity in agriculture has been growing recently, it is still moderate, at about 60
          percent of average productivity in Moldova—similar to Ukraine and Russia but significantly
          higher than in Romania or Croatia (Figure 1-7). In recent years, the steep reduction in agriculture
          employment was one of the main reasons behind the growth in the productivity of Moldovan
          agriculture. Still, agriculture’s share of employment is more than twice its share of GDP, which
          implies that labor generates much less value- added in agriculture than it does in other sectors.

       7. Low incomes from agriculture results in higher poverty in rural areas. Household income from
          agriculture has been dropped over the years, from 28.4 percent of total income in 2007 down to
          19.1 percent in 2010. Poverty is highest in rural areas, particularly among those who are
          agriculture-dependent. While in 2013 in urban areas the poverty rate was fairly low, at 4.6 percent,
          rural poverty was much higher at 18.8 percent. However, agriculture in rural areas is still a safety
          net protecting the rural poor from food insecurity because agricultural activities facilitate their
          access to food, while urban households rely primarily on purchased food.

        8. Investment in agriculture is essential for improving the potential of the sector and helping to
           mitigate its volatility. In recent years, the increasing stock of capital has had an important role in
           generating agricultural production. International comparisons suggest that Moldova’s agricultural
           capital stock is equal to about the average for the group despite relatively high government outlays
           (Figure 1-8).
        9. Land utilization, variation of crop production, irrigation, and government outlays have a
           significant impact on agricultural production and on total factor productivity (TFP). Large
           variations in the production of crops, which constitutes over 50 percent of total agriculture output
           in Moldova, were the key factor behind output volatility in recent years and resulted in a large TFP
           shift over the period. The analysis of TFP (see Annex 2) also points to a weak, though positive
           relation of the size of farms to productivity. Increased capital investment in agriculture and a
           declining rural labor force have also affected agricultural production, but to a much lesser extent
           than weather conditions.
        10. Exceptionally high output volatility poses a serious threat to sector development (Figure 1-9 and
            1.10). Crop production is particularly vulnerable to the weather. Severe droughts in 2003, 2007,
            and 2012 had a devastating effect on most crops.8 High volatility partly reflects underdeveloped
            weather-related risk mitigation, varying access to irrigation, low adoption of modern agricultural
            technologies, such as drought-resistant crop varieties and anti-hail protection tools, and a lack of

      The severe drought in 2007 caused a 55 percent decline in the winter wheat harvest, a 72 percent decline in maize, a 70
    percent decline in sunflower seeds, a 64 percent decline in pea production, and a one third reduction in cattle holdings. Total
    losses were estimated at US$1 billion.

       Climate change is expected to exacerbate the impact of these extreme weather events. A World
       Bank study (2013) has shown that changes will lead to variations in temperature and rainfall
       patterns, and that over the next 40 years climate change will have more severe effects on Moldova.
       Without decisive adaptation strategies, most yields will suffer significant reduction.

    11. Agriculture products constitute a large share of total exports. Since 2000 Moldova’s agro-food
        exports have accounted for 60 percent of total merchandise exports. Between 2000 and 2013 the
        value of agro-food exports went up by 220 percent, to US$935 million. While exports of animal
        products expanded only moderately, Moldova managed to increase exports of plant-based
        products seven-fold. As Figure 1-11 shows, specialization in production and exports of vegetal
        products, especially since 2009, have driven up Moldova’s net exporter position in agro-food
        products, trade in food products has been balanced, and trade in animal products has been falling.
        The most widely exported products are both wine and spirits and both fresh and processed fruit
        and vegetables. These categories alone account for nearly 40 percent of exports. Expanding
        agricultural production despite Russian restrictions on Moldovan exports has led to shifts in the
        geographical pattern of exports toward the EU (Figure 1-12).

        12. Trade integration with the EU will generate many opportunities and advantages but will also
            challenge Moldova’s producers to become more efficient. In 2014 Moldova signed the Association
            Membership Agreement (AMA) with the EU and the related agreement on the Deep and
            Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). With the opening of the EU-28 economic borders, the
            Moldovan agro-food sector has a great opportunity to compete in the largest market of the world.
            This access could bring significant gains to the Moldovan economy through increases in production,
            revenues, and producer incomes. It could also lower domestic prices via cheaper intermediary
            inputs entering the Moldovan technological chains. On the other hand, Moldova needs to prepare
            the agricultural sector to compete with EU producers. Although Moldovan producers have already
            made major efforts to modernize the sector, significant investment and institutional change are still
            required to ensure that the agricultural and food industry comply with EU market requirements.

        1.2. Policy Perspective
        13. Moldova’s strategic vision for agriculture as part of its growth agenda gives priority to sector
            modernization and improved market integration. Developing the agricultural sector is seen as an
            essential component of the government’s goal for achieving sustainable economic growth, as
            reflected in the GoM 2020 National Development Strategy (“Moldova 2020”). The strategy calls for
            a shift from the current consumption-based growth model towards a growth model based on
            raising investments, increasing productivity and competitiveness, developing export industries, and
            promoting a knowledge-based society. Agriculture sector is presently viewed as a potential driver
            of growth rather than a poverty reduction vehicle; policy measures for in the sector are primarily
            targeted to supporting market competitiveness and investment-enhancing developments.
        14. A sizable budget is required to finance the National Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy
            for 2014–20 (see Chapter 2). Present policies are guided by a new strategic document adopted in


                                                                                                                         16
    June 2014, the National Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy (NARDS) for 2014–20. The
    document specifies priorities for the agricultural and food sector through 2020. The budget
    required to finance the new NARDS is €2.2 billion for the seven-year period (2014–20). Direct
    financing from the budget will be complemented by large resources from international financial
    institutions (IFIs) and donors. It is critical that money spent on the sector is aligned with
    government priorities and sector needs. It is also important to remember that tax preferences are
    another important form of support to agriculture, which should be directed to sectoral priorities.
15. The challenge of building competitiveness and reorienting a large chunk of Moldova’s agro-food
    exports toward the EU today seems more pressing than ever in view of the increasing
    uncertainties about Moldova’s traditional CIS markets. Enhancing Moldova’s agricultural
    competitiveness is vital for improving the access of Moldovan agro-food products to the EU market
    and capitalizing on its potential benefits. At the same time, it is realistic to expect that many
    farmers will continue to produce for non-EU markets and that agriculture will retain its social role
    as a source of income for less prosperous households.
16. Moldova has much to learn from the recent accession of Central and Eastern European countries
    to the EU. Review of agricultural developments in New Member States of the EU (NMS) leads to a
    number of conclusions: (1) Accession had a positive impact on the sector. It resulted in a
    consolidation of production, higher current prices, higher exports and imports, and especially
    higher farmer incomes. (2) There is diversity behind the overall positive picture, due to initial
    conditions, pre-accession policies, post-accession policies, how the Common Agricultural Policy
    (CAP) was implemented, and the macro policy and institutional environment. The post-accession
    performance of the NMS was heavily influenced by the agricultural policy prevailing in each country
    pre-accession. Candidate countries implemented quite different policies, some with positive
    elements, others with negative experiences after accession and introduction of the CAP (Swinnen-
    Rozelle, 2009).
17. How countries directed public support and pre-accession facilities provided by the EU influenced
    how agriculture performed after accession. The most critical component of pre-accession policies
    was not the level of support to agricultural production but its purpose and how countries used pre-
    accession EU-provided facilities. Public support was beneficial post-accession if in the pre-accession
    period it had been mainly concerned with enhancing long-term competitiveness. In Romania,
    Hungary, and the Czech Republic, the level of support was close to or even higher than the EU
    average but it did not bring significant positive results (e.g., price increase) because it was too
    focused on price and market support. Countries giving priority to enhancing competitiveness,
    modernizing the agri-food industry, and adapting it to EU standards benefited more in terms of
    how agriculture performed post-accession; Poland is a good example (see Annex 1). Restrictive land
    policies, as in Hungary, and failure to consolidate land negatively influenced utilization of the
    advantages of larger markets by constraining significantly the flow of outside capital to agricultural
    (Csáki et al. 2008). In contrast, liberal land policies, as in the Baltic countries, helped the agricultural
    sector to obtain more resources and better take advantage of the possibilities created by accession
    and close integration with the EU.

1.3. Moldova’s Fiscal Challenges and Public Support to Agriculture
18. The Government of Moldova managed to maintain fiscal discipline in 2010–14, but it does not
    have fiscal space for a substantial increase in spending. After undertaking the adjustment program
    that was supported by the IMF, after 2009 the general government deficit declined by almost 4 pp
    of GDP, to 1.8 percent in 2013–14. Moldova contained the increase in public wages, and made
    spending on education and social assistance more efficient (see Figure 1-3) However, budget
    amendments introduced in summer 2014, including wage and pension raises, lifted recurrent
    expenditures by 0.6 pp of GDP in 2014 and another 1 pp in 2015. The government foresees a 1
    percent contraction of economic activity in 2015 and adopted a budget that targeted general
    government deficit of 3.8 percent of GDP. Interest expenditures are also going to increase
    significantly in the medium term once the state recognizes the losses incurred in the banking
    sector. Thus, debt sustainability considerations do not allow Moldova to spend more without
    jeopardizing macroeconomic stability.
19. Government spending is already high for Moldova’s level of income; the path forward lies
    through better prioritization and more efficient use of public resources. Since early 2000 public
    spending has risen steeply, from about 26 percent of GDP in 2001–02 to over 38 percent in 2014,
    even after a considerable decline from the crisis-related peak of over 42 percent. The spending
    increase was driven by an expansion of capital spending, which jumped to 8 percent of GDP,
    supplemented by higher spending on wages and pensions as well as goods and services (Figure
    1.13). From the functional side, Moldova spends more on economic affairs, health, and education
    than comparators. As a result, Moldova’s spending exceeds that of other countries with similar or
    even higher per capita income (Figure 1-14). This calls for revisiting the role and optimal size of
    government, better prioritization, and more efficient use of public resources.
20. Taxes are relatively high, which limits room to maneuver on the revenue side. Moldova’s tax
    revenue is close to the average for its peers but higher than in some more developed CEE countries
    like Poland and Slovakia (Figure 1-15 and 1.16). The tax structure is somewhat skewed toward
    consumption taxes, which is a positive, growth-friendly feature (Arnold 2009). In 2014 total
    revenues and grants were 39 percent of GDP and tax revenues equal to 32 percent of GDP. Since
    2008 tax revenues have been relatively stable but the structure has changed: a decline in revenues
    from value-added tax has been offset by an increase in CIT tax. As result, about 30 percent of taxes
    collected are now from VAT and excises, followed by SSCs of about 20 percent. The share of income
    taxes in government revenues is minimal: less than 5 percent of GDP. The level and the structure of
    taxes in Moldova do not leave much space for more taxation to fund higher spending.

 21. In the medium term, Moldova’s fiscal sustainability will be challenged by the institutional and
     social context. On the spending side, social and demographic challenges will intensify, building on
     current social insurance and pension commitments. Aging will push up the pension bill and fuel
     demand for health care services, while public spending on education and health in particular
     remains high. Intergovernmental fiscal relations should be reformed in a way that is consistent with
     fiscal discipline and reduces the inefficiencies of small, fragmented local governments. Further
     spending adjustments are needed to make space for pressing medium-term public investment
     needs. On the revenue side, institutional weaknesses are reflected in tax collection problems. The
     scope for raising revenues is limited because tax revenue is already high as a percent of GDP,
     compared with regional neighbors. There are limited possibilities for raising revenues in real estate
     taxes, VAT—not only (because it is the largest revenue source, but because there are numerous
     exemptions with zero or reduced rates—and excise taxes. Nevertheless, the main (but long-term)

                                                                                                                      19
      possibilities for raising revenues should not be from raising taxes, which can reinforce compliance
      problems, but from improving collection and therefore administration. Moreover, Moldova could
      see a decline in external assistance, making it important to preserve fiscal sustainability in the
      medium term.
 22. Moldova spends more on agriculture than other countries at the same level of development. Its
      agricultural spending at about 1.4 percent of GDP is higher than that of most benchmark countries,
                                                                     including such new EU member states

                                                                     in recent outlays on the sector:
                                                                     between 2002 and 2014 spending on

                                                                     Only Georgia had a larger rise, but to a

Note: Including Forestry and Fishing.                                government spending, Moldova’s
Source: Data from BOOST, FAO, IMF.                                   public spending on agriculture
                                                                     compares favorably to that of many
      ECA countries (being outperformed only by Uzbekistan, 5.4 percent of total spending, and Belarus,
      6.8 percent of the total). Chapter 2 provides a detailed discussion of spending on agriculture. Public
      support to agriculture in Moldova is in fact much higher than headline figures show. Tax
      expenditures add to direct outlays. As Chapter 3 of this report shows, foregone revenues due to tax
      expenditures exceed 0.6 percent of GDP.
 23. Despite the increased resources devoted to agriculture, its productivity has not gone up much.
     Though close, Moldova is somewhat below the efficiency frontier that represents maximum
     attainable productivity for a given level of spending (see Annex 2) for an explanation of the
     methodology). This means that some countries that spend similar amounts achieve better results—
     higher agricultural productivity. Moreover, Moldova has recently been drifting away from the
     efficiency frontier (Figure 1.18 and 1.19), which suggests that higher spending has meant higher
     productivity, at least in relative terms. The same is true for Georgia and Bulgaria, which increased
     spending between 2002 and 2012. The analysis suggests that Moldova’s spending on agriculture

 1.4.      Conclusions
 24. Despite positive developments in recent years, ensuring further sustainable growth for
     agriculture will be quite difficult given the less favorable external conditions. Large increases in
     agricultural output leading to strong performance of agriculture exports, as well as poverty
     reduction in rural areas, are the main sector achievements in recent years. Over that time,
     agriculture has proved its resilience and development potential. To sustain the pace of progress,

                                                                                                             21
structural improvements are needed, in terms of both investments and innovation to make the
sector more competitive and more resilient when external conditions are not that favorable. The
next chapter discusses the role of fiscal policy.

   Chapter 2.           Level and Composition of Government Spending on
                                       Agriculture
Public spending on agriculture in Moldova has gone up considerably, driven by donor-funded projects.
Meanwhile, the country has made progress in improving the budget composition to align it with
government priorities for the sector. The structure of the budget reflects the three main pillars of the
National Strategy for agriculture. In particular, a large and increasing share of capital spending has
helped upgrade obsolete infrastructure and modernize the sector while increasing the sustainability of
natural resources by putting more effort into risk management. The aspiration to improve conditions for
living and working in rural areas cannot be attributed to the sector budget only. It involves several
departments and spans areas much broader than what are usually covered by agriculture.
However, not all types of intervention financed from the agriculture budget are efficient. In general, the
substance and the scope of the recurrent subsidy instruments now in place are not the most efficient
responses to sector constraints. For instance, subsidies to facilitate access to credit are primarily
benefiting wealthier farmers, who are already in a position to qualify for commercial credit. This support
measure is also used mainly for subsidizing operational loans, so it has become a vehicle for subsidizing
agricultural inputs with only a small share used for investments to build productive capacity (such as
buying equipment and rehabilitating infrastructure). Such public services as agricultural education,
research, and irrigation are inefficient and need major restructuring. There are also design issues related
to risk management programs, such as hail prevention and the insurance subsidy program. Finally, public
support for agricultural investment is captured by a small number of corporate farms and often does not
reach individual small farmers, who are the poorest. It is also affected by gender and geographical
inequalities.
This chapter of the Agriculture Public Expenditure Review assesses whether agricultural spending
supports sector objectives. It analyzes the nature, composition, and efficiency of public spending on
agriculture in order to identify what must be done to make the budget a relevant tool for supporting
sector objectives.
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: the first section discusses trends in agricultural spending.
The second looks at the efficiency of public spending in order to determine whether scarce public
resources are allocated in ways that reflect government priorities. The third section analyzes the
effectiveness of agricultural programs by tracking their results and impact. The fourth section looks at
the distributional impact and the inequality aspects of spending on agriculture. The concluding section
summarizes the major findings and policy recommendations.



2.1. Trends in the Budget for Agriculture
 25. Government spending on agriculture has gone up considerably since 2002, though not as much as
     total spending. Outlays on agriculture rose from less than 0.5 percent in GDP in 2002 to more than
     1.5 percent in 2014 (Figure 2-1). After a post-crisis decline in 2010–11, agricultural spending


                                                                                                           23
      reversed and by 2014 it exceeded the 2009 level, due mainly to one-off compensation to farmers
      to offset Russian trade restrictions and to an inflow of donor funding. Excluding tax expenditures,
      government support to agriculture amounted on average to about 2.6 percent of the total budget
      for 2009–13.11 Spending on agriculture as a share of spending has been stable unlike the declining
      trend (as share of the total government expenditure) observed in other developing countries after
      the crisis in 2008-09.12

 26. The increase in public spending on agriculture was mainly due to an increase in donor funds for
     investment. External resources, predominantly investment loans and grants from multi- and

the budget of the Ministry of Education and Academia for Research. See Annex 3.

   Most developing countries seem to have prioritized other sectors in response to the crisis. Africa experienced a substantial
decline in the agriculture share of government spending, from an average of 3.5 percent in 2009 to about 2.5 percent in 2011;
Asia saw a contraction of 0.6 pp., from 4.4 percent in 2009 to an average of 3.8 percent in 2011.

        bilateral partners, rose by 0.4 percent of GDP13 from 2010 to 2013. In general, international
        support for Moldova has been growing since 2006, with about one-third of the funds directed to
        agriculture. These funds were allocated to high-priority investment to modernize the sector (Figure
        2-2)

2.2. Key Aspects of Economic and Functional Composition
 27. The share of capital outlays in the agriculture budget rose at the expense of recurrent
     expenditures— a welcome trend that sets Moldova apart from other ECA countries. From about
     0.6 percent of GDP, capital outlays now account for nearly 0.8 percent and recurrent spending has
     plunged (Table 2.2). The change is seen as a positive development that is addressing investment
     and modernization needs and helping to reduce inefficient recurrent subsidies. Moldova’s
     emphasis on capital spending contrasts with other countries in ECA: in FYR Macedonia, nearly 98
     percent of agricultural spending in 2013 was on recurrent items and in Ukraine it was 91 percent.

 28. The structure of recurrent spending has also improved, with outlays shifting away from subsidies.
     While goods and services have held steady and wages have been controlled, transfers (recurrent
     subsidies) have dropped from 0.7 percent of GDP to 0.1 percent. The wage bill accounts for 40
     percent of the budget.

 29. The functional composition of the budget shows a concentration of spending on a few items that
     are critical for the development of agriculture. The largest shares of agriculture spending are
     allocated to physical infrastructure and business development to modernize the sector, and to key
     services, the largest shares being for food safety and agricultural education, with smaller shares for
     research, extension services, and irrigation. These are followed by viticulture and wine
     development in support of high-value markets and risk mitigation and anti-hail programs to help
     make agriculture more resilient to weather risks. As shown in Table 2.4, the share of these items
     increased from 41 percent in 2009 to almost 84 percent in 2009-2013, reflecting a concentration of
     public resources on these programs critical for the modernization agriculture and its sustainability.

 30. Services account for more than 30 percent of the agricultural budget. The core public agricultural
     services are operational. The annual funding allocated to agricultural services mainly covers the
     recurrent needs of the institutions, with no capital resources for their effective functioning and
     institutional development in general. This holds true for large budget items like education, food
     safety, and research, as well as smaller services like irrigation. Some agricultural institutions benefit
     more than others from additional annual allocations from donors, which help fill critical gaps (in
     both know-how and investment) not covered by the public budget. Favorite areas for donor
     support are food safety, irrigation, and advisory services. Such key services as research and
     education are primarily state-funded and have so far seen limited donor support, possibly because
     of pending government-led structural reforms in these areas. Annex 4 provides a summary of
     agricultural services along with problems specific to each.

2.3. Effectiveness of Public Spending in Supporting the National Sector Strategy
 31. The structure of spending on agriculture in Moldova is aligned with the priorities defined in the
     National Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy (NARDS). Spending is guided by the main
     pillars for the sector: (1) enhanced competitiveness of the agricultural and agri-food sector through
     restructuring and modernization; (2) sustainable management of natural resources; and (3)
     improved conditions for living and working in agricultural and rural areas. More than 80 percent of
     agriculture spending supports the first priority, competitiveness, mainly by investments to
     modernize the sector and delivery of agricultural services, such as enhancement of food safety and
     agricultural education. About 15 percent of agricultural funds are spent to ensure sustainable
     management of natural resources. Vulnerability to climate distress is addressed by weather-related
     risk mitigation instruments (access to irrigation, adoption of modern agricultural technologies such
     as drought-resistant varieties, anti-hail protection) and innovative insurance schemes (such as
     index-based weather insurance). Realization of the government’s third priority, improved
     conditions for living and working, is more influenced by donor projects that provide funding for
     activities contributing to this objective. Funding of this priority also spans areas beyond the
     responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and involves other ministries.

32. The rest of this section assesses the efficiency of the main programs supporting Pillars 1 and 2 of
    the sector strategy, to which 95 percent of sector spending is allocated. This approach does not
    differentiate between the nature of support according to its economic (investment or recurrent
    spending) or functional composition but rather focuses on the results achieved.
Pillar I. Enhanced competitiveness through restructuring and modernization

33. Donor programs helped to reorient spending toward activities supporting competitiveness and
    modernization. Donor spending on the wine-growing industry helped redirect domestic spending
    toward investments in machinery and equipment. Apart from supporting the wine industry,
    international and donor programs finance other areas of the government’s agricultural
    competitiveness agenda: modernization of the agri-food chain, food safety and quality
    requirements, sustainable land management, development of the horticulture value chain, and
    support for dealing with resource endowment and depletion. As a result, the government has
    redirected its capital spending toward machinery and equipment, especially for improving the
    organization of production and post-harvest collection to facilitate selection, packaging, and
    contracting procedures in line with European practices.
34. Moldova could reap the benefits of higher donor funding in many ways: (1) The bulk of the funds
    come from the EU, which recently signed the DCFTA cooperation agreement with Moldova. This
    could provide some stability for future funding. (2) All large donor projects are presently captured
    by the public budget; what is not yet captured are technical assistance projects (mainly EU/FAO,
    USAID), which account for less than 10 percent of total donor support for agriculture. (3) Donor-
    supported investments are closely coordinated with the GoM, including the annual Agricultural
    Support Fund instruments, and some donor funds to the sector are channeled through MAFI’s
    Agency of Interventions and Payment for Agriculture (AIPA). Thus, donor funding complements the
    national budget positively.
35. Investment subsidies support the introduction into agriculture of modern and innovative
    production and post-production practices, with emphasis on high-potential high-value
    agriculture (HVA). Subsidies account for about 40 percent of investment spending in Moldova—
    over 90 percent if donor funding is excluded. The bulk of investment support to crops is channeled
    to the horticulture value chain to support productivity and market competitiveness improvements;
    equipment for post-harvest handling and processing of fruit and vegetables, and planting of new
    orchards and vineyards. All investment subsidies represent grants to producers that cover a portion
    (normally 25–50 percent) of their investment in productive assets.

 36. Reducing the concentration of the investment subsidy program and refocusing funding toward
     “smart”15 subsidies helped to improve the allocative efficiency of subsidies (Figure 2-4).16 The
     largest machinery program (M5) has been both redesigned and reduced to better respond to
     sector modernization needs. Some large-scale traditional-type agricultural machinery has been
     removed from the list of subsidized items and replaced by more innovative types. The currently
     largest post-harvest infrastructure program (M8) addresses a major constraint of Moldova’s
     production sector: low value-added due to insufficient capacity for post-harvest handling and
     processing of primary agricultural products. Demand for the smaller programs (M4 – protected
     field horticulture production, M6 and M7 – livestock breeding material and technological
     upgrading) seems to have been picking up over the last two years, indicating more interest in
     investing in these sectors.
 37. Recurrent subsidies intended at building competitiveness may need to be redesigned, though
     they are not very expensive. Half of recurrent subsidies (only 1.5 percent of total spending) aims to
     improve the competiveness of agriculture, especially programs supporting access to capital and
     land. Spending on interest rate subsidies (M1), which focuses on increasing the access of farmers to
     credit has risen recently and is now the largest of the recurrent subsidies. However, credit is
     allocated primarily to wealthier farmers, who are already in a position to qualify for commercial
     credit. Another serious concern is that it is used mainly to subsidize loans for operations, so that it
     becomes in effect a vehicle for subsidizing agricultural inputs. The 2014 AIPA data reveals that

programs for livestock breeding material; M7: programs for technological upgrading; M8: programs for post-harvest handling
and processing of primary agricultural products

   Subsidies stimulating adoption of innovative technologies and approaches are referred to as smart subsidies.

    almost two-thirds of subsidized credits went for fuel (25 percent), fertilizers (22 percent), and seeds
    and seedlings (17 percent); only a small share went into investments to strengthen productive
    capacity, such as purchase of equipment and work on infrastructure.

    even distribution of subsidies among farmers, but its current uptake is very limited at US$8,000–
    9,000 annually, with only nine applicants in 2014 and six in 2013. As a result only about 1,000 land
    parcels were consolidated. The low uptake of this program reflects the current slow pace of
    valuation of land markets although the pace is expected to pick up in the near future. Although
    there is a power rationale for it, if scale and critical mass are not achieved in the next few years,
    administrative costs would most likely not justify retaining this measure.
39. Services supporting Pillar I have been sizable and stable, with about 30 percent of agricultural
    spending allocated to research, education, food and safety, and extension services. According to
    international studies, these services can be a strong return to public investments and boost
    agriculture productivity and competitiveness. While there are efforts at improving the quality of
    food safety, the effectiveness of some other services is questionable due to deep-rooted structural
    inefficiencies built into the current systems. Most of the problems identified are complex and
    require wide-ranging approaches and in some cases bold structural reforms (see Annex 4). Services
    that deliver results have only a small share in the budget.
40. Research and education, which are large budget items, offer limited value-added due to
    outdated methods and systemic deficiencies: (1) Research and education are driven by a sizable
    wage bill that results from a heavy institutional structure. The wage bill for agricultural education
    and research institutions in Moldova accounts for about 10 percent of total agricultural spending.

                                                   32
      Because the funding is spread over several institutions, it has little ability to generate outcomes,
      such as a higher (quality of education or research spillovers to extension services). (2) The link
      between research and the needs of farmers is missing. The research institutes operate in isolation
      from the private sector and from the international R&D system. The current structure of
      agricultural education does not respond to the current needs of the country and does not generate
      positive results (see World Bank, 2007a). The curriculum in most colleges is outdated and not
      responsive to the requirements of a modern agricultural industry; nor is there a useful link to the
      private sector. For instance, it does not provide on-farm training to introduce the certification
      demanded EU retailers demand or to meet Global G.A.P. (Good Agricultural Practice) and other
      private standards, which is a good way of establishing closer links with the private sector.
 41. Coverage and efficiency of the extension network are high and have potential for improvement
     despite the network’s small share of the sector budget. Presently, the network covers over 40
     percent of Moldova’s territory and over 50 percent of farms. Most of the advice offered relates to
     production technologies (52 percent of services in 2014); other consultancy areas are marketing
     (16 percent of services), business (20 percent), and legal advice (12 percent). To complement and
     maximize the efficiency of extension services, the role and operation of Seed Control (the State
     Commission for Testing Plant Varieties17), which is mandated by Moldova’s legal requirement is
     widely discussed in Moldova. The Seeds Commission would function better if its role were to shift
     from a prescriptive to a consultative one by abolishing the mandatory requirement to test new
     varieties that are used in other countries although not yet registered in Moldova. This change
     would better serve the needs of the private sector by offering immediate access to new plant
     varieties developed elsewhere.
 42. Modernization of the food safety system will be continued, but public funding in this area could
     be further optimized. The spending on food safety absorbs about 10 percent of total spending on
     agriculture and is allocated to ANSA which is in charge of ensuring control over the entire food
     chain. ANSA, with strong support from donors, is now proactively engaged in harmonizing its legal
     and institutional framework with EU practices and requirements. Though significant progress has
     been made in various areas of food safety and quality control in Moldova, a robust, reliable and
     effective domestic food safety system has yet to be built. Among the elements needed are (1)
     aligning food safety requirements and norms with internationally accepted practices; (2) optimizing
     the ANSA laboratory to make lab testing more reliable and achieve laboratory accreditation; (3)
     transitioning to risk-based inspections and controls; and (4) setting up advanced information and
     data management systems.
Pillar II. Sustainable management of resources

 43. Risk management programs to facilitate sustainable management of resources account for 15
     percent of total spending. Budgeted agricultural risk management programs are mainly delivered

  Any new variety must be tested before it can be sold on the domestic market. The clients of the Seeds Commission are either
local breeders (mainly agricultural research institutes) or seed importers that want to introduce a variety that is not yet
registered in the national catalogue of plant varieties. There is a charge.

      Services. The government has for many years operated a hail prevention service using an
       expensive system of ground-based rockets and radar stations. The Water Service Agency (Apele
       Moldovei) that manages the large-scale state irrigation systems also requires an annual public
       budget of about $1.5m (part of the Ministry of Environment budget because the water agency is
       subordinated to this ministry).

      Subsidies. A number of investment subsidies are targeted to building up agriculture’s resilience
       to weather risks, such as support to purchase anti-hail and anti-frost systems (part of M3),
       irrigation equipment (part of M5), protected field vegetable and strawberry production (M4).
       Two recurrent programs, – agricultural insurance (M2) and energy for irrigation (M10), are also
       part of the RMP. The following section assesses the efficiency of these programs.
44. The cost-effectiveness of a hail prevention system is questionable. This service has been
    absorbing increasing amounts of budget funds every year; its share in the total services budget has
    gone up from 10.3 percent in 2009 to 15.5 percent in 2013. However, international research has
    found no scientifically credible evidence worldwide that hail can be suppressed, so the benefits of a
    rocket-based anti-hail system are unproven. A cost-benefit analysis to compare the efficiency of
    the rocket approach to a risk-reduction approach based on hail insurance would be informative and
    useful (World Bank 2007). Similarly, there is little evidence that the traditional insurance system,
    like the one in Moldova, is well- suited for managing national systemic risks, such as drought, so it
    is an inadvisable option for Moldova (World Bank, 2007).
45. The irrigation system is underutilized and its management is not sustainable. The bulk of annual
    budget allocations for irrigation (about 75 percent) are staff costs. The rest is for maintenance and
    rehabilitation of irrigation systems. It is unlikely that this amount is adequate for proper


                                                       34
      maintenance. As a result, the Water Agency, which is responsible for the irrigation system,18
      performs below its potential, and only 7,000–15,000 ha of the 144,000 ha of agricultural land are
      irrigated every year (out of 121 operating irrigation stations, only 40–50 are used utilized). Earlier
      studies on this topic recommended transferring irrigation management to Water User Associations
      as the only viable option for long-term sustainability of Moldova’s irrigation systems. This is being
      addressed as part of the MCC irrigation program involved in rehabilitating 10 central irrigation
      systems (to be finalized in 2015), but these efforts need to continue and public funding needs to be
      scaled up.
 46. The irrigation subsidy has not yet been successful in attracting sizable investments in small-scale
     on-farm irrigation. Despite an extremely high rate of re-pumping of irrigation water (80 percent
     subsidy rate), which is seen as “unhealthy” and creating an extremely high dependence on the
     subsidy, the 2013–14 uptake of the measure was still low ($0.3m in 2014), with only about 40
     annual beneficiaries irrigating a total of 4,500–5,000 hectares of land. The main reasons for this
     dismal performance are (1) approval of the subsidy is conditioned on proof of having paid water
     fees, which accounts for about 60 percent of the subsidy, which may be why the low subsidy is not
     attractive for some farmers, and (2) most claims for the subsidy comes later in the year when the
     subsidy fund is nearly depleted, so the amount approved is either subject to a coefficient
     application or in some cases held for payment in the next calendar year.
 47. The risk insurance subsidy program (M2) has been in place since 2004 but does not appear to
     have had encouraging results in stimulating faster adoption of agricultural risk insurance. The
     amounts annually allocated
     to this measure had been Table 2.8: Main Risks Insured in Moldova, 2011–2014

      arable land. The main risks
      insured are hail and drought (Table 2.8) The scheme has benefitted only a handful of agricultural
      producers (up to 200 beneficiaries a year), and the number of annual insurance contracts seems to
      have been declining in the last few years,19 even though annual allocations to this measure have
      been going up. There are also anecdotal reports of insurance companies using fraudulent practices
      by supplying fake documentation to get higher subsidy payments.20

   Expenditures for irrigation are allocated to the Water Agency (subordinated to the Ministry of Environment) that is in charge
of managing the large-scale central irrigation systems. The Water Agency manages 78 irrigation systems throughout the
country.

2.4. Distributional Impact and Inequality of Agricultural Subsidies
 48. Public spending on agriculture seems to reach primarily large farms, creating inequalities that run
     counter to the inclusiveness intent of Pillar 3.21 Inequalities of access to public spending reflect the
     size and legal status of farms, and geographic and gender dimensions.22 Today, the overwhelming
     majority of subsidies are absorbed by large corporate farms—75–80 percent for the past three
     years. About 71 percent of farms that received any subsidy in 2010 had more than 100 ha of land,
     and 98 percent had more than 5 ha. The only subsidy largely benefitting smaller individual farms23
     is the one stimulating investments in protected-field vegetable production. These outcomes are not
     consistent with the weight of individual farms in total agricultural output, which is significantly
     higher than that of the corporate sector: 70 versus 30 percent.
 49. Small farmers face greater information and monetary constraints than large farmers in accessing
      modern technology. Improving access to better services should raise yields and incomes for small
                                                          farmers. Ensuring that expansion of services

                                                          would help to make these subsidies more

21
   A comprehensive analysis of the distributional implications of public spending on agriculture is complicated by the lack of
data on both small and commercial farms and information on the welfare of farm owners.
22
    Poverty rates are highest among farmers (36 percent) and agricultural workers (45 percent); together, the two categories
account for 40 percent of Moldova's poor. Data from the 2012 Household Budget Survey suggests that 44 percent of those in
the bottom 40 percent of Moldova’s welfare distribution are farmers or farm workers.
23
   The available data does distinguish between corporate and individual farms, although specific farm sizes are not provided. It
is important to realize that the size of individual farms can vary, so that “individual farms” are not always “small farms” (and in
fact can be fairly large enterprises). However, per unit data clearly suggests that individual farms are in general smaller
businesses than the corporate enterprises.


                                                               36
     emphasis on the HVA sector (where most operators are small and medium farmers), can be
     expected to lead to a more equitable distribution of public capital resources. Capping investment
     subsidies—in tandem with setting differentiated subsidy rates that taper off—will serve the same
     purpose by allowing more farmers to participate in subsidy schemes, and reduce the gap in the
     subsidy amounts obtained by large versus small farms.
 51. There are also regional disparities in public spending on agriculture. The South is the poorest
     region in the country but farmers there received fewer subsidies than those in the North or Central
     regions Subsidy reallocation also specifically benefits individual farmers in the South, but they
     receive even lower subsidies than the average. Redistribution of subsidies should have a deeper
     impact on regions where the concentration of poor is highest but allocation of subsidies was
     previously lowest, but such redistribution needs to be facilitated by concerted efforts and be based
     on objective criteria that track sector objectives.
 52. Finally, it seems that gender is another dimension of disparity in the allocation of subsidies. For
     both individual and corporate farms, the share of subsidy recipients is slightly lower among female-
     headed than male-headed farms: 27.1 percent of all female-run corporate farms receiving a
     subsidy and 30.2 percent of male-run farms); and 6.1 percent of all female-run individual farms
     receive a subsidy compared to 7.4 percent for male-run farms.24 Increasing inclusion of small farms
     in the agriculture support program would benefit especially female farmers, since 36 percent of
     individual farms have a female head, though only 14 percent of corporate farms.
 53. The distributional implications of supporting large-scale agriculture as opposed to small scale
     farming cannot be dealt with in depth here. The approach adopted by the MAFI to support the
     sector is the following: within a limited budget envelope, the objective is to support market-
     oriented and competitive farmers who will contribute to sustainable sector growth and
     development. To the extent that the government wants to support large-scale farming, it would be
     important that the decision be based on economic arguments, such as the need to address some
     market failure, rather than being a response to pressures from interest groups. The broader issue
     of the distributional implications of supporting large-scale rather than small-scale farming, and the
     gender dimension, in the context of fragmented property rights that limit Moldova’s ability to take
     full advantage of its agro-climatic and geographical advantages, will be analyzed in a dedicated
     piece in the Poverty Assessment (forthcoming).

2.5. Conclusions and Recommendations
 54. The GoM has made progress in aligning the budget with its agriculture sector strategy. Allocative
     efficiency has improved with the reduction of large-size recurrent subsidies and the increase of
     investment support and smart subsidies. The budget also reflects the priorities announced in the
     National Sector Strategy.

  Similarly, 13 percent of all incorporated farms led by females have a bank loan versus 14.4 percent of male-led farms; 0.1
percent of unincorporated farms led by females have a bank loan and 0.2 percent of male-led farms).

55. Structural reform of some agricultural services is needed to make them more effective and
    heighten their value for money. Inefficiencies still negatively affect the outputs and outcomes of
    budget-financed activities. Budget allocations need to be revised in recognition of the new roles
    and functions of the reformed institutions. Renewed budget allocations need an embedded focus
    on building the long-term efficiency and sustainability of agricultural services through enhanced
    capital allocations. These findings suggest a need to continue refining the composition of the
    budget to change the quality and quantity of public services.
56. Given the inefficiencies affecting them, the government is invited to consider reducing some
    programs: for example, cancel or redesign the less effective credit subsidy program and the land
    consolidation program if uptake continues to be small. Further, reconsider the allocation to
    education if there are no reforms. Some other programs are essential but require revision to make
    them more efficient before increasing their budget share : (1) link research institutes with the
    private sector and the international R&D system; (2) revisit the irrigation strategy to create a model
    in which Water Agencies and Water User Associations share maintenance and rehabilitation of
    irrigation systems; (3) reform the Seeds Commission testing program to both better serve private
    sector needs and rationalize annual spending on these public goods; (4) increase the share for risk
    management tools preceded by improvements to the current system; (5) continue to reform the
    food safety programs. Finally, some programs warrant an increase because they are both critical
    and have so far achieved positive results: (1) build up the extension services, the budget share of
    which is small; (2) invest more in the post-harvest infrastructure program and consider further
    reducing subsidies for large machinery; (3) continue designing smart subsidies.
57. Finally, to facilitate and discipline the process of preparing the agricultural budget for institutions
    performing services in the sector, it is necessary to closely link it to annual performance
    evaluations of the institutions. This could be done by operationalizing inclusive M&E frameworks
    and setting clear rules and procedures for utilization of the M&E frameworks in the annual budget
    process.

                  Chapter 3.          Tax Expenditures in Agriculture
Agriculture receives favorable tax treatment. This reflects the large role of the sector, the high level of
capital investment required—and the limited availability of financing—and the need for it to compete
successfully in the EU market. Supporting rural incomes is also a government priority as it advances
structural transformation. A large proportion of farmers are thought to fall outside the tax net because
of preferential tax treatment arrangements, including a lower corporate income tax rate, lower social
security and health contributions, concessions for citizens acquiring property, property tax concessions
and a complex system of VAT concessions. All these tax expenditures amount to 0.6 percent of GDP,
which is sizable in relation to explicit spending and tax collection in the sector.

On the other hand current tax expenditures do not effectively address challenges identified for the
sector. As suggested by good practice according to the theoretical and empirical literature and the
experience of other countries, structural impediments in Moldova’s agriculture sector—and the country’s
economic transformation—can be tackled in more efficient, more cost-effective, and more equitable
ways. This requires a range of both tax and non-tax incentives, and removal of disincentives, related to
capital investment, farm consolidation, land utilization, and income support.

This chapter discusses how the tax system can be used to achieve the government’s objectives while
minimizing the burden on government finance and the distortion to the efficiency and equity of the tax
system. The chapter first reviews the favorable tax treatment of the sector. That is followed by estimates
of the related fiscal cost of the main tax preferences. The next section discusses how effectively current
tax expenditures address the challenges of Moldova’s agriculture sector; their economic and social
impact is compared to good international practice from the perspectives of both research and the
experience of other countries. Finally, the chapter suggests changes to the tax and social security
systems to address structural impediments in Moldova’s agriculture in a more sound and fiscally
responsible way.



3.1. Taxation of Agriculture in Moldova
 58. Agriculture is one of the least-taxed sectors in the economy. Taxes collected from agriculture
     amounted to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2013, or 3.3 percent of agriculture’s gross value-added. As a
     result, agriculture competes with construction, housing services, and manufacturing for the least-
     taxed sector. Since 2008 the amounts collected from agriculture have plunged, mainly due to lower
     VAT revenues (Figure 3-1). This is the result of new lower VAT rates on several agricultural
     products.

                 Source: MoF.

                                                                            A reduced CIT rate: Farmers
       who operate through companies (joint stock or limited liability companies or agricultural
       cooperatives) are subject to a preferential 7 percent CIT rate; the standard rate is 12 percent. The
       current rate is up from the 0 rate that applied for 2008–11.

      A reduced rate for social security and health contributions: The Social Security Fund and the Health
       Insurance Fund offer concessions to farmers:
         o Employers in agriculture (those who during the budget year engage exclusively in certain
             activities stipulated in Classification of Economic Activities of Moldova) enjoy a contribution
             rate of 22 percent instead of the standard 23 percent. Furthermore, 6 percent of an
             employee’s salary is transferred as a direct subsidy from the state budget, bringing the
             effective rate down to 16 percent. The social security system for farmers is managed with that
             for the rest of the population. Since contributions do not fully fund benefits, the government
             covers the gap. The government also funds from general revenues the main (non-agricultural)
             system, which is also in deficit.
         o Concessions for health insurance contributions are available for specified categories of
             taxpayers, including the unemployed who own agricultural land and individuals who contract
             to lease or use agricultural land. Thus, like individual farmers, these taxpayer farmers pay an
             annual flat premium for health insurance (MDL 4056 [EUR 197.92] for 2014–15) instead of 4
             percent of gross salary.

     In this study tax expenditures are defined as tailored reductions in tax liability (see Annex 7).

    Concession for property acquisition by citizens. Transfer by gift or inheritance of real property,
     including agricultural land, is free of tax, but agricultural and forest land cannot be bought by foreign
     citizens, companies, or states, though they can lease it for the short term (1–3 years) or the long
     term (5–99 years). However, Moldova does not have special rules for capital gains tax in connection
     with agriculture. The gain, taxed at normal rates, is calculated as 50 percent of the difference
     between the sale price and the purchase price (all costs related to acquisition of capital assets).

    A property tax concession. Concessions on taxation of agricultural property are complex but
     generally consist of low rates for agricultural land (Annex 6) and exemptions from the real property
     tax if the land meets certain conditions.26 Currently, Moldova is in transition from the old system of
     real property taxation based on inventory value (consisting of two taxes: a land tax plus a tax on
     immovable property, a real estate tax27) to a new ad valorem system. In the new system, both land
     and buildings are subject to a single tax, which is based on the market value of the property. The
     new system is not yet completed with only certain types of property covered; in practice, only the
     old system is in operation. Since 2013 the government has been working on establishing a new
     method to value immovable property for purposes of taxing it in the new system and expanding
     coverage of the valuation system to agricultural land and residential property in rural areas.

    Complex VAT concessions, including a reduced rate.
       o A few Moldovan agricultural businesses have been given explicit concessions on their tax
         obligations. The main concessions have been a deduction for VAT input associated with the
         purchase of fixed assets for agricultural purposes, a VAT exemption for tractors used in
         agriculture, and VAT refunds for producers of agricultural goods subject to a lower VAT rate.
         Whoever pays the VAT is entitled to a refund if the company carries out one of the business
         activities specified (e.g., export supplies, international transportation services, production of
         bakery and dairy products, leasing activity, and supply of certain self-manufactured
         agricultural products, such as sugar). Before registering for VAT purposes, it is possible to
         deduct input VAT, but only if incurred on acquisition of fixed assets for agricultural purposes
         and construction and reconstruction of agricultural goods. This allows agricultural enterprises
         that invest in fixed assets to recover their investments faster.28
       o A reduced VAT rate for agricultural products is an implicit concession to farmers. The standard
         VAT rate in Moldova is 20 percent, but a reduced rate of 8 percent applies to bread and

26
   At least one of three conditions must be met: the land is (1) used for multiannual crops before they are harvested; (2) used
for agricultural purposes for 5 years and was recognized as eroded when acquired and later was re-cultivated and restored; or
(3) subject to chemical, radioactive, or other type of pollution if the government restricts agricultural activity on the land.
27
   The land tax is calculated on the unit area of land and adjusted to reflect land location and fertility; the real property tax
depends on the type of owner or use. Residential buildings are taxed on their inventory value (cost) and buildings used by
businesses on their book value.
28
   However, Moldova does not have a simplified VAT system like the one the EU makes available to some farm businesses. The
rules for VAT registration are the same across the board: businesses can register for VAT purposes if total turnover within the
last 12 consecutive months reached the threshold of MDL 600,000 (about €29,278.43). They also allow for optional registration
as a VAT payer when the business supplies goods or services in an amount exceeding MDL 100,000 (€4,879.74) and meets
certain additional criteria.


                                                               41
            bakery products, milk and dairy products, and primary agricultural production and sugar (see
            Table 3.1.). Reduced VAT rates for agricultural commodities provide an indirect financial
            benefit to farmers, though consumers are likely to benefit more from this type of concession
            than farmers (a discussion of the economic impact of reduced VAT rates is presented below).

 60. Although in theory farmers are largely subject to the same income tax regime as other
     individuals, a large proportion are thought to fall outside the tax net . In Moldova, 58 percent of
     agricultural land is farmed by companies and 42 percent by small-scale enterprises. The latter
     (individual entrepreneurs, subsistence farmers, family farms) are subject to progressive income tax
     like other taxpayers. Farmers and individual entrepreneurs who are not registered as VAT payers
     may maintain a single-entry accounting system29 without a need to present financial statements,
     provided that the system is a method approved by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Those entitled to
     use a single-entry system may still opt to use double-entry accounting. Farmers who met specific
     criteria30 in the previous reporting period are entitled to organize and maintain accounts using the
     double entry accounting system with a simplified presentation of financial statements. However, a
     large proportion of farmers are thought to fall outside the tax net. Only a fraction of the 550,000
     individual farmers pay income tax, though statistics suggest this number is probably an
     understatement. The agriculture sector also constitutes a large part of an unobserved economy
     (about 60 percent of its VA or about 7 percent of GDP).

3.2. The Fiscal Cost of Agricultural Tax Expenditures
 61. Tax expenditures in agriculture are sizable in relation to explicit spending and the taxes collected
     from the sector. Although defining and quantifying tax expenditures is not easy (see Annex 7), an
     estimate of tax expenditure points to foregone revenue of over 0.6 percent of GDP in 2014,31 which
     is sizable compared to both the taxes collected from agriculture and public spending on the sector.
     The ratio of tax expenditures in agriculture reached about 60 percent of the tax collected in
     agriculture and about 40 percent of direct budget spending on agriculture.

29
    Single entry is often referred to as the cash method of accounting. In this relatively simple method of accounting, items are
listed as income or expenses when cash transactions occur. For example, grain is recorded as income when it is converted to
cash—that is, sold and delivered. Also, production inputs like seed, feed, and fertilizer are recorded as expenses when they are
paid for rather than when they are used or ordered.
30
   The three main criteria are (a) an average number of employees that does not exceed 9; (b) income from sales of less than 3
million lei; and (c) the total balance of assets carried over at the reporting date of less than 3 million lei.
31
   The lack of statistical information, appropriate databases, and economic models for estimating tax expenditures in Moldova
was a limitation to the exercise.


                                                               42
 62. Tax expenditures are skewed toward special VAT treatment of agricultural output, which is a
     drain on the budget. VAT has the largest share in the tax expenditures granted to the sector—
     about 0.5 percent of GDP—while tax expenditures from direct taxes (together with SSCs) represent
     about 0.1 percent of GDP (Table 3.2). Corporate tax concessions are the second largest, followed by
     concessions in payment of social security contributions.

 63. For VAT, the potential shortfall of revenues stemming from the reduced rate for agricultural
     products could be decomposed into a policy gap (the measure of tax expenditures) and a
     compliance gap. The policy gap for agriculture, which reflects the extent to which consumption of
     agricultural products is not taxed at the standard rate,32 is high at about 0.5 percent of GDP. The
     gap is driven by the reduced rate for VAT on consumption but also refunds of input VAT granted to
     the sector. The compliance gap reflects the effectiveness of tax policy administration in
     implementation of the VAT33 and consists of the amount of tax declared but not collected and the
     amount of tax due that was not declared or assessed. For Moldova the compliance gap is much
     lower than the policy gap at about 0.1 percent of GDP. Both gaps were calculated based on the RA-
     GAP VAT gap estimation methodology (see Annex 8Error! Reference source not found.).
     Unfortunately, the fiscal costs of other VAT concessions offered to farmers (deduction for VAT
     input associated with the purchase of fixed assets) have not been estimated due to data
     limitations.
 64. The estimated size of agricultural tax concessions in income taxes and social security and health
     contributions is relatively small and mainly reflects reduced rates . Reduction of the tax rate for
     corporate farmers (legal persons) reduces state revenues by about 0.7 percent of GDP. In 2014 the
     state budget transferred MDL 44.3 million (0.04 percent of GDP) to the social security agency,
     CNAS, as compensation for a 6 percent lower contribution. The estimated implicit subsidy from the
     lower general rate (22 percent vs 23 percent) was MDL 7.3 million (0.01 percent of GDP).

32
  The policy gap is zero if the VAT is applied at a single rate to all (and only) consumption. The calculation assumes full
compliance.

33
     The compliance gap is zero if implementation of the VAT is perfect.


                                                                 43
      Concessions in health contributions are small. In an extreme scenario in which all farmers that pay
      lump sum contributions switch to paying 8 percent of their gross salary (which is assumed to be
      twice as high as the average agricultural salary), the tax expenditure equals 0.1 percent of GDP.
      Unfortunately, data limitations do not allow calculation of the costs of current concessions in taxing
      land and other immovable property, capital gains, and the transfer of assets.
 65. However, eliminating some, or even most, tax expenditures may not increase tax collections by a
     corresponding amount. At first glance, after reviewing the tax expenditure estimates, it appears
     that the government could collect more tax revenue by eliminating some, or even most, of those
     granted to the agriculture sector. However, such calculations need to take into account economic
     and behavioral effects. The costs of tax concessions also need to be set against the benefits they
     create (discussed below) and against missed opportunities to use public funds for other purposes
     or in a different way (e.g., through direct spending on the sector).

3.3. The Economic and Social Impact of Tax Expenditure in Agriculture
 66. As an instrument of policy, tax expenditures should help the government to deliver on its
     objectives for the sector. Tax expenditures granted to agriculture can be viewed as having one or
     more of the following aims: (1) support the competitiveness of the agricultural sector through
     restructuring and modernization (e.g., provide economic incentives to support investment in fixed
     assets or more productive use of land); (2) incentivize sustainable management of natural
     resources; and (3) help improve conditions for those living and working in agricultural and rural
     areas (e.g., provide financial assistance to certain groups of farmers and their families, without
     limiting structural change in the sector). An effective tax system—one that raises the revenue
     needed for core governmental functions while minimizing the burden on citizens—should also
     follow some basic principles (Error! Reference source not found.). Do tax expenditures live up to
     the expectations of them? The following section assesses potential benefits and distortions created
     by the tax expenditure system in Moldova.34
 67. The favorable tax treatment of income is likely to slow restructuring of the agricultural sector.
     Reduced rates for health contributions for individual farmers and reduced CIT rates and SSCs for
     corporate farmers are likely to bear on decisions of farmers and landowners to stay in the industry
     and slow the much-needed structural transformation. The income taxation rules for farmers do not
     distort the choice between being organized as a company or as an individual farmer for small-scale
     farmers (annual taxable income of up to MDL 27852) since up to that level of income they offer the
     same personal and corporate tax rates. In the short run these preferences support corporate
     profits and employment in agriculture. In the longer run, however, lower effective taxation of
     agricultural incomes can stimulate reallocation of resources toward agriculture and affect decisions
     in favor of diversification. Lower SSCs for farmers will have a similar effect, and lower employer

34
  The economic and social impact of tax expenditures in Moldova is assessed by comparing them to (1) good practice in taxing
agriculture derived from a review of the theoretical and empirical literature (mainly OECD 2005) and (2) the experience of other
countries with selected tax expenditures (both advanced countries like Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and Germany and also
Moldova’s comparators, such as Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine).


                                                              44
    contributions for hired workers will keep more of them in the industry. Preferable treatment of
    agricultural income in any case is not equitable and generates high costs. Finally, the income tax
    concessions do not provide support to low-income rural households or reduce the volatility of
    farmers’ incomes (e.g., through farm income averaging).
68. Moreover, in contrast to practices in other countries, Moldova’s taxation of incomes favors
    corporate over individual farmers. Compared to both advanced countries and countries in the
    region, Moldova’s PIT concessions do not look very generous. Several countries in the EU use a
    special system of assessment in taxing individual farmers (see Annex 9), and Georgia, Bulgaria, and
    Romania exempt from taxation in whole or in large part the incomes of individual farmers (see
    Table 3.3). Presumptive taxation is also practiced (e.g., in Belarus). In the EU farmers are also the
    main group using the averaging provisions in income tax systems or income equalization funds. All
    of these PIT concessions attempt to deal with income instability, low incomes, and the associated
    poverty of individual farmers and their families. Special treatment of farming companies is less
    frequent, and here Moldova’s reduced CIT rate stands out as an exception. Several advanced
    countries have special arrangements for SSCs in agriculture, but deciding whether these constitute
    concessions is difficult because the social security system for farmers is typically run separately
    from that for the rest of the population.
69. Moldova’s current system for taxing real property may both delay exit from agriculture and block
    entry into it. The area-based system of land taxation in Moldova is comparatively simple to
    administer and manage. However, an area-based property tax system is often perceived to be
    unfair because area-based rates bear little relationship to either ability to pay or benefits received,
    e.g., there is very little difference between the tax rates for land in the capital and in other cities in
    Moldova. Agricultural real estate is exempted real property tax if, for instance, the land is used for
    multi-annual crops before their harvest. This exemption from taxation, together with the tax
    concession on transfers of agricultural property, may delay exit from agriculture and raise
    impediments to entry, particularly for foreigners. The evidence from Romania and Bulgaria shows
    that restrictions on foreign ownership have affected the efficiency of land exchanges, land
    allocation, and productivity growth there. However, as in Moldova, agriculture receives
    concessions on annual real estate taxes in most advanced and developing countries.

 70. VAT concessions on agricultural inputs are not justified by market failures and are likely to have
     an economic cost because they may induce a change in the pattern of production. The impact of
     the tax concession on agricultural inputs (e.g., investment and tractors) is similar to that of
     subsidies on agricultural inputs. These

     agriculture shows that private investment
     had gone up in 2011–12 before the VAT concessions were granted (Figure 3-2).
 71. Although a reduced VAT rate for agricultural products is quite common in European countries,
     the efficiency and equity rationale for supporting that approach does not apply in Moldova.
     Extending reduced VAT rates to food affects the efficiency of a VAT system and increases
     complexity, which in turn increases administrative costs (for system operation and monitoring) and
     compliance. Compliance costs seem to be particular high for the food sector due to its multitude of
     products and the gray zone between sales of foods themselves and of prepared food. However,
     there are economic arguments for granting lower rates to very specific sectors, such as agriculture,
     and their theoretical and empirical merits need to be discussed. These arguments are based on
     grounds of both efficiency (heightening productivity or reducing structural unemployment) and
     equity (improving the income distribution or making particular products more accessible to the
     entire population (see Annex 11: . In practice, a reduced VAT rate for agricultural products is quite
     common in European countries. However, some of these arguments do not hold for Moldova; for
     example, the reduced VAT rate on certain agricultural products is in general regressive because it
     accrues mostly to higher-income quintiles (Figure 3-3).36 Thus, it is questionable whether the
     reduced VAT rate is the best instrument for improving income distribution, especially in countries
     like Moldova that have sound social security systems.

35
   An impact similar to that of the VAT concession would come from lowering fuel taxes for agricultural purposes—something
now being debated in Moldova. All else being equal, such a reduction could increase fuel usage and the production of
agricultural goods and services, not only market output but also non-market environmental goods and joint products.
36
   While the share of consumption spent on food and agricultural items whose VAT is subsidized is relatively flat (from 12.2 for
the bottom quintile to 13.4 for the 4th), richer groups consumer vastly more of these goods than poorer ones (over 33 percent
of total spending on these goods comes from the top quintile, against 10 percent from the bottom quintile).

3.4. What Might be Changed?
 72. The taxation and social security systems could be used to tackle agricultural problems in ways
     that are more efficient, more cost-effective, or more equitable. More effectively addressing
     structural impediments in Moldova’s agriculture sector requires both tax and non-tax incentives—
     or removal of disincentives—related to capital investment, farm consolidation, land utilization, and
     income support.

Incentives to Invest in Agriculture

 73. A proper investment structure is vital to support private investment and should be in place
     before considering specific tax incentives. The experience of other countries suggests that tax
     incentives for investment can be costly and are rarely the main determinant of whether to invest.
     That is why Moldova needs to focus directly on improving the environment for enabling investment
     to ensure that there is a proper context for investing in agriculture before considering specific
     incentives.37 Tax incentives to support investment include reductions in the statutory CIT rate;
     accelerated depreciation allowances for capital expenditures; enhanced depreciation allowances
     for capital expenditures; general or targeted investment tax credits; and financing incentives (see
     Annex 13). Capital allowances (accelerated depreciation or an investment tax credits) are likely to
     be more efficient and have fewer drawbacks than other types of tax concession (e.g., tax




37
  The OECD Policy Framework for Investment in Agriculture (PFIA), which aims to support countries evaluating and
designing policies to mobilize private investment (OECD 2013) could be a useful guide with several aspects relevant
for Moldova, including infrastructure development, financial sector development, human resources, research and
innovation, tax policy, and risk management.

      exemptions), and in many countries they are replacing income tax exemptions or reduced CIT
      rates.38
 74. Tax expenditures in Moldova could be redesigned to make them more effective in supporting
     investment and to increase the value for money in the use of public resources. The authorities
     could consider increasing the CIT rate for agriculture from 7 to the standard 12 percent, which
     would still be one of the lowest CIT rates in the world. The reduced CIT rate gives the largest
     benefits to high-return firms that are likely to have invested even without incentive. Moldova’s
     recent experience with a zero CIT rate has also demonstrated that the low rate did not have any
     incremental impact on investment in the country. Moreover, given its distortive nature and the lack
     of visible results, the authorities could consider removing the VAT exemption for machinery and
     tractors. The revenue gains from these changes could be used to offer more effective instruments
     to support investments in agriculture, such as a capital allowance or tax credit similar to those used
     in more advanced countries. For instance, capital allowances for expenditures could be directed to
     improving the productivity of land or favoring environmental (soil-friendly) investments.39 Thus,
     with a CIT rate of 12 percent, an investment allowance of 50 percent of the amount invested
     equates to an investment credit of 6 percent of that amount and revenue foregone of about MLD
     100 million.

Incentives for Better Utilization of Land

 75. Better utilization of land, a crucial asset for agriculture, could make a significant difference in
     how the sector performs. There are several ways in which government might incentivize better
     land use, in particular by allowing foreigners to acquire land, adopting value-based taxation of
     property (which requires effective valuation of land and property), and taxing uncultivated land.
 76. Abolishing the limitation on land acquisition by foreigners can open the sector to new entrants
     who might bring in new resources and technology. Here, the experiences of Bulgaria and Romania
     are particularly useful (Vranken 2010), One option could be to allow foreign citizens to acquire
     agricultural land without restrictions up to a certain area (less than 10 ha) and allow foreign citizens
     to acquire farm buildings and the land on which these are built without restrictions. Both proposals
     could result in substantial economic benefits as foreign citizens investing in the agricultural sector
     in Moldova could combine renting and owning land in their farm operations, as do many farms in
     the EU.
 77. It would also be advisable to complete the process of revaluing agricultural land and property
     and to introduce a transparent value-based system for taxing property. Here, Lithuania provides a
     good example of a well-developed system of mass valuations with periodic revaluations using
38
  For instance, the evidence from Ireland is of an indicative impact on gross output of €1.9m for every €1m of
capital allowances claimed.
39
  Of course there are several design issues of this kind of tax incentives that need to be carefully thought-through to make it
work. Main include the definition of the eligible expenditures, the choice of the rate of the allowance or credit restrictions on
the use of the credit or allowance, the payable element of the credit and the treatment of any amounts of incentive that cannot
be used in the year that they are earned as a result of insufficient taxable income.


                                                              49
      different models for different types of property. Currently, the insignificant income from land taxes
      in Moldova is viewed as a factor preventing reallocation of agricultural lands to more efficient
      users, which leaves large areas uncultivated.
 78. Also worth considering might be introduction of a special tax on uncultivated land to incentivize
     better use of it, as has been done in Latvia, Croatia, and Romania.40 Introduction of a tax on
     uncultivated land in Moldova of about MLD 100/ ha could bring some in MLD 45 million for the
     state budget annually (assuming that the amount of uncultivated land in Moldova totals 0.2 million
     ha and full compliance will be achieved).

Support for Farmer Incomes

 79. Given the impact of the agriculture sector on the poverty map in Moldova, it is essential to raise
     farmers’ incomes and ensure that they are stable. In the short to medium term, there is a need to
     raise the basic incomes of the poorest farmers. Most advanced countries use social policies to
     protect incomes and provide support for farmers who are unable to adjust with social aid to
     families concentrated in means-tested schemes requiring an application. In reality, however, those
     with low incomes from agriculture often fall below the tax net, and not being part of the general
     tax system they cannot receive social system benefits. That is one reason why incentives are
     needed to report income, along with reducing the burden of taxation for small farmers.
 80. A presumptive tax regime would carry a lower tax burden and lower compliance costs. The
     incentive to report agriculture income in Moldova could be increased by introducing a simplified
     method of taxing individual farmers, with one option being a presumptive tax regime to replace PIT
     for this group. There are several types of presumptive taxes, such as. a patent, an indicator-based
     tax, a gross-basis turnover tax, and a net (adjusted) turnover tax, with a number of variants for
     each. The most common form is a turnover tax levied on gross revenues, which unlike a patent or
     indicator-based tax varies directly with the farm size. A turnover tax, besides addition to imposing a
     higher tax burden on less efficient farms, would tend to discourage allocation of capital to business
     activities where profit margins are relatively thin, thus not compromising equity and economic
     efficiency too much. Austria provides an example of this type of tax.41 In Moldova, the presumptive
     tax could be applied to agricultural producers with turnover below the VAT registration threshold,
     with cost deductions like those of Austria. Of course, the design of the tax should be non-distortive
     and help maintain equity with taxpayers covered by standard tax regimes. A presumptive tax is



40
  For instance, Latvia applies a tax rate of 3 percent to uncultivated land capable of agricultural use, compared to the normal
rate of 1.5 percent. The Romanian authorities intend to introduce a tax on uncultivated land that will oblige owners to work,
rent, or lease their land, or sell it, though the proposed annual tax of about €100 ($138.30) for each uncultivated hectare h as
yet to be passed. Croatia also applied a tax on uncultivated agricultural land between 2001 and 2007.
41
  The tax is applied to unincorporated businesses only; the tax base is measured as turnover minus wages, cost of
goods (inputs), and related taxes (including VAT on inputs), less “deductible expenses” measured simply as 12 per
cent of turnover (up to a maximum of €26,400). The simplified regime applies to businesses under a turnover
threshold that varies by business sector.


                                                               50
    introduced in the simplest form could bring in about MLD 50 million (5 percent tax rate applied to
    gross profits).
81. Building up prospects for higher incomes should be put on the long-term reform agenda.
    Ultimately, Moldova will need to move from improving incomes from current activities to
    improving labor productivity and facilitating adjustment to activities that might command higher
    returns. This means not only skills upgrading, technology improvement, and improving off-farm
    employment prospects in rural areas but also limiting disincentives to move out of agriculture. As
    discussed earlier, social security and property tax concessions discourage farmers from leaving the
    sector. Thus, it is worth considering removing the SSC reduction for farmers, which would not only
    reduce disincentives for labor to leave agriculture but also make the pension system more
    sustainable.
82. Reintroducing a unified VAT rate for agriculture could help limit production inefficiency and
    administrative costs. The reduction of the rate was intended to make agriculture more competitive
    by reducing costs, with the objective of boosting activity in the sector and creating jobs. It does not
    seem to have been very successful. As evidenced by the Mirrlees Review (2011) it may also lead to
    both consumption and production inefficiency (the distortion arising from favoring the industry
    that has a lower VAT rate). Evidence from other EU countries is that administrative costs are high
    due to constant delineation problems linked to making distinctions between different kinds of
    food. Thus, Moldova should consider returning to taxing all food at a standard rate. Since the
    change would have negative impact on households with the lowest incomes (see Annex 12), part of
    the revenue gains should be used to compensate those most affected. Three groups that could be
    given priority for a compensation program are (1) beneficiaries of Ajutor Social, the current
    guaranteed minimum income program, which could add a top-up to compensate for the VAT
    increase; (2) the poor, since protecting them from further economic hardship should be a priority;
    and (3) the poor and other who have become vulnerable to poverty due to the VAT increase. With
    such focused targeting, the compensation would absorb a mere 6 percent of the budget currently
    absorbed by the reduced VAT rate. Thus, an increase in the reduced VAT rate for agriculture could
    not only limit production inefficiency and administrative costs but allow for cost-efficient income
    distribution.
83. The proposed changes to tax expenditures could bring the budget extra revenues. Several
    measures could bring in higher revenues, with the largest being to do away with the reduced VAT
    rate (see Table 3.4). Significant revenue gains would also come from a new land utilization tax if the
    government decided to levy MLD 100 / ha of unutilized land. The assumption of a rate of 5 percent
    on gross profit for a presumptive tax would give revenues of about 0.04 percent of GDP, though
    clearly the cost of the simplified system will depend on the tax rate and decision of who is in the
    tax base. At the same time, spending will increase by MLD 170 million, 0.2 percent of GDP, to cover
    introduction of programs to compensate those affected by the VAT change, a new investment tax
    credit/allowance, and the simplified method for taxing the incomes of individual farmers. The net
    effect of the proposed changes is likely to be additional revenues of about 0.5 percent of GDP.

Conclusions and Recommendations
84. Tax expenditures for agriculture in Moldova have a serious cost and do not effectively address
    the challenges identified for the sector. They do not seem to have been effective in (1) providing
    income support for farmers to reduce their poverty; (2) fostering structural change in the sector
    and the whole economy; or (3) offering an incentive for the sector to become more competitive.
    Concessions granted on taxation of income property and social security encourage workers to stay
    in the sector and do not help attract new, more productive entrants. VAT concessions are not
    effective in attracting investment in fixed assets and equipment upgrades—if there are any
    economic efficiency gains of a reduced VAT rate, they are not evident. Instead, concessions involve
    substantial administrative costs. Moreover, the current tax system does not provide incentives for
    consolidation or better utilization of land, fails to heighten the market orientation of semi-
    subsistence farms, and does not address poverty in the sector. Most of the concessions violate at
    least one of the basic principles of a fair and effective taxation system; the special VAT
    arrangements for agriculture seem not to respect any of them. Finally, tax expenditures in
    agriculture represent a significant fiscal cost of about 0.6 percent of GDP, which constitutes about
    40 percent of Moldova’s direct budget spending on agriculture.
85. The taxation and social security systems could be used to tackle agricultural problems in ways
    that are more efficient, more cost-effective, or more equitable with the net effect of the
    proposed changes likely to result in extra revenues of about 0.5 percent of GDP. Addressing
    structural impediments in Moldova’s agriculture sector more effectively requires a range of both
    tax and non-tax incentives—or removal of disincentives—related to capital investment, farm
    consolidation, land utilization, and income support:

                                                  52
   Increasing the CIT rate for agricultural enterprises to the standard 12 percent and removing
    the VAT exemption for machinery and tractors would bring revenue gains from offering
    more effective tax instruments to support investments in agriculture, such as a capital
    allowance or tax credit similar to those used in more advanced countries.

   Better use of land can be incentivized by (1) abolishing the limitation on land acquisition by
    foreigners, in order to the sector to new entrants who might bring in new resources and
    technology; (2) effective valuation of land and property, which is vital to adopting value-
    based taxation of property; and (3) introducing a special tax on uncultivated land.


   At the same time it is vital to provide income support to the poorest farmers. Introducing a
    presumptive turnover-based tax, with a low tax burden and low compliance costs, would
    bring low-income farmers back into the tax net and make them eligible for means-tested
    social assistance. To strengthen prospects for higher incomes through sector restructuring
    it is crucial to limit the disincentives to moving out of agriculture and consider removing
    the reduction in the SSC rate for farmers. Last but not least, re-introducing a unified VAT
    rate for agricultural products (while ensuring proper compensation for low-income
    households) could help limit production inefficiency and administrative costs.

Annex 1: Modernization and restructuring of agri-food industry and adapting it to EU standards – the
experience of Poland.

Reaping the benefits of the trade integration with the EU depends to large extent on the ability to meet
the body of Community legislation with the adoption of the acquis communautaire being the main
priority of the EU accession process. For agriculture this includes the sensitive areas of veterinary and
phytosanitary legislation and in eight CEE countries joining the EU in 2004 required significant
investment in restructuring and upgrading the agri-food industry to make it competitive, and to comply
with EU quality and sanitary standards. Especially, huge investments were necessary to adapt to EU
standards in the meat and dairy sectors.

Among the eight CEE countries joining the EU in 2004 Poland appeared to have most pronounced
problems with adjusting to EU regulation, in particular regarding health rules of the production and
processing of dairy products, where (as of 2003) national legislation was only partly in compliance with
EU regulations (similar to Bulgaria and Romania). But also in other countries full implementation and
enforcement of the acquis with respect to health rules of the production and processing of dairy and
meat products faced some challenges due to a shortage of well-trained and qualified staff, an ineffective
monitoring and/or penalty systems or unclear divisions of authority and competencies. Furthermore,
the huge investments necessary to adapt to EU standards caused severe problems.

In 2002 only 15% of enterprises in the dairy sector in Poland had a license to export to the EU with 35%
of production satisfying the criteria for export to the EU – among the lowest shares in the EU8. The cost
of complying with EU standards was estimated at 600m EUR and regardless of significant support being
provided under the SAPARD and national programs considerable part was to be taken by the enterprises
(with 25% of dairy enterprises and ca. 10% of capacity expected forced to close down because not being
able to comply to EU standards). As for the meat industry the cost was estimated at 1bn EUR with ca.
40% of meat processing enterprises and ca 15% of capacity estimated to be forced to close down due to
not being able to comply with EU standards.

Annex 2: Determinants of TFP in agriculture

There is an extensive literature about the determinants of TFP in agriculture. Some authors (e.g. Bravo-
Ortega and Lederman, 2012 or Mundlak, Yair, 2001) consider such measures as an illiteracy rate, paved
roads or telephone lines as important determinants of agriculture productivity. Given significant
correlation of such factors as the number of telephone lines or illiteracy rate with GDP per capita, in our
analysis we focused only on agriculture-specific determinants of productivity. According to Cimpoies et
al.(2008), three main problems of Moldovan agriculture are orientation to export, climate vulnerability
and land fragmentation.

The impact of land fragmentation on productivity was quite extensively researched and described it the
literature – in general there is a positive correlation between farm size and productivity (e.g.
Adamopoulos, Restuccia, 2011).However, for Moldova the relationship is different and small farms are
more productive (see Lerman, Sutton (2008)) The reason for this difference is probably due to the fact
that in Moldova large farms are, in general, big conglomerates, that were previously state owned farms
and are equipped with obsolete materials and technologies and resist modernization.

To see the relationship between country specific TFP rate (in our analysis we decided to exclude time
variability as this is to large extend due to weather and country fixed effect as a proxy of country specific
agriculture productivity. As the overall level of development (captured by the level of GDP per capita)
was already included in the production function, we decided to exclude variables which correlate with
them from the regression analysis and focused on the variables, which, theoretically should not be
correlated with GDP. Therefore, we considered following variables:
     Share of livestock in agriculture product (as a proxy for agriculture specialization);

       Share of irrigated land;
       Share of permanent crops area in overall agricultural area (land utilization);

       The variability of agriculture output;
       Share of export in agricultural production;
       Average size of agriculture holding (a proxy for land fragmentation);
       Orthogonalized government outlays on agriculture


Some variables were included in logs if the distribution of values in the sample or theoretical reasons
suggested to do so. The results of that exercise are presented in the table below. In general, they are not
surprising, robust and immune to the changes in specification.
Results clearly show that there are a few equally important determinants of agricultural productivity.
The most important components are land utilization, irrigation, variability of agricultural output and
government outlays on agriculture. Therefore, government outlays are only one way to increase the
agricultural output, the other ways are increase in the utilization of land and reduce variability of output
(possibly through irrigation). As almost all variables enter the equation in log (standard specifications
were also tested but caused estimation problems) their impact is multiplicative, so increase in utilization

                                                      55
of land or drop in availability will increase the efficiency of agriculture spending. The result for the
average size of agriculture holding is somewhat puzzling, as they are no clear correlation between TFP in
agriculture sector and average size of agriculture holding. However, in almost all cases, the coefficients
are positive. Also, share of export helps to explain the differences of TFP between countries, however, in
that case, the causality runs the other way round – countries with higher TFP are more competitive on
international markets so they manage to send more output to other states.

Annex 3: Local mapping of Agriculture Expenditures

The local mapping for the agricultural sector shows that the institutional and financing structure for
agriculture is complex.42 The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI) is the principal
government body responsible for funding and administering agricultural policy. Between 2009-13, the
budget of MAFI and its subordinated agencies/deconcentrated regional offices accounts for
approximately 88 percent of the sector budget on average. A significant number of subordinate agencies
and institutions 43 are not directly part of MAFI but under its oversight and funding, which complicates
effective management of the funds allocated to agriculture. 44 Public services in agriculture that are
non-MAFI managed include mainly agricultural research activities as part of the Academy of Sciences
budget for vocational school (6.6) percent and irrigation (2.4 percent) administered by the Ministry of
Environment for irrigation. In addition to these, there are some agriculture-related expenditures under
the Cadaster Agency for soil fertility activities, approximately 2 percent. However, it is an extremely
small amount and it is not included in the estimates due to difficulties in separating the recurrent and
capital agriculture-specific allocations. Lastly, the share of local spending in the sector budget is
negligible (less than 1 percent over 2009–13).




42
   The local mapping is different from the COFOG definition but it captures the amount allocated to the agricultural
sector only, excluding forestry, fisheries and other non-directly related spending. The local mapping will used for
any internal and sector comparison.
43
   The total number of active institutions amounts to more than 25 plus 20 VET schools
44
    MAFI is represented by its core central unit along with other agencies/inspectorates, such as “Main State
Inspectorate for Phytosanitary Quarantine”, “State Inspectorate for Seeds of RM”, “State Inspectorate for
Selection and Reproduction in Animal Husbandry”, “Consolidated Unit to implement the International Fund for
Agricultural Development”, etc. At the sub national level, MAFI is represented through its deconcentrated offices
(Food Security Directorates).

                                      Public Services in Agriculture

The agriculture education budget is allocated approximately 50/50 between the 8 agricultural
colleges and the Agricultural University. There are also about 20 vocational schools that teach
agricultural subjects, but these are funded through the Ministry of Education budget (not part of
MAFI budget). The Agricultural University offers courses in about 25 specialties ranging from
traditional agricultural technical subjects such as agronomy, horticulture, animal husbandry to more
general subjects such as economics and law. Agricultural colleges offer more narrow specializations,
such as accounting, food technology, viticulture, mechanization. However, the curricula for most of
the courses taught in agricultural education institutions had undergone little adjustments since old
times. Even though education expenditures are the largest PEA budget item, these are considered
highly insufficient to ensure adequate development of the agricultural education system, including
teachers’ trainings, updating of curricula, repair of buildings, upgrading of equipment and other
needs.
The image of VET schools in the Moldovan society is particularly negative and is reflected in the
decreasing number of students. Considering that most of the agricultural population is presently
represented by family farmers the level of specialization taught in VET institutions is way too narrow.
The young people trained in agricultural VET schools presently do not receive the kind of training that
would help them become successful polyvalent farmers as small-scale entrepreneurs. More than 20
years after the dismantling of the collective farm system in agriculture and appearance of small family
farms in Moldova, there is still no curriculum developed for training of self-employed farmers
entrepreneurs.
Ag research expenditures are part of the Academy of Sciences budget and come to finance the
research activities of six institutes and the Agricultural University. Each research institute is in charge
of a certain agricultural sub-sector/ area (such as field crops, horticulture, soil protection, animal
breeding), while the research area of the Agricultural University is somewhat broader. Apart from
research activities, some institutes are heavily involved in commercial activities (seed and seedling
production, multiplication and sale) these activities bringing additional extra-budgetary revenue to
the institutes. The agricultural research system has not managed to break with the past and
reconnect with the private sector, it still operates in relative isolation and is fairly weak. Under-
funded, struggling with dilapidated inventories and inadequate resources, aging of staff (due to low
salaries), the existing research institutes are in a survival mode. There is no clear procedure/process
established on consulting the selected research topics with the end-users of the research, i.e.
representatives of the farming and business community. The risk of irrelevance appears particularly
critical as long as the research institutes continue to operate in isolation from the private sector and
from the international R&D system. The interlinking of research and commercial activities is not a
healthy situation either, leading to inefficiencies and distorted public policies (e.g., research institutes
lobbying for restrictive access to imported plant varieties thus undermining farmers’ interests).
The core food safety budget is allocated to the National Food Safety Agency (ANSA), the single food

                                                     61
safety authority in charge of ensuring the control over the entire food chain “from farm to fork”.
ANSA was set up in 2013 and was the result of merger of several public institutions previously
responsible for various aspects of food safety and quality management. This institutional
restructuring does not seem to have led to budget savings so far (the 2013 ANSA budget was similar
to pre-2013 annual budgets allocated to food safety institutions). ANSA presently employs about
1500 people and disposes of a central office, 35 regional offices and 18 border control points. ANSA,
strongly supported by donors, is presently pro-actively engaged in harmonizing its legal and
institutional framework with EU practices and requirements, and significant progress has been made
in various areas of food safety and quality control. However, significant efforts are still needed to set
up a robust, reliable and effective domestic food safety system comprising the key elements of: (i)
bringing food safety requirements and norms in line with internationally accepted practices; (ii)
optimizing the laboratory setup, improving the reliability of lab testing and achieving laboratory
accreditation; (iii) transitioning to risk-based inspections and controls; and (iv) setting up advanced
information and data management systems.
The Anti-Hail Service is in charge of organizing and executing active cloud influence works aimed at
reducing the damages caused by hail. This is a large structure employing over 1400 people comprising
of a central office, 12 regional units, and within each regional unit there are several ‘rocket points’
equipped with anti-hail launchers, rockets, storages and dwellings. The anti-hail coverage is extended
mainly to high-value production areas (such as orchards and vineyards), while annual anti-hail
allocations may vary significantly depending on hail propensity forecasts/conditions on the covered
areas. Earlier World Bank studies45 indicated that there is no formal research demonstrating the cost
effectiveness of such a hail prevention system, and that a cost-benefit analysis should be carried out
to compare the efficiency of the current anti-hail rocket approach to a risk-reduction approach based
on hail insurance. The studies conclude that since there is no scientific evidence on the effectiveness
of the hail prevention system, there is a need to consider hail insurance options.
Expenditures for irrigation are allocated to the Water Agency (subordinated to the Ministry of
Environment) that is in charge of managing the large-scale central irrigation systems (CIS). The Water
Agency manages 78 CIS located throughout the country, which have the (theoretical) capacity to
irrigate as much as 144,000 hectares of land. In reality, only 7,000-15,000 ha are irrigated on annual
basis by the use of CIS, and out of 121 operating irrigation stations only 40-50 are being utilized. So
the bulk of annual budget allocations for irrigation (about 75% of total) are in fact staff costs – WA
employs over 1000 people (mainly CIS operators and guards). The rest – up to 5 million MDL on
annual basis – is used for maintenance and rehabilitation of irrigation systems. It is unlikely that this
limited amount is sufficient to perform adequate maintenance of the CIS, much less serious
rehabilitation. However, without a significant rehabilitation of the central irrigation systems, and the

consequent expansion of irrigated areas, fees collections from water users will also be insufficient for
maintenance. Earlier studies on this topic46 concluded that prospects for the Water Agency to
properly operate and maintain the CIS over the longer term were limited, and recommended
irrigation management transfer to WUAs as the only viable option for long-term sustainability of the
CIS in Moldova. The Ministry of Environment has recently reported that a concept is presently under
preparation aiming for a comprehensive reform of the irrigation management system in view of
rationalizing the public spending and ensuring a better service to its clients, including CIS
management transfer to WUAs, where feasible.

The Advisory Service carried out by the Rural Development Agency has been created in Moldova in
early 2000 with the support of the World Bank and SIDA, while the full financing of this service has
been picked up by the public budget in mid-2013, when the donor funding ceased. The extension
network is managed from the head office located in Chisinau and consists of 35 regional offices that
involve 75 regional consultants and 350 local consultants operating within village mayoralties. The
services of the network are presently provided to the farmers free of charge. The coverage and the
efficiency of the extension network are estimated as high and continuously improving. Presently, the
network is present in every rayon, covers over 40 percent of villages/mayoralties and over 50 percent
of farms. Services are provided to all types of farms, including small subsistence farms which form the
largest client group. Most of the advice offered relates to production technologies (52 percent of
services in 2014), while other consultancy areas include marketing (16% of services), business (20%)
and legal advice (12%).
Testing and registration of new crop varieties is done by a public institution – State Commission for
Testing of Plant Varieties (shortly referred to as Seeds Commission) subordinated to MAFI. The
operation of this institution is mandated by Moldova’s legal requirement to test any new variety
before allowing it for sale on the domestic market. So the clients of the Seeds Commission are either
local breeders (mainly ag research institutes) or seed importers that want to introduce on the market
a variety that is not yet registered in the national catalogue of plant varieties (for a charge). The Seeds
Commission has a central office as well as regional stations/labs with adjacent land plots for carrying
out the field tests (the total land area managed by the SC – 840 ha). Most of the varieties tested by
the SC are imported. There is a long standing discussion in Moldova about the need to change the
role of the Seeds Commission from a prescriptive to a consultative one by abolishing the mandatory
requirement to test the new varieties that are used in other countries although not yet registered in
Moldova. This change would better serve the needs of the private sector by offering immediate
access to new modern plant varieties developed elsewhere. Under the renewed mandate the Seeds
Commission would carry on the variety tests with the purpose of identifying and recommending
varieties that perform best in the pedo-climatic conditions of Moldova, concomitantly not precluding
the use of imported varieties.

Annex 7: Preferential Tax Treatment in Agriculture

Defining preferential tax treatment of agriculture requires an exact definition of the agriculture sector
and agreement on what constitutes tax relief (concession).To define agriculture it is necessary to define
who qualifies as a farmer and distinguish agricultural activity from the provision of other land-based
goods and services, such as housing for farmers and others in rural areas. In broad terms, tax
expenditures are concessions that fall outside a tax norm or benchmark (World Bank 2004). A useful and
more detailed description is “any law … that exempts, in whole or in part, certain persons, income,
goods, services, or property from the impact of established taxes, including, but not limited to, tax
deductions, tax deferrals, preferential tax rates, and tax credits” (State of Oregon 2003).

In this study tax expenditures are defined as tailored reductions in tax liability. Special tax incentives or
tax expenditures that generate reductions in tax revenue constitute a fiscal advantage conferred on
farmers individually or the agriculture sector as a whole .Tax expenditures may take the following forms:
     Exemptions: amounts excluded from the tax base
     Allowances: amounts deducted from the “normal” or benchmark regime to arrive at the tax
         base
     Credits: amounts deducted from tax liability
     Reduced rate: a special tax rate applied to a specific class of taxpayers or taxable transactions
     Tax deferral: a relief that takes the form of a delay in paying taxes

The farmer is defined in this study as an individual enterprise or operation based on private ownership
of farmland and related property, with family members working personally to earn income from the
production of agricultural products. Their activity must consist in the primary processing of agricultural
produce, which extends to commercializing their production. The area of land being cultivated or
otherwise farmed and income from renting agricultural implements and land from the individual farm
should provide more than 50 percent of the farmer's annual earnings. Agricultural producers may be
joint stock companies, limited liability companies, or agricultural cooperatives.

Measuring the Costs of Tax Expenditures

Measuring tax expenditure costs and effects is very complex. While there is broad agreement in theory
on the definition of tax expenditures, there seems to be no well-accepted methodology for estimating
them (Canada, Department of Finance 2001. Internationally there is a range of approaches to costing tax
expenditures, with some of them quite broad in terms of what forms of concessions are covered. In
principle, costing out a tax expenditure involves comparison with a benchmark tax system (what is
normal), based on the methodology chosen. Estimates of tax expenditures depend heavily on the choice
of the “normal” or benchmark regime against which treatment of agriculture can be compared. Thus,
the choice of benchmark is more than technical; it is rooted in different views of the normative tax base
(OECD 2004). There are two broad approaches to this choice:




                                                     65
       The conceptual approach, in which the benchmark is defined as an abstract tax system that is
        seen to have desirable neutrality properties in that it does not give particular tax advantages to
        a limited number of people or activities.
       An approach based on current tax law, but without provisions seen as benefitting particular
        groups of people or businesses or favoring particular activities, such as research or investment
        in pensions.


There are also different methods for estimating the costs of tax expenditures with the following three
principal methods distinguished in the literature:

       The Foregone Revenue Method is an ex post quantification of the reduction in tax revenue
        relative to a benchmark due to tax expenditures. It does not take into account changes in the
        behavior of individuals.
       The Outlay Equivalent Method estimates the subsidy or transfer that would leave taxpayers with
        an income net of taxes similar to what they would obtain if the tax expenditure applied.
       The Revenue Gain Method measures how much revenue could increase if a particular tax
        concession were removed. Accurate estimation of this cost requires estimating the secondary or
        behavioral effects associated with the change.

The method applied in this study was the foregone revenue approach with the estimations referring to
the last year for which data are available (usually 2014) and are calculated using and current tax law
benchmarks. The method is based on quantification of the decrease in revenues that would be caused if
the taxpayer did not take advantage of the tax relief. In other words, this is a static calculation of lost
revenues incurred by the public sector.
Naturally, some simplifications are used in calculating tax expenditures in this study as quantifying the
real amount of tax relief is difficult. Measurement of fiscal costs is only the first step in the process of
evaluating tax expenditures. A full-fledged economic evaluation requires an even more comprehensive
approach involving (1) identification of the evolution and role of a tax expenditure in relation to policy
objectives and in comparison with alternative instruments; (2) measurement of the behavioural
responses that are crucial for judging the effects of the relief; (3) simulation and accounting methods to
generate estimates of the effects; and (4) an analysis of the formal legal rules through which relief is
delivered to identify administrative and compliance costs. This study uses a simple method to measure
the costs and gauge the economic effects of tax expenditures (for assessment of how tax expenditures
relate to policy objectives, see the next section).

Annex 8: Calculating VAT GAP

Quantitative assessment of the VAT gap is based on the supply and use matrices and theoretical
assessment of taxes that should be collected. Several numbers are calculated on the basis of these data:
       Output VAT – total output of sector s*VAT rate for sector s (      )
       Input VAT credit –,the VAT that was paid by the sector and is deducted from the VAT bill (∑ input
        from sector s to sector r*VAT rate for sector s), (    )
     Investment VAT credit (investment in sector s*VAT rate for sector s), (       )
     Import VAT (total imports of sector s* VAT rate of sector s) (      )
     Export VAT credit (as export is exempted from VAT in most countries to avoid double taxation)
        (Export of sector s * VAT rate of sector s), (    ).
The total VAT that should be collected from sector s is then calculated as follows:

                            (       )            ∑

where     is the percentage of output by non-registrants.

In calculating the compliance gap¸ the VAT rates that are taken into account are those implied by
current legislation whereas in calculating the policy gap the basic tax rate is used.
Some caveats must be kept in mind in analysing the results of such a simple analysis. First and foremost,
it does not take into account the consumption shift resulting from the change of relative prices. Such
effects may be quite large, since the reduced VAT rate in place for agricultural products may be replaced
by home production. The second important problem is that the percentage of output that is exempt is a
rather rough estimate based on tax authority data. Moreover, the percentage of output by non-
registrants ( ) is also a very approximate number may be dependent on the VAT rates. Therefore, the
results of such exercise should be treated as a first estimate of the tax gap rather than complex and
robust estimations.

Annex 10: Fundamental Principles of a Fair and Effective Tax System

An effective tax system is equitable, supports economic growth, and has minimal impact on taxpayer
behavior. It should be based on several general principles and take into account the specific objectives
and characteristics of each sector. The three fundamental tax principles for a fair and effective tax
system are
     Equity: The tax system must treat taxpayers in different sectors of the economy equitably.
        People with similar incomes should pay similar rates—horizontal equity. There is also
        widespread agreement that vertical equity should apply: people with higher incomes should on
        average pay a higher effective tax rate.
     Incentive: The tax system should facilitate and support economic growth and job generation. In
        particular, it should not operate as a disincentive for those with low incomes to become
        employed or as a disincentive to enterprise, innovation, and investment. Finally, it should not
        distort production and trade.

       Economic Neutrality: This term covers a number of characteristics that ensure that the behavior
        of taxpayers is not unduly influenced: (1) The tax base should be as broad as possible and tax
        rates as low as possible. (2) Taxation of income from different sources—employment, self-
        employment, investment, pensions—should be taxed equitably. (3) Administrative and
        compliance costs should not be excessive.

Annex 11: Reduced VAT rates for food and agricultural products – pros and cons

There is a number of economic arguments for granting lower rates to very specific sectors, e.g.
agriculture. The pros and cons of these arguments can be summarized as follows47:

     1. Compliance cost. Extending reduced VAT rates to food, as Moldova does, affects the efficiency
        of a VAT system and increases complexity, which in turn increases the administrative costs (for
        system operation and monitoring) and compliance costs. The latter seem to be particularly high
        for the food sector due to the multitude of products and the gray zone between sales of food
        and of prepared food served in restaurants. Reduced rates on food also tend to make do-it-
        yourself cooking economically more attractive than visiting restaurants.

2. Higher productivity and employment. Permanently lowering the VAT rate on a particular good or
   service is expected to lead to its lower price, which in turn translates, as evidence suggest, into
   increased consumer demand for this particular good or service. Thus, production and employment
   in the sector producing that good will correspondingly expand to meet the higher demand.
   However, the strength and swiftness of the production and employment response depend on
   consumer response to lower prices and the degree of competition within the sector. If consumption
   is price-inelastic—typically the case for basic goods, such as food— production and employment
   will not increase much. An empirical study of the EU countries found that food is price-inelastic: a
   drop of 1 percent in food prices expands food consumption by less than 0.5 percent. In sectors
   where there is little competition, pass-through to prices may be less than full, which mutes the
   impact on production and employment.
          Second, there is a convincing argument for extending reduced VAT rates to sectors whose
   services are easily substituted for do-it-yourself or underground work (EU 2009), and that is that
   high VAT rates make it very expensive to buy these services or products on the market and more
   attractive to supply oneself. The implication is that high-skilled professionals spend time on low-
   skilled work at home rather than spending time with their families or increasing their more
   productive labor supply.48
          Third, there is a theoretical but not an empirical argument for extending reduced VAT rates to
   sectors that employ many low-skilled workers in order to boost demand for them. In theory, by
   boosting demand for agricultural products, reduced VAT rates stimulate demand for low-skilled
   workers and push up their wages so that employment becomes a more attractive option than
   unemployment. In practice, the impact will be more pronounced the larger the share of low-skilled
   jobs in the favored sector relative to the rest of the economy, especially if it is a non-tradable sector
   that is not very vulnerable to competition from abroad. If like agriculture the sector is tradable, part
   of the increase in demand would go to increasing imports, boosting low-skilled employment abroad

47
  See Copenhagen Economics (2007).
48
  This argument, however, does not apply to the food products that were granted reduced rates in Moldova. It is
difficult to imagine that high market prices will induce skilled professionals to start producing their own milk or
sugar.


                                                         71
     rather than at home. Again, empirical work on EU countries found evidence that the overall impact
     on demand for low-skilled workers stemming from reduced VAT rates for food product is not
     impressive.

     3. Better distribution of income. Lower VAT rates on essential goods are typically introduced to
        ensure that the items are more affordable for lower-income households. Reducing VAT rates on
        food that constitutes a larger share of consumption for low-income than for high-income
        households implies a cost saving. The larger the difference in consumption shares is, the more
        effective the argument. Unfortunately, the evidence shows that the argument has empirical
        support only in countries where income inequality is high, which is not true of Moldova. As such
        measures are universal, however, they also imply that the discount is also enjoyed by better-off
        households. Furthermore, to the extent that better-off households consume more in absolute
        terms than poorer households, higher-income households might be receiving a higher share of
        the VAT subsidy than lower-income ones.

Except for Denmark, all advanced EU countries have lower VAT rates for food and agricultural products,
with the tax rates ranging from 0 percent in Ireland and the U.K. to 15 percent in Norway. However, in
the new member states, the use of reduced VAT rates for food products is less common. Among
Moldova’s benchmark countries, using reduced VAT rates and standard rates are equally popular, but in
general, standard rates in these countries are lower than those in the EU, so the burden on producers is
less onerous. In addition, simplified or special VAT regimes for agriculture are used by many countries in
the EU (usually available to small farms), as well as in Ukraine49. Such special VAT regimes allow
agricultural producers to accumulate VAT at special accounts and spend these funds for production
purposes without transferring them to the budget.




49
  At present the special VAT treatment of agriculture products in Ukraine is not referring to small farms. However,
the government of Ukraine is now in the process of bringing preferential VAT treatment of agriculture closer to the
general VAT regime (as a step to harmonize it with the EU standards).

Annex 12: Distributional Impact of a VAT Increase for Agricultural Products

Lower-income households are likely to suffer due to the squeeze on their budgets that would result if
the VAT rate on agricultural products went up from 8 to 20 percent. To capture these effects, as table B1
shows, simulated different combinations of changes of the VAT have been simulated and their poverty
impacts analyzed. The analysis is based on simulating in the micro-data (HBS 2013) the purchasing
power loss experienced by each household, based on its consumption patterns before the VAT increase.
The analysis does not consider possible substitutions between goods but shows two different
assumptions about the pass-through of the price increase.

On the assumption that the entire increase in the VAT would be passed on to consumers, the poverty
impacts or raising the VAT on all categories of agricultural products is 0.6 percentage points, which is
roughly equivalent to 22,000 more people becoming poor. A lower pass-through would restrain this
poverty impact. Interestingly, increasing the VAT on agricultural products, dairies, and grains would have
the same poverty impact as abolishing all the other exceptions on the VAT.

Increases

Urban and rural areas will be affected differently. Urban areas, which in the baseline start with a much
lower poverty rate (4.6 percent, compared to 18.8 percent in rural areas) would see only a marginal
increase in poverty of an 0.2 percentage point from the combined effect of raising the VAT on
agricultural products, dairy, and grains. In contrast, in rural areas the increase in poverty incidence
would amount to 1 percentage point.

Given that the poverty impacts of raising the VAT rate are not negligible, there is scope for reallocating
resources saved by abolishing the reduced VAT rate to compensate poor and vulnerable groups.
TableB.2 shows in absolute terms and as a share of the estimated current expenditure on the reduced
VAT rate, the costs of compensating different groups. It presents results for three groups, though many
others would be possible. The groups that could be given priority for compensation are: (1) beneficiaries
of Adjudor Popular, the current Guaranteed Minimum Income program, which could add a top-up to
compensate for the increase in the VAT; (2) the poor, on the ground that protecting them from further
economic hardship should be a priority; and (iii) the poor and those who are vulnerable to poverty due
to the VAT increase.

These are rough scenarios in that they assume that the targeted groups can be identified perfectly and
that there are no administrative costs in delivering the targeted subsidy, but they do give a sense of the
fiscal savings that could be obtained from replacing a universal subsidy with a targeted one. In
particular, adding a top up to Adjudor Popular, even as Moldova is seeking to expand its coverage,
would absorb the least resources, both because the program reaches only a limited number of people
and because the administrative costs of a top-up would be minimal, since the whole targeting and
administrative system is already in place. Reaching the other two groups would be more complicated, so
that the estimated costs as a share of resources underestimate the true resources required. Still,
because of the targeted nature of the compensation suggested, less than 6 percent of the budget
currently absorbed by the VAT discount would be absorbed by compensation of all the poor and
vulnerable.

Annex 13: Tax Incentives and Investment in SMEs

Most modern investment models are usually based on the neoclassical theory that a representative firm
maximizes the present value of its expected profits. The two most common models following this
tradition are the theory of the user cost of capital and the Q-theory. The basic reasoning behind the
former, introduced by Jorgenson (1963) and Hall and Jorgenson (1967), is that a firm decides to invest
when marginal benefits exceed marginal costs. For this model the cost of investment is a function of the
returns required on debt and equity and an adjustment for corporate taxes. Thus, corporate taxes on
profits increase the cost, while allowances for depreciation and investment tax credits reduce it. This
relation can be expressed as follows:
(Y/K)(1 – u) = (r + d)(1 – A)      [1a]

or equivalently,

Fk = (r + d)(1 – A)/(1 – u)   1b

In equation 1b, the term Fk = (Y/K) represents the increase in gross revenues (Y) accompanying a (one
currency) unit increase in the representative firm’s capital stock (K). With diminishing returns to
installed capital at the margin, Fk falls as the capital stock increases. Revenues from investment at the
margin are subject to the statutory or “headline” CIT rate, denoted by (u). The left -hand-side of 1a
measures the after-tax marginal benefit from an additional unit of investment.
This framework is useful for considering the channels through which various tax incentives may operate
to encourage investment. First, reducing the statutory CIT rate will increase the after-tax revenues from
investment at the margin, which tends to lead to a higher equilibrium for capital stock. A reduction in
the CIT rate, however, also lowers the present value of deductible depreciation allowances, which
lowers A. A reduction in the CIT rate also increases the after-tax cost of debt financing by reducing the
value of interest deductions, which also acts to lower A. Therefore, the impact on investment incentives
of a reduction in the CIT rate is ambiguous. However, the first-noted effect will generally dominate with
typical parameters, implying that investment incentives will be increased by a reduction in the corporate
tax rate.
Second, introducing or enriching a system of investment tax credits increases the value of A, which
tends to encourage investment at the margin. Similarly, increasing the rate at which capital can be
depreciated for tax purposes (e.g., accelerated depreciation, or immediate and full expensing of capital
costs) increases A and thereby investment incentives. Depending on the rate and design of the
investment tax credit and capital cost allowance (i.e., tax depreciation) regime, the term (1 – A) may be
negative and the tax system on balance may operate to encourage rather than discourage investment
relative to the no-tax case. Such situations lead to an increased benefit when costs rise and so are
particularly susceptible to tax avoidance and inefficient investment.
Third, government policy can influence the firm’s pre-corporate tax cost of finance (r). As already noted,
the cost of finance, which generally is some weighted average of equity and debt finance, will tend to
increase if the statutory CIT rate is reduced. In some cases, the cost of equity financing may be a

function of personal tax parameters, such as the degree of relief from double taxation (corporate and
personal tax integration). In particular, reductions in shareholder dividend tax rates and capital gains tax
rates may lower the cost of funds for SMEs that obtain financing from domestic rather than
international capital markets.
