PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This study forms one of the case studies of a larger study on Green Urban Development commissioned by the World
Bank and co-funded by The Nature Conservancy. Anchor Environmental Consultants (Anchor) was subcontracted
by AECOM to undertake case studies in three cities: Kampala, Uganda; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and Durban, South
Africa. Each city was consulted as to the focus of the case study. In the case of Dar es Salaam, the city requested a
study to evaluate the potential costs and benefits of rehabilitating the Msimbazi River and catchment to address the
flooding problems associated with this river system. This study builds on the preparation of an Environmental Profile
for Dar es Salaam by AECOM, as well as on earlier work on flooding in the city led by one of our team members,
Raffaele de Risi.

The study was led by Drs Jane Turpie of Anchor Environmental Consultants and Timm Kroeger of The Nature
Conservancy. Gwyneth Letley and Katherine Forsythe of Anchor and Dr Liz Day of Freshwater Consulting Group
undertook the ecological and green urban design aspects of the study and associated costings. Dr Raffaele de Risi of
Bristol University and Dr Francesco de Paola of Naples University undertook the hydrological and hydraulic modelling
and flood damage estimates.

We are grateful to the Dar es Salaam municipal staff for their interest and support of this project, in particular
to local World Bank consultant Amy Faust for her valuable inputs and assistance with data collation and to Mary
Bitekerezo (social development specialist) for her advice on resettlement. Nancy Lorenzo Garcia of the World Bank
kindly provided detailed land cover data.

Thanks to Roland White and Chyi-Yun Huang of the World Bank and Diane Dale, Brian Goldberg and John Bachmann
of AECOM for inputs and discussions during the project planning phase, as well as to Elizabeth Tellman (Arizona State
University) and Daniel Auerbach (U.S. EPA) for their technical guidance on hydrological aspects.

At the confluence with a Luhanga tributary (Figure 2.5)
there is still some remaining riparian vegetation, despite
the increases in density of people. This tributary drains a
large area of farmland to the north of the main Msimbazi
channel. Below this, the river has an extensive floodplain
area that is under dense unplanned settlement. Illegal
sand mining in the middle catchment has caused severe
degradation and destabilisation of the riparian zone.

Between the dumpsite and the Nelson Mandela Bridge
(see bottom left hand corner of Figure 2.7), there are
densely populated residential areas on both sides of the

the industrial area the floodplain opens up into a wide
area which is filled with agricultural fields on the south

Examination of the pollution levels within the mangroves

in the sediment amongst the mangroves are still lower
than those reported in some European and American
estuaries (Mrutu et al. 2013), the rate of increase has
been quite rapid (De Wolf et al. 2001).

The clay content in the soils in the Msimbazi estuary
play a large role in filtering these heavy metals out of
the polluted river water. The clay content of the top
layer ranged from 17-85%, making it potentially effective
at retaining heavy metals, however the retention
capability of the mangrove is exceeded by the amount
of heavy metals being deposited (Mrutu et al. 2013).
This indicates that pollution is still passing through the
mangrove system and therefore can reach and have
the potential to have negative effects on the coastal
environments.

A few studies of the nearshore environment just off
Dar es Salaam have also indeed showed that there is
also heavy metal contamination in these environments
(Mremi & Machiwa 2003, Mtanga and Machiwa 2007,
Muzuka 2007). In addition, Daudi et al. (2012) found that
the nutrient enrichment from the waters exiting from
the Msimbazi River mouth was having negative impacts
of a range of higher trophic levels species that inhabit
seagrass beds.

Overview                                                      Data requirements for flood risk assessment
Flood risk assessment encompasses three phases:               Riverine flooding phenomena can be triggered by natural
hazard, exposure and vulnerability assessment (Leader         processes, such as heavy precipitation, or by the failure

by means of the runoff coefficient that expresses the

3.0.2	   Hydrologic basin modelling
The aim of the hydrologic basin modelling is to produce
a series of hydrographs (the discharge [volume/time]
plotted against time), for different return-period flood
events. A systematic description of the procedure is
reported below.


3.3.2.1	 Identification of catchments
Catchment area characterization, which is done based
on the topography of the zone, is one of the first steps in
hydrographic basin analysis. The catchment refers to the
topographical area from which a watercourse, or a water
course section, receives surface water from rainfall
(and/or melting snow or ice). For the analysis domain
within Dar es Salaam, the river representing the greatest
threat is the Msimbazi River. Three catchments feed the
Msimbazi (Figure 3.11):

    is drained by the Mto Ng’ombe water course that

The exposure and vulnerability models
The analysis domain and the sub-domains cover portions
of all three municipalities in Dar es Salaam, as shown in
Figure 3.16, and represent one of the most populated
areas in the city. The analysis domain covers the sub-
wards of Ilala, Kinondoni, and Temeke. The study area
was chosen because it contains the low-lying densely
populated areas that have experienced recurrent flood
damages in the past, often annually or sub-annually.

According to the results presented in Section 3.2.3 and
represented in Figure 3.8, it is also possible to observe
that the analysis domain covers a big part of the city
center in which residential areas and economic activities
are concentrated. In this study, the buildings potentially
subject to the flood hazard were investigated in detail,
and were used as main elements of the exposed asset.
Appendix 2 contains a literature survey and presents the
estimation of the current building value in Dar es Salaam

(e.g. costs of infrastructure repair or medical treatment).
Direct non-market losses are costs that are caused by
the disaster but whose economic value cannot be readily
quantified because they are not themselves traded on
markets (e.g. suffering caused by injury or by death of
family members or friends; loss of life; loss of amenity).
While economic valuation of direct, non-market impacts
is possible (e.g. the cost of suffering from specific health
effects) and in many cases even fairly common (e.g.
the value of a statistical life or of disability-adjusted
life years), the resulting values often are contentious
because they rely on indirect valuation approaches that
utilize people’s stated rather than observed preferences,
or because many individuals are uncomfortable with
assigning monetary values to these impacts.

deepening the floodplain area adjacent to the channel
the storage capacity of the area is significantly increased,
reducing flows downstream. Households would still be
able to grow crops within these areas outside of the

retain a significant amount of runoff during peak flows
and will also contribute to the removal of sediments and
nutrients through infiltration, although this function is
expected to be relatively small. The vegetated floodplain

rehabilitation measures provided higher net benefit
than moving people from the flood prone areas, and
also yielded the highest rates of return. The addition of
a storage basin added least value, but largely because
opportunities for the location of such an intervention
were too low down in the catchment to be particularly
effective. The results suggest that investment should
be secured for the implementation of a combination
of rehabilitation measures in the catchment that are
specifically designed to attenuate flows and improve
drainage, including formal solid waste management and
community-based river cleaning programs, reforestation
in the upper catchment, the rehabilitation of river
buffers in the middle catchment and the reconnection
of floodplains in the lower reaches. This could be part
of an even broader catchment-to-coast rehabilitation
programme for the Msimbazi River system which also
aims to address water quality problems and the need for
green open space within the rapidly-growing city.

required in the Msimbazi catchment do involve costly
rehabilitation (catchment land cover and river-floodplain
connection) and relocation of unplanned settlements
from river margins, demonstrating that better historic
protection of both catchment and floodplain areas
would have been a far more efficient development
path. This is important for the city to bear in mind as
it prepares for rapid expansion, especially toward the
south.

and drain water. Infiltration trenches allow water to
infiltrate into the surrounding soils from the bottoms
and sides of the trench. They usually have a rectangular
vertical cross-section and are designed to receive
stormwater runoff from adjacent properties and
transportation links such as asphalt roads and footpaths
(Armitage et al. 2013). The amount of water that can be
disposed of by an infiltration trench within a specified
time is dependent on the infiltration potential of the
surrounding soil, the size of the trench, and the bulk
density of the fill material. Stormwater runoff is treated
by physical filtration to remove solids, adsorption onto
the material in the trench and biochemical reactions
involving micro-organisms in the soil.

A5.2.5	 Rainwater Harvesting
Rainwater harvesting systems collect and store rainfall
from hardened surfaces for later use. With minimal
treatment the water that is collected could be used
to supplement the potable water supply and can be
used for a number of activities such as toilet flushing
and irrigating crops and gardens (Armitage et al.
2013). Storage of runoff from roofs and other elevated
impervious surfaces is provided by rainwater tanks,
barrels, cisterns or other storage structures until the
water is required (Armitage et al. 2013). The utilisation
of stormwater as a water source not only saves potable
water but it also significantly reduces the stormwater
discharge from roofs. Rainwater harvesting systems are
known to be particularly useful during extreme rainfall
events as they help to protect receiving streams and
rivers by reducing the initial runoff volumes and the
associated polluted (Armitage et al. 2013).

A5.3.4	 Catchment reforestation
Catchment reforestation is an important intervention
that does not differ much from the riparian buffer
intervention. Catchment reforestation focuses on
planting indigenous trees and shrubs within the
greater catchment area, in particular in areas that were
previously forested. By increasing the number of larger
trees and shrubs in the catchment the amount of runoff
entering streams and rivers in reduced through trapping
and infiltration. Forested areas are well known for their
ability to reduce runoff as well as reduce nutrient and
pollutant loads entering waterways. Reforestation in
the catchment also increases conservation value and
amenity value.
