ARMENIA: WATER SECTOR TARIFF STUDY




         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


         The Republic of Armenia’s water and sanitation services (WSS) sector has seen impressive improvements
         over the last decade.1 The Government of Armenia (GoA) has restructured, reformed and invested in the
         sector in ways that have improved access, continuity and quality of water and sanitation services.


             Water and                WSS tariffs are some of the lowest in the region. In 2012, the average monthly
             sanitation               household per capita expenditure on water for the poorest quintile was 2.3 percent
             services                 of total household per capita consumption expenditures. This figure is far below
             are largely              the commonly-used thresholds for affordability in the region.2 Figure 0.1 compares
             affordable…              domestic and regional WSS tariffs to Armenia’s.

 well short of        2012. Even after government subsidies, the water sector had a shortfall of 3.38

                          Options 2 and 4 present the lowest risk of rate shock. In these options, the initial
                          rate hikes are closest to results of the WtP survey. The survey shows that on average,
                          respondents are willing to pay a maximum of 17.7 percent more than their current
                          monthly water expenditures for system improvements. Option 1 also has an initial rate
                          hike of 20.5 percent, but its subsequent rate hike of 44.7 percent is likely to result in
                          rate shock. Option 3 has a 48 percent initial rate hike, the highest among the options
                          presented.


 …and the                 There is low risk that affordability becomes an issue for customers in the lowest
 poorest                  quintile. Armenia’s existing social transfer program, the Family Benefits Program (FBP),
 customers                is well suited to disperse cash transfers to poor households.5 The program identifies
 protected                beneficiaries according to a formula with thirteen means-testing variables including
 through direct           electricity consumption and access to gas. The FBP has already prepared a program
 cash transfers.          to deliver stipends to vulnerable water customers. Table 0.3 shows a breakdown of the
                          subsidies necessary as well as additional income from value added tax (VAT) associated
                          with each transition option. The options 1 – 4 are ranked from the highest subsidies
                          required to the least subsidies required. As shown in the table, options with a higher
                          overall fiscal burden require a smaller allocation of funds to the FBP.

                                     pay for improvements to WSS infrastructure. Such beliefs increase the likelihood
                                     of “rate shock” if tariffs are increased to cost recovery levels within a short period

                                     improve chances of success.

         1	INTRODUCTION


         The Republic of Armenia’s water and sanitation services (WSS) sector has seen impressive improvements
         over the last decade. The Government of Armenia (GoA) has restructured, reformed and invested in the
         sector in ways that have improved access, continuity and quality of water and sanitation services. Challenges
         in the sector nevertheless remain. Table 1.1 summarizes some of the improvements that have taken place
         under the two largest service providers in the country, AWSC and Yerevan Djur. A table showing sector
         improvements for all companies may be found in Appendix I.

         Challenges in the water and sanitation sector
         Revenues in the sector fall well short of costs, requiring direct fiscal subsidies as well as “quasi-fiscal”
         subsidies, due to the deterioration of infrastructure. Under-investments on maintenance and rehabilitation
         have caused the deterioration.

         Revenue from tariffs in Armenia covered only 67.3 percent of the sector’s total costs in 2012. Even after
         government subsidies, the water sector had a shortfall of 3.38 billion AMD. As a result, revenues fall far
         short of recovering operating and maintenance costs. Revenues also do not meet the investment costs
         necessary for the rehabilitation and expansion of network coverage. Figure 1.1 below shows the cost of
         service and revenues of each utility.

Costs, meanwhile, will likely continue to climb. The grace period on several large loans—those used to
finance improvements in service—will end in 2015. This will result in a higher cost of debt service for the
service providers. Moreover, investment needs—for which new loans will be needed—are still substantial.
More than 800,000 people in 560 villages live without access to centralized water and sanitation. Within
the areas covered by centralized service there are problems with continuity of supply, pressure, and
unsanitary discharge of wastewater.

Higher costs of service will need to be passed through into customer tariffs or subsidized by the GoA. This
presents the GoA with two distinct challenges: i) How to protect the poorest members of the population
from tariff increases that make water and sanitation (or other basic needs) unaffordable; and ii) How to
avoid the rate shock which can come with sudden, large tariff increases and make reform difficult.

Institutional changes will also present challenges. Five water utilities currently serve 75 percent of the
population of Armenia under three public-private-partnership (PPP) contracts. There are 560 villages
outside the areas served by PPPs. These villages have independent arrangements to obtain water supply.7
Figure 1.2 illustrates the institutional arrangements and coverage of the service areas.

         The following PPP contracts currently exist:

             ▪	 Yerevan Djur, which serves 1.07 million people in Armenia’s capital, is operated under a lease
                contract with the French company Veolia.
             ▪	 Armenia Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC), which serves 640,000 people, is operated under a
                management contract with the French company SAUR.
             ▪	 Three regional uilities (Nor Akunq, Lori, and Shirak), which serve 421,000 people, are operated
                under a management contract with the German company MVV.
         The three PPP contracts will end in 2016 and be retendered. Before bidding, potential investors will want
         to have a clear idea of the costs of service going forward and what subsidies (if any) can be expected from
         the government to cover the gap between the cost of service and customer tariffs. The government, for its
         part, will want to know what level of tariffs customers will be willing and able to afford. If subsidies are
         required, they will want to know the anticipated fiscal burden.


         Purpose of this report
         The purpose of the report is to help the GoA:

             ▪	 Analyze the current levels and structures of water and wastewater tariffs compared to the costs of
                service.
             ▪	 Forecast costs under alternative scenarios, and forecast revenues under alternative tariff levels and
                structures.
             ▪	 Recommend how Armenia can move from current tariffs to the tariffs required for full cost-recovery
                in the sector. This includes recommendations on:
                  –	A transition plan for phasing in gradually higher tariffs
                  –	Ways to improve the protection of the customers most vulnerable to tariff increases
         The World Bank commissioned this study to inform the GoA’s work in developing tariff policy and regulation
         in the WSS sector. This study will also inform the GoA as it prepares to procure private operators under new
         PPP arrangements.

2	 AFFORDABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR
   WATER SECTOR IMPROVEMENTS


Water and sanitation sector tariffs in Armenia are lower than those in many cities of Eastern Europe and
Central Asia (ECA). Armenians also spend less on water than the commonly-used thresholds of affordability
in the region. Figure 2.1 compares WSS tariffs for cities in ECA to utilities in Armenia.

Large increases in tariff levels could, however, make water unaffordable for households below the
poverty line. Moreover, water sector reform is a highly political issue in Armenia. Social acceptability and
willingness to pay for water may be as important to policy makers as affordability.

In this chapter we analyze both the affordability and social acceptability (or willingness to pay) for higher
water and sanitation tariffs.

         As Figure 2.3 shows, current tariffs benefit wealthier customers more than the poor, because wealthier
         customers typically have a higher level of consumption.

         The poor in Armenia receive direct cash subsidies through the Family Benefits Program (FBP). The program
         has high targeting performance, with 72 percent of its resources going to the poor. It consists of cash
         benefits paid directly to poor households as a basic lump sum that is reviewed regularly by the Government,
         plus a variable amount depending on family characteristics (i.e., number of children). There is currently no
         variable related directly to payments for water and sanitation services. However, preparations for responding
         to potential rate increases in the water sector are underway. Box 2.1 describes the FBP and demographics
         of a typical FBP beneficiary.

     Box 2.1: The Armenian Family Benefits Program

     The Family Benefits Program was created in 1999 by integrating several Soviet era categorically targeted
     programs into a single proxy means test program. Beneficiaries are identified according to a formula
     with thirteen means testing variables, including variables related to electricity consumption and access
     to gas. A World Bank study in 2012, evaluated Armenia’s social assistance programs to determine if they
     were creating work disincentives. As part of the study, the profiles of FBP beneficiaries were examined.
     The results provide an indication of the program’s targeting efficiency. A majority of beneficiaries are not
     of working age; about 40 percent are below the age of eighteen, while 13 percent are of pension age.
     FBP households tend to have more children and differentially abled persons. About 60 percent of FBP
     households have two or more children, and 30 percent of FBP households have at least one differentially
     abled person, almost two times the number of differentially abled persons in non-FBP households.

2.2	 Affordability of WSS
The Armenian economy is slowly recovering from the 2008 recession, which resulted in acute increases
in poverty. Poverty levels have increased most rapidly in urban areas. Levels increased in Yerevan by 5.5
percent. In all other urban areas, levels increased by an average of 4.4 percent. The poverty rate in rural
communities increased by 4.5 percent. The growth of extreme poverty was least in rural communities, due
to subsistence agriculture activities. Table 2.1 shows poverty rates by settlement and changes in poverty rate
in Armenia from 2008–2012.

The poverty rate fell 2.6 percent from 2011 to 2012. However, GDP growth in 2013 was lower in 2012 by 3.7
percent, so it is reasonable to expect an increase in reported poverty levels for 2013. Data on poverty rates

              Box 2.2: Measuring Poverty in Armenia

              Poverty in Armenia has been assessed quantitatively since 1996. The methodology has been updated
              twice, in 2004 and 2009. In 2009, new baseline data was added that reflects changing consumption
              and expenditure habits associated with overall improvements to Armenian living standards and
              economic conditions. Poverty levels in Armenia were estimated using a quantitative indicator known as
              a consumption aggregate. This indicator includes the monetary value of a basket of food and non-food
              goods adjusted for regional and seasonal price differences.
              Poverty is described by three levels in Armenia: poor, very poor, and extremely poor. Each of the three
              levels is demarcated by a poverty line for a more nuanced and stable picture of poverty incidence in
              the country. The extremely poor fall under the food poverty line (the lowest poverty line). This line is
              comprised of a minimum food basket based on the average caloric requirement per day (energy required
              for light physical activity and healthy living).11 The estimated cost of this food basket—the food poverty
              line—is 21,732 AMD per month or 1.47 USD per day at the current exchange rate.12 The lower poverty
              line (30,547 AMD/month), which separates the poor and very poor population includes the cost of basic
              non-food goods in addition to the cost of the minimum food basket. This line was estimated using the
              consumption basket method, which derives the share of non-food consumption by taking the grand mean
              of food consumption by adult equivalent of those within 2 to 10 percent of the food line.13 The upper
              poverty line (37,044 AMD/month) separates the poor from the non-poor population in Armenia. This line
              also includes the cost of basic non-food goods in addition to the cost of the minimum food basket. The
              upper poverty line is estimated using the food expenditure method, which adds an estimated proportion
              of non-food expenditures spent by those living at the food line.
              The figure below illustrates the three poverty lines derived from the 2009 methodology. The column
              in blue shows the percentage of poor and non-poor populations in Armenia in 2012. The percentages
              of poor, very poor and extremely poor populations and their respective thresholds (poverty lines) are

Affordability as compared to typical thresholds
Expenditure on water is well below affordability thresholds typically used in Armenia and elsewhere in the
world. The affordability threshold used by the World Bank in Armenia is 4 percent of average household
income. In other words, if households spend more than 4 percent of their average income on WSS services,
the services are considered to be unaffordable. The GoA, in contrast, adopted a more stringent threshold
in the Armenian Development Strategy (ADS) for 2014-2025. The ADS applies a threshold of 2.5 percent of
household expenditures to the lowest income quintile of the population.

Consumption expenditures were used as a proxy for household income in this study, because in Armenia,
as in many transitioning economies, consumption relative to incomes is a more reliable and stable indicator
of welfare over time.17 Consumption expenditures are not as susceptible to short-term shocks. They are also
considered to be more accurate than data on incomes, because people tend to remember their expenses
while underreporting their incomes.

   	 Perceived inequality between settlement types is already a potential cause of social tension, particularly in areas where coverage between
companies almost intersects, for example in the Armavir region where coverage between Yerevan Djur and Nor Akunq almost intersects.
17
  	 Income may fluctuate seasonally or year-to-year, but consumption tends to remain more stable over time.

         Section 4.2 uses the affordability thresholds to analyze tariff transition plans.

         Collection ratios as an indicator of affordability
         Utility collection ratios or collection efficiencies provide another perspective on the affordability of water
         and sanitation services. Low collection ratios may suggest that residents are having difficulty affording
         tariffs and paying bills. Data on collection rates in Armenia suggest that this effect is not present. In
         2012, collection ratios in Armenia were, on average, 97.67 percent, and have improved steadily. The high
         collection rate does show that low expenditure shares on water are not due to lack of tariff collection. Table
         2.4 shows the changes in collection rates by provider since 2009.

         2.3	 Willingness To Pay for WSS
         Customers do appear to be willing to pay more for better water and sanitation services in Armenia.
         Willingness to pay was assessed through a bidding game in which a type of contingent valuation was used
         to determine customers’ willingness to pay more in exchange for improvements to their water and sanitation
         services.18,19 In the bidding game, respondents were read a scenario which described:

                    ▪	 The current conditions of service in the WSS sector
                    ▪	 The consequences of failing to invest in, and properly maintenance the system
                    ▪	 Improvements that could be expected within one year of a tariff increase
         They were then asked if they were willing to pay a randomly assigned percentage (20, 50 or 100 percent)
         above their current WSS expenditures. Depending on their answer, the enumerator would follow up with
         a higher or lower percentage. Finally respondents were asked the maximum amount they would pay for
         service improvements.

         Two separate scenarios were read to each respondent, one relating to water supply and another relating
         to sanitation. The scenarios are described below. The scenarios were constructed based on focus group
         discussions as well as existing reports on the availability, quality and reliability of service. Box 2.3 describes
         current levels of access, quality and reliability of WSS services.




         18
            	 Contingent valuation is a stated preference method used by economists to obtain a dollar estimate of a respondent’s preference for a given
         good. In other words, it is a technique used to elicit a respondent’s willingness-to-pay for a given good. A bidding game is one technique used
         to obtain a respondent’s maximum willingness-to-pay. The respondent is asked a sequence of questions until the “maximum” bid is obtained.

 Box 2.3: Current Levels of Access, Quality, and Reliability of WSS Services

 The introduction of lease and management PPP arrangements in the last few years has led to improvements
 in quality and reliability of supply of WSS services, but problems still remain. Five utilities serve about 75
 percent of the population living in Armenia, but more than 800,000 people still do not have a connection to
 the CWS. Sewerage is mostly discharged untreated into waterways, though sewerage from urban areas is me-
 chanically treated. Most of Yerevan Djur customers currently receive 24 hours of continuous supply, but cus-
 tomers of AWSC, Nor Akunq CSJC, Shirak and Lori CJSC receive an average of 16, 22.3, 11.9 and 10 hours
 of water per day, respectively. Water quality is also a recurring problem, especially during the rainy season. In
 some settlements, water does not meet national standards. Additionally, water pressure is a problem, espe-
 cially for those living in high-rise apartment buildings.

Water supply improvement scenarios
Residents in Yerevan were told to expect: strong water pressure regardless of which apartment floor they
live on; 24 hours of continuous supply; and little to no service interruptions. Residents living outside
Yerevan were told to expect: strong water pressure during service hours regardless of apartment floor; and
eight to 12 hours of extra water service per day, if they did not already have 24 hours of continuous supply.

Sanitation improvement scenarios
Respondents who were connected to the centralized water and sanitation system (CWS) were told about a
program to invest in sewerage treatment infrastructure. Residents who were not currently connected were
told about a program to invest in collection, disposal and treatment infrastructure.


2.3.1	      Willingness to pay for water supply improvements
The results of the WtP survey show that 35.7 percent of respondents were willing to pay more than they
currently pay for better WSS services. In Yerevan, 27.1 percent of respondents were willing to pay more,
while in areas outside of Yerevan, 41.6 percent of respondents were willing to pay more for improved
services. On average, the maximum amount respondents were willing to pay was 17.7 percent more than
their current monthly water expenditures. In Yerevan, respondents were willing to pay a maximum of 12.1
percent above their current expenditures, while respondents outside of Yerevan said they would pay 21.4
percent more.

The results by welfare group show that 39.4 of poor and 36.3 percent of non-poor respondents were willing
to pay for better services.20 On average, the maximum amount poor respondents were willing to pay above
their current expenditures was 17.6 percent. Non-poor respondents were willing to pay 17.7 percent more
than what they currently pay. Table 2.5 shows respondents’ maximum willingness to pay for improvements by
settlement type and welfare group.

         2.3.2	        Willingness to pay for sanitation improvements
         The results of the WtP study show that 36.7 percent of respondents were willing to pay more than they
         currently pay for a connection to the CWS or for better sanitation services. In Yerevan, 27.5 percent of
         respondents were willing to pay more, while in areas outside Yerevan, 42.2 percent of respondents were
         willing to pay more for improved services. On average, respondents were willing to pay a maximum of 17.5
         percent above their current monthly expenditures on waste disposal and treatment. The maximum amount
         respondents were willing to pay above their current expenditures was 9.6 percent in Yerevan and 22.9
         percent in areas outside Yerevan.

         The results by welfare group show that 40.8 of poor respondents and 36.0 percent of non-poor
         respondents were willing to pay for a connection to the CWS or for improvements to their sanitation service.
         On average, poor respondents were willing to spend up to 17.9 percent more than they currently spend.
         Non-poor respondents were willing to spend 18.0 percent more. Table 2.6 shows respondents’ maximum

2.3.3	      Constraints to WtP
Respondents were asked after the bidding game to identify: the constraints preventing them from paying
more for WSS improvements; how they would cope with a tariff increase; and circumstances under which
they would be willing to increase their maximum WtP.

Constraints on paying more for WSS improvements
Roughly 70 percent of respondents across all settlement types reported an inability to afford higher
tariffs as the most significant constraint on their willingness to pay for improvements. In Yerevan, the
second most reported constraint was disbelief that service providers would use higher tariffs to deliver
the promised improvements as stated in the WtP scenario. In other urban areas outside of Yerevan and
rural areas, respondents felt that they should not be the ones responsible for costs associated with service
improvements.

Analysis by welfare group shows that 78.4 percent of poor respondents reported an inability to afford
higher tariffs as the largest constraint on their willingness to pay more for water services. About 11 percent
of poor respondents indicated distrust of service providers as the largest constraint on their willingness to
pay a higher tariff.22 Table 2.7 shows constraints respondents perceive as limiting their willingness to pay a
higher tariff by welfare group.

Coping strategies if tariffs are increased
Respondents were also asked to report strategies they would use to limit their consumption if tariffs were
increased by 50 percent. More than 90 percent of respondents said that they would take shorter showers,
and 54.7 percent of respondents said that they would limit running water during cooking or cleaning.

         Scenarios in which respondents would support a tariff increase or surcharge
         Respondents were also asked if they supported or opposed a tariff increase or surcharge under the
         following scenarios:

                    ▪	 Paying a surcharge so that network expansion may be subsidized for households with no access
                       to the WSS network (Figure 2.5)
                    ▪	 Paying a higher tariff for water infrastructure rehabilitation and better quality and reliability of
                       service (Figure 2.6)
                    ▪	 Paying a higher tariff to ensure their families always have access to safe and clean water (Figure
                       2.7)
         Roughly two-thirds of respondents answered “no” in opposition to each of the above scenarios. Only a
         majority of respondents who live in rural areas responded “yes” in support of a tariff increase or surcharge
         for improvements to the reliability and quality of WSS services and to ensure that their families always
         have access to safe and clean water. More than 80 percent of respondents from Yerevan answered “no” in
         opposition to each of the above scenarios. In short, most respondents in Yerevan were unwilling to pay a
         higher tariff or a surcharge for any of the above scenarios unlike most rural residents who were willing to
         paying more for two of the three presented scenarios.

3	 SETTING TARIFFS


There are three main steps to setting tariffs:

        ▪	 I) Estimate the revenue requirement. The revenue requirement is the total amount of revenue a
           utility requires to cover all of its costs.
        ▪	 II) Allocate the revenue requirement to the various classes of customers served by the utility
           (customer classes).
        ▪	 III) Design the end-user tariffs. Tariff design is about deciding how to charge customers for the
           costs they impose on the system. Tariffs should be designed to allow the utility to recover its
           revenue requirement.
A simple explanation of this process is: costs are first aggregated into a total; portions of this total are
divided and assigned to each customer class; a tariff is designed to recover the portion of costs assigned to
each customer class. Figure 3.1 depicts the tariff setting process. This chapter carries out these three steps
for the Armenian water sector.

                                          much revenue must                  tariffs for each customer

                                               each class)                      revenue requirement


                                                        Ideally should be
                                                      linked to how costs
                                                          are incurred




3.1	 Estimating the Revenue Requirement
A utility’s revenue requirement is the total amount of revenue required to recover its costs in any given year.
Figure 3.2 shows the components that go into an estimation of the revenue requirement. This study uses the
“cash needs” approach for estimating the revenue requirement (further described in Appendix A).




                                                                                                                          19

                                                                                        Requirement



         As shown in Figure 3.2, the main components of the revenue requirement are:
                   ▪	    Operating and maintenance (O&M) expense
                   ▪	    Capital expenditures (CAPEX)
                   ▪	    Debt service
                   ▪	    Reserve funds

         Audited financial statements from 2009 to 2012 were used to estimate test year revenue requirement. These
         costs were adjusted for “known and measureable” changes. Appendix C describes the methodology for
         estimating the test year. Box 3.1 provides a description of the test-year approach.

          Box 3.1: Selecting the Test Year

          The revenue requirement is meant to be a “forward-looking” estimate of the costs for the upcoming
          operating years. It provides a basis for setting prices. However, it is common practice that the initial
          estimate for each of the items identified in the revenue requirement is made with reference to the most
          recent available historical costs (often referred to as the “test year”). It is necessary to bridge the gap
          between historical actuals and future expectations by applying a series of adjustments to better reflect
          actual costs. These can be organized within the following three categories:

               ▪	 Normalization (removing the effects of unusual circumstances in a historical year)
               ▪	 Known changes (anticipating the evolution of the business from the past to the future, such as the
                  requirement for new security measures at water reservoirs, or increases in the electricity tariff)
               ▪	 Adjustment from previous year (reconciling for previous differences between actual and target
                  revenues)
          A future test year, based on forecasts, can also be used as a starting point for a revenue requirement, or a
          “pro forma” test year, which is an historic test-year adjusted (as indicated in the second bullet above), for
          “known and measurable” changes.

Operating and maintenance expense
Operating and maintenance expenses refer to the ongoing costs of maintaining and operating utility
equipment. Such expenses consist of line items typically found on a service provider’s income statement. In
the revenue requirement model used for this study, O&M expenses include:

   ▪	 Staff costs (managerial staff costs and operational staff costs)
   ▪	 Electricity costs
   ▪	 Fixed costs (less staff costs)
   ▪	 Variable costs (less electricity)

ARMENIA: WATER SECTOR TARIFF STUDY




         Capital expenditures
         Capital expenditure (CAPEX) refers to the cost of new construction or rehabilitation of assets. Capital
         expenditure needs for rehabilitation, system extension, and waste treatment investment have been estimated
         by Dorsch International Consultants for the Armenia Water Sector Study. These are shown in Table 3.2.

         Certain investments in wastewater treatment plants were excluded from these estimates because neither the
         service providers nor the regulator considered that those investments, while necessary, would be realistically
         made during the projection period. The costs of bringing service to the 560 villages with no CWS have
         also been excluded.23 The CAPEX plan also is synchronized with the funds earmarked for rehabilitation and
         extension of the W&WW sector in the Armenian Development Strategy. Table 3.2 shows the allocation of
         earmarked funds over the projection period.

         Debt service
         Debt service costs on existing loans are estimated using loan schedules provided by each of the service
         providers for all current loans in the water sector (shown in Appendix Table D.13, Appendix Table D.14
         and Appendix Table D.15). This study assumes that investment needs for new CAPEX are met through
         concessional loans (soft loans) with the following terms:

                 ▪	 Year of loan start: 2016
                 ▪	 Loan period: 30 years
                 ▪	 Grace period: 5 years
                 ▪	 Interest rate: 4.0% p.a.
                 ▪	 Commission fees: 0.0%
         Schedules on existing loans and the methodology for calculating debt service fees as a result of new loans
         are described in detail in Appendix D.2. Table 3.3 shows debt service costs for the base year.




         23
              	 The costs and tariff implications were modeled but were not included in this study.

The estimated revenue requirements include contributions to a working capital reserve and a capital
improvement reserve fund. In modeling the revenue requirement of the service providers, the study has
included a capital improvement reserve and a working capital reserve.

Contributions to the working capital reserve are calculated as interest on two months of O&M expenses for
each service provider (assuming a 6 percent interest rate). Contributions to the capital improvement reserve
are calculated using estimates provided by the service providers and the State Water Committee for annual
cash needs for asset renewal. These are summarized in Appendix Table D.11 and Appendix Table D.12.

           Box 3.2: Contributions to Reserve Funds

           The GoA may also want to accumulate a “safety reserve” to fund future investments or to achieve other
           objectives. The best way to do this is through explicit contributions to a reserve fund. Examples of reserve
           funds include:

               ▪	 Capital improvement or “renewals” reserve. This reserve accounts for the cash needs of the
                  utility. It ensures that the performance of existing assets does not deteriorate during their lifetime.
                  It is meant to cover the annual cash needs of renewing assets, which may exceed the provision of
                  routine maintenance in a utility’s operations and maintenance (O&M) costs.
               ▪	 Capital replacement reserve. Some regulators decide to include a replacement reserve in the
                  revenue requirement. This allows service providers to accumulate a reserve, which can cover the
                  costs of replacing assets when they become obsolete. Capital replacement reserves are typically
                  estimated at the rate of 1 to 2 percent of the total original cost asset value of the utility’s property.
               ▪	 Contingency fund. A contingency fund is used as “insurance” against unanticipated emergencies
                  or failure of the utility’s most vulnerable system components. Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes
                  or other natural disasters typically cause such unanticipated emergencies. This fund is often
                  estimated by determining the cost of replacing the most expensive facility of the utility system and
                  reserving an amount equal to that cost. The need for this fund may be eliminated by establishing
                  a close relationship with lending institutions and by creating an available line of credit that can be
                  made quickly available under such circumstances.
               ▪	 Working capital reserve. This allows utilities to recover interest on the cost of capital needed to
                  protect the utility’s cash needs against fluctuations in operating revenues and costs.25

         Efficiency adjustments
         Regulators typically allow only efficient (sometimes called “prudent”) costs to be included in the tariff.
         Efficient costs are costs required for efficient delivery of utility services. These are often determined by the
         regulator through expert judgment or through comparison with costs of similar utilities. Regulators may
         prohibit the inclusion of certain costs in the revenue requirement because they reflect poor management.
         For example, the costs of technical losses (leaks) or staffing above a certain level may be excluded from the
         revenue requirement, because they reflect management inefficiencies.

         The test year used in this study was accordingly adjusted, assuming reductions in network losses,
         improvements in collections, reductions in staffing and more efficient electricity consumption. Appendix C
         provides the methodology used for these adjustments.

3.1.2	                Forecast of revenue requirements
Forecasts of the revenue requirement were developed in a tariff projection model (TPM).26 The TPM
has separate revenue requirement calculations for the service areas of Yerevan Djur, AWSC and the three
regional utilities.

A forecast of the revenue requirement was developed to 2030 based on: i) water demand forecasts
developed by Dorsch International Consultants for a KfW study; ii) assumptions agreed upon by the World
Bank and sector stakeholder on changes to drivers of the cost of supply over time.

Demand
The demand projections developed by Dorsch were adjusted to account for effects of income and price
elasticity. This study assumes:27

                 ▪	 An income elasticity factor of 0.3, which means that for every 10 percent increase in household
                    income, water demand increases by 3 percent
                 ▪	 A price elasticity factor of -0.4, which means that for every 10 percent increase in the tariff,
                    demand is assumed to decrease by 4 percent
Figure 3.3 shows a forecast of end-user water demand.

Growth in demand is considerable for AWSC, while consumption for Yerevan and the three regional utilities
remains close to 2014 levels. This is principally due to system expansion and the extension of service hours
in the AWSC service area. For all customers, income and price elasticity are factored into the demand
forecast.4.3Appendix E describes methodology for the demand forecast.

  	 Price elasticity data were taken from the study “Policy alternatives in subsidizing water sector in Armenia”, “Advanced Social Technologies”
NGO (AST), Yerevan 2012. This study is based on a survey conducted with a representative sample of 1,600 Armenian households in 2011,
which included a question regarding customer’s consumption response to a 50 percent and 100 percent tariff increase, respectively. The
results show an average consumption reduction of 30.6 percent for the first question and 41 percent for the second question (-0.6 price
elasticity for the first question and -0.4 price elasticity for the second question). The lower value was chosen because customer reactions to
price changes are typically somewhat lower than the anticipated reaction expressed in WtP studies.

         Revenue requirements in Armenia’s water sector are projected to increase in the short- and medium-term
         due primarily to:

                    ▪	 The end of grace periods for several loans in the sector
                    ▪	 The need for major rehabilitation of assets, as identified by service providers, requiring new
                       capital expenditures
         Revenue requirements are shown in real terms, exclusive of value added tax (VAT). The assumptions and
         methodologies used in the forecasts are summarized in in Appendix C and Appendix D.

         Revenue requirement for Yerevan Djur
         Figure 3.4 shows the revenue requirements for Yerevan Djur. Debt service costs increase from 2014 to
         2025. This is due to the end of grace periods for existing loans and the addition of debt service costs for
         new loans taken for water supply, disposal and treatment system rehabilitation and system expansion.


         28
            	 Any reduction in non-revenue water is assumed to reduce overall production by the same volume, with a correlated reduction in the vari-
         able costs of production. This effectively means that all non-revenue water is assumed to be attributable to technical losses. The schedule of
         reductions is based on the demand forecast from the study prepared by Dorsh International for KfW (Present State of Water Sector: Water
         Sector Study Armenia – Sector Review and Strategy, 2014.
         29
            	 The revenue collection rate is assumed to affect the tariff only, but not the revenue requirement. The revenue shortfall from under-collec-
         tion is assumed to be borne by paying customers. As the collection rate increases, the average tariff decreases accordingly, which affects (in a
         very small way) demand through the price elasticity effect.
         30
           	 Electricity tariff estimates use figures from the ongoing 2013 Armenia Energy Sector Policy Note Update and are summarized in Appendix F.

Revenue requirement for AWSC
Figure 3.5 shows revenue requirements for Armenian Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC). Similar to
Yerevan Djur, there is an increase in debt service costs in 2014, which continues through 2028. This is due
to the end of grace periods for existing loans in 2014 and the addition of debt service costs for new loans
taken for rehabilitation and system expansion. AWSC also converts from a management to a lease contract in
2016. The management fee will be removed at that time, leading to a reduction in management costs.

         Revenue requirement for three regional utilities
         Revenue requirements for the three regional utilities are shown in Figure 3.6. As the figure shows, there
         is a large increase in debt service costs in 2015 which continues through 2030. This is due to the end of
         grace periods on existing loans in 2015 and the slow addition of debt service costs for new loans taken for
         rehabilitation and system expansion.

         3.1.4	              Sensitivity and scenario analysis
         Basic sensitivity analysis was applied to the revenue requirement by changing several key assumptions,
         including:

             ▪	 The price elasticity of water services
             ▪	 Income elasticity for water and wastewater customers
             ▪	 The interest rates and grace periods of new loans taken in the sector
             ▪	 The annual cash needs for renewal of assets (capital improvement reserve)
             ▪	 Changes to the electricity tariff
         The variable values used to calculate revenue requirements were selected through consultations with key
         stakeholders, including the State Water Committee and managerial staff from each of the service providers.
         These assumptions are described in detail in Appendix C.

         Scenario analysis was used to reflect different institutional arrangements being contemplated in the sector
         at the time. In 2016, the lease contract for Yerevan Djur, and the management contracts for AWSC and the
         three regional utilities will come to an end. At the completion of this study, different options were under
         exploration, including changes from management to lease contracts and mergers between some or all of the

Table 3.6 shows the assumptions made under the two institutional scenarios described above. Adjustments
in costs were made at the company level and then aggregated into grouped costs under the one operator
and two operator scenarios. The assumptions used to model institutional scenarios were developed through
input from the service providers and the State Water Committee. These are summarized in Table 3.6 and
shown in detail in Appendix C.

single operator in 2016. Revenue requirements for one operator are shown in Figure 3.8.

  	 The strengths and weaknesses of each of these institutional options, as well as guidance on contractual arrangements, were investigated in
a study funded by the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW). Present State of Water Sector: Water Sector Study Armenia – Sector Review and
Strategy, 2014.

  	 The average salary for Yerevan Djur is currently much higher than that for AWSC and the 3 regional utilities. Thus, it is assumed that follow-
ing a merger between the five service providers, the average salaries of AWSC and the 3 regional utilities would increase.

         As shown in Figure 3.8, by year 2030 the costs associated with new debt service fees exceed O&M
         expenses. The model assumes grace periods for loans taken to implement the capital improvement plan,
         which offset the costs of rehabilitation to later years. Appendix D details the assumptions and methodology
         used to model debt servicing fees.

The increase in the revenue requirements for AWSC and the three regional utilities combined operator are
largely a result of existing debt servicing fees. In 2016, these account for more than fifty percent of the total
costs.


3.2	 Allocating the Revenue Requirement
The steps required to allocate the revenue requirement include:
   ▪	 Assign the revenue requirement components by function or activity. Components of
      the revenue requirement such as O&M, capital costs, debt services, capital improvements and
      depreciation expenses should be assigned to the different activities of a service provider (i.e.,
      extraction, pumping, storage, distribution, transmission, meters and customer service activities).
   ▪	 Assign costs by causation (commodity, demand, or customer costs). For each component of
      the revenue requirement and for each function or activity, allocate costs according to how they are
      incurred or caused. Costs are typically incurred as:
      –	Commodity costs, which vary with the volume of water produced. Such commodity costs include
         purchased water, most energy costs and chemicals.
      –	Demand or capacity costs, which vary with the rate of customer demand for water. Demand costs
         may include a portion of purchased water and energy costs and will include any equipment or
         facilities required to meet higher than average system levels of demand.
      –	Customer costs. Customer costs are those costs associated with serving customers, regardless
         of their volume or rate of use (billing, costs associated with meters and meter reading and most
         costs associated with customer accounting and collections).
   ▪	 Assign costs to customer classes. Customers are commonly categorized as residential, commercial,
      or industrial. Depending on the region or country, with customer classes are occasionally given for fire-
      protection service or lawn irrigation. To the extent possible, regulators try to group customers who have
      similar usage profiles and needs to impose similar costs on the system.
The following subsections describe how the study undertook each of these steps.


3.2.1	    Assign revenue requirement components by function or activity
Table 3.7 shows how cost components were allocated by function or activity. As the table shows, most costs
were allocated as a group to extraction, pumping and storage, transmission and distribution. The granularity
of the data available from service providers did not allow for a more specific allocation.

3.2.3	      Assign costs to customer classes

Service providers in Armenia use three customer classes: residential, industrial and budgetary
(government). Residential customers represent most of the load. They also have the most volatile load.
Commercial customers form the second largest customer class in terms of consumption. They have a slightly
less volatile load curve than residential customers. Budgetary customers are the smallest class of customers
in terms of consumption. They have the most stable load curve. In 2012, residential customers consumed
64.39 million cubic meters of water. Commercial and budgetary customers consumed 30.54 and 7.84
million cubic meters of water, respectively. Peak consumption occurred during the month of August for
residential customers (6.06 million cubic meters), in June and July for commercial customers (2.98 million
cubic meters) and in September for budgetary customers (0.70 million cubic meters). Figure 3.10 illustrates
the water sector load curves by customer class.

         For this tariff study, peak month data was used to allocate demand costs since peak period demand data was unavailable. As the Armenian
         water sector develops further, it would be worthwhile to put financial resources toward a system that can measure maximum day and hour
         demand by customer class.

3.3	 Tariff Design
The tariff is a charge or set of charges designed to collect a utility’s cost of service. Tariff structures may
include a volumetric component, a fixed component, or both.

         ▪	 Fixed charges typically include customer charges. Customer charges are typically related to
            meter reading, billing costs and other customer-related costs. Fixed charges may include a
            minimum charge (to cover some minimum level of water consumption) or a “readiness to serve”
            charge, which reflects fixed capacity costs.
         ▪	 Volumetric charges typically recover the costs of hourly production (commodity costs) and the
            costs serving maximum demand (demand or capacity charge). Volumetric tariffs can be charged
            via a flat fee per m2 of water consumption, or a “declining” or “inclining” block scheme, where
            the fee per m2 changes as consumption passes designated thresholds. In an inclining block
            scheme, the fee per m2 increases as consumption increases. In a declining block scheme the fee
            per m2 decreases as consumption increases.
         ▪	 Two-part charges include a fixed component and a volumetric component. A fixed charge could
            be used in combination with any of the proposed volumetric tariff options.
Figure 3.7 gives an overview of common tariff options. These tariff structures may differ by customer class
and by service area, or may be applied uniformly across all customer classes and service areas.

The tariff options were evaluated in close consultation with stakeholders in workshops on June 17, 2014.
Stakeholders included the State Committee of Water Economy (SWCE), the Public Sector Regulatory
Commission (PSRC), the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Territorial
Administration, KfW, AWSC, the World Bank, Consulting Engineers Salzgitter GmbH (CES), and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).

Section 3.3.1 describes the criteria used in evaluating options for tariff design.


3.3.1	    Criteria for tariff design
Stakeholders agreed on six criteria to be used in evaluating options for tariff design. The criteria are
described below:
   ▪	 Revenue adequacy. The primary objective in setting water tariffs is to allow water utilities to recover
      the costs incurred to provide water and wastewater services.




                                                                                                                         37
ARMENIA: WATER SECTOR TARIFF STUDY




               ▪	 Revenue stability. Most utilities incur expenses at a relatively fixed rate every month. Operating and
                  maintenance and debt service expenses tend to stay constant throughout the year. Alternatively,
                  customer demand fluctuates by month and year depending on seasonal and economic effects. The
                  variation in customer consumption can create a discrepancy between revenues and expenses. This is
                  an important issue to consider when setting tariffs.
               ▪	 Equity. Utility companies incur varying levels of cost to serve different customer classes. Interclass
                  tariff equity or fairness means that customers pay according to the costs incurred on their behalf.
               ▪	 Simplicity. The tariff setting process can be a complex and controversial topic. Customer confusion
                  over bills could undermine tariff reform efforts. Decision makers need to take into account how easy
                  it will be to explain tariffs to water and wastewater customers.
               ▪	 Conservation. A tariff, like any pricing structure, provides incentives to alter consumption choices.
                  Price signals should be clear, promote efficiency and discourage wasteful use.
               ▪	 Feasibility. Tariff decisions need to consider the current legal and regulatory environment. The tariff
                  should be easy to implement. It should comply with all applicable laws.
         The criteria used to evaluate tariff options in Armenia align closely with principles of regulatory design used
         widely throughout the world. Box 3.3 lists eight “textbook” principles of tariff design.


              Box 3.3: Global Good Practice in Tariff Design

              Eight principles of tariff design are often cited as the foundation of regulatory best practice on tariff
              structures. The principles are:34

                 1.	The related, “practical” attributes of simplicity, comprehensibility, public acceptability and
                    feasibility of application
                 2.	 Freedom from controversies over proper interpretation
                 3.	 Effectiveness in yielding total revenue requirements under the fair-return standard
                 4.	 Revenue stability from year to year
                 5.	 Stability of the tariffs themselves, with a minimum of seriously adverse, unexpected changes to
                     existing customers
                 6.	 Fairness of the specific tariffs in the apportionment of total costs of service among the different
                     customers
                 7.	 Avoidance of “undue discrimination” in tariff relationships
                 8.	Efficiency of the tariff classes and tariff blocks in discouraging wasteful use of service while
                    promoting all justified types and amounts of use:
                    a.	 In the control of the total amounts of service supplied by the company
                    b.	 In the control of the relative uses of alternative types of services (i.e., on-peak versus off-peak
                        consumption)
              Principles three, six and eight are typically regarded as the most important principles for economic
              efficiency.

3.3.2	   Selecting the best tariff design for Armenia
Table 3.9 shows the advantages and disadvantages of the tariff options discussed during the workshop.
Certain tariff design options were excluded from the analysis, because they were initially dismissed by
stakeholders as being unrealistic or inappropriate for the Armenian context. Declining block tariffs and
“normative” tariffs (fixed charges only) were not considered, because these structures would not promote
efficient water use.

         The workshop participants felt that volumetric tariffs were a strong option because: i) they are easy to
         implement; ii) they are easy for customers to understand (since a volumetric tariff is currently used); iii)
         they have strong alignment with the conservation objective; iv) when partnered with the FBP (which has
         a program to deliver stipends to vulnerable water customers) volumetric tariffs can ensure affordability.
         The government found it preferable to not change the tariff structure in conjunction with the changes
         in operators occurring in 2016 (due to signing of a new lease contract for a single country operator).
         Maintaining the same tariff structure would ensure the public would not have to adjust to two simultaneous
         changes in the water sector.

         Stakeholders thought that inclining block tariffs held many advantages, but that the implementation could
         be difficult and the complexity of the system could be confusing to customers. Box 3.4 shows an example
         of an inclining block tariff structure for Armenia. It was also determined that creating a lifeline block
         for subsistence consumption was a strong but less preferred mechanism for ensuring affordability when
         compared with the family benefits program.

         Two-part tariffs were considered a strong option for reducing stability of revenues. However, significant
         concern was expressed from the service providers about the current tax law and that the added tax burden
         (as a result of having to pay taxes on bills that were not collected) would outweigh the benefit of increased
         revenue stability. There was also a concern that the fixed charge may make monthly bills unaffordable for
         some poor customers.

           This proposed structure for an inclining block tariff includes three blocks for residential tariff and a
           single uniform charge for non-residential customers set at the third residential block level. The
           affordability benefits of this proposed structure are evident when comparing it to the alternative
           uniform and non-uniform tariff options. The figure below presents estimated customer bills for varying
           consumption levels under both increasing block, uniform, and non-uniform tariffs based on the estimated
           revenue requirement in 2016.

 Note: Tariffs are shown at full cost-recovery level under the single operator scenario.

 The figure shows that residential bills would be higher under both uniform and non-uniform tariffs for
 a range of consumption levels. The lower residential bills under the proposed increasing block tariff are
 the result of setting the tariff for non-residential customers at the third block price level. One issue to
 consider with this outcome is that the tariff level could create affordability problems for small commercial
 customers. Creating blocks for non-residential customers or establishing separate small commercial and
 large commercial customer classes could help to solve this problem.


In addition to discussing tariff design options, stakeholders considered the distribution of costs between
customer classes in uniform and differential tariffs. The advantages and disadvantages of differential tariffs
are shown in Table 3.10.

         Stakeholders generally agreed that both uniform and differential tariffs were viable options. Because the
         current tariff is a uniform tariff, this option would be the easiest to implement. However, the presence of an
         inherent subsidy between residential customers and budgetary customers under uniform tariffs made this
         option less attractive. This transfer is apparent in Table 3.11, which shows the average unit costs for each
         customer class in 2016 based on the findings of the cost allocation model. Stakeholders felt that differential
         tariffs, while slightly more difficult to implement, held many advantages. Most notably, the opportunity
         to reduce residential tariffs would likely cause less resistance from the public (excluding the commercial
         sector) in transitioning tariffs to cost recovery levels. It was considered a strong advantage that differential
         tariffs allowed for the tariff to have a more accurate representation of costs for customer classes.

         Stakeholders also considered whether tariff levels should be the same across the country (under one
         operator), or whether they should differ for residents of Yerevan and residents living within the service areas
         of AWSC and the three regional utilities (two operators). Table 3.12 shows the advantages and disadvantages
         of these options while Figure 3.13 shows a comparison of unit cost projections under the two alternatives.

4	 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REFORM


Tariff reform is necessary to increase access, quality and reliability of WSS services in Armenia, but it can
disproportionately impact the poor and lead to social unrest if mitigation measures are not put in place.
Successful reform efforts typically do the following:

   ▪	 Provide highly targeted subsidies for vulnerable households
   ▪	 Gradually phase in cost recovery tariffs
   ▪	 Conduct transparent and sustained communication with the public



4.1	 Subsidy Delivery
An increase in WSS tariffs will have a disproportionate impact on poor households’ budgets. Roughly half
(51.6 percent) of respondents surveyed believed that a program to protect vulnerable groups should be
introduced if tariffs are increased.

Designing a subsidy regime requires decisions about: i) how to identify the poor; ii) how to deliver the
subsidy; iii) when to deliver the subsidy; and iv) how to fund the subsidy. Options for each of these
decisions are described and evaluated in the subsections below. This section describes different approaches
to each step and recommends an approach for Armenia’s WSS sector.


4.1.1	      How to identify the poor
Poor customers are typically identified by:

   ▪	 Their water consumption. So-called “lifeline tariffs” are tariffs which are lower for certain
      customers based on the amount of household consumption. These tariffs are generally applied to
      the initial block of consumption, called the basic need (for example, 6 m3/month). Under inclining
      block tariff structures, this lower rate can either be included for all customers for their first 6 m3
      of consumption, or only be applied to those customers that use less than 6 m3 (or the level set as
      subsistence consumption). A variation on the lifeline tariff is to waive or partially waive, or to provide
      a credit or partial credit for the fixed monthly customer charge for a targeted group of customers.
   ▪	 Assumptions about their income levels. In some countries, customers receive compensation
      for the share of utility expenditures that exceed a notional “burden limit,” determined as a given
      percentage of monthly household income. In Ukraine, for example, the Government provided
      discounts to households that spent more than 20 percent of monthly income on utilities). Income
      levels are typically determined by:
         –	Household budget, income survey data, or other information collected by government (i.e.,
           existing social support programs)
         –	Other normative assumptions (i.e., type of housing)
         –	Documents providing verification of income
   ▪	 Demand for subsidies. In some countries, customers must submit an application for consideration
      and must provide verification of income.




                                                                                                                         45
ARMENIA: WATER SECTOR TARIFF STUDY




         As described in Section 2, poverty in Armenia has been assessed since 1996 using a consumption aggregate
         which includes the monetary value of a basket of food and non-food goods adjusted for regional and
         seasonal price differences. There are three poverty levels in Armenia: poor, very poor and extremely poor.
         These levels are demarcated by poverty lines and described in greater detail in section 0. Baseline line
         data is updated once every few years. The most recent update occurred in 2009. In 2012, 32.4 percent of
         households in Armenia lived below the poverty line.35 There currently is no specific subsidy for water tariffs.
         However, the Family Benefit Program—the largest social transfer program in Armenia—uses a means test
         on income and a vulnerability scoring formula to identify and allocate social transfers to the poor. This
         formula allows the GoA to rank applicants, giving preference to single mothers, orphans, families with many
         children and the differently abled.36

         The results of the WtP survey showed that 40.5 percent of respondents believed that tariff increases should
         be mitigated using the existing Family Benefit Program. As described in Section 3.3, this view is also
         consistent with the discussions held by government stakeholders and service providers.


         4.1.2	       How to deliver the subsidy
         Subsidies can be delivered directly to customers through cash transfers or vouchers. They can also be
         delivered indirectly discounts on customers’ energy bills. However, there is often a trade-off between
         administrative costs and targeting efficiency. Options to reach target populations most effectively often have
         high administrative or monitoring costs. The section below describes a few ways in which subsidies can be
         delivered to poor households.

              ▪	 Cash transfers allow a government to increase consumers’ purchasing power by supplementing the
                 household income with allocations of money. The money may be intended for a particular purpose, but
                 customers aren’t required to use it in a specific way. The effectiveness of targeting the poor with cash
                 transfer schemes depends on the institutional capacity to reach the intended beneficiaries.
              ▪	 Voucher schemes, or near-cash transfers to households, also aim to increase consumers’
                 purchasing power. Unlike cash, which can be used to buy anything, vouchers are designated for
                 a specific purpose, such as the purchase of water. Voucher programs are low cost compared to
                 universal subsidy programs. However, the administrative costs of voucher programs tend to be higher
                 than those of cash transfer programs. The development and distribution of vouchers is inherently
                 more complicated than the distribution of cash.
              ▪	 Indirect delivery of the subsidy means subsidizing the water companies so that they are able to
                 discount rates. This subsidy can be roughly targeted, such as through a lifeline tariff, or untargeted,
                 such as when all end-user tariffs are set below cost-recovery levels.
              ▪	 Lifeline tariffs can be used to ensure that all consumers can afford a subsistence level of water
                 consumption. Implementation of a lifeline tariff involves a discount on the first portion of
                 consumption, estimated at subsistence levels (approximately 6m³/month), while all subsequent
                 consumption is billed at the higher rate. Another option is to charge all consumption at the highest
                 consumption block customers enter during a billing period. This would mean that customers only
                 benefit from the lifeline rate if they keep their consumption within the first block.
         Cash transfer schemes are generally recognized as best practice if sufficient institutional capacity exists for
         targeting and delivery. Armenia fortunately has high institutional capacity to implement a cash transfer scheme
         through the FBP, which has been shown to have high targeting efficiency (see section 2.1).

4.1.3	      When to deliver the subsidy
Indirect subsidies to water and sanitation utilities can be delivered in lump sums tied to budgeting cycles.
Subsidies to customers through the FBP can be delivered on a monthly or bi-monthly basis directly to
customers as cash transfers, using the existing system employed by the FBP program.


4.1.4	      How to fund the subsidy
Subsidies may be funded by: i) direct transfer from government; ii) through cross-subsidies from other
customer classes (inter-class subsidies); iii) within a customer class (intra-class subsidies). The advantage
of a cross subsidy is that it avoids using government funds. The disadvantage is that it distorts prices, which
affects consumption by the customer classes that fund and receive the cross subsidy. Figure 4.1 illustrates
the need for funding when tariffs exceed 2.5 percent of the bottom quintile’s expenditures.37

Existing social protection programs in Armenia are some of the best targeted programs in the ECA region.38
The Family Benefit Program is well suited to distribute subsidies in the form of credits equal to the
monthly average water consumption of poor households multiplied by the difference between the new and
affordable tariff.

         As shown in Figure 4.2, the incidence of benefit and targeting efficiency of subsidies delivered through
         the FBP as cash transfers to customers is much higher than would be expected with indirect transfers to
         service providers. When subsidies are administered directly to service providers, customers are subsidized
         on a per m3 basis, so customers who consume more receive a greater portion of the subsidy. According to
         consumption records from 2012, when subsidies are transferred directly to service providers, customers in
         the 5th quintile receive 330 percent of the subsidies provided to the 1st quintile.

The administrative cost and burden of this subsidization option is remarkably low, because the FBP has
already developed a successful program to target vulnerable water and sanitation customers and has in
place a mechanism to deliver cash transfers. It takes less than two months for eligible customers who apply
to the program to begin receiving benefits. For its advantages in targeting efficiency and administrative
costs, it is recommended that cash transfers are used to subsidize vulnerable customers



4.2	 Transition to Cost-Recovery
Increases from current tariffs to cost-recovery tariffs present three important issues for the GoA to consider:

▪	 How to keep water affordable for as much of the population as possible
▪	 How to prevent “rate shock,” or customer discontent over sudden, substantial tariff increases. Rate shock
   is more than a political problem. It can create real financial problems for water service providers by
   decreasing collection efficiency and increasing commercial losses. Rate shock is related to customer
   willingness to pay but not necessarily to affordability.
▪	 The cost of subsidies to the sector under each tariff transition program. This includes subsidies to the
   service providers for covering basic O&M, capital improvement reserves and debt service costs. It also
   includes increases in water and wastewater fees for budgetary customers and contributions to the Family
   Benefit Program for the protection of vulnerable families.
This section presents four potential transition programs for moving from current tariffs to cost-recovery
tariffs over the period of 2014–2019. The transition options described assume the one operator scenario
and a flat volumetric tariff differentiated for residential and non-residential customers. Stakeholders from
the tariff workshop generally preferred this option for tariff design.

The subsidy levels required by each of the transition options are estimated by calculating: i) the difference
between the revenue requirements from each year; ii) the revenue collected under a given tariff scheme; iii)
the budget required for subsidies through the FBP program; iv) the increased revenue from sales after VAT;
v) the increased cost of paying for water and wastewater services of budgetary customers.


4.2.1	    Option 1
In transition option 1, tariffs would reach full cost recovery levels by 2019. In June of 2016, after the start
of the new contract arrangement, tariffs would increase to 210 AMD/m³ until 2018 and to full cost recovery
levels in 2019.

Figure 4.3 shows how the tariff levels in transition option 1 would affect customers from each of the service
areas under a differentiated tariff.

4.2.2	      Option 2
In transition option 2, tariffs would reach full cost recovery levels by 2019. In June of 2016, after the start
of the new contract arrangement, tariffs would increase to 210 AMD/m³ and to cost recovery levels by 2019.

Figure 4.5 shows the tariff levels in transition option 2 as they affect customers from each of the service
areas under a differentiated tariff.

 4.2.5	          Analysis of transition options
 In all of the transition options, there is low risk that affordability would be a problem for customers in
 the bottom quintile due to the FBP. The potential fiscal burden from necessary subsidies is a greater




                                                                                                                                             55

         concern. Rate shock also could pose challenges for reform. The results of the WtP survey show that on
         average, respondents were willing to pay a maximum of only 17.7 percent more than their current monthly
         water expenditures for system improvements. The tariff increases proposed in the transition plans require
         considerably higher percentage increases. Table 4.6 shows the annual percentage rate hike for each
         transition option.

         Note: Dark grey box represents highest rate hike in each transition program. Lighter grey box represents the op-
         tion’s second highest rate hike.


         Transition options 2 and 4 have the lowest risk of rate shock with the greatest annual rate hike of 20.5
         and 20.9 percentage points over the span of five years. The key differences between the two options are
         the total subsidy cost between the years 2014–2019 and when the initial rate hike is introduced. Transition
         option 4 has a 16.5 billion AMD total subsidy cost, the lowest among the options. This is largely because
         it requires the most immediate initial rate hike. The lower the total subsidy cost, the earlier cost recover
         levels are reached. By comparison, transition option 2 has the second highest subsidy cost. However, the
         initial rate hike would not be introduced until the second half of 2016, a year later than in transition option
         4. It is important to note that under all transition programs, improvements to water services are expected
         to happen at the same pace, according to the investment plan outlined in Appendix D. Thus, to align public
         support with tariff increases, there are clear advantages to spreading out tariff increases over several years.
         This would allow customers to see improvements in their quality of service as tariff levels increase. Again,
         transition options 2 and 4 present the most gradual increases among the four options.

         Transition options 1 and 3 hold the highest risk for rate shock, with tariff increases of 44.7 percent in 2019
         and 48 percent in 2016, respectively. Such a large sudden increase in rates has a stronger likelihood of
         public disapproval of tariff reform. These increases are much higher than the surveyed level of willingness to
         pay.



         4.3	 Public Communications
         Regardless of the transition option chosen, a critical component of tariff reform is a well-coordinated
         communication campaign. It is important for customers to understand: i) what is changing and why; ii) what
         is the long-term plan; iii) what will be the expected benefits of the plan; iv) how much tariffs will increase in
         the upcoming five year period.

         Survey results showed that there is much institutional distrust and a collective belief that water providers
         should pay for improvements to WSS infrastructure. These sentiments make the likelihood of rate shock
         high, especially if tariffs are increased to cost recovery levels within a short period of time.40 Consequently,

          	 See Appendix J.7 for respondents’ attitudes towards stakeholders responsible for WSS improvements and perceptions of WSS providers’
         40

         ability to successfully deliver improvements.

                                                                                            ARMENIA: WATER SECTOR TARIFF STUDY




it may be beneficial for the GoA to use direct and indirect means to involve the public in rate setting. A
successful public awareness and communication campaign can: i) inform the public on true sector costs; ii)
inform the public on conservation issues; iii) reduce public distrust of water service providers and the GoA.
Some methods of communication include:

   ▪	 Bill inserts are particularly useful to: i) announce tariff study events such as community meetings; ii)
      report findings; iii) report effective dates of tariff changes. Although inserts have a potential to reach
      all customers, they are often discarded as ‘junk mail’.
   ▪	 Newsletters can be used to provide more detailed information about a specific concern related to
      tariff reform. They can be distributed to community groups most affected by tariff changes.
   ▪	 Community group presentations are a relatively inexpensive way to involve the public in the tariff
      reform process. Unlike with print materials, trained utility representatives can meet directly with
      members of the public.
   ▪	 24 hour information lines with recorded messages can inform interested members of the public
      on the date and time of tariff study events, public hearing sessions and tariff study findings. Contact
      numbers of a few utility representatives that can answer the public’s questions would also be
      pertinent.
   ▪	 Print and broadcast media relations with local media networks can brief and provide advance
      notice to the public on the tariff reform process.
   ▪	 Internet sites can be a source of information and a platform for the public to communicate with
      service providers. Information such as presentations, newsletters, and study findings can be easily
      uploaded and updated for users to access at any time. In addition, contact details and a messaging
      platform would allow the public to communicate with service providers directly.
It takes time to build public support for tariff reform. Public communication should be sustained throughout
the transition period, and showing links between higher tariffs and noticeable service improvements will be
crucial to success.

Appendix A: Approach Taken for Aggregating Costs in
the Revenue Requirement


There are two general options for aggregating utilities’ costs into a revenue requirement:

    ▪	The rate-of-return approach.41 Under the rate-of-return approach, a utility’s costs of service
      are assumed to include: cash operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses and
      an allowed rate of return on invested capital (often referred to as the “rate base” or “regulated
      asset base”). The sum of these costs (after any required adjustments made by the regulator for
      imprudent expenditures) is the annual revenue requirement. The revenue requirement is typically
      represented arithmetically as follows: Revenue requirement = operating and maintenance expenses +
      depreciation + (rate base x allowed return).
    ▪	The cash needs approach. Under the cash needs approach, a utility’s costs of service are assumed
      to include: operating and maintenance expenses, any debt service requirements (where debt service
      means principal plus interest payments required on any loan) and the direct cost of any capital
      expenditures not financed by debt (i.e., capital expenditure paid for by the utility from its revenues).
      The revenue requirement is typically represented arithmetically as follows: Revenue requirement =
      operating and maintenance expenses + debt service + capital improvements.
The cash needs approach explicitly acknowledges direct, annual cash requirements for capital investment.
The rate-of-return approach provides a stream of cash which is only a proxy (not a direct measure) of a

  	 The term “rate” is used in the United States and some other countries to mean the same as “tariff”. The term “rate of return” refers to the
returns expected by equity investors and lenders on the capital provided to utilities. The rate of return is expressed as a percentage of the util-
ity’s asset value and often reflects a weighted average of rates of return expected by equity and debt investors (often referred to as a “weighted
average cost of capital”). We therefore use the terms “rate” and “tariff” interchangeably throughout this document.

ARMENIA: WATER SECTOR TARIFF STUDY




         As shown in the table and notes to the table, with the “cash needs” approach, the value represented by
         depreciation charges is captured through debt service costs and direct recognition of the costs of any
         capital improvements not financed by debt. The cash needs approach, if implemented correctly so that rates
         recover full operation and maintenance and capital costs, yields the same level of revenue requirement as
         does rate of return regulation.43

         A number of water regulators have observed that depreciation accounting is particularly ill suited to
         measure the useful life of many underground water sector assets, for the following reasons:

              ▪	Underground water sector assets have longer lives than depreciation accounting recognizes. This is
                particularly true for irrigation and wastewater assets (some sewers and canals have been operating
                for hundreds of years).
              ▪	Water sector assets are more often repaired or renewed than replaced. Repair work is often
                necessary only in extraordinary circumstances (i.e., by natural disaster or severe weather conditions).
         For the purposes of this tariff study, we use a cash needs approach for estimating the future revenue
         requirement as it:

              ▪	Measures the costs to a water utility of maintaining, renewing and repairing its system more directly
                than conventional depreciation accounting. This will be particularly important for Armenia’s water
                utilities as they look to further rehabilitate their systems to meet service quality targets.
              ▪	Relies on water utility forecasts of maintenance, renewals, and repairs. These factors more accurately
                reflect the needs of the system than charges based on notional depreciation schedules.
         Since the Government of Armenia also provides investment funding for capital expenditures (CAPEX), it
         could consider requiring a return on that investment (to be paid out as dividends). However, it should be
         noted that dividend payments, like debt service, mean a higher cost of service which will result in a higher
         tariff.




         43
           	 In practice, many government-owned utilities typically fail to recover both full O&M and capital costs, but this failure is due to political
         pressures to keep rates low, or because of poor management (i.e., poor collections procedures), not because the “cash needs” approach fails
         to take the full costs of running and sustaining a utility into account.

Forecasts of the revenue requirement were developed in a tariff projection model (TPM)44 with 64 fully
interlinked spreadsheets, shown in Appendix Figure B.1. The TPM is constructed with separate revenue
requirement calculations for the service areas of Yerevan Djur, AWSC and the 3 regional utilities. These are
then aggregated in the one and two operator options.

         Appendix C: Methodology for Estimation of Operation
         and Maintenance Costs


         This appendix provides an overview of the methodology used in modelling operation and maintenance
         (O&M) cost estimates for each of the service providers (Sheets A1-A9, B1-B6, and C1-C7 of the TPM) .45

         Operation and maintenance expenses refer to the ongoing costs of maintaining and operating utility
         equipment. In the revenue requirement model, these costs are summarized as:
               ▪	 Staff costs (management costs, security costs and remaining staff costs)
               ▪	 Electricity costs
               ▪	 Fixed costs (less staff costs)
               ▪	 Variable costs (less electricity)

         All costs are adjusted to account for the collection rates of each service provider by dividing the total costs
         by the collection rate.

              C.1	 Staff Costs
         Staff costs have been modeled in a staff cost projection model (sheet A9 of the TPM). These costs are
         modelled using the following variables for each service provider:
               ▪	 Number of management staff
               ▪	 Number of operational staff
               ▪	 Number of customers
               ▪	 Customer/management staff ratio
               ▪	 Customer/operational staff ratio
               ▪	 Average monthly salary of managerial staff
               ▪	 Average monthly salary of operational staff

         Historic figures for each of these variables have been provided by service providers for 2011-2013. These are
         then projected for the 2014-2030 period using the assumptions shown in Appendix Table C.1.

In addition to the managerial and operational staff costs, management fees for AWSC and the three regional

After year 2016, the management costs for AWSC and MVV are reduced by 60 percent, representing the
removal of the management fee. For the year of 2016, the reduction is applied only to the 7 months of 2016
that take place after the management contract is finished. The first 5 months of 2016 use the management
fee shown in Appendix Table C.2.

     C.2	 Electricity Costs
Electricity costs for each service provider are adjusted annually based on three factors: i) the price of elec-
tricity; ii) the volume of water supplied to the network; and iii) the kWh used per m3 of water supplied to
the network (energy efficiency of the system). As energy efficiency improves, electricity costs decline at a
proportionate pace.


        C.2.1	       The price of electricity
Changes in the price of electricity are estimated using projections developed in the 2013 Armenia Energy
Sector Policy Note Update. These are summarized in Appendix G.


        C.2.2	       The volume of water supplied to the network
Projections in the volume of water supplied to the network for each service provider use assumptions
developed in the Armenia Water Sector Study.47 These are summarized in Appendix E.1.


        C.2.3	 Changes in energy efficiency
Appendix Table C.3 summarizes the different energy efficiency assumptions used for each company.

Energy efficiency: Yerevan Djur

Over the course of Yerevan Djur’s lease contract, the company has achieved dramatic improvements in the
electricity efficiency of its water and wastewater systems. In 2009, Yerevan Djur consumed a total of 109.6
million kWh, in comparison with 240.3 million kWh in 2000.48 For estimating the future improvement to
Yerevan Djur’s electricity efficiency, it is assumed that, after a measured reduction of 20 percent in 2013,
kWh consumed per cubic meter of water produced remains constant. This estimation is based on the
assumption that many of the major electricity efficiency improvements have already been achieved and that
future improvements will not result in large changes to the overall efficiency of the system.

Energy efficiency: AWSC

Energy costs for AWSC are estimated using projections from the total management plan developed by
SAUR.49

         Energy Efficiency: Three Regional Utilities

         For the three regional utilities it is assumed that a reduction of 25 percent of electricity usage per cubic
         meter of water produced is achieved after the first 10 years of the lease contract (2016 – 2026). These
         changes also reflect the phasing of the capital expenditure plan. Appendix Table C.3 shows the assumed
         changes in electricity consumption over the course of the projection period.

                   C.3.1	       Changes in active subscribers
         The changes in active subscribers for each service provider are estimated using figures developed in the
         Armenia Water Sector Study.50 These are shown in Appendix F.


                   C.3.2	 Historic and test year fixed O&M costs
         Historic fixed O&M costs for each service provider are determined using data from the audited financial
         statements of each of the five service providers. Appendix Table C.4 shows historic and test year costs for
         each of the service providers.

The changes in water demand and production are estimated using figures developed in the Armenia Water
Sector Study.52 These are shown in Appendix E.1


        C.4.2	 Changes in variable production, distribution and indirect overhead
        costs
Historic variable production, distribution and indirect overhead costs for each service provider are
determined using data from the audited financial statements of each of the five service providers. These
are then adjusted for the base year and the projection period using the changes in water production (water
which is supplied to the network). Appendix Table C.5 shows historic and test year costs for each of the
service providers.

         In estimating revenue requirements over the 20-year projection period, there are additional expenditures
         which are expected to be undertaken by service providers. These are summarized as follows:

               ▪	 The inclusion of the expense of rain water removal network maintenance in the Yerevan Djur service
                  area starting in 2016

               ▪	 The inclusion of increased security requirements for AWSC and the Three Regional Utilities starting
                  in 2016

               ▪	 The inclusion of servicing internal networks of multi-family apartment buildings as a responsibility
                  of service providers, starting in 2024

               ▪	 The replacement of water meters by service providers starting in 2016

         Estimates for the above expenses were provided by the State Water Committee. They are shown in Appendix
         Table C.7.

  C.6	 Changes in Collection Rate
When calculating the necessary tariffs to meet cost recovery, revenue requirements are adjusted to
account for collection rates of each service provider. It is assumed that, with a switch to a lease contract,
the collection efficiency of the service providers would approach the level achieved in the Yerevan Djur
lease contract over the period of 10 years. It is assumed that AWSC and the three regional utilities, after
converting to a lease contract, achieve a collection efficiency of 99.3 percent by 2025. This is shown in
Appendix Table C.8.

         Appendix D: Methodology for Estimation of Capital Costs


         Capital costs include the following three components:
               ▪	 Debt service payments on existing loans
               ▪	 Debt service payments on new loans for rehabilitation and system expansion
               ▪	 Losses or gains on foreign exchange

              D.1	 Capital Costs of Existing Loans
         Debt servicing costs on existing loans are forecasted using actual loan schedules provided by each of the
         service providers for all current loans in the water sector. A summary of these loans is shown in Appendix
         Table D.1. Detailed repayment schedules are shown in Sheet E1 of the TPM. 55

         Capital expenditure estimations for rehabilitation, system extension and waste treatment investment have
         been developed by Dorsch International Consultants for the Armenia Water Sector Study. All calculations
         and estimates are included in Sheets E1-E10 of the TPM. 56 The methodology is included as excerpts from
         the Armenia Water Sector Study.57

        D.2.1	 General considerations (excerpt from Financial and Human Resource
        Impact Report: Water Sector Study Armenia, 2014) 58
The estimate of the mid- and long-term investment needs in the WS WW sector in a developing country is a
complex and critical issue as the results and reliability of the estimates are substantially dependent on:

     ▪	An appropriate assessment of the technical condition and rehabilitation needs of the existing WS and
       WW systems in the particular urban and rural service areas;
     ▪	The target service standards for public water supply and wastewater collection systems in urban and
       rural service areas (which level of water supply quality and connection rate for which size / type of
       settlement);
     ▪	The treatment / effluent standards for wastewater and sludge treatment systems in urban and rural
       service areas (mechanical, chemical, biological standard for which size / type of settlement);
     ▪	An appropriate assessment of the settlement structure in the urban and rural service areas;
     ▪	An appropriate assessment of the topographic , soil, surface & groundwater conditions in the
       particular urban and rural water supply areas;
     ▪	An appropriate assessment of adequate unit costs for the different system components under the
       different conditions in the urban and rural supply areas; and
     ▪	A realistic time frame for achieving of the targeted service standards.
That means, as long as the required input data are not really known (at least to a certain degree of detail
and accuracy) and the target parameters are not yet clearly defined the estimate of each Consultant will
necessarily come to another result regarding the overall amount of the mid- and long-term investment needs
in a country.

A schematic estimate of investment needs carried out by the Consultant of the Water Sector Study is
presented in Section 4.3D.2.2. The estimates of the investment needs for the wastewater / sanitation sector
in Armenia currently carried out by JINJ Consult is summarized in Section 4.3D.2.7.


        D.2.2	 Investment needs estimated by the Consultant of the Water Sector
        Study (connected customers) – (excerpt from Financial and Human Resource
        Impact Report: Water Sector Study Armenia, 2014) 59
Within the “Present State of Water Sector Report” the Consultant has carried out a projection of the long-
term investment needs in the W&WW sector in Armenia for the period 2014 to 2033 by means of a normative
approach.

The estimates are based on unit cost rates derived from projects in the region and on detailed cost
estimates as provided for example by AWSC. The estimates are stated separately for the particular service
areas currently managed by utilities and carried out for the following sector components:
     ▪	Rehabilitation of WS systems
     ▪	Extension of WS systems
     ▪	Water disposal facilities
     ▪	Wastewater treatment facilities
The respective unit rates applied and the resulting investment needs are summarized in the following three
tables.

Existing water supply systems for off-grid communities are assumed to be mostly obsolete and in need
of replacement. For off-grid communities it is assumed that the existing water supply systems are mostly
obsolete and require complete replacement. The investment needs of the off-grid communities as shown in
detail in Sheet E2 of the TPM include:

       ▪	Water source including access road 20,000 EUR
       ▪	Chlorination device: 7,500 EUR
       ▪	Transmission mains: 24,000 EUR
       ▪	Reservoirs: digressive cost function based on population figures

       D.2.7	 Investment needs for the wastewater sector in Armenia as estimated
       by JINJ Consult (excerpt from Financial and Human Resource Impact Report:
       Water Sector Study Armenia, 2014) 65
JINY Consult is going to prepare an estimate of the investment needs in the WW sector in Armenia. This
estimate is not carried out on “utility basis”, but for the different types of urban and rural settlement areas
as outlined in the following table.

According to preliminary JINJ estimates the investment needs for wastewater removal systems amount to
about EUR 1300 million for cities & towns and to EUR 685 million for villages (including off-grid villages).

The preliminary estimated investment needs for WWTPs, as presented in the following table, amount
to about EUR 370 million for cities & towns and to EUR 240 million for villages (including off-grid
villages).	

The overall investment needs for WW removal systems and WWTPs, as presented in the following table
amount to about EUR 2600 million.

              D.3	 Funding of Investment Needs in the WS & WW Sector in Armenia (Excerpt
              From Financial and Human Resource Impact Report: Water Sector Study Armenia,
              2014) 66
         The amount of investment funds earmarked for rehabilitation and extension of the W&WW sector have a
         decisive impact on the level and development of the average W&WW prices which are required to achieve
         both the targeted water sector cost recovery and the financial sustainability of the future lease contract
         operator.

         The future investment funds earmarked for rehabilitation and extension of the W&WW sector will have
         decisive impact on the development of average water and wastewater prices required to achieve the
         targeted sector cost recovery. Two tariff scenarios were studied:

               ▪	 Tariff Scenario A (conservative estimate of investment funds by SCWE)
               ▪	 Tariff Scenario B (with maximal investment funds as earmarked by ADS for the W&WW sector in
                  Armenia)
         Provisional estimates provided by SCWE suggest investment funds of approximately EUR 150 million
         available for the 2016-2020 period. This would average EUR 30 million per year. Approximately EUR 180
         million would be available for the 2021-2025 period. This would average EUR 36 million per year. Based on
         these figures it is assumed that for the 2026-2033 period, EUR 36 million per year will be available.

         This means that in the “Tariff Scenario A,” investment funds of about EUR 618 million or AMD 338 billion
         are assumed to be available for investments in the W&WW sector in Armenia over the period 2016 to 2033;
         compared to estimated investment needs of AMD 708 billion.

The following two tables show a provisional allocation of the earmarked investment funds for the service
areas currently managed by utilities and some funds for off-grid communities (in million EUR, respectively
in million AMD). In this context, the allocation of the investment funds by utility service areas does not really
affect the average future water and wastewater price in the case of one nationwide operator. However, the
allocation should have a logic structure and be oriented to the needs of the different service areas. The final
allocation of funds will be the subject of more detailed investment studies.

         Sheet E4 of the TPM shows annual allocation of the investment funds for WS system rehabilitation/
         extension, water disposal and WW treatment. 67

         For the service area of Yerevan Djur it is assumed that the earmarked capital funds will cover primarily the
         investment needs for WS system extension and rehabilitation. Residual capital funds will be used equally for
         investments in water disposal and WW treatment.

         For the service areas of AWSC and the 3RWC it is assumed that the earmarked capital funds are allocated to
         WS system rehabilitation/extension and water disposal proportionally to the current investment schedules.

         At this time it is not known from which sources and under which conditions the overall capital requirements
         of about AMD 338 billion for the period 2016 to 2033 are to be funded. The Government of Armenia has a
         restricted funding capability, so it is assumed that the government would want to receive as many soft loan
         funds from international IFIs as possible.

         It is assumed that the earmarked funds are on average provided as “favorable loans” with the following
         average loan conditions:

              ▪	Loan disbursement of each year is treated as a separate loan
              ▪	Year of loan start: 2016
              ▪	Loan period: 30 years
              ▪	Grace period: 5 years
              ▪	Interest rate: 4.0 percent p.a.
              ▪	Commission fees: 0.0 percent
         Sheets E5, E6, and E7 of the TPM show the resulting debt service schedule by year. 68The following
         table shows the anticipated amount of annual funds for the particular utility service areas by sector
         components.

     E.4	 Losses and Gains from Foreign Exchange
Losses and gains on foreign exchange are estimated using the new and existing loan repayment schedules
described in Appendix D.1 and Appendix D.2. The foreign exchange rate projections from the AWSC Total
Management Plan shown in Appendix Table D.16 were applied. To determine the distribution of new loans
between Euros and USD, the distribution between Euros and USD of all existing loans in the sector is used.
Sheet E1 of the TPM shows losses and gains on foreign exchange for existing loans. 69

ARMENIA: WATER SECTOR TARIFF STUDY




         Appendix E: Water Demand and Production and
         Wastewater generation.


         Water demand and production and wastewater generation forecast have been developed by Dorsch
         International Consultants for the Armenia Water Sector Study. The methodology is included as an excerpt
         from the Financial and Human Resource Impact Report. 71

              E.1	 Projection of Water Demand (Excerpt From the Financial and Human Re-
              source Impact Report: Water Sector Study Armenia, 2014) 72
         Calculation and projection of overall water demand development is based on data and projections provided
         by the utilities. Only for Yerevan service area, where the forecast ends with 2016, it is assumed that the
         population demand will increase by 0.5% p.a., whereas the demand of all other consumer categories will
         remain about constant. The original demand projection is then adjusted to account for “income elasticity”
         and “price elasticity” which become relevant with a significant increase of W&WW prices.

         Appendix Table E.1 shows the projection of the original water demand for service areas currently managed
         by utilities (on an annual basis over the period 2012-2033).

         For off-grid communities, water metering does not exist. The water demand forecast is based on a current
         normative water consumption of 250 l/cap/d. The assumption was made that the average water demand will
         drop to a level of 150 l/cap/d by the year 2033 (see Appendix Table E.2).

         For the elaboration of the TPM, the Consultant has modified the original demand projection by considering
         both the effects of “income elasticity” and “price elasticity” for the service areas managed by utilities.

         Regarding “price elasticity,” data are provided by the study “Policy alternatives in subsidizing water sector
         in Armenia”, Advanced Social Technologies” NGO (AST), Yerevan 2012. This study is based on a survey
         conducted with a representative sample of 1,600 Armenian households in 2011. The study included a
         question regarding customer’s consumption response to a 50 percent and 100 percent tariff increase. The
         results show an average consumption reduction of 30.6 percent for the first question and 41 percent for the
         second question (-0.6 price elasticity for the first question and -0.4 price elasticity for the second question).

         Base on the results of this study the Consultant has applied:

              ▪	An “income elasticity factor” of 0.3, which means that the domestic water demand is assumed to
                increase by 3 percent if the available household income increases by 10 percent.
              ▪	A “price elasticity factor” of - 0.4, which means that the domestic water demand is assumed
                to decrease by 4 percent if the W&WW price increases by 10 percent. A factor of -0.4 is chosen,
                because the actual reaction on price changes is usually somewhat lower than the anticipated reaction
                expressed in willingness to pay studies.
         Appendix Table E.1 shows the annual modified water demand projection for each utility.

The water demand in the utilities’ service areas is expected to increase while water demand in rural areas is
expected to decrease. This is due to the reduction of the specific per capita consumption, which is expected
to start when pricing of water will enhance rational use.


       E.1.1	 Projection of water production (excerpt from Financial and Human
       Resource Impact Report: Water Sector Study Armenia, 2014) 73
The original projection of long-term water production as described in detail in the Study Report “Present
State of Water Sector” assumes that with full rehabilitation of the existing water supply systems the high
portion of NRW (currently about 75 percent) can be reduced to 35 percent by the year 2033.

Appendix Table E.3 gives a detailed projection of water production using the estimate of full rehabilitation
funds required in Appendix D.2.74

         NRW reductions at the utility level and better demand management in off-grid communities will likely lead
         to a significant decrease in water production for those communities.


                  E.1.2	 Projection of wastewater generation (excerpt from Financial and
                  Human Resource Impact Report: Water Sector Study Armenia, 2014) 76
         It is assumed that 80 percent of water supplied is returned as wastewater both in the service areas managed
         by utilities and in rural areas. Sheet C4 of the TPM shows projected annual wastewater generation by utility
         service area. 77

         Appendix H: Cost Allocation by Customer Classes


         To ensure equitable allocation of costs across customer classes, the forecast revenue requirement for
         each year is apportioned by three allocators: (i) water consumption; (ii) number of customers; (iii) peak
         month consumption. Allocators are shown in column (a). The percentages in columns (c), (d), (e) and (f)
         we derived using the 2012 annual reports and data provided by service providers. Costs for each line item
         were assigned an allocator. For example, electricity costs (640 Mil AMD) were allocated by the percentage
         of total water consumption by each customer class as described below:

                                                  Total Electricity Costs = 640 Mil AMD

                                         Residential Electricity Costs = 383 (629*60.9%).

  J.1	   Survey Methodology
The willingness-to-pay survey supports the Armenia Tariff Study by providing a quantitative measure
of Armenians’ willingness to pay for improvements to water and sanitation services. It also gauges the
social acceptability of tariff reform. Enumerators interviewed and acquired 600 completed surveys
from respondents living in 4 marzes: Yerevan, Shirak, Ararat and Kotyak. Though small, the survey
is representative of the four marzes. Yerevan and outside-Yerevan (Shirak, Ararat and Kotyak) consist of
approximately 75 percent of the population in Armenia. Furthermore, the marzes selected represent the
diverse conditions of water supply and sanitation services in Armenia. The survey results have a sampling
error of 5.7 percent. Appendix Figure J.1 provides a geographical representation of the four marzes that
covered in this survey.

ARMENIA: WATER SECTOR TARIFF STUDY




                  J.1.1	        Sampling design
         Nearly half of Armenia’s population lives in Yerevan. The marz has roughly 52 percent of active subscribers
         who receive WSS in the country. In marzes outside of Yerevan, four companies, the larger AWSC and smaller
         consortium made up of the three smaller utilities, Lori, Shirak and Nor Anunk, serve approximately 175
         thousand households. AWSC serves approximately 32 percent of the subscribers in the country while the
         three utilities collectively serve approximately 16 percent of subscribers.

         To select respondents, the proportional to size sampling approach was used with data from customer
         records provided by the water companies. Samples were divided as follows: roughly 50 percent were
         customers from Yerevan served by Yerevan Djur; 50 percent were customers from outside of Yerevan,
         namely, from AWSC (31.9 percent); 16 percent were customers of a consortium of the three smaller utilities.
         To reflect these proportions, 313 respondents were selected from all 12 administrative districts in Yerevan,
         191 from Ararat and Kotyak and 96 from Shriak. For the marzes outside Yerevan, communities were selected
         by using probability proportionate to size sampling so that smaller communities had an equal opportunity
         to be selected relative to larger communities. Within each administrative district of Yerevan, about 26
         households were selected. From the 10 communities selected in Ararat and Kotyak, about 20 households
         were selected from each of the 10 communities chosen. In Shirak, about 20 households were selected from
         each of the 5 communities chosen. Appendix Table J.1 presents a quantitative breakdown of the sampling
         approach. Appendix Figure J.2 illustrates the sampling approach.

The results of the survey were analyzed by the following sub-samples: Yerevan; outside Yerevan; rural, urban
areas outside of Yerevan; and poor and non-poor groups.

  J.2	 Availability and Continuity of WSS Services
Respondents were asked a series of questions on their centralized water service (CWS). The questions
related to continuity of supply including the number of days in a week and hours out of 24 hours they
received water service from the CWS. Respondents were also asked if they used alternative sources of water
in addition to water from the CWS to meet their household’s water needs.


      J.2.1	      Continuity of supply
In Yerevan, other urban and rural areas, 98.3, 96.9 and 85.7 percent of respondents receive water
every day of the week, respectively. Appendix Table J.2 shows by the number of days the proportion of
respondents who receive water from the CWS by sub-samples.

         Only 47.3 percent of respondents indicated that they receive 24 hours of continuous water supply. Respondents
         who live in Yerevan receive, on average, 21.1 hours of water each day, the highest amongst the marzes sampled.
         On average, respondents from outside Yerevan receive 14.2 hours of water each day, while those in other urban
         and rural areas receive 14.5 and 13.4 hours of service, respectively. In other urban areas outside of Yerevan,
         respondents experience disparate hours of service—20 percent of respondents report receiving only one to four
         hours of water service each day while 36.4 percent report that they receive more than twenty hours of service
         daily. Appendix Table J.3 outlines the hours of service received in each settlement type.

                  J.2.2	        Some use of water sources other than CWS to meet household needs
         Most respondents are connected to the CWS, but about 5 percent of those surveyed rely on other water
         sources to meet household water needs. They obtain water from other sources because they perceive water
         from the CWS to be of poorer quality, and/or because they do not receive sufficient amounts from the
         centralized network. Appendix Table J.5 shows the percentage of household water needs met by the CWS
         for respondents who reported that they use other sources to meet household water needs.

By settlement type, only 1.6 percent of respondents who live in other urban areas outside of Yerevan areas
supplement household needs with other sources of water. In Yerevan, 5.8 percent do so, while 10.5 percent
of those who live in rural areas supplement with other sources. In Yerevan, respondents purchase bottled
water, while outside of Yerevan, respondents use a variety of sources in addition to bottled water, including
public taps and deep wells. Appendix Figure J.3 shows the alternative sources of water used by respondents
in Yerevan and areas outside of Yerevan.

     J.3	 Satisfaction with WSS Services
Sixty-four percent of respondents surveyed were satisfied with their current WSS services, of which
47.2 percent were completely satisfied. There is a positive and direct correlation between respondents’
satisfaction with WSS services and the number of days in a week of WSS service as well as the number of
hours of service received out of 24 hours.83

ARMENIA: WATER SECTOR TARIFF STUDY




         In Yerevan, where almost all respondents receive water all seven days of the week, and 72.5 percent receive
         more than 20 hours of supply a day, 46.2 percent of respondents were satisfied to some extent and 21.7
         percent were completely satisfied with their WSS services. In urban areas outside of Yerevan, where WSS
         services are more variable, 30.2 percent of respondents were satisfied to some extent with their WSS
         services, while 38.4 percent were completely satisfied. In rural areas, where WSS services are the poorest,
         and respondents receive on average, 13.4 hours of water a day, 14.3 percent reported that they were
         satisfied to some extent, while 29.5 percent were completely satisfied. Appendix Table J.6 further describes
         respondents’ level of satisfaction with WSS services by settlement type.

         Respondents were also asked about their satisfaction with attributes of water supply including: continuity
         of water supply; the time schedule for delivery; pressure; and qualities such as smell, taste, cleanliness and
         clarity. Overall, about 70 percent of respondents were satisfied or completely satisfied with all attributes of
         CWS services. Appendix Figure J.4 shows the proportion of respondents who were satisfied or dissatisfied
         with attributes of CWS service.

         Respondents in Yerevan and urban areas outside of Yerevan were more satisfied with the duration of
         water supply and quality (smell, taste, cleanliness and clarity) attributes of CWS than rural respondents.
         In rural areas, 52.4 percent of respondents were satisfied with the quality of CWS while 66.2 percent of
         respondents in Yerevan and 76.9 percent of respondents residing in urban areas outside of Yerevan were
         satisfied or completely satisfied. Appendix Figure J.5 shows the most common problems associated with

    J.4	 Current Sanitation Conditions
Results of the survey indicate that 84.3 percent of respondents are connected to the centralized sewerage
system. Every respondent in Yerevan and 97.6 percent of respondents in urban areas outside of Yerevan
reported that they are connected to the centralized sewerage system. By contrast, 16.2 percent of rural
respondents reported that they are connected to the centralized sewerage system. Appendix Figure J.6
shows the proportion of respondents who are connected, by settlement type.

                  J.4.1	         Households not connected to the centralized sewerage system
         Households who are not connected to the centralized sewerage system in other urban and rural areas have
         the following toilet facilities: pit latrines with slab (covering); pit latrines with no slab; or open pits. Eighty-
         six percent of unconnected households use pit latrines with no slab or open pits.

         Sewerage of unconnected households is disposed in different ways. In rural and urban areas outside of
         Yerevan, sewerage empties into non-septic wells or pits. Appendix Figure J.7 shows the various types of
         waste disposal and treatment methods used by respondents not connected to the centralized sewerage
         system.

                  J.4.2	        Satisfaction with sanitation facilities and services
         Eighty-three percent of respondents surveyed were completely satisfied with their sanitation system.
         In Yerevan, where all respondents are connected to the centralized sewerage system, 97.1 percent of
         respondents were completely satisfied with the system. In other urban areas, 93.7 percent of respondents
         were completely satisfied. In contrast, only 24.8 percent of respondents from rural areas were completely
         satisfied with their sanitation system. Respondents who were less than completely satisfied with their
         sanitation system reported inconvenience and smell as the two most important problems related to
         household sanitation systems.

           J.5	 CWS Expenditures
         On average, respondents spent 2069.24 AMD on CWS each month. Respondents who live in Yerevan spent
         on average 2455.52 AMD—29.8 percent and 17.5 percent more than those who lived in other urban areas
         and rural areas, respectively.

Expenditures on alternative water sources
Respondents who used alternative sources spent on average 7214.3 AMD per month on household water
needs, more than three times the average monthly water expenditures of all study respondents. On average,
respondents bought 34.5 liters of bottled water and reported spending 5014.2 AMD per month on bottled
water in addition to, or as an alternative to consuming water from the CWS.

CWS expenditures of poor households
On average, the poor households surveyed spent 7.2 percent less on CWS services each month than
non-poor households. In Shirak, the marz with the highest poverty rate in Armenia, respondents spent
on average 1589.74 AMD each month on CWS services. Appendix Figure J.8 ranks households’ average
monthly water expenditures by settlement type, marz and poor and non-poor groups.

Sanitation expenditures for households that are not connected to the CWS
The cost of building a standalone toilet can be high or come at no monetary cost to a household. On
average, respondents who were not connected to the CWS spent 44,702 AMD, while the median amount
reported was 20,000 AMD. In man-hours, a standalone toilet took about 55 hours to build. A few
respondents also reported costs associated with maintaining their toilets. The average amount spent was
14,674 AMD while the median amount spent was 8000 AMD.

  J.6	 Attitudes and Perceptions of Current Tariffs
To better understand respondents’ attitudes and perceptions of current tariffs, enumerators asked
respondents whether they agreed or disagreed with five statements. The statements were related to issues of
fairness and transparency of current tariffs.

Appendix Table J.7 summarizes respondents’ attitudes and perceptions of tariffs by settlement type.

  J.7	 Attitudes Towards Stakeholders Responsible for WSS Improvements and Per-
  ceptions of Their Ability to Successfully Deliver Improvements
Respondents were asked to indicate which stakeholder they thought should be most responsible for paying
for sector improvements. As shown in Appendix Figure J.9, 36.5 percent of respondents thought that service
providers should be most responsible. The central government and “all of the above” were ranked second
and third respectively.

Responses were largely mixed when respondents were asked to rate their confidence in service providers’
ability to deliver sector improvements. In Yerevan, where quality and reliability of service is the highest, only
2.9 percent of respondents were very confident that service providers could deliver on the improvements
described in the WtP scenarios. In contrast, respondents outside Yerevan were more optimistic, 17.2 percent
were very confident that improvements could be delivered.

           J.8	 Attitudes Toward Social Protection Mechanisms
         The results of the survey show that there is strong support for measures that protect the poor from tariff
         increases.

         As shown in Appendix Table J.8, more than 90 percent of respondents believe that additional measures
         must be taken to protect the poor if tariffs are increased. Respondents were also strongly in favor of
         introducing a lifeline tariff for households that consume less than 25 liters per person per day as shown in
         Appendix Figure J.11.

            Instructions for the interviewer

            When someone answers the door please read out the following text:

            Good morning/afternoon/evening. My name is _____ and I am carrying out research on a study of
            Armenia’s Water Sector for the World Bank. We would like to better understand the public support for
            improving water and wastewater services and are interested in your experiences towards the services you
            currently receive. While the city authority and water company are aware of this research, the research itself
            is independent of them. Therefore, your answers will be held entirely confidential. Would you be willing to
            share 20 minutes of your time to assist us with our data collection?

            Thank you. Before we start, I need to ask you a few questions to determine if you will be able to answer all
            the questions in the survey:

                  1.	 Have you lived in this dwelling for longer than 6 months?
                  2.	 Is your house connected to the central water supply system (water supply pipeline inside the
                      dwelling/building or in the yard or land next to the dwelling)?
                  3.	 If yes, is this connection functional (you have water through it)?
                  If ‘no’ to any question, please move to the next apartment/house on your list.

            For conducting this survey, it will be best for us if we can speak to the member of your household who is
            the most informed about water supply and sewage issues and can provide the most complete answers to
            the questions on behalf of the household. Would this be you? If not can we please speak with this person?

                   families.
                   Yes. Water and wastewater services should be supplemented under the
                   family benefit program.
                   Yes. A separate program should provide assistance for water and wastewater

                  water and wastewater infrastructure will deteriorate in the next 10 years,
                  leading to more frequent interruptions, fewer service hours, and poorer
                  pressure and quality.
          G.6_2 Introduce a water network expansion charge, where you pay a little extra
                  each month to invest in providing public access for families that currently do
                  not have access to affordable clean water.

         Willingness to Pay Scenarios
         Water Supply
         Did you know that the price paid for water only covers a small portion of the overall costs of supplying your
         home with water? Much of the infrastructure is badly in need of repair, and water losses are some of the highest
         in the world. An average of less than 50 liters for every 100 liters of water put into the water system actually
         makes it to your home. Without investment, it is likely that the quality of water service will deteriorate in the
         coming ten years, leading to fewer service hours, poorer water quality and weaker pressure.
         Suppose a program was being considered to invest in repairing and upgrading water infrastructure in Armenia.
         The improvements would provide:

           For respondents in Yerevan:                                    For respondents outside of Yerevan:
           Perfect water quality (the same as you                         8-12 extra hours of service (for customers who do not
           would get in bottled water), reliably strong                   already have 24 hour service), perfect water quality (the
           pressure, regardless of which floor you live                   same as you would get in bottled water) and reliably
           on and consistent 24 hour service, with close                  strong pressure during service hours, regardless of which
           to no service interruptions                                    floor you live on

         Considering that in total you currently pay ________ per month for water (including water from centralized system
         and purchased water), of which you currently pay ________ per month for water from the centralized system, would
         you be willing to pay _____________ more per a month for these improvements for the same amount of water
         consumed? You can assume that the improvements would be implemented within one year of the change in price.

         Sanitation
         Respondents with connection

           For respondents in Yerevan:                                    For respondents outside of Yerevan:
           Did you know that sewage from your                             Did you know that sewage from your home is currently
           home is currently discharged directly                          discharged directly into watercourses?
           into watercourses and in some cases in
           recreational areas of central Yerevan?

         Also, due to damaged pipes, during heavy rains there is a risk of cross contamination between the sewage
         network and the water supply network. Suppose a program was being considered to invest in sewage treatment
         infrastructure. The program would create a more hygienic environment for your family and community, ensure
         safe and clean drinking water, and prevent contamination of rivers and groundwater. Considering that you
         currently pay ________ per month for water and sanitation, would you be willing to pay _____________ more
         per month for these improvements? This would be in addition to the costs of improving water supply. You can
         assume that the improvements would be implemented within one year of the change in price.
         (3) Respondents without connection but that can be connected to the centralized sanitation network
         A program is being considered to bring wastewater collection services to your neighborhood and home. The
         program would provide a connection at your home to dispose of all wastewater and sewage through a public
         waste water system. These systems have been used successfully in other communities in Armenia to remove waste
         in a hygienic way without odor. The objective of the program is to prevent you from having to construct and
         maintain pit latrines in your yard and to create a more hygienic environment for your family and community.
         It would also prevent contamination of rivers and groundwater. Considering that you currently pay ________
         per month for water and sanitation, would you be willing to pay _____________ more per month for these
         improvements? This would be in addition to the costs of improving water supply. You can assume that the
         improvements would be implemented within one year of the change in price.
