      To support the implementation of the Education Strategy 2020, the World Bank’s Education Global
      Practice (formerly Human Development Network, Education) launched the Systems Approach for Better
      Education Results (SABER) initiative to help governments systematically examine and strengthen the
      performance of their education systems so that all children and youth can be equipped with knowledge
      and skills for life. SABER fills in the existing gaps in availability of policy data, information, and knowledge
      about the factors that might influence education quality and about the variables that can be transformed
      to improve the quality of education. Education Management Information Systems is one of several SABER
      domains (others include Early Childhood Development, Engaging the Private Sector, School Autonomy
      and Accountability, Student Assessment, Teachers, and Workforce Development) and each domain has a
      set of diagnostic toolkits. As a result, a knowledge base is developed that policymakers and citizens
      worldwide can utilize to identify the reforms needed to improve learning outcomes.

      This SABER initiative seeks to provide standards of good practice against which countries can rate
      themselves through a benchmarking tool. Policymakers, educational leaders, and researchers will have
      access to the data collected by this initiative. This will enable users to make their own diagnoses about
      the status of the Education Management Information System in their countries, learn about other
      countries’ policies, and make informed policy decisions. The information collected will be combined with
      information collected from other countries. It will then be disseminated through a user-friendly website,
      accessible to the general public for research and analysis. No individually-identifiable responses or data
      will be reported and country data will be reviewed by The World Bank SABER team and the country’s
      government before information is uploaded to the SABER website. For more information on SABER, visit
      worldbank.org/education/saber.


      Overview of SABER-EMIS and its instruments
      An education management information system is responsible for producing and monitoring education
      statistics within an education system. An EMIS has a multifaceted structure, comprising the technological
      and institutional arrangements for collecting, processing, and disseminating data in an education system.
      It is crucial for tracking changes, ensuring data quality and timely reporting of essential information for
      planning and management, and for facilitating the utilization of information in decision making by policy
      makers. The system’s effectiveness is dependent upon its sustainability, accountability, and efficiency. A
      successful EMIS is credible and operational in planning and policy dialogue.

      The policy domain aims to eliminate the misconception often held by education stakeholders, namely,
      that an EMIS is simply a database or an Information Technology (IT) system. People are an important
      component of an EMIS in that they not only guide the collection, maintenance, and dissemination of data,
      but they also lead the transformation of data into statistics that are used to inform decision making. In
      reality, an EMIS is a system that exists within the larger education system.


      SABER-EMIS Tool
      SABER’s EMIS policy domain aims to help countries identify areas for improvement in data collection,
      data and system management, and data use in decision making and improving the different elements
      of the education system. SABER-EMIS assesses education information systems with the aim of informing


                                                                                                                    3
        the dialogue on policies related to statistics and indicators; and helping countries monitor overall progress
Education  Management Information Systems (EMIS)
       related to education inputs, processes, and outcomes.

        SABER-EMIS identifies four core policy areas that are shared by educational data systems and need to
        be assessed:
            1. Enabling environment: Assessment of intended policies in relation to a sustainable infrastructure
               and human resources that can handle data collection, management, and access.
            2. System soundness: Assessment of the degree to which the processes and structure support the
               components of a comprehensive information management system.
            3. Quality data: Assessment of the degree to which an EMIS system accurately collects, securely
               saves, and produces high-quality, timely information.
            4. Utilization for decision making: Assessment of the reality of system implementation and
               utilization of EMIS information in decision making.

        The combination of these four areas, along with 19 associated policy levers that support the achievement
        of these goals, allows for the existence and use of a comprehensive education information management
        system that contains quality data and is critical to drive policy decisions.

        The SABER-EMIS Tool provides a systematic and           Box 1: Scope of SABER EMIS
        practical way to benchmark an EMIS. SABER-EMIS

            x SABER-EMIS administers a set of tools,
                including questionnaires and a rubric for key informants, and gathers both qualitative and
                quantitative data (validated by legal documents) in order to assess the soundness of the
                information system.
            x SABER-EMIS classifies and analyzes existing education management information systems based
                on four policy areas.
            x SABER-EMIS produces country reports and other knowledge products with the intention of
                improving a country’s education system.

        The benchmark findings are intended for use by education policy makers in government to assess the
        policy areas of relevance to a country’s EMIS against international best practices. The tool’s evidence-
        based framework is also envisioned for use by education stakeholders to evaluate the intended policies
        behind the system, data quality, monitoring, and in utilizing the system in decision making to support
        improving education quality through the four above-mentioned policy areas.

                             Information Systems (EMIS)
           For additional background, the “What Matters Most for Education Management Information Systems”
           framework paper outlines how an EMIS operates to meet data-related demands, examples of features of systems
           that are considered to be best practices, guiding principles of an EMIS and the theoretical underpinnings behind
           four policy areas that need to be assessed. It also contains the SABER-EMIS tool comprised of instruments for
           data collection, and a rubric for scoring, benchmarking and analyzing the results.


       EMIS Functionalities
       An effective EMIS is one that has a fully functioning information cycle. This cycle demonstrates that an
       EMIS is more than a simple annual school census, which the coverage of statistics goes beyond
       administrative census data. An EMIS is a dynamic system that has a defined architecture, the capacity to
       perform analytics, and the ability to serve its users. The functioning of this cyclical process results in more
       effective data sharing and coordination.

       The functionality of an EMIS is universal across contexts because data is the core of its operations.
       However, an EMIS may look different among countries depending upon the context in which it operates
       because of differences in how data is collected and processed. Data collection tools may differ due to
       differences in available technologies. Analytics can be performed on the data using business intelligence
       techniques,1 and data visualization tools and dashboards can be used to better understand the results of
       these analytics. An EMIS database can simply be an updated, computerized statistical information system
       or an administrative, function-specific database. In some contexts, an EMIS is often the result of “an
       accumulation of largely unrelated applications, some computerized and some manual, that grew from
       largely unrelated project initiatives” (Cassidy 2006, 2). Also, EMIS tools and technologies may be specific
       to contexts in poor, post-conflict, and/or small states (including Small Island Developing States), yet data
       is still intended to be the center of EMIS procedures. Figure 1 depicts how data is gathered, maintained,
       and shared in an EMIS, as well as how it is coordinated by users through the EMIS infrastructure.

                                                                                                                                        5
        It is relevant to note that in some contexts, there is an intermediary level between the schools and data
Education Management Information Systems (EMIS)
       management depending upon what level of government manages data (e.g., county level versus state
        level; provincial level versus federal level). This is because countries are increasingly progressing from a
        centralized system towards a decentralized system where the creation of education statistics occurs at
        the school, district and regional levels (Adam 2011). This shift results in an increase in demand for access
        to data at the lower level and subsequent creations of intermediary levels (depending upon the structure
        of the education system) developing their own information systems within the broader EMIS (Cassidy
        2006) Regardless, data needs to inform policy makers at the highest level so that it can inform decision
        making.


        Data Collection Methodology
        SABER EMIS data is collected at both policy intent and implementation level. At the intent level, it involves
        reviewing all the laws, regulations and other technical documents relevant to EMIS. This would help in
        assessing the enabling context around which EMIS operates. At the implementation level, all procedures
        and practices supporting EMIS operations need to be reviewed at different levels of the education system
        (central, regional/ provincial and local). The data management system needs to be examined, and quality
        of data collected has to be assessed.

        This exercise is expected to take about 1-2 weeks to complete, depending on the degree of preparedness
        of the staff and the time allocated to the activity. The checklist below (table 1) provides a quick reference
        of the activities for the data collectors to follow:

       Key Steps for data collection
Education Management Information Systems (EMIS)
      1. Recruitment and Terms of Reference (ToR) for the World Bank Staff or Consultant

      A World Bank Staff or Consultant needs to be commissioned with the following expertise:

          x   Master’s degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics, Public Administration,
              Business Administration or related field
          x   Experience in the field of EMIS
          x   Knowledge of education sector data collection methodologies
          x   Strong interpersonal skills and good written and oral communication skills in English
          x   Strong analytical and computer skills.

      2. Receive training on how to complete the SABER-EMIS Questionnaire and conduct background
         research in preparation for data collection

      The preparation for data collection is extensive and requires that the data collector complete three tasks:

      A. Training for data collection

      In order to have a comprehensive understanding of an EMIS, training is important for all data collectors.
      This includes a review of the SABER-EMIS “What Matters” framework paper, this manual along with the
      glossary and the data collection tools. After reviewing these documents, prepare questions for discussion
      with the SABER-EMIS team. Additionally, it is important to become familiar with the education statistics
      terminology as this is important for questionnaire completion, especially Policy Goal 3.

          A.1 Obtain copies of all laws, regulations and other supporting documentation related to the topics
              covered by the school system overview and SABER-EMIS Questionnaire

      Some questions in the questionnaire relate to official laws and regulations, so it is required to obtain
      digital copies of all laws, regulations and other supporting documentation related to the EMIS; this is
      especially the case for Policy Goal 1. Thus, it is important to ensure that there is sufficient time to locate
      the documents and/or inquire with other experts. It is also crucial that responses to the questions are
      accurate and that the information reported to the general public are in fact consistent with what the laws
      and regulations stipulate. All supporting documents will be maintained by the SABER-EMIS team. These
      documents will be used to build a virtual library of EMIS activities, which will be part of the SABER-EMIS
      online tool.

          A.2 Identifying correct questionnaire respondents

      The EMIS is typically located within the Ministry of Education or the education-statistics producing agency.
      It is important to be cognizant of the fact that different functionalities of the EMIS may be located within
      different agencies. Therefore, the data collector should research which departments may contain
      components of the EMIS and correspond via phone and/or email with those departments for
      confirmation. In addition, regional/ local governments should also be interviewed to understand their role
      in EMIS. Focus group discussions with school principals, teachers and parents would help in understanding
      the use of data at the school level, and help answering questions relevant especially for Policy Goal 4.

                                                                                                                  8
      3. Complete the SABER-EMIS Questionnaire
Education Management Information Systems (EMIS)

      Data collection takes place via the SABER-EMIS Questionnaire. This is a single survey questionnaire with
      four sections, designed to collect information on existing EMIS activity in the country and current policies
      governing their activity.

      A. SABER-EMIS Questionnaire Structure

      This questionnaire takes on a cascading structure.2 Each of the four policy goals has distinct levers (19 in
      total) for which data is reviewed, with qualitative indicators in a cascading structure of three levels,
      ranging from the abstract to specific (e.g., policy area, lever, indicators) (table 2).

      Table 2. Cascading Structure for the SABER-EMIS Questionnaire
       Policy Area + Description of best practice
                     Lever + Description of best practice
                                                      Indicator + Questions

      The questionnaire has four policy goals. Each of the four policy areas contains levers and a series of
      indicators that are evaluated through the completion of a questionnaire containing questions specific to
      each indicator. The following table lists the question series for each policy area.

       Enabling Environment                              institution, an agency or an official
                                                         entity to manage the EMIS?
                                                     x Does the education statistics agency
                                                         have the legal authority to collect
                                                         data required to compile educational
                                Data Supply              statistics?
                                                     x Is there a legal mandate that ensures
                                                         that schools provide their data to the
                                                         EMIS?

      Most of the questions in the questionnaire can be answered with either a “Yes” or “No” (Check the
      relevant box for each question). Some of the questions contain a checklist of items that need to be
      answered. For some questions, a 4-scale rating is used. The weights assigned to each question are: (1)



      2   See the framework paper for a more detailed overview of the construct validity of the tool.

                                                                                                                   9
        Not at all; (2) A little; (3) Some; (4) A lot. It is important to answer every question (including all items in
Education  Management Information Systems (EMIS)
       the checklist) so that the EMIS can be effectively benchmarked.

        The questionnaire contains a column labeled, “Level”. When relevant to the question, use this column to
        indicate at which level the answer pertains by indicating one of three options: 1) Local; 2) Sub-national;
        or 3) National. For example, if the answer to the question is a federal policy, the level would be federal. If
        the answer is specific to a classroom practice, the level would be local/district. When the answer does not
        pertain to any level, leave the column blank.

        For some questions, it will be necessary to reference specific documents (e.g., policies/legislation, reports,
        websites, program documents, etc.), which can be included in the “Notes” column. For each question,
        there is also a “Comments” box to place additional information that you think might be relevant to
        evaluate the EMIS. It is important to add relevant information to the “comments” box, as needed,
        because the evaluation of the EMIS will consider the strengths and weaknesses of the system. Please
        include the specific documents referenced to answer the question (be specific and include numbers for
        the Article/Section, URL where government document can be found, etc.). This space can also be used to
        add relevant information that will be useful when assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the system.

        B. Guidance for Specific Policy Areas

        SABER studies a system in its entirety which includes the policy intent, the policy implementation and
        the policies and steps that bridge the intent to the implementation. The depth of the EMIS policy
        assessment falls into these three categories:

        Table 5: Depth of EMIS Policy Assessment

                                           system                                    education stakeholders

      Because of these differences, specific guidance is required for each policy goal.
Education Management Information Systems (EMIS)
          x   Policy Goal 1: It is necessary to reference specific documents (e.g., legal framework, policies,
              statistical reports, websites, etc.) in order to answer questions. Therefore, the questionnaire
              contains an additional column entitled “Notes” to reference any policies/ documents. Please
              indicate the specific documents referenced to answer the question (be specific and include
              numbers for the Article/Section, URL where government document can be found, etc.).
          x   Policy Goals 2-4: Since the evaluation of the EMIS will also contain a review of a system’s strengths
              and weaknesses, it is especially important to use the “Comments” box to include examples to
              justify “Yes” responses, especially in Policy Goal 4 which reviews how the EMIS is used for decision
              making. Include URLs or digital copies of publications or online sources where applicable (e.g.,
              online website for report cards, platforms to disseminate administrative data by school, etc.). See
              “EMIS Experiences” section of the “What Matters” framework paper for some specific examples.

      This questionnaire exercise can be conducted via structured interviews with individual informants and
      desk review of relevant documents, but it is more efficient to conduct it in a small-group setting since
      there is a better likelihood of reaching consensus on some of the more subjective questions. Also,
      participating staff in the host country should be made familiar with the materials needed for the review
      exercise in advance.

      1. Submit the set of final responses and supporting documentation in digital form

      There are two key products that are required upon completion of questionnaire: (1) responses to all of
      the questions on the SABER-EMIS Questionnaire, including specific document citations, and text excerpts
      (for Policy Area 1); and (2) digital copies of all laws, regulations and other documentation that support
      these responses or URL where government document can be found, as applicable.

      All submitted answers must be in English. Documents and text excerpts do not need to be translated into
      English and can be submitted in the local language.

      2. Provide necessary notes, feedback, and clarification for the SABER country report

      After completing and submitting all required forms and documentation, the country report will be drafted.
      This report will be similar to reports from other SABER domains. This report will include an overview of
      the country’s education system with special emphasis on the education management information system.
      The report will then highlight the four policy areas of an EMIS in the country, and provide benchmarked
      scores in the policy areas of enabling environment, system soundness, quality data and utilization in
      decision making, as reported in the questionnaires. It will also include an evaluation of the strengths and
      weaknesses of the EMIS. It will be necessary to provide guidance on the creation of the report, to verify
      the data presented and to offer feedback for any necessary corrections or improvements.
