1.      This Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) is part of a broader dialogue on energy tax
reform and strengthening social safety nets in Djibouti. As part of a possible reform of energy taxes in
Djibouti, the government of Djibouti has sought the support of the World Bank to better understand
how such a policy reform can be pro-poor. Through this technical assistance, a cross-sectoral Bank
team, in close cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has supported the government
of Djibouti to help understand the following questions:

          •    What is the Current Nature of Tax Exemptions in Djibouti?
          •    What is the Impact of the Current Tax Exemptions on Household Welfare?
          •    What is the Context of such Reform: Winners and Losers?
          •    What is the Current Role of Social Safety Nets in Djibouti?
          •    What is the Impact of the Reforming Tax Exemptions and Safety Nets on Poverty?

2.      The study was designed and implemented by a multisectoral committee composed of various
stakeholder institutions, including the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Budget, the
Secretary of State responsible for National Solidarity (SESN), the Department of Statistics and
Demographic Studies (DISED), the Ministry of Energy, and the Ministry of Transport, with whom the
teams of the Bank and the IMF collaborated throughout the process of preparation of the study.
Technical meetings were held on January 30, February 2, May 25, May 28, and May 29, 2014, in
Djibouti to discuss the various scenarios of reform, obtain additional information, and present
preliminary quantitative results. Consultation meetings were held on July 2 and November 15, 2014, to
present the findings and discuss possible reform options.

3.       This executive summary condenses the main findings of the study. The study is available as a
separate report with more analyses and background information. The study is based on data from a
representative household survey which includes detailed information on household expenditures and
receipt of certain cash and in-kind benefits (EDAM 3-2012). The tables in this executive summary show
2014 prices, with inflation rates of 2.5 and 2.9 for 2013 and 2014, respectively.

4.      The third Enquête Djiboutienne auprès des ménages (EDAM 3) was conducted in 2012 and
has a nationally representative sample of the sedentary population composed of 5,880 households with
31,686 individuals. The EDAM 3 questionnaire covers many aspects: demography, education,
employment, mortality, governance, housing, access to basic social services, durable goods ownership,
and finally, expenditures and revenues. Of particular importance for this study is information on
household expenditure on tax-exempt food (flour, rice, oil, sugar, and milk); certain fuel items
(kerosene, butane, and fuel expenditure on transport); and electricity, as well as information on cash
and in-kind benefits. The EDAM 3 dataset has been used to compute total expenditure aggregates of
households based on which the DISED has produced their recent poverty profile, yielding 40.8 percent
of poverty and 23 percent of extreme poverty.1

5.      As is common for household surveys, the EDAM 3 data is representative only of the sedentary
population. The EDAM 3 sample leaves out the nomad and homeless populations (population flottante)
and individuals living in collective households (hotels, prison, military camps, and orphanages).
According to the most recent census conducted in 2009, Djibouti’s total population was 818,159

1 The EDAM 3 sample slightly underestimates the size of households, and the level of average per capita total household

expenditure is therefore slightly overvalued in this survey. Since this study focuses primarily on expenditure quintiles, the
effect of this general overvaluation is marginal. Furthermore, and in contrast to the recently updated national poverty profile
that combines data from EDAM 3 and the Budget and Consumption Survey (EBC), this study uses data from EDAM 3 and
its expenditure aggregate only. The aggregate used in this study, however, is highly correlated with that used for the poverty
profile produced by the DISED and we do not see any conflict between the analysis in this study and the figures recently
approved by the government.

                                                               1
individuals, of which 161,132 were nomads and 149,022 either lived in collective households or were
homeless. Having household surveys solely covering the sedentary population is standard practice since
surveying nomad and homeless populations creates important conceptual and logistic issues.

6.       Five quintiles based on per capita expenditure have been constructed based on the per capita
expenditure welfare index. The first quintile includes the poorest 20 percent of the sedentary Djibouti
population; the second quintile includes the next 20 percent, and so on up to the top quintile with the
richest 20 percent of the population. For the purpose of this study, the destitution2 line is defined as the
upper limit of the first quintile. Therefore the destitution head-count rate is de facto set to 20 percent.

               WHAT IS THE CURRENT NATURE OF TAX EXEMPTIONS IN DJIBOUTI?

7.       Djibouti is vulnerable to major risks to growth and macroeconomic stability, including fuel and
food price shocks and natural disasters such as droughts and floods. Poverty has been exacerbated by
drought conditions since 2007—the worst in 60 years. The drought is estimated to have affected at least
half the rural population, with annual economic losses of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
over the period 2008–2011 and a substantial flow of refugees from neighboring countries that also
suffer from drought.

8.      Universal tax exemptions were introduced in response to the food crisis and to shield the
population from price shocks on essential food products. Djibouti depends massively on imports to
meet its food needs and a large fraction of the population faces food insecurity. Practically all food
items are imported and increases in international food prices directly affect Djibouti’s poor people, who
spend up to three-quarters of their income on food. Due to severe and prolonged droughts, at least 20
percent of the capital’s population and three-quarters of rural households are vulnerable to severe or
moderate food insecurity, according to the Emergency Food Security Assessment carried out by the
World Food Programme in 2013. In response to the stark food price increases, the government has
exempt five essential food items from domestic consumption tax since 2008.

9.       Similarly, discretionary price adjustments on certain energy products (super, kerosene, and
diesel) have been in operation since 2009. The government’s Department of Customs and Excise, after
consultation with oil companies, performs a monthly adjustment of prices at the pump to minimize the
negative impact of fluctuating international prices of super, kerosene, and diesel. According to estimates
of the IMF, Djibouti foregoes an estimated 2 percent of GDP (2011) on certain energy products.3

10.      The government is currently considering abandoning the use of the discretionary tax element
on certain fuel products (super and diesel) for private consumers; the privileges for other exempt groups
such as the military and embassies would remain. At the time of analysis (based on prices of December
2013), such a reform would have resulted in a small fall in super prices and an increase of around 13
percent for diesel. Crude oil prices have recently fallen substantially and this is relevant to the
calculations shown. In December 2013, Brent crude sold for about US$110 a barrel and it remained
around that level until July 2014. Since then it has steadily declined until falling to around US$50 a
barrel in January 2015. There is considerable uncertainty about the course of prices in 2015.

11.      Before the drop in oil prices, the government had not taken any firm decision, in part due to
fears of increasing inflation with increasing fuel prices (based on the previously higher oil prices). In
addition, there are concerns over the impact on the poor as well as the middle class and on certain
sectors (transport, fisheries, and bakeries) in particular. The impact of fuel subsidy reforms on the
transport sector is of particular concern to the government. Ticket prices for public transport are set by
the state and have more or less been stable since 2006. The bus and taxi fleet is outdated and current
discussions center on decreasing the cost of transport by updating the fleet. The government is
considering pre-financing new vehicles, which the bus and taxi operators would pay back over time,

thereby reducing the consumption of fuel.

12.     If the government wanted to abandon the discretionary tax, this would be the time for action.
With falling oil prices, an elimination of the discretionary tax elements would not necessarily lead to
higher prices for consumers. In fact, given the low prices seen in early 2015, removal of discretionary
tax on diesel would be small in comparison to the fall in underlying costs—so that the effect of its
removal will be negligible and the effect on bus prices will be easily absorbed. If bus operators do not
lower their prices at all then their margins will increase.

13.      However, with the elimination of discretionary tax on fuel products, the government would
relinquish a tool to smooth fuel prices in times of price increases and decreases. With falling oil prices,
government tax revenues will decrease accordingly. The removal of discretionary tax at this point would
lower the tax revenue further. It is likely that the government has adjusted the magnitude of the
discretionary tax since January 2014, which would warrant further analysis. Furthermore, going
forward, an analysis of the optimal tax structure would be warranted.

14.     Overall, the following analysis based on December 2013 prices confirms that a negative tax on
fuel products effectively subsidizes the better-off. Any reform of the current energy tax system should
be pro-poor and social safety nets would be the channel to reinvest savings in pro-poor policies.

  WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT TAX EXEMPTIONS ON HOUSEHOLD WELFARE?

Distribution of Subsidies on Energy Products

15.       The following analysis includes all the tax-exempt fuel products available in the household
survey. The survey does not differentiate between diesel and super (lumped together as carburant in the
EDAM 3 questionnaire), but data from the Enquête de Budget et Consommation (EBC) survey (an
urban-only survey done in 2013) show that around two-thirds of spending by households on carburant
is on diesel. Furthermore, the survey shows that almost all direct spending on carburant is by the richest
quintile. The simulations assume that the price of fuel purchases will increase from DF 215 to DF 242
per liter.

16.      Car ownership and utilization of public transport is a strong indication of welfare. Car
ownership is not widespread in Djibouti—only 6 percent of households own a car and 1 percent owns
a motorcycle. One-fourth of the richest quintile owns a car while car ownership is basically negligible
in the other quintiles. Most cars are owned by urbanites. Not surprisingly, carburant is essentially
consumed by urban households and the richest quintile. Utilization of public transport (buses, taxis, and
school buses) is also highest among the richer quintiles. Only 12 percent of the poor (first quintile) use
public transport compared with 60 percent in the richest two quintiles. More than half of the population
in urban areas makes use of public transport but less than 10 percent in rural areas. Utilization of school
transportation is also highly skewed toward richer and urban households.

17.       Djibouti households spend about DF 7.96 million on subsidized fuel products (that is, fuel at
the pump, public, and school transport), about 6.75 percent of their total annual expenditure. On an
average, households spend DF 25,400 on fuel at the pump, DF 27,400 on public transport, and DF
30,600 on school transport. Tax exemptions on fuel products do not benefit the poorest as they consume
little fuel and hardly use public transportation. Possession of cars and motorbikes is essentially limited
to the fifth quintile, which consumes DF 96,847 per household on fuel at the pump, about 4 percent of
the total annual household expenditure. Spending on public and school transport is also considerably
lower in the poorest quintile (DF 2,142 and DF 2,381 per household, respectively) than in the richest
quintile (DF 49,837 per household). Already the second quintile spends considerably more on public
transport than the very poor. For the poor, expenses on fuel and public and school transport amount to
less than 2 percent each of the overall household expenses (DF 4,522), whereas the richest quintile
spends about 8 percent of total household expenditure (DF 197,643) on these fuel products.




                                                    3
Distribution of Subsidies on Food Products

18.      Poor households spend relatively more on tax-exempt food products than richer households.
Household expenses on tax-exempt food products amount on average to DF 153,629 per household,
which is equivalent to 12.4 percent of total household spending. Of these basic food items, sugar is the
most consumed item in terms of expenditure (DF 37,622). Although rice consumption is higher, only a
tiny fraction of rice is actually tax exempt and therefore has been excluded from our analysis. Tax-
exempt products are relatively more important for the poor, as the expenditure share of these products
is much higher for the very poor than for the very rich. In the poorest households, 19 percent of the total
expenses correspond to tax-exempt food products, while these products account for less than 7 percent
of the richest households’ total expenses.

                  WHAT IS THE CONTEXT OF SUCH REFORM: WINNERS AND LOSERS?

Impact of Abandoning the Discretionary Tax on Retail Prices of Fuel Products

19.      The proposal to abandon the use of discretionary tax on certain fuel products is currently under
consideration by the government. Other tax rates could be varied by legislation, as at present, but would
normally be stable for lengthy periods. Allowable costs along the supply chain could also be varied if
justified by the circumstances of the entities involved. To simulate the effect of removing the
discretionary tax element on prices, it is assumed that all other tax rates and costs remain at the levels
of December 2013. The removal of discretionary tax would have resulted in a small fall in gasoline and
kerosene prices but an increase of around 13 percent for diesel. The comparison between the before and
after prices in December 2013 is possible because the government’s action with respect to the
determination of the retail price (and the associated discretionary tax) is a known fact. Simulating the
effect of removing the discretionary tax under different circumstances is possible, but it is not possible
to give a ‘before’ calculation since it is not known what the government would have decided to do with
retail prices had it kept the discretionary tax.

Impact of Fuel Subsidy Reform on Household Welfare, Government Budget, Poverty, and Inequality

20.     Abandoning discretionary tax on super and diesel retail prices would imply a loss of DF 510.8
million (or 0.2 percent of GDP4) for the population.

21.      For fuel bought directly at a pump, the impact of the reform on poor households is negligible,
but it increases with welfare and represents the highest loss among rich households (DF 2,734 per
capita), equivalent to 0.5 percent of household spending. The poorest two quintiles spend considerably
less on public transport than the richer quintiles; this is partly due to the fact that the poor live in areas
with no public transport available, such as the rural areas. However, the same conclusion holds when
restricting the analysis only to urban areas. The impact of the reform on the poorest 40 percent is less
than DF 80 per capita on public transport, compared to more than DF 400 among the richest 20 percent.
In terms of household spending, this would amount to a loss of 0.3 percent of welfare for the poorest
20 percent and 0.8 percent for the richest quintile. The middle class would experience the largest
reduction in well-being—about 0.12 percent.

22.      The impact of the reform on government budget would result in a gain, the highest coming
from fuel bought directly at the pump. The impact of the reform on government budget would result in
a total gain of DF 408.6 million (or 0.16 percent of GDP). Sixty percent of that gain would come from
fuel sold at the pump (96 percent of the gain from fuel will originate from the richest households) and
the remaining 40 percent from public transport. It should be noted that since we assume a price elasticity
of 0.2, the amount gained by the government is less than the loss incurred by the different households.

23.    As the poor spend most of their income on food-related products, the elimination of tax
exemptions on fuel products would reduce inequality but with no apparent impact on poverty. The

4   GDP for 2013 is estimated at US$1.456 billion.

                                                      4
elimination of tax exemptions on fuel would not affect the poorest because the consumption of this
product is negligible among the poor. On the other hand, the consumption of this product is one of the
highest among the subsidized products in rich households, and an elimination of tax exemption would
result in a reduction in inequality by 0.12 percentage points.

24.     Results of the PSIA show that an elimination of tax exemption on fuel at the pump offers
potential for higher government revenues without impacting poverty. An increase of prices on public
transport would increase poverty, but at a lower rate than increases on school transport.

Impact of Introducing Consumer Tax on Basic Food Items

25.      The government is not considering levying consumer tax on basic food items and the
simulations below are merely for illustrative purposes. As mentioned above, among the basic food items
that are tax exempt, only a certain quality/type is exempt (for example, broken rice). For rice, only 6
percent of the imported rice is exempt, but about 88 percent of flour, about 60 percent of sugar and
edible oil, and about 50 percent of powdered milk products are exempt. The implicit subsidy represents
7 percent of the unsubsidized price.

26.      Introducing consumer taxes would imply a loss of DF 558.7 million (or 0.22 percent of GDP)
for the population. The per capita values indicate that the loss would be considerably higher for the
richest in absolute terms. Overall, the impact of the reform on the poorest 20 percent would imply a
decrease in well-being by DF 500 or 1.06 percent of household spending. For the richest quintile, the
loss would be equivalent to DF 1,836 or 0.33 percent of household spending. This comparison shows
that the poor spend more in relative terms on tax-exempt food products. Therefore, introducing
consumer taxes would affect poverty.

            WHAT IS THE CURRENT ROLE OF SOCIAL SAFETY NETS IN DJIBOUTI?

27.     A public safety net typically consists of publicly sponsored programs that provide income or
in-kind support and access to basic social services to the poorest and vulnerable members of society. In
addition, there are other types of transfers such as contributory social insurance like pensions, labor
market programs, subsidies on food and fuel products, and private transfers (remittances) among
households. To assess the effectiveness of these transfers to protect the poorest and vulnerable from
shocks, a number of indicators are presented, for example, coverage, targeting accuracy, and generosity.

28.       Untargeted tax exemptions (implicit subsidies) reach a wider part of the population than
targeted programs. Tax exemptions on basic food items reach the majority of the poor (77.3 percent in
the first quintile) and almost the majority of individuals in the other quintiles. Tax exemptions on certain
fuel products, on the other hand, benefit only 17 percent of the poorest quintile but more than 82 percent
of the richest. About a quarter of the population in the poorest quintile benefits from food rations,
making it a program with relatively effective targeting. Compensation for health expenditure
disproportionately benefits the richer quintiles. Very few households (less than 10 percent) benefit from
pensions. Finally, 21 percent of Djibouti households receive private transfers (international or national)
and these transfers mainly benefit the poorest households.

29.     The intended beneficiaries of social safety net programs should be the poor. Therefore, the
performance of such programs can be assessed by estimating program leakage. One way to measure
such leakage is by determining the share of total transfers received by non-poor beneficiaries. In a well-
targeted progressive program, the poor (bottom quintile) receive the highest share of transfers; this share
declines as welfare increases. In Djibouti, food rations and cash transfers generally fit this description
as the poor receive most of the transfers. Over half of the transfers for food rations are received by the
poor (bottom quintile). In contrast, tax exemptions on food and fuel items predominantly benefit the
urban population and non-poor, making these programs regressive. In fact, the majority of food and
fuel subsidy resources (85 percent and 97 percent, respectively) are received by those living in urban
areas and by those from the richest two quintiles (57 percent and 89 percent, respectively). However,
only 15 percent of food subsidy benefits and less than 3 percent of fuel subsidy benefits go to

                                                     5
beneficiaries living in rural areas and only 10 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively, are received
by those in the poorest quintile. Pensions and compensation for health care expenditure transfers are
received mainly by non-poor beneficiaries and the population living in urban areas.

30.      The generosity of social safety net programs in Djibouti is generally very low. The lower the
generosity, the less important the value of the transfer is for the welfare of the beneficiaries. On the
other hand, the higher the generosity, the higher its importance as a source of welfare for the
beneficiaries. The generosity and size of transfers are, therefore, important design features of social
safety net programs as they will have an impact on the poverty and other intended objectives of the
programs. In fact, low generosity will limit the impact on poverty. Only two programs (pensions and
private transfers from family and friends—which strictly speaking are not social assistance programs),
out of the seven types of programs available, seem to have an impact on the consumption levels of the
population in general. On the contrary, by focusing on the poorest quintile, food rations also have a
significant effect even if private transfers are by far the most efficient vehicle. In fact, the impact of
cash transfers from the government or NGOs and tax exemptions on food on the welfare of the poorest
quintile is extremely modest and that of tax exemptions on fuel items is negligible.

31.     In line with low targeting accuracy and low generosity, social safety net programs in Djibouti
are generally small and inadequate in reducing the poverty gap. The ratio is above 1 for pension, which
means that the average transfer is higher than the poverty gap and a strong indication that beneficiaries
depend on this transfer as a source of income, which is usually expected for social insurance programs.
On the other hand, the generosity of subsidies (both fuel and food) is negligible in closing the poverty
gap; hence, a ratio of less than 0.1.

     WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE REFORMING TAX EXEMPTIONS AND SAFETY NETS ON
                                   POVERTY?

32.      Discretionary energy taxes have benefitted the better-off in times of higher fuel prices (the
analysis in this study is based on December 2013 prices). An elimination of tax exemptions on fuel
products would reduce inequality but would not have any apparent impact on poverty. To reduce
poverty, savings from a possible tax reform and other funding resources could be rechanneled toward
the poor and vulnerable. To reduce poverty, however, effective targeting of the poor is key. The
government with the support of the Bank is currently developing a social registry to increase equity in
the distribution of resources, and promoting greater social inclusion for the most vulnerable groups.
Over the course of the technical assistance provided to the government of Djibouti, a number of policy
recommendations have emerged and some have already been taken into consideration in the design of
a stronger social protection system. These recommendations are derived from the sections below and
include:
             • Savings on energy tax reforms and other funding resources, including those spread over
                 a number of very small safety net programs, should be channeled to a cash-transfer
                 program targeting the poorest;
             •   A Proxy Means Test (PMT) should be used to determine the households’ poverty score,
                 and all safety net programs should target the poorest (as defined by the PMT) rather
                 than targeting rural households based on geography;5
             •   Similarly, current and future safety net programs should first target poor households
                 based on the relative poverty score, and then use other (categorical) factors to
                 determine program eligibility.

Impact of Tax Reform on Household Welfare and Government Revenue

33.     As the poor spend most of their income on food-related products, the elimination of tax
exemptions on such products would have the highest impact on destitution and inequality, while the
elimination of tax exemptions on fuel products would reduce inequality but with no apparent impact on

5This functionality will be part of the forthcoming social registry which will be used to identify, classify, and target
households that would be considered poor or vulnerable, to improve the delivery of assistance to them.

                                                                6
destitution. However these effects would be minimal, almost negligible. Globally, a reform of taxes on
fuel and food products alone would not have a very significant impact on destitution and no impact on
inequality. In particular, the destitution rate would increase by 0.17 percentage points from 20.00 to
20.17 percent. The elimination of tax exemptions on flour would increase destitution by 0.05 percentage
points (from 20.00 to 20.05 percent), and inequality by 0.05 percentage points (from 45.13 to 45.18
percent). The effect of the elimination of the discretionary tax adjustment on fuel would not affect the
poorest and would in fact result in a reduction of inequality by 0.12 percentage points. This is explained
by the fact that the consumption of this product is negligible among the poor, while it is one of the
highest consumed products among the subsidized products in rich households.

34.     Among the poorer quintiles, the loss in welfare as a result of the reform would be the highest
on food-related items; while it would be the highest on fuel products among the richer quintiles. In
terms of food-related products, the reform would result in a significant loss of welfare among the
poorest quintile (1.12 percent of total spending) but this loss decreases as welfare increases. On the
other hand, the reform would result in a minimal loss among the top quintile for fuel products, and this
loss decreases as welfare decreases and becomes negligible for the first quintile.

35.      The impact of the reform on government budget would result in a gain, the highest coming
from fuel. The impact of the reform on government budget would result in a total gain of DF 856 million
(or 0.33 percent of GDP): 28 percent of that gain would come from fuel (96 percent of the gain from
fuel will originate from the richest households), 18 percent from flour, and 15 percent from sugar. The
highest gain in the government budget will come from the richest households (54 percent). This
decreases as welfare decreases to reach the lowest share among poor households (5 percent). This is
consistent with the previous finding that the highest loss of welfare in the population would come from
fuel, and particularly among the rich. The most important revenue gain to the government would come
from increasing the price of fuel, while the least would come from increasing the price of cooking oil.

Likely Impact of Compensation Policies through Social Safety Nets Programs

36.      Any reform necessitates an efficient system for targeting the poor and vulnerable. The
government, with support from development partners, is currently in the process of reforming the social
protection system. A key element to strengthening social safety nets in Djibouti is the creation of a
social registry of poor and vulnerable households, which will be used to target the poor and serve as a
single platform used by all social assistance programs, resulting in significant cost savings and
substantial improvements in targeting the poorest households.

37.     The preceding analysis has shown that tax exemptions on food and fuel items are regressive,
and that the poor benefit the least. The government is considering strengthening the social protection
system through a targeted cash-transfer system. Based on discussions with the SESN, reform options
based on a number of transfer schemes and budget envelopes are presented. The study shows the results
of 54 different simulations on the welfare effects of various reform options on poverty headcount and
poverty gap. The reform options consist of transfer schemes implemented depending on the location
and/or quintile targeted; whether it is done at the individual or household level; and according to the
total budget to be transferred: either 1, 2, or 3 billion Djibouti francs.
    • Destitution headcount. The largest decline in poverty headcount is achieved when targeting
        the first quintile. Most of the schemes that target the first quintile achieve a significant
        reduction in poverty headcount, especially with a budget of DF 2 or 3 billion. In fact, with a
        budget of DF 3 billion it would be possible to more than halve the poverty headcount using
        any of the schemes that target the first quintile. A program targeting only the rural areas
        would be less efficient.
    • Destitution gap. The optimal scheme in terms of reducing the poverty gap would be the ‘first
        quintile with a 4-step transfer’ in which the amount transferred depends on the standard of
        living of households in the first quintile. In this way, the poorest 5 percent would receive the
        most, then the following 5 percent would receive a bit less, and so on. A unique simple
        transfer targeting the first quintile might be simpler to implement and would also provide
        satisfactory results.

                                                    7
•   Coverage. In a scheme focusing only on the population living in rural areas, only 62.4
    percent of individuals in the first quintile and quite a few non-poor households would receive
    a transfer (11.8 percent of individuals of the second quintile and 4.3 percent in the third
    quintile). Any such leakage necessarily makes rural-based criteria less efficient at reducing
    poverty than one focusing solely on the first quintile. To reduce the poverty gap, targeting the
    first quintile is more efficient than any of the schemes focusing on rural households. There
    should be an exclusive transfer scheme focusing on the first quintile.

                           COUNTRY AND REFORM CONTEXT
1.       Djibouti faces multiple development challenges, and recent economic growth has not led
to improvements in the welfare of the people. The increased growth of the past decade has relied in
part on one-time events such as an economic resurgence after the political turmoil of the 1990s, the
establishment of foreign military bases, and significant inflows of foreign investment that financed
the construction of the new port and hotel infrastructure. Yet this growth pattern has not alleviated
high levels of poverty or unemployment. Although poverty figures are difficult to pinpoint due to data
limitations, available evidence indicates that poverty is widespread and worsening in the face of the
current drought—the worst in 60 years. In terms of human development, Djibouti is ranked 170th out
of 187 countries (United Nations Development Programme 2014).

2.       Djibouti depends heavily on imports to meet its food needs, and a large fraction of the
population faces food insecurity. Practically all food items are imported and increases in
international food prices directly affect Djibouti’s poor people, who spend up to three-quarters of their
income on food. Due to severe and prolonged droughts, at least 20 percent of the capital’s population
and three-quarters of rural households are vulnerable to severe and moderate food insecurity (World
Food Program 2013). On average, 17.8 percent of Djiboutians are affected by acute malnutrition,
which varies between 14 and 26 percent across regions, and about 5.7 percent by severe acute
malnutrition. On average, 29.7 percent suffer from chronic malnutrition, exceeding 40 percent in
certain regions. About one in four children are underweight (SMART 2013).

3.       In this context, social safety nets become crucially important to alleviate the devastating
effects of poverty, and the government of Djibouti has made considerable progress in building a
social safety net. Social safety nets (noncontributory transfer programs targeted to the poor or
vulnerable) have an immediate impact on extreme poverty and inequality. They enable households to
manage risks and make better investments in their future, often helping to prevent malnutrition and
underinvestment in education. Djibouti is only at the beginning of institutionalizing an efficient social
safety net. To date, the scale and funding of existing social safety net programs remains inadequate to
protect most poor and vulnerable groups. Spending is limited, programs are fragmented and largely
uncoordinated, and there is no (non-emergency) large-scale social safety net at the national level.
Increasing coverage of social safety net programs is thus paramount so that the country can eventually
benefit from reforming the policies to reduce the large expenditures going to untargeted subsidies at
present.

4.       In response to the food crisis and to shield the population from price shocks on essential
food and certain energy products, universal tax exemptions were introduced; yet, since these
are untargeted, these exemptions benefit mostly the middle and higher income class. According
to IMF estimates, Djibouti foregoes 0.5 percent of GDP (2009) on certain food items (rice, edible oil,
sugar, flour, and powdered milk) and an estimated 2 percent of GDP (2011) on certain energy
products (IMF 2012). Such untargeted tax breaks on fuel benefit mainly those who are better off.
According to IMF estimates, there is significant leakage of diesel and gasoline price reductions, and
households in the highest income quintile receive 12 times more of these benefits than the two poorest
quintiles combined. Gasoline, diesel, and kerosene are subject to a mix of ad valorem (value added
tax [VAT]) and specific taxes (royalties, excise). A discretionary component is added, allowing the
government to target monthly prices. Between 2010 and 2013, these goods were all taxed but net
taxes have fallen.


                             DATA SOURCES AND TARGETING
5.       The study is based on data from a representative household survey (2012) which
includes detailed information on household expenditures as well as on receipt of certain cash
and in-kind benefits. The third Enquête Djiboutienne auprès des ménages (EDAM 3) was conducted
in 2012 by the DISED, the national statistical agency. EDAM 3 has a nationally representative sample
of the sedentary population composed of 5,880 households with 31,686 individuals. The EDAM 3


                                                   9
questionnaire covers many aspects: demography, education, employment, mortality, governance,
housing, access to basic social services, durable goods ownership, and finally, expenditures and
revenues. Of particular importance for this study is information on household expenditure on tax-
exempt food (flour, rice, oil, sugar, and milk); certain fuel items (kerosene, butane, and fuel
expenditure on transport); and electricity as well as information on cash and in-kind benefits. The
EDAM 3 dataset has been used to compute total expenditure aggregates of households based on
which the DISED has produced their recent poverty profile, yielding 40.8 percent of poverty and 23
percent of extreme poverty.

6.      As is common for household surveys, the EDAM 3 data is representative of the
sedentary population only. The EDAM 3 sample covers the sedentary population, leaving out the
nomad and homeless populations (population flotante) as well as individuals living in collective
households (hotels, prison, military camps, orphanages). According to the most recent census
conducted in 2009, Djibouti’s total population was 818,159 individuals, of which 161,132 were
nomads and 149,022 either lived in collective households or were homeless. Having household
surveys covering solely sedentary population is standard practice since surveying nomad and
homeless populations creates important conceptual and logistic issues.

7.      Access to a representative sample of the nomad population extracted from the 2009
Census allowed supplementing certain analysis. The census-based nomad sample was used to
construct the proxy means test (PMT) index. However, as the census dataset does not have any
information on specific spending on tax-exempt items or on access to benefits, most of the analysis
had to rely only on the sedentary population. Finally, for the homeless population the only
information that could be provided by the DISED was a simple count according to gender and age.

8.      A series of corrective factors were applied to both datasets to perform analysis on the
actual 2014 population. First, the EDAM 3 sample weight has been corrected for a slight under-
coverage. Second, the population growth rate (2.8 percent per year) was applied to both the 2009
Census and 2012/13 EDAM 3 data up to 2014. Therefore, the analysis is based on the following
population size (excluding collective households):

    •     Sedentary: 536,851
    •     Nomad: 184,990
    •     Homeless: 139,514

9.      To assess the effectiveness of the current safety nets (section IV) and the effectiveness of
the tax exemptions (section V), five quintiles based on per capita expenditure have been
constructed.6 Sections IV and V are based on the EDAM 3 data since this is the only database with
information on the current safety nets and expenditure on tax-exempt food and petroleum items.
Based on the per capita expenditure welfare index already computed by the DISED and the World
Bank and the ranking of per capita expenditure, five quintiles have been constructed. The first quintile
includes the poorest 20 percent of the sedentary Djiboutian population, the second quintile includes
the next 20 percent, and so on up to the top quintile with the richest 20 percent of the population.
Translated into Djibouti francs, the ranges of per capita expenditure for each quintile are the
following:
    • Quintile 1 : <DF 77,962
    • Quintile 2: [DF 78,145–126,405]
    • Quintile 3: [DF 126,431–180,970]
    • Quintile 4: [DF 180,971–276,678]
    • Quintile 5: >DF 277,231

  Following a complete revision of the expenditure-based household welfare index undertaken recently by the World Bank
Djibouti Country Team (in full collaboration with the DISED), our report was also revised to take into account those
changes. Although the revisions were important, the actual ranking of the different households from the poorest to the
richest was not modified enough to change our conclusions. In fact, the revised figures found in the latest version of this
report are barely the same as the previous version.

                                                             10
10.     Simulations of the welfare effects of various reform options (section VI) use the EDAM
3 data as well as data from the 2009 Census. For these simulations, quintiles are based on the PMT
formula that has been constructed for the social registry, which will be implemented by the SESN.

11.     For the purpose of this study, the poverty line is defined as the upper limit of the first
quintile. Using the PMT formula and the sedentary sample only, the poverty line is DF 77,926 per
capita.

12.       Different targeting approaches are possible (self-targeting, geographical targeting) but
after discussion with the Djiboutian authorities and based on experience in the region, it was
agreed that the PMT approach would be used to target the poorest households. The PMT
approach calls for the construction of a synthetic measure of household welfare based on a series of
easily observable indicators (at least easier to observe than expenditure or income) but strongly
correlated with expenditure or income. Those easily observable indicators could be dwelling
characteristics (water source, access to electricity, wall, roof and floor material, type of sanitation);
demographic composition of the household; socioeconomic characteristics (employment, education,
age, and gender) of the household head as well as ownership of durable goods or animals. The
relationship between the actual per capita expenditures (in log) and those correlates is supposed to be
linear and is estimated by the ordinary least square (OLS) technique. From the estimated coefficients,
it is straightforward to compute expected per capita expenditure on which our analysis would be
performed. Technically, we need to estimate equation (1) on the 5,880 households from the EDAM 3.

                                            =     +        +             (1)
where     represents the actual per capita expenditure for household i (in log);  represents the j
independent variables for household i; is the coefficient to be estimated for the j variables ; is
the constant; and is the error term.

Estimated by OLS techniques, equation (1) would generate the constant and coefficients and
therefore , the estimated PMT measure of welfare. That can be summarized by the following
equation:

                                        =       = exp	     +       (2)
In the analysis, a given household would be considered poor if its measure of welfare      is lower than
a predetermined poverty line and non-poor otherwise. In this study, we consider the upper limit of the
first quintile as the poverty line (DF 77,962 per capita). Further details on the PMT approach as well
as a series of results on its efficiency can be found in annex 2.

           EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CURRENT SOCIAL SAFETY NET
                                           WHO ARE THE POOR?

13.      This section shows characteristics of the sedentary population by quintile to understand how
well programs are targeted to the poor and inform possible reform options. Table 1 shows that the
data has been divided into five consumption quintiles and that the first quintile is fixed as ‘poor’ in
the analysis. The rural population dominates the poorest quintile (67.9 percent of the rural population
are classified as ‘poor’ according to this definition) while only 2.2 percent of the rural households
belong to the richest quintile. Over half of the total expenditures of all households (50.4 percent)
accrues to the richest quintile. In comparison, the poorest quintile consumes less than one-twentieth
(4.3 percent) of the total even if it constitutes 20 percent of the population. Similarly, rural areas
represent 16.1 percent of the sedentary population but only 5.6 percent of the total expenditure and
54.8 percent of the poor individuals.

14.     Welfare is not uniformly spread across groups. Some strata of the Djiboutian population
are more likely to be in the poorest quintile than others (see Table in annex 3). Important correlates of
welfare are the following:

    •    Location. This is the most important correlate of poverty. There is a clear regional pattern:
         richer populations are more likely to live in urban areas and poorer in rural areas (see figure
         1). About 90 percent of individuals in the richest three quintiles live in urban areas compared
         with 40 percent in the poorest quintile. About 73 percent of the population lives in urban
         Djibouti city and the rest distributed among the five regions Ali Sabieh, Dikhil, Tadjourah,
         Obock, and Arta (see Table 1). Among the poor (first quintile), only 32 percent live in urban
         Djibouti city.

    •    Levels of literacy and education. Overall, poverty is associated with lower levels of literacy
         of household heads (12.7 percent in the poorest quintile compared with 67.8 percent in the
         richest quintile) and also lower levels of education (in the poorest quintile, 89.0 percent have



                                                       12
           no education at all, 7.4 percent have completed primary education, and less one percent have
           completed high school or tertiary education, see figure 2).

     •     In the case of household heads, not working or working in menial jobs. This is associated
           with greater poverty. Poorer quintiles have lesser attachment to the labor market (32.9 percent
           in the poorest quintile hold a job compared with 71.1 percent in the richest quintile) and lower
           status jobs (only 7.5 percent in the poorest quintile work in the public sector compared with
           almost 40 percent in the richest quintile; see figure 3). For the total population aged between
           15 and 65 years, employment rates are even lower (15.9 in the first quintile against 41.8 for
           the richest quintile). Employment rates are particularly low in rural areas (17.6 percent
           against 30.0 in urban areas). Conversely, the proportion of people looking for a job (at least
           ready to take up one if available) is negatively correlated with the employment rate

     •     Household size. Poorer households tend to be larger and with more young members. The
           average household size among the poorest three quintiles is 6.1 persons; it is 5.6 among the
           fourth quintile and 4.5 among the richest quintile. The average age in the poorest quintile is
           22.1 compared with 27.5 in the richest.

     •     Vulnerable populations, such as households with disability, old-age and orphans, or female-
           headed households. These are not associated with a higher risk of living in poor households.
           Table 2 shows the proportion of those aged 60 years and older, 70 years and older, disabled
           and orphans, and households with female heads in each quintile. There is no apparent
           relationship between vulnerability and poverty.

                                    FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS

15.     Female-headed households are not subject to higher poverty risk despite their
disadvantageous socioeconomic characteristics. The distribution of female-headed households is
rather uniform across the welfare distribution. Nevertheless, female-headed households are at a
disadvantage in terms of socioeconomic characteristics. Figure 4 shows that almost 90 percent of
female heads of households have no educational attainment, in contrast to 55 percent of their male
counterparts. About 30 percent of female heads of households work mainly as day laborers or are self-
employed (see figure 5). Overall, this points to a more extensive support system for these female-
headed households. Interestingly, among the poorest quintile, the heads of about 40 percent of both
female- and male-headed households are looking for work.

16.       Education supports resilience to inter-generational transmission of poverty but poorer
children are less likely to be enrolled in school. School attendance for all age groups (6 to 13, 14 to
18, and 19 to 25) goes up with welfare quintile (see Figure 7). Among the richer quintiles, about 80
percent of 6 to 18-year-olds are in school compared with less than 60 percent among the poorest 6 to
13-year-olds and about 45 percent among the poorest 14 to 18-year-olds. School attendance is also
correlated with location: more than 75 percent of 14 to 18-year-olds in urban areas are enrolled
compared with only 28 percent in rural areas (see Table in annex 3). The gender gap in school
attendance increases with age (see Figure 8). There is a very small gap for the 6–13 age group but the
gap increases for older children. However, the gender gap is much smaller than in many African
countries, particularly Muslim ones. Analphabetism is widespread—about half the population is
illiterate—but it is also strongly correlated with welfare. Only 23 in the lowest quintile can read and
write compared with 71 percent in the richest quintile (see Table in annex 3).

   CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO SHOCKS, INCLUDING SAVINGS AND STRATEGIES FOR COPING

17.      Poor and rural households are especially vulnerable to shocks, in particular, food price
increases. Over the past 12 months, households in the lowest quintile were affected by an average of
1.55 shocks and households in the highest quintile by an average of 0.67 shocks (see Table 3). Rural
households are faced with more than twice the number of shocks than urban households (1.79
compared with 0.70), with households in Obock reporting more than three average shocks. Among
the households that faced a shock, 40 percent were affected by high food prices while 8 percent cited
the loss of cattle due to drought and 7 percent cited fuel and transport price rises (see annex 6). Again,
these numbers differ across welfare quintiles. For example, 56 percent of households in the first
quintile faced the shock of high food prices compared with 31 percent in the richest quintile. Loss of
cattle mainly affects poor households in rural areas, with 29 percent citing loss of cattle due to
drought and another 14 percent citing loss of cattle unrelated to drought, compared with less than 2
percent among the richest quintile. High cost of fuel/transportation is cited by eight percent of the
population across all quintiles.

Note: With the exception of column 2, averages are across households that faced at least one shock over the past 12 months.

18.     Shocks affect the ability of households, both poor and non-poor, to have access to
enough food. Following a shock, about 81 percent of households in the poorest quintile and 64
percent of households in the richest quintile experienced a decrease in revenue or a loss of goods,
including animals (see Table 3). Among the households affected by shocks, 83 percent of the poorest
households and 65 percent of the richest households report not having enough food. There is no major
difference between rural and urban households (80 and 78 percent, respectively), while the percentage
of female-headed households (83 percent) without sufficient food following a shock is slightly higher
than male-headed households (78 percent).


                                                            17
19.      Low resilience is associated with poverty and rural areas. Households in lower quintiles
and rural areas have less capacity to recover from shocks. Among the poorest households, 59 percent
report not being able to do anything to compensate the effect of the shock, whereas only 36 percent of
the richest households were in this situation. Similarly, vulnerability is higher in rural than urban
areas (60 and 42 percent, respectively). Conversely, the most resilient households tend to be the
richest and urban households. More than half of the households in the fifth quintile could recover
from losses caused by a shock, while only 26 percent of the poorest households were able to recover.
Similarly, urban households (38 percent) report more resilience than rural ones (25 percent).

20.     There does not seem to be a clear pattern on the resilience of female- and male-headed
households. On average, female-headed households are slightly more vulnerable to shocks (0.98
average shocks) than male headed-households (0.88 average shocks), in particular due the death of a
family member or the loss of cattle. As a consequence of a shock, a larger proportion of female-
headed households (83 percent) than male-headed households (78 percent) report not having enough
food. Male-headed households are less able to compensate for shocks compared with female-headed
households: 48 percent of male-headed households compared with 44 percent of female-headed
households report not being able to do anything to compensate the effect of a shock. For example,
female-headed households report being more likely to compensate for the loss of a family member
than male-headed households (difference of thirteen percentage points). Conversely, male-headed
households seem slightly better able to recover from a shock than female-headed households, in
particular after the loss of a family member. Again, this points to the existence of a ‘family-based
safety net’ for female-headed households.

                          EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET

21.      The public safety net typically consists of publicly sponsored programs that provide
income or in-kind support and access to basic social services to the poorest and vulnerable
members of society. In addition, there are other types of transfers such as contributory social
insurance like pensions, labor market programs, subsidies on food and fuel products, as well as
private transfers (remittances) among households. To assess the effectiveness of these transfers to
protect the poorest and vulnerable from shocks, a number of indicators are presented, for example,
coverage, targeting accuracy, and generosity.

22.      Untargeted tax exemptions (implicit subsidies) reach a wider part of the population than
targeted programs. Table 4 shows the percentage of the population (by area, region, and welfare
quintile) receiving seven types of transfers: pensions (private or public), compensation for health care
expenditure, food rations, cash transfers from the government or NGOs, publicly provided food and
fuel subsidies, and private transfers received from family and friends. Tax exemptions on basic food
items reach the majority of poor (77.3 percent in the first quintile) and almost the majority of
individuals in the other quintiles. Tax exemptions on certain fuel products, on the other hand, benefit
only17 percent of the poorest quintile but more than 82 percent of the richest. About a quarter of the
population in the poorest quintile benefits from food rations, making it a program with a relatively
effective targeting, partly because the program mainly targets rural areas. Compensation for health
expenditure disproportionately benefits the richer quintiles. Very few households (less than 10
percent) benefit from pensions. Finally, 21 percent of Djiboutian households receive private transfers
(international or national) and these transfers mainly benefit the poorest households.

23.      Looking at the transfers in terms of benefits incidence shows that untargeted tax
exemptions have high benefit leakage and are regressive compared to some targeted transfers
which appear generally more progressive. Table 5 shows the distribution of benefits by area of
residence, and by welfare quintile) of the same seven types of transfers previously mentioned. The
intended beneficiaries of social safety net programs should be the poor, so the performance of such
programs can be assessed by estimating program leakage. One way to measure such leakage is by
determining the share of total transfers received by non-poor beneficiaries. In a well-targeted
progressive program, the poor (bottom quintile) receive the highest share of transfers; this share
declines as welfare increases.7 In Djibouti, food rations and cash transfers generally fit this description
as the rural population and the poor receive most of the transfers. Over half of the transfers for food
rations are received by the poor (bottom quintile); almost 80 percent are in the bottom two quintiles
and live in rural areas (84.2 percent of benefits received), which is consistent with the fact that such
transfers are targeted to rural areas. In contrast, tax exemptions on food and fuel items predominantly
benefit the urban population and non-poor, making these programs regressive. In fact, the majority of
food and fuel subsidy resources (85 percent and 97 percent, respectively) are received by those living
in urban areas and by those from the richest two quintiles (57 percent and 89 percent, respectively).
However, only 15 percent of food subsidy benefits and less than 3 percent of fuel subsidy benefits go
to beneficiaries living in rural areas and only 10 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively, are
received by those in the poorest quintile. Pensions and compensation for health care expenditure
transfers are received mainly by the population living in urban areas and non-poor beneficiaries.

Note: Benefits' incidence is the transfer amount received by the group as a percent of total transfers received by the
population. Specifically, benefits' incidence is (Sum of all transfers received by all individuals in the group)/(Sum of all
transfers received by all individuals in the population). Aggregated transfer amounts are estimated using household size-
weighted expansion factors.

24.     The majority of the poor are not covered by the social safety nets programs in Djibouti,
leading to high exclusion (under-coverage or proportion of the poor not benefitting from the
program) and inclusion errors (leakage or proportion of beneficiaries who are non-poor) and
low targeting accuracy (see Table 6). ‘Targeting differential’ (last column in Table 6) measures the
difference between the coverage rate of the poor and beneficiary leakage (participation rate for non-
poor). Therefore, a negative number would mean that there are more non-poor than poor beneficiaries
covered by the program. Coverage of the poor for pension (5.3 percent), compensation for health care
expenditure (1.3 percent), cash transfers from the government or NGOs (5.8 percent), and fuel
subsidies (17.1 percent) are very low, and therefore under covered. Leakage (both in terms of
beneficiaries and benefits) and targeting differential are very high. On the other hand, coverage of the
poor for food-related transfers (food ration and subsidies) is relatively higher.

  Note: Under-coverage refers to the percentage of poor individuals that do not receive transfer. Leakage refers to the
  percentage of individuals that receive transfers and are not poor. Sample of all households. Under-coverage and leakage
  are calculated across this sample, setting as expansion factor the household expansion factor multiplied by the household
  size. The targeting differential is the difference between the coverage rate and the participation rate for non-poor.


25.      The generosity of social safety nets programs in Djibouti is generally very low. Tables 7
and 8 illustrate the generosity of the transfers (size or value of the transfer) received by a given group
relative to the welfare of all households in that group (relative incidence) or relative to the total
welfare of beneficiaries in that group (generosity). The lower the generosity, the less important is the
value of the transfer on the welfare of the beneficiaries. On the other hand, the higher the generosity,

                                                              20
the higher its importance as a source of welfare to the beneficiaries. The generosity and size of
transfers are, therefore, important design features of social safety programs as they will have an
impact on the poverty and other intended objectives of the programs. In fact, low generosity will limit
the poverty impact. Only two programs (pensions and private transfers from family and friends –
which strictly speaking are not social assistance programs), out of the seven types of programs
available, seem to have an impact on the consumption level of the population in general. On the
contrary, by focusing on the poorest quintile food rations also have a significant effect even if private
transfers are by far the most efficient vehicle. In fact, the impact on the welfare of the poorest quintile
from cash transfers from the government or NGOs and tax exemptions on food is extremely modest
and that of tax exemptions on fuel items is negligible.

26.       Social safety nets in Djibouti appear to have limited impact on poverty and inequality,
which could be explained by the combination of low targeting accuracy and generosity. Table 9
illustrates the impact of different transfers on poverty, using the headcount index or poverty rate
(FGT0) and poverty gap index (FGT1) measures as well as the impact on inequality using the Gini
coefficient. The poverty rate is the share of population that is counted as poor; the poverty gap index
(expressed as a percentage of the poverty line) sums up the extent to which, on average, individuals
fall below the poverty line; and the Gini coefficient measures income distribution and ranges from 0
(perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality). For example, without the food ration program, poverty rate
would increase by 0.4 percentage points, the poverty gap would increase by 0.58 percentage points
and the Gini coefficient would increase from 46.5 to 46.7. The two programs with the highest impact

on poverty are pensions and private transfers as the poverty rate would increase by 1.5 and 2.1
percentage points, respectively, in the absence of this program.

27.       In Djibouti, the program with the highest cost-benefit ratio is food rations followed by
cash transfers from the government or NGOs (targeted transfers). In contrast, the one with the
lowest cost-benefit ratio is tax exemptions on fuel products closely followed by compensation for
health care expenditure (untargeted transfers). Using the poverty line, defined by the upper limit of
the first quintile, Table 10 and Figure 9 illustrate the cost-benefit ratio of the seven types of transfers
in Djibouti. This ratio measures the poverty gap reduction in local currency (Djibouti franc - DF) for
every unit spent in the given program. For example, for the food rations transfers, the program with
the highest ratio, every DF 1 spent in the program leads to DF 0.64 reduction in the poverty gap.
However, for the tax exemption on fuel products, the transfer with the lowest ratio, every DF 1 spent
in the program leads to only DF 0.01 reduction in the poverty gap.

28.      In line with the low targeting accuracy and low generosity, social safety net programs in
Djibouti are generally small and inadequate in reducing the poverty gap. Table 11 shows the
generosity ratio, the ratio between the average transfers and the poverty gap, and the program size for
each of the seven transfer programs in Djibouti. The ratio is above 1 for pension, which means that
the average transfer is higher than the poverty gap and a strong indication that beneficiaries depend on
this transfer as a source of income, which is usually expected for social insurance programs. On the
other hand, the generosity of subsidies (both fuel and food) is negligible in closing the poverty gap;
hence, a ratio of less than 0.1.

                           SAFETY NET
           THE IMPORT AND CONSUMPTION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IN DJIBOUTI

29.      Djibouti relies entirely on imports for the supply of petroleum products and domestic
consumption is dominated by diesel. All imports come through Djibouti port. Of these imports, a
substantial portion is re-exported, and in addition, there are large volumes in transit to Ethiopia.
Furthermore, a large fraction of the net imports are destined for foreign armies with bases in Djibouti,
for international airlines, and for maritime transport. Although there are no official figures for imports
and consumption of petroleum products, a recent study for the government of Djibouti surveyed all
parties involved in the import and sale of petroleum products and produced a reconciliation for 2012.
The resulting data is shown in Table 12, and this indicates that domestic consumption is dominated by
diesel.

30.      The same study also presented a forecast of domestic consumption until 2017 in which
diesel was expected to reach 91 million liters, kerosene 17 million liters, gasoline 9 million liters,
and fuel oil 8 million liters. These figures indicate that the change in taxation of diesel will be
particularly important in terms of government revenue. The domestic consumption of petroleum
products is divided between households and businesses that pay all taxes and duties and a number of
parties that receive some tax exemptions. These include certain businesses, embassies, and the
Republican Guard.

                         PETROLEUM PRODUCTS: PRICES, COSTS, AND TAXES

31.      Fuel prices, especially of gasoline, are higher in Djibouti than in neighboring countries.
Transportation fuel prices in Djibouti can be compared to those from other non-oil-producing
countries in the region in 2012. With the exception of Eritrea, prices in Djibouti, especially gasoline
prices, were higher than neighboring countries (see Table 13). This is largely due to the very small
size of the domestic market, resulting in loss of economies of scale. Diesel prices are nearer to those
of neighboring countries and this is in part due to discretionary tax offsets that have been used for
diesel.

32.      The retail prices of petroleum products in Djibouti are regulated by the Ministry of
Finance according to a formula, which includes predetermined and discretionary elements
(costs and taxes). The complete price and cost structure is reviewed monthly. Costs include an
import component and various domestic items. The allowable amounts for domestic costs are changed
occasionally, while tax rates are fixed except for a discretionary component (ajustement en faveur de
l’Etat) that is used to smooth out fluctuations in retail prices that would otherwise be induced by
fluctuations in the import cost. This component can be either positive (extra tax) or negative (tax
offset).

33.    The exact determination of the smoothed retail price is made not according to a formula
but depends on judgments made by the government. In principle, such an approach to smoothing

                                                      24
out import cost fluctuations could result in no extra, long-run net benefit or cost to the government.
However, there have been lengthy periods in which the discretionary component has been negative
(because of the low final retail price set by the government) resulting in tax revenue persistently
below that which would have resulted from the application of the non-discretionary tax structure. The
government is now considering abandoning the discretionary tax component so that retail prices
would be predictably linked to the allowable costs and the import cost of the products. This would
mean that the full tax revenue implied by the formula would be collected from retail sales.

34.      At present, kerosene is provided through two routes, yielding the same retail price due
to a discretionary tax element. Besides the established marketing of kerosene, the government has
recently made an arrangement with the La Société de Distribution et de Vente de Kérosène (SDVK) to
distribute kerosene nationwide (although at present it serves only Djibouti-ville and suburbs). The
government allows the SDVK to include a fee in the price charged to build its network and also
exempts the price from domestic consumption tax (TIC) and VAT. The price does include a
discretionary tax element so that the retail price of this kerosene supply is the same as the general
retail price of kerosene.

The Determination of the Retail Price

35.      The various components of the pricing formula are set by the government in agreement with
the oil companies.8

       •   The price for delivery at Djibouti port. FOB prices in international markets are collected
           monthly, as averages of daily FOB prices for the preceding month quoted in Platt’s Oilgram
           Price Report. An exporter’s margin, cost of shipping and insurance, and port fees are added.
           The commercial margin is updated every six months based on invoice information about
           actual FOB prices paid by oil companies in the preceding six months.

       •   Duties and taxes include a domestic consumption tax (TIC) and VAT at rates set by
           legislation—currently 26 and 7 percent, respectively. Excise duties are set by legislation, and
           royalties are determined annually in the budget.

       •   The transport, operational, and storage costs and the commercial margins of distributors and
           service station operators are set by the government. These can be changed after discussion
           with the relevant parties.

       •   A discretionary tax component is used to smooth out retail prices in the face of volatile FOB
           costs and to reduce inflationary pressure on low-income households in times of rising
           international prices. This component varies each month and is calculated so as to produce a
           desired retail price linked to the other costs by the formula.

37.     The regulated prices for petroleum products sold to special groups also allow for
various exemptions on taxes, and these exemptions are expected to continue so that tax revenue
from these groups is lower than that from the purely retail market. Such groups include the
French military (50 percent exemption on domestic consumption tax and 50 percent exemption on
excise duties); exempt businesses (zero domestic consumption tax and zero excise tax); embassies and
domestic security forces (zero domestic consumption tax, zero VAT, zero excise tax, and zero
royalty). The effect of these exemptions is to forgo tax revenue that would otherwise have accrued to
the budget had the products been sold at the same price as to the general public.

38.      The government recently entered into an arrangement with the SDVK to distribute
kerosene in order to make it more widely available. A service fee was included in the price
markup on top of other port and distribution charges. To encourage the company to set up the
network required to expand the market for kerosene, the government exempted this kerosene from the
domestic consumer tax (TIC), excise duty, and VAT. However, royalty was charged and the
discretionary tax was set so as to bring the retail price to the same level as the charge for the
traditional method of selling kerosene.

39.      The retail prices and discretionary tax elements for 2013 are shown in Table 14. The
data for gasoline prices illustrate how the retail price was smoothed by varying the discretionary tax
through the year. In January 2013, the adjustment was negative, indicating that the government was
holding down retail prices by forgoing a certain amount of tax revenue. By the end of the year, the
retail price had risen slightly, but the discretionary tax had become positive, indicating that the
government was now collecting some extra tax revenue. For diesel, the government was forgoing a
certain amount of tax revenue throughout the year to hold retail prices down. It is important to note
that the government during this period was still a net recipient of tax revenue from diesel. For
kerosene, the government collected some tax revenue through royalty as well as a small amount from
the (positive) discretionary tax. The net effect of this sales arrangement for kerosene was that the total
tax revenue per liter was much lower than for gasoline and for diesel.

40.       The calculation of the discretionary element is similar for the exempt organizations but
it has to be interpreted differently. The price calculation for the Republican Guard is given as an
illustration. In December 2013, the price at the port (PP) for gasoline was DF 148.46; domestic tax,
excise tax, royalty, and VAT were all zero; distribution costs (DD) were DF 11.65; terminal transport
cost was DF 1.76; and retail margin was DF 7.02. The sum of these costs was DF 168.89 and this was
the charge to the Republican Guard. Relative to the retail price of DF 315, this involved a tax
exemption of DF 146.10 that can be seen as a transfer from one segment of the government to
another.

Impact of Abandoning the Discretionary Tax on Retail Prices

41.      The proposal currently under consideration by the government is to abandon the use of
the discretionary tax element. Other tax rates could be varied by legislation, as at present, but would
normally be stable for lengthy periods. Allowable costs along the supply chain could also be varied if
justified by the circumstances of the entities involved. To simulate the effect of removing the
discretionary tax element on prices, it is assumed that all other tax rates and costs remain at the levels
of December 2013. The calculation shows the effect on the price of kerosene that is supplied by the
SDVK.

42.       For gasoline and diesel, the removal of the discretionary tax component has two effects
on the retail price that would have to be charged. First, when the discretionary tax is positive, its
removal would contribute to lowering of the retail price by this amount. Second, because VAT at 7
percent is charged on the discretionary tax element, there would be a further lowering of the retail
price. Similarly, when the discretionary tax is negative, its removal would raise retail prices by 1.07
times the amount of the discretionary tax. For kerosene sold by the SDVK, there is no VAT element
so that the resulting price change would be equal to the amount of the discretionary tax. Table 15
illustrates the effects on retail prices if the tax had been removed in December 2013.

43.       The removal of the discretionary tax element would have resulted in a small fall in
gasoline and kerosene prices but an increase of around 13 percent for diesel. The comparison
between the before and after prices in December 2013 is possible because the government’s action
with respect to the determination of the retail price (and the associated discretionary tax) is a known
fact. Simulating the effect of removing the discretionary tax under different circumstances is possible,
but it is not possible to give a ‘before’ calculation since it is not known what the government would
have decided to do with retail prices had it kept the discretionary tax.

44.      As an illustration of the range of retail prices that might be experienced if the
discretionary tax were abandoned, simulations of the impacts of a 20 percent increase and a 20
percent decrease in the FOB prices (relative to the levels of December 2013) are constructed and
the results are shown in Table 16. It is assumed that all other costs, taxes, and duties remain
unchanged, and in all cases there is no discretionary tax element. The results of the calculations show
gasoline price varying by between ±12 percent, kerosene prices by ±15 percent, and diesel prices by
±15 percent. The larger fixed elements for gasoline (excise duty and royalty) mean that the percentage
swing in the FOB price (which is similar for all three products) is damped down more than is the case
for diesel and for kerosene

45.      Crude oil prices have recently fallen substantially and this is relevant to the calculations
shown. In December 2013, Brent crude sold for about US$110 a barrel and it remained around that
level until July 2014. Since then it has steadily declined until falling to around US$70 a barrel in
December 2014 (i.e., a drop of 36 percent). There is considerable uncertainty about the course of
prices in 2015, with some analysts expecting a small recovery to around $80 a barrel.

46.     The simulations of the effect of abandoning the discretionary tax focused on December
2013 actual FOB prices, and included a sensitivity analysis of a 20% drop of those prices (Table
17). This drop would have corresponded to a Brent crude price of about $90 a barrel. The actual fall
has been almost twice that allowed in the sensitivity analysis. Simple extrapolation indicates that, in
the absence of discretionary taxes, a 40% fall in FOB prices would result in gasoline prices of 235
DF/liter, kerosene prices of 130 DF/liter, and diesel prices of 169 DF/liter.

                                  GASOIL PRICES AND TRANSPORT COSTS

47.     The analysis of the impact of removing the discretionary tax element on households
proceeds through the use of an expenditure survey, coupled with the calculated changes in
petroleum product prices. The shares of total household expenditure allocated to each of the three
petroleum products is directly available from the household expenditure survey and can be combined
with predicted price changes to estimate the expenditure change required to purchase the same
amounts of each product.

48.      Besides these direct effects on household budgets, there are indirect effects caused by
the impact of rising petroleum product prices on other goods and hence on the household
budget. Without a detailed input-output table it is not possible to quantify all such links, but the most
important link for petroleum products in Djibouti is transport costs. In particular, costs of travel by
bus or taxi can be an important component of household expenditure, so it is important to consider the
link between product prices and transport costs.

49.     As gasoil (diesel) is used as fuel for commercial transportation vehicles, the key question
is the nature of the link between the gasoil price and the price of transportation services. Bus

fares are regulated and have changed very little in the last decade. However, it is likely that a jump in
fuel costs brought about by the abolition of the discretionary tax, which was holding down costs by
about 12 percent in December 2013, could provide an opportunity for the bus sector to ask for higher
ticket prices to cover their increased costs. Many factors might enter such a negotiation, including
previous loss of profitability caused by the government holding prices steady for a long period. A full
justification of an allowable fare increase would require detailed analysis of the economics of the bus
and taxi sectors. In the absence of such a detailed study, a first approximation can be obtained by
combining the fuel share in total costs with the percentage increase in fuel costs.

50.      There is some evidence on the share of fuel costs in the total costs of operating a bus
fleet from other countries that can serve as a marker for any assumption that is made for the
case of Djibouti. ESMAP (2011) refers to a study in India where the share of fuel cost in Andhra
Pradesh amounted to 37 percent of total costs. A study by the World Bank analyzed factors affecting
bus performance in middle- to low-income countries and provided values indicative of the range of
cost breakdown as shown in Table 17. The following remarks from the study are relevant in the
present case: “In the case of informal small-scale operation using rehabilitated or locally fabricated
buses, financed by overseas remittances, depreciation and interest costs are much less (only about 10
percent of total costs), while driver and other staff costs can be relatively more (20-30 percent) due to
the higher number of people employed per unit of capacity (often including the owner).”

51.      Table 17 indicates that fuel costs can range between about 50 and 75 percent of variable
costs depending on circumstances. A survey carried out by the SESN and DISED in Djibouti-ville
in 2014 indicated that, averaged over all forms of passenger road transport, fuel accounted for 80
percent of variable costs (see annex 4 for details) and that there was little variation in this ratio among
the different forms of passenger transport. The closeness of these figures suggests that it is reasonable
to assume that fuel costs in Djibouti are about 30 percent of total operating costs (the high end of the
range given in Table 17 corresponding to the 75 percent share of variable costs).

52.     Combining the information on the possible increase in diesel prices (12.5 percent)
relative to their level in December 2013 with a fuel cost share of 30 percent suggests that an
increase of 4 percent in passenger fares would be justified to allow bus companies to overcome
the effects of higher fuel prices. If the government decided to permit a larger price rise, perhaps to
allow for ‘catch-up’ with previous cost increases, there is more likelihood of public opposition to the
change.

                                 WHO CONSUMES ENERGY PRODUCTS?

53.      Car ownership and utilization of public transport is a strong indication of welfare. Car
ownership is not widespread in Djibouti: only 6 percent of households own a car and 1 percent owns a
motorcycle. One-fourth of the richest quintile owns a car while car ownership is basically negligible
in the other quintiles (see Table 18). Most cars are owned in urban areas. Not surprisingly, carburant
is only consumed only by urban households (see figure 10) of the richest quintile (see Figure 11).

                                                        29
Utilization of public transport (bus, taxis, and school buses) is also highest among the richer quintiles.
Only 10 percent of the poor use public transport compared with almost 60 percent in the richest 2
quintiles. About half the population in urban areas makes use of public transport but less than 10
percent in rural areas. Among school children, only 5 percent of children in the poorest quintile take
the school bus compared with 30 percent in the richest 3 quintiles.

                                       WHO BENEFITS FROM TAX EXEMPTIONS?

54.     In response to the food crisis and to shield the population from price shocks on essential
food and certain energy products, universal tax exemptions were introduced. Djibouti depends
heavily on imports to meet its food needs, and a large fraction of the population faces food insecurity.
Practically all food items are imported and increases in international food prices directly affects
Djibouti’s poor people, who spend up to three-quarters of their income on food. Due to severe and
prolonged droughts, at least 20 percent of the capital’s population and three-quarters of rural
households are left vulnerable to severe and moderate food insecurity (World Food Program 2013).
According to IMF estimates, Djibouti foregoes 0.5 percent of GDP (2009) on certain food items (rice,

                                                                      30
edible oil, sugar, flour, and powdered milk) and an estimated 2 percent of GDP (2011) on certain
energy products (IMF, 2012).

55.      The following analysis includes all the tax-exempt fuel and food products available in
the household survey. Among the basic food items that are tax exempt, only a certain quality/type is
exempt (for example, broken rice). For rice, only 6 percent of the imported rice is exempt, but about
88 percent of flour, about 60 percent of sugar and edible oil, and about 50 percent of powdered milk
products are exempt. For flour, the implicit subsidy represents 7 percent of the unsubsidized price.
The survey does not differentiate between diesel and super (lumped together as carburant), but data
from the Enquete de Budget et Consomation (EBC) survey (an urban only survey done in 2013) show
that around two-thirds of spending by households on carburant is on diesel. Furthermore, the survey
shows that almost all direct spending on carburant is by the richest quintile. For carburant (super and
diesel), the implicit subsidy represents 11 percent of the unsubsidized price. For public transport, the
analysis assumes a fuel cost share of 30 percent, which corresponds to passing on 4 percent to
passengers.

56.      Poor households spend relatively more on tax-exempt products, with the exception of
fuel and public transport. Household expenses on tax-exempt products amount on average to DF
267,531 per household, which is equivalent to 22.8 percent of total household spending. Table 19
shows household expenses on tax-exempt products and Table 20 shows the proportion of household
spending toward those tax-exempt products. Kerosene is the most consumed item in terms of
expenditures (DF 42,777), followed by rice (DF 36,671) and sugar (35 670 DF). Tax-exempt products
are relatively more important for the poor, as the expenditure share of these products is much higher
for the very poor than for the very rich. In the poorest households, 30.7 percent of the total expenses
correspond to tax-exempt products, while these tax-exempt products account for just 19.6 percent of
the richest households’ total expenses.

57.     Tax exemptions on fuel products do not benefit the poor as they consume little fuel and
hardly use public transportation. As shown in Table 18, possession of cars and motorbikes is
essentially limited to the fifth quintile, which consumes DF 91,847 per household on fuel, while the
very poor do not consume fuel at all. Spending on public transport is also considerably lower in the
poorest quintile (DF 2,030 per household) than in the richest quintile (over DF 47,000 per household).
Already the second quintile spends considerably more on public transport than the very poor (see
Table 19). For the poor, expenses on public transport amount to less than 1 percent of overall
household expenses. The middle three quintiles spend about 2 percent of overall expenses on
buses/taxis and about 3 percent on school transport (see Table 20).

                                          IMPACT OF SUBSIDY REFORMS

58.     This section presents a simulation that eliminates the discretionary tax elements on each of
the subsidized products discussed in the previous section and then shows the potential impact of this
removal on household welfare, government budget, poverty, and inequality.

Household Welfare

59.      The reform would imply a loss of DF 1,014 million (or 0.66 percent of GDP) for the
population; however, the per capita values indicate that the loss would be higher for the richest.
This is explained by fact that the richest have a higher consumption level than the poor as mentioned
in the previous section. Table 21 shows the impact of the reform on the welfare of the population for
each quintile, as illustrated in Figure 12 and Table 22, and Table 22 shows the impact of the reform
on the per capita welfare of each quintile. For fuel, the impact of the reform on poor households is
negligible, but it increases with welfare and represents the highest loss among rich households. In
fact, among the poorest households, the reform would imply an important loss in welfare from food-
related products—flour, followed by sugar—while for the richest the loss will be the highest for fuel,
followed, by far, by flour (also seen in per capita basis in Table 22). This is consistent with the finding
in the previous sections that the richest households spend a significant share of their income on fuel.

60.     Among the poorer quintiles, the loss in welfare as a result of the reform would be the
highest on food related items; while it would be the highest on fuel products among the richer
quintiles. Table 23 and Figure 13 show the impact of the reform on the welfare of the population as a
proportion of total spending by quintile and for each subsidized product. In terms of food-related
products, the reform would result in a significant loss of welfare among the poorest quintile (1.12
percent of total spending) (see Figure 13) but this loss decreases as welfare increases. On the other
hand, the reform would result in a minimal loss among the top quintile for fuel products, and this loss
decreases as welfare decreases and becomes negligible for the first quintile.

Government Budget

61.     The impact of the reform on government budget would result in a gain, the highest
coming from fuel. Table 24 shows the impact of the reform on government budget from the different
subsidized products. The impact of the reform on government budget would result in a total gain of
DF 811 million (or 0.53 percent of GDP): 28 percent of that gain would come from fuel (96 percent
of the gain from fuel will originate from the richest households), 18 percent from flour, and 15
percent from sugar. The highest gain in government budget will come from the richest households (54
percent). This decreases as welfare decreases to reach the lowest share among poor households (5
percent). This is consistent with the previous finding that the highest loss of welfare in the population
would come from fuel, and particularly among the rich. Figure 14 shows the impact on government
revenues as the price of each subsidized product increases. The most important revenue gain to the
government would come from increasing the price of fuel, while the least would come from
increasing the price of cooking oil. It should be noted that since we assume a price elasticity of 0.2,
the amount gained by the government is less than the loss incurred by the different households.

Poverty and Inequality

62.      As the poor spend most of their income on food-related products, the elimination of tax
exemptions on such products would have the highest impact on destitution and inequality, while
the elimination of tax exemptions on fuel products would reduce inequality but with no
apparent impact on poverty. However these effects would be minimal, almost negligible. Table
25 shows the impact of the reform on destitution and inequality. The reform would not have a very
significant impact on destitution and no impact on inequality. In particular, the poverty rate would
increase by 0.17 percentage points from 20.00 to 20.17 percent. Similarly, the Gini index would
decrease by 0.02 percentage points from 45.13 to 45.11 percent. The elimination of tax exemptions on
flour would increase destitution by 0.05 percentage points (from 20 to 20.05 percent), and inequality
by 0.05 percentage points (from 45.13 to 45.18 percent). The effect of the elimination of the
discretionary tax adjustment on fuel would not affect the poorest and would in fact result in a
reduction of inequality by 0.12 percentage points. This is explained by the fact that the consumption
of this product is negligible among the poor, while it is one of the highest consumed products for rich
households among the subsidized products.

                                SIMULATING REFORM OPTIONS
                                        BUDGET AND SIMULATIONS

63.      A rough estimate of the available budget to simulate reform options is based on current
budget estimates and half the savings from removing tax exemptions. Table 26 shows an
estimation of a budget that could be transferred by the SESN. At this stage, knowing the exact amount
to be transferred is not that important and simulations are mainly illustrative.

64.      Based on discussions with the SESN, 6 families of transfer scheme either at individual,
equivalent adult, or household level yield a total of 18 schemes. For each scheme, we assume that
the total budget to be transferred is DF 1, 2, or 3 billion for a grand total of 54 different simulations.

65.       Table 27 defines 6 families of transfer schemes:

      •   Rural + urban outside Djibouti-ville: all individuals away from Djibouti-ville are targeted
          irrespective of whether they are from urban or rural areas.
      •   Rural only.
      •   Rural + urban in first quintile: all rural + individuals that are in first quintile (nationally
          defined).
      •   First quintile with unique transfer: any households (urban or rural) found in the first quintile
          are targeted. Targeted households received the same transfer, whether they are the poorest or
          the ‘richest’ within the first quintile.
      •   First quintile with 2 steps: same as the one above but the amount transferred depends on
          whether you are the first or second decile.
      •   First quintile with 4 steps: same as above but with 4 different amounts, one for the poorest 5
          percent, 5–10 percent, 10–15 percent, and 15–20 percent. That scheme is closer to an optimal
          one where the amount transferred would be different for each household, depending on the
          PMT level, the poorest receiving the most, then the second poorest receiving a bit less, and so
          on. However, such a scheme would be rather difficult to implement.
      •   The total budget allotted to the different groups was based on the relative size of their poverty
          gap. The following was used:
               o 0–5%: 41.0% of total budget
               o 5–10%: 33.9%
               o 10–15%: 19.0%
               o 15–20%: 6.2%

66.     Those 6 schemes could be implemented at individual or household level. In the latter
case, the amount transferred is the same for any household meeting the selection criteria
irrespective of the household size. On the other hand, the ‘individual schemes’ depend on household
size. For example, a nine-member household would receive three times the amount received by a
three-member household. An intermediate measure is based on equivalence adults (Eq.Ad.). Each
member is then weighted by the calorie requirement as defined in Table 28.

Destitution Headcount

67.      The largest decline in destitution headcount is achieved when targeting the first quintile.
Table 29 shows the destitution headcount (P0)—poverty defined as first quintile—after transferring
three different budget amounts (DF 1, 2, and 3 billion) according to the 18 schemes defined. Overall,
with a total budget of DF 1 billion, the effect on destitution headcount is limited if we concentrate
mainly on rural households without taking into account urban households from the first quintile. The
largest decline in destitution headcount with a DF 1 billion budget is scheme 10–12, which targets the
first quintile and transfers a uniform amount.

68.      With a larger budget of DF 3 billion, it would be possible to almost halve the destitution
headcount using any of the schemes that target the first quintile. Any scheme that targets the first
quintile (schemes number 7 to 18) achieves a significant reduction in destitution headcount with a 3
billion budget. Using such a destitution headcount as a measure of efficiency, however, it is not clear
whether an individual or a household-based scheme is more efficient at reducing destitution. The
main problem using a destitution headcount to assess the different schemes is that no weight is given
when an extremely poor household receives an important transfer while remaining below the
destitution line. Actually we can imagine an extreme case where all the poorest households would be
much better off but still poor if none of the amount transferred makes them go over the poverty line.
Because of that, we should focus on destitution gap as a measure of poverty.

Destitution Gap

69.      To reduce the destitution gap, targeting the first quintile is more efficient than any of
the schemes focusing on rural households. The destitution gap index (P01) estimates the depth of
destitution by considering how far, on average, the poor are from that poverty line. It is defined as the
average destitution gap in the population as a proportion of the destitution line. In a graph presenting
the cumulative welfare function, this is the area below the poverty line and on the left hand side of the
function. Before any transfer, the destitution gap index (PGI or P1) associated with the destitution line
used in Table 30 is measured as 6.9 percent (last line in the table). On average, the poor individual has
expenditures (as measured by the PMT) 6.9 percent below the destitution line (DF 77,926 per capita).




                                                        38
70.      Table 30 clearly shows that there should be an exclusive transfer scheme focusing on the first
quintile. Importantly, such a transfer would be much more efficient at reducing poverty than any of
the schemes focusing on rural households (schemes 1–9). The preferred scheme to reduce the
destitution gap would be targeting the first quintile with a 4-step transfer amount depending on
poverty. Schemes number 16 or 17 would be by far the best: focusing on the first quintile but with the
amount transferred being dependent on poverty (as defined by the PMT). In this case, the poorest 5
percent would receive more than the poorest 10 percent, and so on (see Table 27). In a scheme
focusing on ‘rural only’, Table 31 shows that only 62.4 percent of individuals in the first quintile, and
quite a few non-poor households, would receive a transfer (11.8 percent of individuals of Q2, 4.3
percent in Q3, and so on). Any such leakage (households receiving transfers although they were not
targeted) necessarily makes rural-based criteria less efficient at reducing poverty than one focusing
solely on Q1. Alternatively, the ‘rural + urban in first quintile’ would have the advantage of covering
everybody in Q1 but the leakage would remain similar (i.e. the non-poor in rural areas), making such
a scheme only slightly better (no exclusion error but the same inclusion error) that the ‘rural only’ one
(see Table 31). In summary, by far the best scheme would be number 16 or 17.

Proxy Means Test9 - Djibouti

Introduction
Le Gouvernement de la République de Djibouti, ainsi que plusieurs organismes non-
gouvernementaux, cherchent les meilleures politiques afin d’améliorer le bien-être de la population
Djiboutienne en général, et des individus les plus pauvres et vulnérables en particulier. Les différents
programmes actuellement en place utilisent différents critères de ciblages ce qui entraîne des coûts
administratifs trop élevés et parfois des incohérences quant aux différentes populations ciblées. Une
approche plus cohérente entre les différents programmes devrait permettre d’obtenir des programmes
de lutte contre la pauvreté plus efficace et à un meilleur rapport coût-efficacité.

Différentes approches de ciblage sont possible (auto-ciblage, ciblage géographique, ciblage
catégorielle etc.) mais après concertation entre le gouvernement et ses différents partenaires il a été
arrêté que l’approche dite « Proxy Means Test » (PMT) serait celle utilisée à Djibouti.

L’approche PMT consiste à construire une mesure de bien-être des ménages à partir de la collecte
d’indicateurs multiples qui sont plus faciles à observer que le revenu (consommation), mais qui sont
fortement corrélés avec le revenu (consommation). Ces indicateurs multiples servent à établir une
note (score) qui détermine si la famille devrait recevoir une aide ou pas. La formule PMT inclura en
général des caractéristiques des ménages comme sa taille et sa composition, la qualité de son
logement, la propriété des biens de consommation durables ou bien le niveau d’instruction des
membres du ménage.

La présente note technique fait suite à une mission de la Banque mondiale qui a eu lieu à Djibouti-
ville du 10 au 19 avril 2013 et mise à jour lors d’une dernière mission en mai 2014. La mission a reçu
la collaboration étroite de la Direction de la statistique et des études démographiques (DISED) et du
Secrétariat d’état à la solidarité nationale (SESN). L’objectif principal consistait à estimer cette
fonction PMT qui devrait être utilisée dans le cadre du projet de Registre unifié des pauvres.

Données
La troisième Enquête Djiboutienne auprès des ménages (EDAM 3) a été conduite en 2012 par la
DISED. Cette enquête est à la base du dernier profil de pauvreté qui est en cours de finalisation par la
DISED. L’EDAM 3 a un échantillon représentatif de la population nationale sédentaire de 31 686
individus répartis au sein de 5 880 ménages. Le questionnaire de l’EDAM 3 couvre une multitude de
facettes socio-économiques des ménages : démographe, éducation, emploi, mortalité, gouvernance,
logement, accès aux services sociaux de base, possessions du ménage, dépenses et revenus.

A partir des données de cette enquête, un agrégat des dépenses totales des ménages par habitant a été
calculé et a été à la base du profil de pauvreté. Les analystes de la DISED et de la Banque mondiale
ont trouvé des taux de pauvreté de 16,9% (pauvreté extrême) et 33,7% (pauvreté relative)10.

Par contre, l’EDAM3 ne couvre ni la population nomade ou la population dite « flottante », i.e. les
sans-abri. Selon le recensement général de la population et de l’habitat (RGPH) de 2009, sur une
population totale de 818 159 personnes, la population nomade est de 161 132 et la population flottante
est de 149 022. Afin de prendre en compte ces populations non-sédentaires dans notre analyse, nous
avons complété l’EDAM3 par des données du dernier RGPH. Pour la population nomade, nous avons

  L’expression Proxy Means Test est quelques fois traduite par contrôles indirects du niveau des ressources ou
bien par test de revenu par approximation. Par contre, nous continuerons à utiliser Proxy Means Test (PMT) étant
donné que les gens sont plus familiers avec ce vocable.

accès à un échantillon des données désagrégées du RGPH tandis que dans le cas de la population
flottante (parfois appelée « particulière » ou « sans-abri ») nous avons uniquement un décompte de
cette population.

A partir de ces différentes sources de données nous avons construit un système de pondération qui
tient en compte le poids relatif de ces trois différentes populations et de la croissance de la population
depuis les collectes de données. Ainsi nos analyses se baseront sur une population totale de 827 857
selon la répartition suivante :

     •   Sédentaire :        523 359
     •   Nomade :            173 585
     •   Sans-abri :         130 913

Méthodologie
La méthodologie dite PMT consiste simplement à trouver une série de caractéristiques des ménages
facilement observables et qui sont corrélées avec le niveau de dépenses des ménages. Cette relation
est supposée linéaire et estimée par la méthode des moindres carrés ordinaires (MCO). A partir des
coefficients obtenus, il est possible de calculer la valeur espérée des dépenses de ces mêmes ménages.
En termes plus techniques, nous estimons l’équation (1) à partir des données sur les 5880 ménages de
l’EDAM 311.       représente la valeur réelle des dépenses des ménages i per capita (en log),
représente les j variables indépendantes pour les ménages i, sont les coefficients à estimer pour les
j variables , est la constante et est le terme d’erreur de l’équation à estimer.

                                              =     +         +               (1)
L’estimation de l’équation (1) par la méthode des MCO génèrera la constante et les coefficients .
À partir de ceux-ci, le PMT score est simplement calculé comme la valeur espérée    selon
l’équation suivante :

                                               =        = exp	    +           (2)
Notons que les coefficients estimés sont les poids qui seront utilisée lors du calcul des scores PMT
et ainsi détermineront si un ménage sera bénéficiaire ou non. Un ménage sera considéré comme
pauvre si      est inférieure au seuil de pauvreté et non-pauvre dans le cas contraire. Similairement, un
ménage sera considéré comme bénéficiaire si          est inférieure au même seuil; et non-bénéficiaire si
cette valeur 	est égale ou supérieure au seuil. Le seuil de pauvreté utilisé pourrait être un des deux
seuils se retrouvant dans le dernier profil de pauvreté, mais pourrait aussi être un niveau arbitraire
décidé par l’organisme de mise en place du programme de transfert ciblé. Dans la présente note, nous
utiliserons une série de seuils définie par les différents déciles.

Même si la valeur de 	 se veut la meilleure estimation des dépenses        il est indéniable que ces
valeurs seront différentes. Ce type d’estimation n’ai jamais parfait. Le tableau 1 présente les
différents cas possibles. Certains ménages seront considérés comme pauvres (non-pauvres) et
bénéficiaires (non-bénéficiaires) et seront ainsi des exemples de ciblage réussi (S1 et S2 dans le
tableau 1). Par contre, il y aura assurément des cas où des ménages pauvres seront considérés comme
non-bénéficiaires et inversement, des ménages non-pauvres qui recevront des transferts. Dans le
premier cas, nous parlerons d’erreur d’exclusion (erreur de type II) tandis que le deuxième cas sera
considéré comme des erreurs d’inclusion (erreur de type I). A partir de cet ensemble de possibilités,
nous définirons les concepts suivants :



11Étant donné que la relation (1) est estimée sur une mesure de dépenses des ménages, cette le calcul de l’équation PMT
sera basé uniquement les données de l’EDAM3. Par contre, les coefficients servant au calcul de l’équation (2) seront
appliqués sur toutes les données, autant de l’EDAM3 que du RGPH 2009.

      •   Taux de fuite (leakage) : E2/M1*100

      •   Taux de sous-couverture (undercoverage) : E1/N1*100

Ainsi, dans notre recherche de la meilleure fonction PMT, nous chercherons à minimiser à la fois le
taux de fuite et le taux de sous-couverture. Autrement dit, nous chercherons à maximiser les cas de
ciblage réussi.

Résultats
A partir du questionnaire de l’EDAM-3, nous avons défini une série de caractéristiques des ménages
et estimé différents modèles PMT. Les variables utilisées sont définies au tableau A2 en annexe. A
partir de ces variables, nous avons estimé une fonction PMT pour l’ensemble du pays.12 Les résultats
de cette régression se trouvent au tableau A1 de l’annexe. Avec un R2 de 0,67, nous sommes heureux
de constater que le pouvoir explicatif de ce modèle est très élevé et devrait ainsi permettre un meilleur
ciblage. A partir de ce modèle estimé au niveau national, nous avons calculé les taux de couverture,
de sous-couverture et de fuite pour une série de seuils de pauvreté définis comme les bornes
supérieures des différents décile de la distribution de dépenses. Le Tableau 2 montre que si les
autorités décident que les bénéficiaires seront la population sous la médiane des revenus selon la
mesure de bien-être , la formule PMT couvrira 51,7% de la population avec une sous-couverture de
15,4% et une fuite de 18,1%. Cela permettra un ciblage réussi de 66,4%. Ces taux de réussite se
comparent très avantageusement avec les différentes expériences de PMT ailleurs dans les autres pays
en développement. Il est à noter que lorsque le seuil de pauvreté (i.e. le décile) utilisé augmente, plus
faibles seront les erreurs de ciblage.

12 Au lieu d’utiliser un modèle de régression unique pour l’ensemble du pays, nous avons aussi estimé trois modèles distincts

selon le milieu de résidence : Djibouti-ville, autres zones urbaines et zones rurales. Il est possible de montrer que les
résultats sont très semblables. Étant donné que l’utilisation de trois systèmes de pondérations différents rendrait la logistique
beaucoup plus lourde sans une amélioration significative du ciblage, nous suggérons fortement l’utilisation d’un modèle
unique.

La ventilation de nos résultats selon le milieu et la région de résidence (Tableau 36) montre que la
couverture d’un programme ciblé sera beaucoup plus grande en milieu rural qu’en milieu urbain. Si
on suppose que 20 ou 40 pourcent (i.e. le premier ou le deuxième quintile) de la population nationale
serait ciblé, la couverture serait presque complète (respectivement 80 et 94 pourcent) en milieu rural
tandis qu’elle serait de 11 et 34 pourcent en milieu urbain. En particulier les cas de fuite (i.e. les
ménages bénéficiaires qui n’auraient pas dû l’être) serait minimisé

Questionnaire du recensement à venir

Étant donné que cette fonction PMT a été construite à partir des données de l’enquête EDAM3, il est
nécessaire que la formulation des questions dans le recensement nécessaire à la construction du
Registre unifié des pauvres soit la même que dans l’enquête EDAM3. Les questions nécessaires sont
les suivantes:

     •     Région de résidence (question IM01 dans le questionnaire EDAM3)
     •     Age et sexe des membres du ménage (I02 & I04)
     •     Éducation du chef de ménage (E05)
     •     Éducation de la conjointe du chef (E05)
     •     État matrimonial du chef (E07)
     •     Matériaux des murs (CL02)
     •     Matériaux du toit (CL03)
     •     Matériaux du plancher (CL04)
     •     Source d’énergie pour l’éclairage (CL07)
     •     Principale source d’eau (CL09)
     •     Type de toilettes (CL14)
     •     Possession d’un téléphone portable (P03)
     •     Possession d’un poste radio (P05)
     •     Possession d’un téléviseur (P06)
     •     Possession d’un réfrigérateur (P09)
     •     Possession de camelins (P31A)
     •     Possession de bovins (P31B)

Conclusion

L’efficacité du ciblage dépend beaucoup du pouvoir explicatif de la fonction PMT. Avec le R2 très
élevé obtenu pour la régression multivariée à la base de la fonction PMT (Annexe A1), il est attendu
que nous avons un haut taux de précision qui nous donne espoir qu’un ciblage basé sur cette
spécification sera efficace.

                   Annex 4: Survey of Variable Costs OF Passenger Road
                                      Transportation


A survey of passenger road transportation vehicles was carried out in Djibouti-ville during April 2014
with the objective of providing a breakdown of variable costs of running these vehicles. The share of
fuel costs in variable costs was required to estimate the passing on of an increase in diesel prices that
would be brought about by the removal of the discretionary tax element in these prices. The survey
was designed and administered by the DISED.

Fifty vehicles were surveyed, of which 26 respondents were the owners (propriétaire) and 24 were
employees (employé). The vehicles were of four types: 18 buses, 12 mini-buses, 10 taxis (berline),
and 10 land cruisers. The average age of these vehicles was 5.3 years. Urban routes were serviced by
58 percent of these vehicles and various interurban routes by the other vehicles. Only one vehicle
used gasoline (super) as a fuel, while all the rest used diesel (gasoil). The average daily fuel
consumption was 54 liters.

A number of questions in the survey related to variable costs based over different time intervals. Fuel
costs were given daily, maintenance costs (cleaning, oil change, tire repair, lights, battery, and small
repairs) over a 3-month period, and major replacements and repairs (purchase of tires, batteries) were
given on an annual basis. Other annual costs included license fee (vignette), insurance, and other
taxes. All these have been converted into daily equivalents and are shown in Table 1. Fuel costs are
the major component of variable costs accounting for 80 percent of all daily costs.

The shares of fuel costs by type of transportation are shown in Table 2, indicating that fuel costs were
most important for land cruisers and least important for taxis. However, the household expenditure
survey does not indicate the shares of expenditure to various types of passenger transportation, so the
fact that the proportions are similar for all classes of vehicle indicates that using the overall fuel share
of 80 percent would be a reasonable estimate for all classes of vehicle.

Finally, the survey includes information on average daily receipts, distinguishing between periods
when schools were open and periods when schools were closed. Table 3Error! Reference source not

found. indicates that there is a substantial difference in the average daily receipts between days when
schools are open and days when schools are closed. The average daily receipts of DF 18,254 can be
compared to the average daily variable cost of DF 14,380. The difference between the two has to
cover labor costs, depreciation and interest costs on the vehicles, and the entrepreneur’s margin.
