                                          Executive summary
           Thailand’s national initiative on ICT usage in schools was launched in 1995 by the country’s
           National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) under the pilot project known
           as the Thailand School Communication Network (more commonly referred to as ‘SchoolNet’).
           The main objectives of SchoolNet were to network schools inside and outside Bangkok; to
           connect them to the Internet; and to promote the use of the Internet for teaching and learning in
           schools. After operating for eight years, the project was transferred from NECTEC to the Ministry
           of Education (MOE) and served as the foundation for the country’s national education network.

           Experience from SchoolNet Thailand provides useful lessons related to what can be achieved
           by small groups with vision and passion; how to operate without dedicated budget allocations
           from government in the start-up phase; the important role of support from widely respected and
           influential people outside the particular line ministries in starting something new; how to transition
           from a small and dynamic pilot initiative into a large government bureaucracy; and the
           importance of cooperation among related agencies across ministries.

         1. Introduction: Background and context
           Information and communication technologies (ICT), and especially the Internet, have recently
           played an important role in the development of education in many countries around the world.
           In the 1990s, there was a notable ‘digital divide’ in access to ICTs in schools across Thailand,
           especially between schools in Bangkok and those in rural areas. Students in rural areas did not
           have access to the Internet. As part of larger efforts to reduce various gaps across the education
           system, efforts to promote equitable access to the Internet gained increasing prominence.

           Thailand’s national information technology (IT) policy called for the promotion of ICT use in
           education and human resource development to increase the country’s national competitiveness.
           To be aligned with the policy, in 1995 the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center
           (NECTEC), under the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) of
           Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MOSTE), launched a new pilot project: the
           Thailand School Communication Network. More commonly known as ‘Schoolnet’, this initiative
           sought to promote Internet connectivity in schools so that teachers and students could access
           and utilize the Internet in support of their teaching and learning practices.

           There were four main areas of activity under the SchoolNet project. First, Schoolnet connected
           schools to the Internet and promoted Internet usage through the development of free operating
           software known as Linux School Internet Server (Linux-SIS). Second, the development ICT skills
           among personnel in educational institutes was supported. During the early stages of Schoolnet,
           human resource development was considered to be of critical importance, and NECTEC
           supported various efforts to for staff to develop related skills, through efforts such as its
           cooperation with Rajabhat Institutes to provide training courses. Third, digital learning resources
           were developed. At that time, there were few such resources available in Thai. Teachers were
           encouraged and supported to develop and share educational content through the network. A
           new digital library was created to serve as a knowledge resource, providing material in ten
           academic subject areas. NECTEC also developed the Digital Library Toolkit to help teachers to
           create their own websites. Fourth, NECTEC developed the website of SchoolNet to be the focal
           point for schools to share information, data, news, opinions and to provide solutions for technical
           problems in order to facilitate knowledge exchange across the network.

           According to UNDP’s Human Development Report 2001 and APEC’s New Economy Report
           2001, SchoolNet was considered as best practice in promoting ICT in education. In spite of the
           limited budget from the government, SchoolNet provided internet access to 5,000 schools
           nationwide during 1995-2003.

           In 2003, responsibility for SchoolNet was transferred to the Ministry of Education (MOE) as part
           of the effort to develop the national education network (known as EdNet), merging and
           expanding SchoolNet with the national university network (UniNet) and MOE education
           management network (MoENet). EdNet aimed to provide internet access to 34,000 educational
           institutes nationwide at all levels, including schools.

         2. The development of SchoolNet Thailand
           In alignment with Thailand’s eighth national economic and social development plan (1997-2001)
           and the country’s first national ICT policy (IT 2000), SchoolNet was launched in 1995 by
           NECTEC to be a pilot project for promoting the ICT usage in education. This project aimed to
           upgrade the education level of Thai students through access to self-learning resources from
           various knowledge sources around the world and to become a communication tool enabling the
           exchange of knowledge among teachers and students. The development of SchoolNet can be
           classified into four general stages.

           First stage (1995-1997): Introduction of IT in schools

           In 1995, the Thai Social/Scientific Academic Research Network (ThaiSARN), a project under
           NECTEC, expanded the Internet connection it provided from higher education to secondary
           education in order to promote the use of the Internet in secondary schools. Initially, ten
           secondary schools were targeted. Later, and in alignment with the national IT policy (IT2000)
           approved in 1996, the scale of Internet use in secondary schools in Thailand was expanded.
           The name of the project was changed to SchoolNet, with the target of 50 participating schools
           in 1996, and 120 schools nationwide in 1997. Under this project, an Internet server was set up
           under the name of “k12.nectec.or.th” (or “k12”). Each school was allocated two Internet accounts
           and five MB data storage. In addition, training courses about Internet usage and web page
           creation were provided to teachers. Schools could connect to the Internet by using a dial-up
           modem, connecting to 39 phone lines (later increased to 120 phone lines). No budget was
           allocated by government to support these activities and, given that a number of target schools
           also had no computers, NECTEC asked for support from the private sector to donate hardware
           (such as computers and modems) and operating system software to schools, especially in
           remote areas.

           In this period, SchoolNet faced three major implementation challenges. First, provincial schools
           had to pay a high cost for the long distance call to connect them to the Internet server, which
           was located in Bangkok. Second, some schools did not have computers, modems, and phone
           lines. Third, most educational content on the Internet was in English, and the English language
           ability of most Thai teachers and students was quite limited.

           Second stage (1998-2000): SchoolNet@1509

           In the second stage, the target number of participating schools in SchoolNet was increased to
           1,500 nationwide. Importantly, the national IT committee (NITC) appointed the Sub-Committee
           Coordinating Working Team for Internet use in education as a mechanism to build cooperation
           among three major ministries: the Ministry of Transport (MOT) to provide internet service with
           reasonable cost to schools by Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT) and Communication
           Authorization of Thailand (CAT); the Ministry of Education (MOE) to select qualified schools and
           to provide training on basic internet usage; and the Ministry of Science, Technology and
           Environment (MOSTE) to promote Internet use in education and to prepare guidelines for the
           use of the Internet in schools. Under MOSTE, CAT was responsible for providing Internet
           connectivity. SchoolNet got support from TOT for domestic Internet bandwidth and CAT for
           International internet bandwidth. Participating schools from across the country could connect to
           the Internet by dialing the phone number ‘1509’, paying only the very small cost of three baht
           per connection.

           Three main achievements marked this second phase of activity. First, schools nationwide could
           connect to the Internet network without paying for long distance calls. Consequently, students
           and teachers in schools outside Bangkok could access the Internet for the first time. Second,
           the Digital Library was developed to provide knowledge and useful learning materials in Thai.

                          Building and sustaining national ICT/education agencies: Lessons from Thailand (Schoolnet Thailand)



           Third, Linux-SIS, a free packaged software application, was developed to serve as the
           Internet/Intranet server for schools.

           Third stage (2001-2002): Expansion

           In this period, Schoolnet grew significantly to reach 5,000 schools at the including primary,
           secondary and vocational levels. In addition, SchoolNet shifted its role from network
           development to content development, especially digital learning resources in Thai, as the
           increase of Internet service providers (ISPs) meant that connectivity was widely available at
           much lower costs.

           Fourth stage (2002-2003): Transition from NECTEC to MOE

           The SchoolNet pilot project was formally transferred to the Ministry of Education (MOE) during
           this stage. Under the MOE, the Bureau of Information Technology of the Office of Permanent
           Secretary was responsible for managing this project. There were four groups directly in charge
           of project operation and implementation: the planning and policy group, responsible for training;
           the network and technology group, responsible for network and hardware; the system
           development group, responsible for providing software such as Computer Assisted Instruction
           (CAI) and database management software.; and the information group, responsible for data
           about schools.

           During this period, network coverage expanded to 38,000 schools nationwide. Later, the
           project’s name was officially changed to the Education Network Service (EdNet).

           Key players in SchoolNet Thailand

           Cooperation among a number of related agencies was of critical importance to the development
           of SchoolNet. In particular, as the secretariat office of the national IT committee (NITC) under
           the umbrella of NITC, NECTEC cooperated with TOT to get support for domestic Internet
           bandwidth, with CAT for support of international internet bandwidth, and with the MOE to select
           qualified participating schools and provide training. Under NITC, there was Sub-Committee
           Coordinating Working Team for Internet usage in education. Its major tasks were classified into
           three dimensions: network, content and human resource development. For the network task, the
           working team members included NECTEC, CAT and TOT; content coordinated by MOSTE; and
           human resource development activities were handled by both MOE and MOSTE, with MOSTE
           responsible for public relations and identifying agencies to receive, while the MOE was
           responsible for cooperation with Rajabhat Institutes to provide trainers. Some problems with
           collaboration ensued as, in practice, MOSTE and MOE worked separately and uncoordinatedly
           in many cases. NECTEC therefore took on an unofficial role in searching for educational
           supervisors and teachers to be volunteers to support the core tasks, such as providing solutions
           about basic network and Internet usage problems.

         3. Challenges in the implementation of SchoolNet
            Thailand
           SchoolNet faced six major implementation challenges:

           1.   The MOE did not formulate a clear policy on ICT in education.

           As a result, school administrators did not realize, and were not aware of, the importance of ICT
           use in education. Consequently, when teachers faced problems, such as having no modem or
           computer, high phone costs, and no direct phone line to connect the internet, they did not get
           help or support from principals to help solve such problems. NECTEC stepped in and tried to
           solve such problems by asking for assistance from various other groups, brokering hardware
           donations from the private sector and network support from CAT and TOT. With the passage of
           the National Education Act of 1999, things improved considerably, as Chapter 9 under this Act
           focused on technology for education. This helped to build the awareness of using ICT in
           education for executives in MOE and schools.

           2.   Network infrastructure was not accessible equitably in different areas of Thailand.

           In the beginning of the project (1995-1997), ICT usage was very costly. At that time, there were
           few Internet Service Providers (ISPs), most of which were located in major provinces. Those
           wishing to connect to the Internet from schools in small provinces or remote areas had to pay
           the high cost of long distance call. This led to the development of a ‘digital divide’ between
           schools in major provinces and rural areas.

           3.   Some schools had difficulty connecting to the Internet through phone lines.

           Some schools were in remote areas so they did not have phone lines. Others -- especially small
           schools -- had only 1-2 phone lines dedicated for use by the school administration. This meant
           that they did not have a direct phone line to connect to the Internet; they often experienced
           frequent disruptions in their Internet connections as well.

           4.   Content on the Internet was of limited practical use in education.

           During the first era of Internet use in Thailand, most content was in English, and thus it was
           difficult for teachers to use this content in their teaching. Later, more content was developed in
           Thai, but most of this was created for entertainment purposes, not for education. As a result,
           teaching and learning content meant to be used for educational purposes was very limited.

           5.   Teachers lacked the skills and experience to use ICT in education.

           Most teachers did not have the necessary skills to be able to use the Internet, let alone use ICt
           in support of their pedagogical practices. Some teachers had a very high workload, so they
           thought that they did not have time to learn how to use new technologies. Some teachers had
           difficulties in understanding English – the predominant language of the Internet at that time –
           which further complicated their efforts to use the Internet. Sometimes teachers simply were not
           aware of what was available on the Internet, and so were note motivated to use the new
           technologies provided to them.

           6.   Resource management in schools did not maximize the efficiency of computer and network usage.

           Network administration in schools was often not sophisticated enough to maximize available
           bandwidth. There was no integration between computer usage and learning in core academic
           subjects, and limited cooperation among teachers to manage computer labs or computers to be

           used for learning in computer classes and in other subjects. Some schools, it should be noted,
           did not have enough budget to purchase computers and other related equipment.

           SchoolNet tried to solve these sorts of problems in a number of ways. To solve the network
           problem related to the high cost of a long distance call, SchoolNet got support from Her Royal
           Highness Princess Sirindhorn to allow for the merging of the SchoolNet with the Kanchanpisek
           Network (an online mass-educational project) so that a large-scale nationwide IP network called
           SchoolNet@1509 could be established. This provided one telephone number (‘1509’) which
           users nationwide could use to access the network at low cost. To deal with the problem of limited
           content to be used for learning in schools, SchoolNet developed prototype digital learning
           content as part of a “Digital Library” and a Digital Library Toolkit, which helped teachers with
           basic ICT knowledge create and distribute their own contents on the network. NECTEC
           developed Linux-SIS as free software which could help to manage local school networks, and
           distributed this software by CD-ROM, together with related training manuals and courses.

           To help build awareness of the benefits of ICT use in education, SchoolNet organized a number
           of outreach activities, including regional seminars and exhibitions; training courses for teachers
           and student; rewards for outstanding schools, administrators and teachers who promoted ICT
           use in schools; and online initiatives to demonstrate various applications of ICT use in education.

         4. Conclusion and lessons learned
           A number of key lessons can be learned from the development of SchoolNet Thailand.

           The vision of leaders of the project team at NECTEC was a key factor in the birth of
           SchoolNet. NECTEC executives were keenly interested in technology and realized the potential
           benefits of ICT use in education. In addition, passion and personal commitment among
           operating staff can be an important striver of action and success, especially in the early days.
           Most NECTEC executives were university professors and were passionate about education.
           Their interest in connecting schools was an extension of this passion. Consequently, they were
           eager to launch the pilot project to provide Internet connectivity to secondary schools across
           Thailand.

           As the secretariat of the national IT committee, NECTEC operated the project by seeking
           cooperation from related agencies, such as TOT, CAT and MOE. At that time, NECTEC also
           oversaw the existing project of Thai Social/Scientific Academic Research Network (ThaiSARN),
           which was Internet network for higher education. The experience of operating ThaiSARN project
           helped NECTEC to expand the Internet connection network from higher education to secondary
           education. In addition to executives, NECTEC staffs were capable and eager to operate the
           project successfully, in spite of very limited budget and personnel.

           The creation and implementation of SchoolNet without an allocated budget from the
           government during 1996-2000 demonstrates that a lack of dedicated funds need not
           imperil a project of this sort, provided that people are able to be creative. SchoolNet did
           not get supporting budget from the government until 2001, because the budget bureau
           considered that it was not the main responsibility of NECTEC to promote the ICT usage in
           schools. Accordingly, NECTEC had to find its own ways to support the projects. The
           organization structure of NECTEC and its internal budgeting practices were flexible enough to
           give space for staff to allocate and manage the internal budget and resource to operate
           SchoolNet. To minimize costs, the network resources for the project were shared with the
           Kanchanapisek network and the ThaiSARN network. In addition, NECTEC got financial support
           from other groups, such as the private sector for equipment and TOT and CAT for the network.

           High level support from a widely respected and influential people outside the particular
           responsible line ministries (MOE and MOT) was a key to success. The support of Princess
           Sirindhorn was particularly notable and important in attracting partners to the initiative (like TOT
           and CAT), as well as helping to instill a sense of pride among key staff working on the project.

           In the early stages, the absence of related government policies provided space for groups
           to pilot new initiatives and try new things. NECTEC had done a connectivity project in higher
           education, and then decided that it would do something similar for schools. Although it had no
           mandate to do this, there was nothing preventing it from doing this either. As a national agency
           for education development, the MOE was not involved in the beginning, largely because there
           was no governing government policy. In addition, when Schoolnet Thailand was conceived and
           rolled out, the MICT did not exist (it was established in 2002) or was only in its early stages of
           operation. This meant that the conception and early implementation of SchoolNet was largely a
           result of decisions by NECTEC itself.

           The transition from a small and dynamic pilot initiative housed within a small institution
           into a large government bureaucracy (like the MOE) can be difficult and needs to be
           managed carefully. Once a governing government policy was in place, the functions of
           Schoolnet were transferred from NECTEC to the MOE. The MOE did not set up a separate
           dedicated structure to mirror what had been established within NECTEC. Transferring of “soft
           lessons”, focusing on content and developing human capacity, might not occur naturally,
           especially where responsibilities were transferred, but staff were not. Having a program

           overseen and implemented by a small group like those working on the Schoolnet project at
           NECTEC meant that there was focus. This focus, however, can be difficult to maintain when
           responsibilities are transferred to a large governmental ministry, which has a multitude of other
           priorities, and whose staff may not have the same types of backgrounds and expertise and/or
           who may have other responsibilities as well.

           To expand and ‘scale up’ a project of this sort, cooperation among related agencies is
           necessary. To enable this in Thailand, the joint working committee for ICT in education was set
           up, consisting of representatives from MOT, MOE, and MOSTE. Timing can be of critical
           importance here: If this is established too late, it may be difficult to create the necessary level of
           partnership for an effort like this to be developed and sustained over time.
