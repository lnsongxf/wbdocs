of these DH systems are municipally owned and have limited access to adequate investment

operate at the state level and in three entities (the Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska, and District
Brcko). In addition to concession laws, both Republika Srpska
and District Brcko have adopted PPP laws, and the Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina is planning to adopt one in early
2016. There is no PPP law on the national level. The result is
a rather complex system of concession/PPP regulation, with

With respect to PPP in the municipal sector, the law allows
it, the regulatory structure is in place, and the government
officially supports it. However, the sector is sensitive due
to social concerns, and there is limited municipal capacity

In Serbia, the new 2011 PPP law is in compliance with
international best practice. A PPP unit has been established
in the Ministry of Finance, a practical guide and template
Heads of Agreement has been published, and the PPP
unit has provided positive opinion on 21 new PPP projects,
including two small heating projects. However, there is a
general lack of successfully implemented PPP projects to
date, and three smaller-scale projects in the DH sector failed
due to inadequate cost recovery, as cost-covering tariffs
were not implemented and the assets were reverted to the

This complication challenges potential investors to refer to
legislative acts, which are contradictive in specific cases.
Moreover, several different bodies are involved in the

requests various decisions and approvals of responsible

Municipal ownership of the DH companies and political
concerns about affordability, however, seem to prevent
tariffs from reaching cost-recovery levels. The sector is
burdened by the high costs of imported fuel. In spite of
subsidies, the companies frequently lack funding for fuel
and run at low operational levels, with many off days during
the heating season, which results in low credibility and low
revenue collection. A new 2014 law enabling the blocking of

SERBIA	
In Serbia, the Ministry of Energy and Mining has taken over
responsibility for the DH sector, which is now covered in
the Energy Strategy. The regulator will define a common
methodology for tariffs, but municipalities still approve
heat tariffs. The Law on Energy includes feed-in tariffs for
electricity produced by CHP, renewable energy sources, and
waste incineration; renewable-based heat-only generation
is not covered under the Law. The heating sector in Serbia
is illustrated in Figure 12 for the municipally owned Belgrade
DK company, which encompass both heat generation and
distribution.

ROLE OF REGULATOR	
Table 4 provides an overview of the role of the sector
regulator in the six countries.




         Table 4. The Role of the Regulator

          Country            Role of Sector Regulator
                             Regulation of electricity generation, distribution, and supply is implemented by separate entities; however,
          Bosnia and         none of these entities have regulatory oversight of the DH sector. The regulation of DH is in practice
          Herzegovina        exercised through municipal/canton ownership in accordance with the responsibilities allocated to them by
                             laws on local self-governance.
                             The regulator establishes heat tariff methodologies (without setting the specific tariff levels) and approves
                             the tariffs proposed by the DH companies. The regulator issues licenses for carrying out energy activities
                             and rulings on granting the status of eligible producers. Note that heat and electricity generation are
          Croatia
                             commercial activities rather than public services, in contrast to where a concession is given. Independent
                             heat and/or power production would require an authorization from the Ministry of Economy as well as a
                             production license from the regulator.
                             The regulator grants licenses, establishes heat tariff methodologies, and approves tariffs for regulated
                             energy services. The regulator also grants permits for the construction and operation of new generation
                             capacity. The regulator prescribes the general conditions for energy supply and the standards of service to
                             be met by the licensees, and resolves disputes among customers and energy enterprises, system operators,
          Kosovo
                             and energy enterprises, as well as between generators. Furthermore, the regulator issues general acts,
                             individual acts, and secondary legislation in accordance with the Law on Energy Regulation; revises,
                             approves, and controls compliance with all codes (including the grid and distribution code) as well as all
                             technical rules; enforces the provision of the Law on Energy Regulation; and imposes fines for violations.
                             The regulator sets the terms and conditions to obtain a license, issues licences, establishes the
          Mongolia           methodology to determine heat tariffs, defines the structure of tariffs, and reviews, approves, and publishes
                             tariffs of licensees.
                             The regulator approves prices for electricity and gas and is responsible for the grid code. The DH sector is
                             a municipal responsibility, but in general the role of the regulator is expected to increase with the opening
          Serbia             of the natural gas market and increased focus on renewable energy. The local assembly will, however, still
                             have the final approval responsibility for tariffs, and municipalities will retain operational responsibility for
                             the DH sector.
                             In August 2014, a National Energy and Communal Services Regulatory Commission (NECSRC) was
                             established as an independent regulator for the larger DH utilities, and it presently regulates the 227 largest
                             DH utilities. NECSRC’s main responsibilities include issuing licenses and regulating tariffs for generation,
                             transmission, and supply of heating and hot water supply services. In addition, the regulator is responsible
                             for approving the investment programs of utilities, monitoring them through review of their annual and
                             quarterly reports, and controlling compliance with the license conditions. NECSRC’s current work program
          Ukraine
                             includes increasing all of the mentioned tariffs to a full cost-recovery level and eliminating cross subsidies
                             among the public, budget organizations, and other customers. However, NECSRC is in a challenging
                             position because of the significant increase in natural gas prices, the non-cost-recovery tariffs of DH
                             utilities for the public, and the reduced affordability for end-users due to the current political situation in
                             Ukraine. One of NECSRC’s current priorities is to stimulate utilities to switch to alternative fuels and reduce
                             gas dependence.

renewable sources. The incentives are backed in all countries
by interconnection policies that provide CHP and renewables
with transparent and consistent interconnection procedures
for selling the generated electricity to the grid. Some
countries also have market-based mechanisms (such as a
requirement for new capacity to be CHP, status of privileged
producer, and Certificates of Origin ).

Table 10. Country-Specific Recommendations

Country                  Key Recommendations


                         Due to complex administrative structures and a high degree of decentralization,
                         a multitude of legal acts regulates PPP transactions. PPP models are split into
                         different sets of acts and are regulated by different regulatory authorities. The
                         legal space regulating PPPs needs internal harmonization, with key principles
                         consolidated within a single document at the national and entity (Federation
                         of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska) levels. The country should set
                         clear and uniform PPP policy with regard to all PPP models and provide clear
                         division of competences between PPP and other country legal acts (for example,
                         Public Procurement Law). Establishing a single regulatory body in each entity for
                         concessions and other forms of PPP is also recommended.

                         The legal framework related to the DH sector is incomplete. The country lacks
                         an Energy Strategy, a District Heating Sector Strategy, and a national legal
                         document regulating key principles of the DH sector. A Law on Thermal Energy
                         is in preparation in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina; however, a more
                         coherent framework regulating DH sector operation in both entities and at the
Bosnia and Herzegovina   national level needs to be established.

                         In selected utilities, tariffs do not cover the costs of operation and investments,
                         although the methodology formally allows inclusion of all costs. Concerns
                         about affordability and social burden are frequently given as the reason for not
                         adjusting tariffs to the proper level. There is a need for legal and regulatory
                         enforcement of the tariff-setting and approval process. One option could be
                         to establish a single regulator in each entity or ideally a national regulator.
                         The methodology of tariff calculation also needs revision to take into account
                         the need for substantial investment in DH infrastructure, and corresponding
                         adjustments in the tariff-setting methodology.

                         Various social assistance plans exist, but they are not uniformly applied. In some
                         administrative units, funds are paid directly to customers, whereas in others
                         they are allocated to the monthly invoice or to companies. Both entities need
                         to revise their existing household social assistance plans to allow low-income
                         families to receive direct targeted household subsidies. The program should be
                         imposed uniformly across all municipalities and cantons.

Country   Key Recommendations

          Croatia has had some PPP experience, and several projects are under
          procurement or in the pipeline. Apart from the Zagreb airport, all recent projects
          are in the building sector. However, AIK (previously AJPP) and CEI expect that
          there may be significant potential for PPP projects in the municipal sector. It
          is recommended that AIK identify selected pilot projects in municipal sectors
          where a potential for PPP exists (for example, waste management, street
          lighting, and possibly DH) and that CEI provide project development assistance
          for the pilot projects to demonstrate the viability of PPP projects in municipal
          sectors and facilitate development of sector-specific tender and contract
          templates.

          Approval from AIK and the Ministry of Finance is required for all PPP projects,
          and although the approval procedure has been simplified, the documentation
          requirements may present a barrier for projects that are the first PPP project
          in their sector. The parallel 2012 Concession Act includes less-stringent
          documentation and approval requirements, and the boundary between
          concessions and PPPs is determined on a case-by-case basis . The risk of
          strategic representation of PPP-type concessions as not being of a PPP type
Croatia   in the context of the legislation (for example, to avoid the requirement for
          establishing a Public Sector Comparator) should be recognized. For smaller
          PPP-type concessions at the municipal level, it may be beneficial to relax upfront
          documentation requirements for first-of-a-kind projects or to provide central
          government funding for selected pilot projects to enable the development of
          templates.

          New tariff methodologies recently have been implemented, and the first tariff
          decisions have been made for a number of smaller DH systems. This led to
          tariff increases, which improved the financial viability of DH utilities, taking an
          important step toward cost-reflective heat energy tariffs. The key test will be
          the ability of the state-owned HEP DH (accounting for 6 of the 10 largest DH
          systems and 80 percent of installed capacity) to propose and receive approval
          for rational heat energy tariffs. It is likely that social concerns will continue to
          be a factor in heat energy tariff determination, and there is a risk that such
          concerns may prevent the timely adaptation of cost-reflective tariffs that are
          fully compliant with the regulatory framework. It therefore is encouraged that
          strategies for targeted subsidies that benefit mainly the poorest households be
          considered and implemented.

Country                  Key Recommendations



                         PPP in the municipal sector is allowed by law. The regulatory structure is in
                         place, and the government officially supports it. However, the sector is sensitive
                         due to social concerns, and there is limited municipal capacity for managing
                         PPPs; for DH in particular, there are significant issues related to revenue
                         collection and financial viability that should be addressed prior to private
                         investors being brought in. If the government of Kosovo would like to test PPP
                         in the municipal sector, and in particular in DH, it should consider identifying
                         selected pilot projects; balancing the concerns about affordability of DH services
                         and financial viability through structured, performance-based subsidies from
                         local governments to DH utilities; and seeking international assistance for
                         transaction structuring of the pilot projects.

                         Currently, affordability concerns are being addressed through blanket subsidies
                         that benefit all connected households. Strategies for targeted subsidies that
                         benefit mainly the poorest households should be considered.

                         At the end-user level, an inadequate framework for organizing multi-apartment
Kosovo
                         buildings may limit energy efficiency initiatives, as no entity is responsible
                         for common building installations. New legislation is under preparation at
                         the time of this writing that may promote the establishment of Housing
                         Administrations that would take over heat metering and system maintenance at
                         the substation level. Based on metered consumption of heat, the DH company
                         would prepare invoices (bills) for each substation, which are sent to the Housing
                         Administration (as a result, the DH company would receive payment from
                         the Housing Administration). Meanwhile, the Housing Administration would
                         prepare separate invoices for consumers—individual apartment owners—
                         based on the heated area (or according to calculations by means of heat
                         allocators), plus typically an extra charge for the housing service. Considering
                         the technical design of DH secondary systems in multi-apartment buildings,
                         and the importance of safe and secure operation for reliable heat supply, the
                         Administrator could engage a third party for operation, maintenance, and repair
                         of the substation. The third party could be a district heating utility under a
                         special service contract or any other specialized private company.




                                              30
Country    Key Recommendations

           The policy framework for PPP is in accordance with international best
           practice, but only one PPP project had reached financial close at the time of
           this writing. The lead agency role for PPP has moved several times in recent
           years, reducing continuity. The lead agency also has limited capacity to
           support the development and implementation of PPP transactions, and some
           ongoing transactions are implemented with limited transaction advisory. It is
           recommended that the government of Mongolia consider attracting financial
           resources and management expertise for utility services such as DH through
           a long-term contractual PPP. This could be promoted through establishment
           of a pipeline of selected PPP pilot/demonstration projects and attraction
           of international support for transaction structuring and implementation to
           increase the chance of success.

           In spite of significant fuel subsidies (domestic coal provided at production cost)
           and cross subsidization (between electricity and heat generation as well as
           between commercial and household heat customers), the end-user heat tariffs
           do not cover system operation and maintenance costs and are not adjusted
           to changes in cost basis. Therefore, the DH companies rely on subsidies from
           their owners, and their ability to undertake necessary system renovations and
           expansions is limited. The government of Mongolia should address the issue
Mongolia   of cost recovery in the DH sector. Without a clear and trustworthy model for
           cost recovery and servicing of loans / payback of investments, it will be difficult
           to attract private investment in the DH sector unless a sovereign guarantee is
           provided.

           Currently, affordability concerns are addressed through blanket subsidies
           that benefit all connected households. Comprehensive tariff reform should be
           considered to ensure cost-reflective heat tariffs and targeted subsidies that
           benefit the poorest households.

           In the context of tariff reform, the relation between the heat consumption-
           based tariffs (presently applied at the substation level) and heated area-based
           tariffs (presently applied at the end-user level) should be analyzed, as it appears
           to limit the incentive for switching users to metered billing and thereby the
           promotion of end-user energy efficiency.

           The present tariff approval process limits the ability of the regulator (ERC) to
           approve tariffs that ensure that revenues of licensees are sufficient to support
           their financial viability. It is recommended that ERC consider engaging in a
           dialogue with the country’s Fair Competition for Customers Agency and the
           Customers Rights Protection Agency on approaches to tariff adjustment that
           balance affordability and financial sustainability concerns.

                         The 2011 PPP law is in compliance with international best practice. A PPP
                         unit has been established in the Ministry of Finance, and a practical guide
                         and Heads of Agreement template have been published. However, there is a
                         general lack of successfully implemented PPP projects in municipal services
                         to date. The government of Serbia should consider: developing a pipeline of
                         pilot/demonstration projects for PPP in municipal services (including DH);
                         addressing the inevitable conflict between affordability concerns and financial
                         viability upfront through structured, performance-based subsidies from local
                         governments to DH utilities; and seeking international assistance for transaction
                         structuring of the pilot projects.

                         continue to be a significant determinant in municipal approval of tariffs. An
                         independent approval procedure (for example, by the regulator) would be
                         likely to provide a better framework for ensuring the financial viability that is
                         necessary for development of the sector.

                         The Ministry of Energy and Mining has taken over responsibility for the DH
                         sector, and the DH sector will now be a part of the Energy Strategy. The
                         implementation program to be prepared after the adoption of the new Energy
                         Strategy for Serbia should explicitly consider private sector participation in the
                         continuous modernization and extension of existing DH systems, as well as in
                         relation to fuel switching (increasing the use of biomass, municipal waste, CHP)
                         and end-user energy efficiency.

Country   Key Recommendations


          The risk of strategic representation of projects as concessions rather than as
          PPPs in order to avoid the formal requirement under the PPP Law should be
          recognized. For smaller PPP-type concessions at the municipal level, it may
          be beneficial to relax upfront documentation requirements for first-of-a-kind
          projects or to provide central government funding for selected pilot projects to
          enable the development of templates.

          The PPP law could be strengthened in several areas to improve its role in
          regulation of PPP-type projects and to reduce ambiguity. In the context of the
          PPP Law, it should be considered to distinguish real PPP projects from other
          projects; eliminate inconsistencies between the PPP Law and other laws;
          improve regulation of relationships resulting from land allocation for PPP
          purposes; expand application of competition procedures for selection of private
          partners; introduce effective mechanisms and forms of state support for a PPP
          project; clearly define competencies of national and local authorities regarding
Ukraine   their roles in PPPs and in the analysis of the effectiveness of a PPP arrangement;
          and introduce additional guarantees for a private investor.

          Renewable energy sources and CHP could provide important contributions to
          increased energy supply security for Ukraine. It is recommended that support be
          provided for development of the biomass / solid waste supply chain and market
          to facilitate a switch from dependence on imported gas to alternative domestic
          fuels. High-efficiency cogeneration should continue to be promoted in the
          interest of efficient use of the fuel sources. Hence, the government of Ukraine
          should ensure that CHP is an integral part of the renewable energy action plan.

          End-user energy efficiency can be promoted through ESCOs, but, according
          to the Energy Efficiency Agency of Ukraine, the current subsidy policy targets
          end-users and may limit the opportunities for ESCOs. It is recommended that
          legal and incentive barriers to the use of ESCOs in Ukraine are assessed further
          to enable the testing of ESCOs as a means of implementing end-user energy
          efficiency investments.

4.1 Overview of the DH Sector

The review conducted of selected DH systems in the six
countries has confirmed a substantial investment need and
opportunity in the sector in relation to continued network
improvements to reduce heat and water losses, switch to
cleaner fuels, shift to efficient CHP production, utilize waste
heat, and make energy efficiency investments at the end-
user level. A conservative assessment of the immediate
investment needs in the DH systems reviewed is provided in
the overview Table 15 and sums to $1.5 billion.


Table 15 summarizes key aspects of the DH sector in the six
countries.
