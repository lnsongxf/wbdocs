I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Honduras
        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Honduras regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Honduras;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Honduras;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Honduras;
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Honduras.
       Use data to help inform Honduras country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In May-June 2013, 300 stakeholders of the World Bank in Honduras were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of a minister; office of a Parliamentarian;
employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/
contractors working on World Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units
(PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based organizations; the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and other
organizations. A total of 130 stakeholders participated in the survey (43% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned them accordingly. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Honduras; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the
World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge and research; working with the
World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Honduras; and the Bank’s communication and
information sharing in Honduras.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Honduras: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Honduras is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, and whether they think the Bank is effectively
   investing to support these priorities.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Honduras, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Honduras solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, the most effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Honduras, with which stakeholder groups the
   Bank should collaborate more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow
   reform efforts.

II. Methodology (continued)
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Honduras, the extent to which the
   Bank meets Honduras’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across sixteen development areas, such as education, anti-
   corruption, job creation/employment, and crime and violence.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge and research, to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s
   knowledge and research, including how significant of a contribution it makes to development
   results and its technical quality, and to rate how effective the Bank is at providing linkage to
   non-Bank expertise.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Honduras’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Honduras: Respondents were asked to indicate what
   the Bank should do to make itself of greater value, what would be the most valuable ways the
   Bank could support Honduras’s efforts to see through pro poor growth, and what would be
   the most valuable ways the Bank could support the country’s efforts to decrease the levels of
   crime and violence in Honduras.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank,
   that the Bank’s websites are easy to navigate and useful, and that the Bank is responsive to
   information requests. Respondents were also asked to indicate what connection they
   primarily use when visiting a Bank website, whether they use/have used the Bank’s Public
   Information Centers (PICs) in Honduras, and whether they find the Bank’s PIC a valuable
   source of information related to the development in Honduras.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Honduras, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 138 respondents (46% response rate) who completed the survey
in FY 2004. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, respondents from bilateral agencies and multilateral agencies were
        combined; respondents from PMUs were combined with consultants/contractors working
        on Bank-supported projects; respondents from the financial sector/private banks were
        combined with those from the private sector; respondents from private foundations,
        NGOs, community-based organizations (CBOs), and trade unions were combined into a
        new category “CSO”; and the few respondents from the office of a parliamentarian, local
        government offices, independent government institutions and other organizations were
        included in the “Other” category. There were no respondents from the Office of t he
        President, Prime Minister, faith-based groups, or judiciary branches.

Familiarity with the World Bank

       Familiarity with the World Bank in Honduras received a mean rating of 5.5 across all
        respondents, which is significantly lower than the mean level of familiarity received in
        the FY ’04 country survey (6.6).
       Employees of the Office of Minister had the highest levels of familiarity with the Bank
        whereas respondents from CSOs and academia/research institutes/think tanks had
        significantly lower levels of familiarity.
       Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Honduras and significantly,
        moderately correlated with perceptions of the Bank’s relevance to Honduras’s
        development and the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Honduras.

       There were two instances in which there were statistically significant stakeholder group
        differences across sixteen areas of development. Respondents from the office of minister,
        PMUs, and consultants/contractors working on Bank projects gave the highest ratings for
        the Bank’s effectiveness at “anti-corruption” and “transport,” whereas respondents from
        the CSOs and academia/research institutes/think tanks gave significantly lower
        effectiveness ratings.

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Honduras, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-four specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Honduras. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at monitoring and evaluation;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at transport;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at energy; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at public financial management.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Honduras, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at nutrition;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at education;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at transport;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at social protection; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development.

development in Honduras or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following

development in Honduras. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in Honduras. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the
