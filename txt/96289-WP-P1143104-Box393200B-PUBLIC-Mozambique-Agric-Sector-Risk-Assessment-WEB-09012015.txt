EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Agriculture plays a key role in the economy of Mozambique. It accounts for 31.8 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP), providing a livelihood to almost 81 percent of the
labor force. The majority of production undertaken by smallholder families is for con-
sumption, and the main staple crops produced in the family agricultural sector are
maize, sorghum, rice, millet, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, and beans. Cash crops
frequently grown by households include cotton, tobacco, copra, cashew nuts, sesame,
sugar beans, sunﬂower, bananas, and sugarcane. Many family farms combine food
crops with a single cash crop. The majority of Mozambican agriculture is rain fed
and therefore very sensitive to climatic conditions. Climate change models indicate an
increased likelihood of extreme weather events such as ﬂood, drought, and cyclones
leading to severe negative impacts on the agricultural sector in Mozambique.

Improved agricultural risk management is one of the core enabling actions of
the Group of Eight’s (G-8) New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. The
Agricultural Risk Management Team (ARMT) of the Agriculture and Environment
Services (AES) Department of the World Bank, at the request of the G-8, conducted
an agricultural sector risk assessment in Mozambique with several goals: to provide
a robust analytical underpinning to the Strategic Plan for the Development of the
Agrarian Sector (PEDSA) and the National Investment Plan for the Agrarian Sector
in Mozambique (PNISA), to incorporate agricultural risk perspective into deci-
sion making, and to build the capacity of local stakeholders in risk assessment and
management.

Figure ES.1 shows the annual percentage growth in agriculture value added and the
impacts of major shocks to the sector. The periods of intense civil war (1985–86 and
1990–92), drought (1994), and ﬂood (2000) resulted in negative growth rates in the agri-
cultural sector. Since 2000, the growth rate has not dipped into negative territory, but
the occurrence of agricultural risk has had an adverse impact on agricultural growth.

The frequent occurrence of agricultural risks creates food aﬀordability and availability
problems for vulnerable rural populations and urban consumers, and results in sudden
spikes in the food insecure population (ﬁgure ES.2).

                               Update: Annual percentage growth in agriculture value added has dropped from 2011 at 5.8 percent to 2 percent in
                               2012 and 3.5 percent in 2013. A drop would be expected to be seen after the large ﬂood of 2015.The ﬁgures that
                               would reﬂect the eﬀect of the ﬂood in 2015 are currently not available.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT
Agricultural risk management is a central issue that Mozambique faces in develop-
ment, and multiple stakeholders have analyzed this challenge, sometimes with diﬀer-
ent terminology and focusing on varying aspects.1 Risk is considered the probability
of harmful consequences or expected losses resulting from interactions between nat-
ural or human-induced hazards and vulnerable conditions.2 This is in comparison
with trends that are longer term or “chronic” patterns (reversible or irreversible) that
provide context for impact on agriculture or constraints that are existing conditions/
bottlenecks that hamper the smooth functioning of the sector and lead to suboptimal
performance. The government of Mozambique has adopted the Strategic Plan for
Agricultural Development ([PEDSA]3 2010–19) that focuses on (i) increasing the avail-
ability of food in order to reduce hunger through growth in small producer produc-
tivity and emergency response capacity; (ii) enlarging the land area under sustainable
management and the number of reliable water management systems; (iii) increasing
access to the market through improved infrastructures and interventions in marketing;
and (iv) improving research and extension for increased adoption of appropriate tech-
nologies by producers and agro-processors.

To help implement PEDSA, in May 2013 the government adopted the PNISA, which
has also been accepted by all the major stakeholders as the roadmap for national
agricultural development. Components of the 2010–19 PEDSA seek to minimize and
mitigate agricultural risks as well as to prepare the sector for dealing with climate
change. There are also World Bank operations of note involved in making the sector
more resilient and improving access to predictive information for farmers and early
warning systems including the ongoing climate change development policy operation

MOZAMBIQUE’S AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM
Agriculture plays a key role in Mozambique’s economy, making up 31.8 percent of
GDP and providing a livelihood to almost 81 percent of the labor force (CIA 2013).
The majority of Mozambican agriculture is rain fed and therefore very sensitive to
climatic conditions.

The agricultural sector in Mozambique is dominated (99 percent) by smallholder farmers
using family labor, most of whom cultivate small plots of land (0.5 to 1.5 hectares [ha]) with
limited inputs and mechanization.5 According to data from the Mozambique Agricultural
Census (TIA) surveys, the total farmer population is estimated at 3.8 million. Producers
were organized into small organizations and forums, although these only accounted for
7.2 percent of farmers in 2008 (Government of Mozambique 2008).

Following the Mozambique civil war, which ended in October 1992, increases in agri-
cultural production have been credited for a reduction in poverty, as people were able
to return to previously abandoned land. Despite the increased use of land for agricul-
tural activity, low productivity is still considered a major constraint on development
(Cungara and Garret 2011).

Mozambique is facing a natural resources boom, and agricultural exports have
declined from 31.4 percent of total export revenue in 2002 to 14.4 percent in 2008
because of large-scale expansion of aluminum and electricity exports (World Bank
2012a). Even so, the agricultural sector remains largely responsible for job creation
and the government and donors alike consider agricultural development as a driving
force for poverty reduction.

AGRO-ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS
The agro-ecological zones in Mozambique include three macro-agro-ecological
zones: northern, central, and southern. These macro-agro-ecological zones are based
on climate, vegetation, altitude, soils, and farming systems.


5
    A national survey in 2007 found that only 4 percent of farmers use fertilizer (FAO/WFP 2010).

These three macrozones, are composed of 10 diverse agro-
ecological zones. They are pictured here in ﬁgure 2.1.
Arid and semiarid zones dominate the south and south-
west, whereas subhumid zones make up the majority of
the center and north, and humid highlands are found pri-
marily in the central provinces (United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization [FAO]/World Food Programme
[WFP] 2010). Agriculture is practiced in all zones, with the
exception of highly arid regions in the south and south-
west part of Gaza province, which are only suitable for
livestock. As noted in appendix B, this is due in particular
to the increased incidence of extreme climatic events. The
impact of climate change, if not addressed, may reverse
progress made in agricultural development.

CHAPTER THREE
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR RISKS
This chapter considers the types of risks that are observed in the agricultural sector
and groups them into three main categories: production, market, and enabling envi-
ronment. This chapter is a synthesis of analysis conducted by the assessment team as
well as detailed review of secondary data. A detailed weather analysis (appendix B)
was conducted to understand weather patterns (deﬁcit and excessive rainfall) and their
impact on crop yields. Appendix C reviews the existing literature on climate change
and appendix D summarizes the vulnerability situation in Mozambique. Detailed com-
modity risk proﬁles highlight principal risks to nine major commodities in appendix E.

PRODUCTION RISKS
The main sources of production risk observed through analysis of data and inter-
views with numerous farmers are drought, ﬂood, cyclone, and pests and diseases.
Figure 3.1 shows the annual percentage of growth in agriculture value added and the
declines that occur around major shocks to the sector. The periods of intense civil war
(1985–96 and 1990–92), drought (1994), and ﬂood (2000) resulted in negative growth
rates in agriculture. Since 2000, the growth rate has not dipped into negative territory,
although it has reﬂected the impact of several critical events (ﬁgure 3.1).

The weather analysis in appendix B provides further information on provincial trends
in rainfall using data from 31 weather stations from January 1979 to December 2009.
The climate is considered humid tropical in the north and on the coast, and dry tropi-
cal in the south and interior (Bay 1997). Soils with good agricultural potential exist in
the north, central, and western parts of the country and those with limited potential
occur in the southern part, in the low plateau (Bay 1997). The rainy season occurs in
November/December and lasts until March/April. Annual rainfall is generally up to
400 mm in the south and central western areas and more than 1,200 mm in the north.


DROUGHT
Drought was observed to be the most important agricultural risk, considered probable
and with catastrophic consequences. An agricultural drought occurs when soil moisture
is signiﬁcantly deﬁcient, resulting in reduced crop yields and output. This can be the

CHAPTER FOUR
QUANTIFICATION OF LOSSES AND IMPACT
OF AGRICULTURAL RISKS
This chapter outlines the conceptual and methodological basis used for analysis and
seeks to quantify the impacts of production risk events. The various sources of risk are
then prioritized on the basis of indicative losses and consideration given as to how to
manage these risks in chapter 5.

CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL
BASIS FOR ANALYSIS
For the purposes of this study, risk is defined as an exposure to a significant
financial loss or other adverse outcome whose occurrence and severity is unpre-
dictable but for which some probability of occurrence can be estimated on the
basis of historical experience. Accordingly, risk implies exposure to substantial
losses, over and above the normal costs of doing business. In agriculture, farmers
incur small losses each year caused by moderately adverse climatic conditions and
fluctuations in output or input prices. Risks discussed here refer to more severe
and unpredictable events.

INDICATIVE QUANTIFICATION OF LOSSES
Available data on actual losses caused by adverse events in Mozambique are not par-
ticularly accurate or consistent within individual data sources. In an attempt to facilitate
comparison and ranking of the costs and losses caused by various events, diﬀerent data

BOX 4.1. CROP LOSSES ACCORDING TO THE AGRICULTURAL CENSUS
  The Mozambique Agricultural Census 2002–07 asked small and medium producers (95 percent of all production in Mozam-
  bique) about the principal cause of crop losses. Figure B4.1.1 takes data from the 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007 surveys.
  It can be clearly observed that lack of rain was the largest cause of loss: over 50 percent for maize, rice, and others. Losses
  attributable to pests and wild animals were lower, although still signiﬁcant at over 10 percent, whereas ﬂoods, excess rain,
  and disease/rot (in other crops) came in at about 5 percent.

CHAPTER FIVE
STAKEHOLDER RISK ASSESSMENTS
How diﬀerent stakeholder groups perceive and manage production risks varies sig-
niﬁcantly depending on the commodity as well as on the priorities and capacities of
individual stakeholders. The importance and character of market risks for individual
stakeholder groups is very much a function of the nature and extent of interaction
with markets. A minority of producers use the market as a source of inputs and an out-
let for their production to any signiﬁcant extent. Almost the entire population depends
on markets to some degree as a source of food. Enabling environment risks also aﬀects
everyone, but again by varying degrees at diﬀerent points in time.

This chapter discusses the impacts of the range of risks described in chapter 3 on the
major stakeholder groups, namely, government, producers, consumers, and the most
vulnerable. Producers are a heterogeneous group that can be diﬀerentiated in several
ways, including size of operations and relationships to markets. The vulnerable can
be considered as components of producer and consumer groups, but are treated sepa-
rately here in recognition of the severity of the impacts of risk-related events on this
segment of the population.

This discussion disaggregates the impacts of the risks presented in chapters 3 and 4 by
stakeholder group indicating which types of risks are most signiﬁcant to each group
as well as how the group is aﬀected. Although there are insuﬃcient data for formal
quantiﬁcation, the results provide additional guidance for the prioritization of risks
and their management, which is the focus of chapter 6. In addition to severity and
frequency of risk-related events, their diﬀerential impacts on stakeholder groups are
considered in the prioritization and management response planning processes.

GOVERNMENT
The impact of agricultural risks is far reaching for governments, particularly when the econ-
omy and livelihoods are agriculturally dependent, and the government of Mozambique is
no exception. Not only does it have to provide ﬁnancing for immediate relief and coping,
it also incurs loss of revenue from the agricultural sector, reduced GDP, and ﬁnancial losses
across the economy. The government has to confront the devastating eﬀects on people’s

CHAPTER SIX
RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Risks for the agricultural sector diﬀer signiﬁcantly from one another not only in their
character, but also in the severity, frequency, and distribution of their impacts on dif-
ferent areas, commodities, and sections of the Mozambican population. Chapter 3
describes the major risks aﬀecting the agricultural sector. Production-related risks,
notably drought and ﬂood, are prominent, but there are also a range of risks associ-
ated with markets and the enabling environment. Chapters 4 and 5 attempt to quan-
tify the losses associated with these major risks and assess their impacts on government
and consumers as well as diﬀerent categories of agricultural producers and service
providers. Special attention has been given to the impacts on the most vulnerable
groups in this process.

The information and analysis in the preceding chapters enable a prioritization of risks
according to the magnitude, frequency, and distribution of the impacts of risk-related
events. However, those results must be matched with measures to more eﬀectively
manage risks to be of use to those aﬀected: individuals, communities, private enter-
prises, and public agencies. There is already an array of programs and activities that
government, businesses, and individual farmers use to manage risks. Consumers man-
age higher prices and limited availability for some commodities by substituting with
others. How eﬀective are these activities and how adequate is their coverage? What are
the options for better managing these risks and which are most feasible to implement
in Mozambique?

This chapter summarizes the approaches and results of the risk prioritization (see
“Risk Prioritization”) and risk management (see “Risk Management”) that are the
focus of this initial phase of the agricultural sector risk assessment study. These ﬁnd-
ings in turn provide the background information for an examination of ways in which
Mozambique can more eﬀectively manage risks. It is important to note that diﬃculties
in accessing good data and information to assess risks were encountered, which may
have aﬀected the prioritization undertaken. Interventions to better manage the risks
prioritized, including access to information, are the focus of a proposed second phase
for this exercise that took place in November 2014.

BACKGROUND
The World Bank is conducting a study of the relationship that several climatic events
have on diﬀerent crop yields for Mozambique. The purpose of the study is to deter-
mine whether yield is aﬀected by climatic events and by how much these events aﬀect it.

A weather database was provided that consists of 31
weather stations spread across the country with data on a
daily basis from January 1, 1979, to December 31, 2009.
The available variables are precipitation, maximum tem-
perature, and minimum temperature. Figure B.2 shows
the geographic distribution of the weather stations.

On a general basis, rainfall follows a clear pattern through-
out the whole country. From November to April rain is
plentiful but is scarce from May to October it. Figure B.3
shows the mean cumulative rainfall per month for all the
stations in each region.

Because of the rainfall pattern described above, the year
is not considered to be the calendar year, but rather the
period from October of the previous year to September
of the next year, in order to consider that rain falls mainly
in the November–March period. Instead of showing
the cumulative rainfall in each year, standardization was

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT
ON AGRICULTURE IN MOZAMBIQUE:
LITERATURE REVIEW

INTRODUCTION
Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change in Mozambique, and the eﬀects
are heterogeneous based on model assumptions and across regions, socioeconomic
groups, and crops and livestock. There are direct impacts, such as changes in crop
yields attributable to precipitation changes, and indirect impacts, such as rising food
prices because of production changes and land tenure conﬂict stemming from shifting
agro-climatic zones. If climate change is left unaddressed, then progress in agricultural
development, food security, and poverty alleviation in general may be reversed.

In the Mapping the Impacts of Climate Change index under “Agricultural Productivity
Loss,” the Center for Global Development ranks Mozambique 85th out of 233 coun-
tries globally for “direct risks” attributable to “physical climate impacts” and 28 out
of 233 for “overall vulnerability” attributable to “physical impacts adjusted for coping
ability” (Wheeler 2011). As agriculture accounts for 31.8 percent of the GDP and 81
percent of the labor force are involved in agriculture, there is great potential for wide-
spread impact (CIA 2013).

Varying impacts, in combination with numerous approaches to impact studies, make
it diﬃcult to generalize the potential eﬀects of climate change on agriculture in
Mozambique. This appendix discusses possible outcomes in the context of agricultural
productivity and yield.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
     » The increase in the likelihood of extreme events caused by climate change, as
       opposed to changes in average temperature or precipitation, may pose the great-
       est threat to agriculture in Mozambique. This includes ﬂooding, drought, and
       tropical cyclones. Risk management therefore becomes increasingly important.

                                          land suitability for sorghum, although in a small section
                                          in the northern inland near Lake Nyasa, a sharp increase
                                          in risk is expected. Similarly, the EACC Mozambique
                                          found little change in yield across scenarios and regions.
                                          Averaged across scenarios and regions, the EACC
                                          Mozambique predicted a 0.51 percent decrease in yield.
                                          Very small changes in yield were noted by the 2012 INGC,
                                          concentrated in Tete. These changes in yields are among
                                          the lowest predicted for various crops.

In Mozambique, negative impacts on agriculture from                       BASED ON THE MEDIAN OF
climate change will primarily be caused by the increased                  ALL SEVEN GCMS
likelihood of extreme events such as cyclones and ﬂood-
ing. However, outside of the expected increase in extreme
events, agriculture in Mozambique will see little change in
land suitability and yield (see ﬁgures C.5 through C.13).

Risk management then becomes increasingly important
as risk incidents increase across the country in a vari-
ety of manifestations. Among other tools, information
systems (such as early warning systems, the disaster risk
database) are paramount to mitigating these risks. Other
risk management instruments noted throughout this
agriculture risk assessment will also be crucial to protect
producers and consumers alike as the uncertainty of cli-
mate change unfolds.

APPENDIX D
VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
The World Bank deﬁnes vulnerability as exposure to uninsured risk, leading to a socially
unacceptable level of well-being. An individual or household is vulnerable if it lacks
the capacity and/or resources to deal with a realized risk. It is generally accepted that
in low-income countries, rural populations are both poor and vulnerable, and that
primary risks to these populations may include climate and market shocks (Sarris and
Karfakis 2006). Vulnerability is a useful lens through which to view shocks, because
it allows for determination of impacts on populations and who will be most aﬀected.
Vulnerability is discussed here particularly in the context of food security.

SETSAN performs identiﬁcation of “vulnerability to external shocks,” measured
through food security (see tables D.1 and D.2). As of 2009, other leading government
bodies mandated with addressing the needs of vulnerable groups were the Ministry of
Women and Social Action (MMAS) and a subordinate institution, the National insti-
tute for Social Action (INAS) (Waterhouse 2009).

DEFINITIONS
SETSAN views vulnerability as “associated with exposure to risks and [it] determines
the susceptibility of people, places, or infrastructures to a particular natural disaster.”
The Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF) deﬁned vulnerability as, a “lack of
defense against adversity (including) . . . exposure to external shocks, tension and risks,
and lack of internal defense, of means to compete without suﬀering serious losses”
(MPF 2000; Waterhouse 2009).

RECENT GENERAL TRENDS
IN VULNERABILITY
     » Sustained high levels of food insecurity
     » “Deepening” of the HIV/AIDS crisis
     » More frequent and severe climate-related events such as drought, ﬂoods, and
       cyclones
     » “Increasing feminization of chronic rural poverty” (Waterhouse 2009)

THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP) IN AGRICULTURAL
INSURANCE FOR FARMERS
Developing a viable PPP in agricultural insurance would require signiﬁ-
cant public investments in data and would probably need to be accompa-
nied by substantial growth in credit or input utilization. Developing a PPP
in agricultural insurance is a long-term objective that requires appropriately sustained
engagement and high levels of investment from both the public and private sectors. In
addition, to achieve sustainability and meaningful uptake, it relies on several key pil-
lars, one of which is an eﬀective distribution channel to rural farmers through which
insurance can be sold. These distribution channels can take many forms, such as rural
lending institutions, input suppliers, or social welfare payment systems. The main dis-
tribution channels in Mozambique currently are rural credit and input suppliers, but
only 2.3 percent of the rural population has access to ﬁnance (World Bank 2012b); 3.7
percent has access to credit (World Bank 2012b); and only 10 percent of maize farm-
ers and 4 percent of rice farmers use improved seeds (Government of Mozambique
2008). These low levels of outreach in eﬀect mean that currently there is not an eﬀec-
tive distribution channel to provide insurance to the vast majority of rural farmers.
Experience from other countries also suggests that signiﬁcant investments in weather,
yield and satellite data collection, and auditing would be required if agricultural insur-
ance products were to oﬀer reliable protection to farmers at low cost. Currently, a very
limited amount of yield data are collected in Mozambique and the weather station
network is limited. Moreover, the audit procedures for these types of data are not in
line with international reinsurance standards.
