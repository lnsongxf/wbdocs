     Box 1. Conceptual framework to analyze the effects of increasing labor
     participation of women in rural roads projects on women’s agency



     For the purposes of analyzing the project activities and approaches in rural transport projects that affected women’s agency,
     we use two conceptual frameworks:
     World Development Report 2012 (WDR 2012)
     The first conceptual framework employed is the WDR 2012 on Gender Equality and Development that helps explain the pro-
     cesses that lead to gender equality and identifies policy areas and policy instruments. The WDR identifies three dimensions
     of gender equality: endowments (inequalities related to education, health and/or physical assets) and economic oppor-
     tunities (inequalities related to jobs, land, and agricultural production, technology, or market access), and agency. Agency
     can be understood as women’s ability to make choices they value and to act on those choices. The WDR defines agency as
     the “process through which women and men use their endowments and take advantage of economic opportunities to achieve
     desired outcomes”. In this regard, women’s agency is not only a dimension of gender equality in itself, but additionally, it
     functions as a catalyzer with regards to other dimensions of gender equality. Given its complexity, agency is inherently difficult
     to measure (World Bank 2014). For cross-country comparisons, the common approach used to measure agency is to use data
     on what people say they do in different domains of life. Such actions are called ‘expressions of agency’. WDR 2012 focused
     on five of its ‘expressions’: women’s access to and control over resources; freedom of movement; freedom from the risk of
     violence; decision making over family formation; and having voice in society and influencing policy.
     The WDR 2012 offers a framework for diagnosing and addressing gender-specific constraints. The framework posits that in
     choosing and designing policies to address the gender gaps of concern, it is necessary to target the determinants of the
     gender gaps of concern, not just the outcomes. The framework identifies four sets of determinants: formal state institutions,
     markets, informal institutions and households, specifically:
     •	 Markets: pertains to the incentives that are largely influenced by markets (including the markets for labor, credit, land, and
        goods), which determine the returns to household decisions and investments. For example, gender-constraints in markets
        are seen in the higher proportions of women than men working in the informal economy, gender segregation in occupa-
        tions, discrimination of women in formal credit markets related to institutional requirements and the type of productive
        activities in which women predominate.
     •	 Formal institutions: pertain to all aspects of the functioning of the state, including laws, regulatory frameworks, and
        mechanisms for the delivery of services that the state provides (such as judicial services, police services, basic infrastruc-
        ture, health, and education). Laws and regulations can constrain women’s agency and opportunities as when women and
        men have different ownership rights, or when restrictions are placed on hours and sectors of work for women but not for
        men. Where credit and labor markets already discriminate, such unequal laws and regulations can accentuate the problem.
        Unequal treatment may also manifest itself more indirectly through biased service delivery, as is the case for agriculture
        extension services.
     •	 Informal social institutions: consist of the mechanisms, rules, and procedures that shape social interactions but do not
        pertain to the functioning of the state, such as gender roles, beliefs, social norms, and social networks. Gender roles provide
        guides to normative behaviors for each sex within certain social contexts. Roles gain power as they are learned through
        socialization, elaborated in cultural products, and enacted in daily life. The repeated experience of performing gender roles
        affects widely shared beliefs about men’s and women’s attributes and one’s own sense of identity. Social norms refer to
        patterns of behavior that flow from socially shared beliefs and are enforced by informal social sanctions. These can affect
        household bargaining in many ways: they set limits on what can be bargained about; they can be a determinant of or con-
        straint to bargaining power; they can affect how bargaining is conducted; and they themselves can be subject to bargaining
        and can change. Social networks refer to the system of social relationships and bonds of cooperation for mutual benefit that
        shape one’s opportunities, information, social norms, and perceptions.
     •	 Households: Households make decisions about how many children to have and when to have them, how much to spend
        on education and health for daughters and sons, how to allocate different tasks (inside and outside the household), and
        other matters that determine gender outcomes. These choices are made on the basis of the preferences, decision-making
        (or bargaining) power, and incentives and constraints of different household members. Preferences can be innate or
        shaped by gender roles, social norms, and social networks. And they may be shared by or differ across individuals within

    the household. For instance, evaluations of transfer programs, such as pensions and conditional cash transfers, show that
    spending decisions differ depending on whether money is given to women or men within the household, suggesting dif-
    ferences in men’s and women’s preferences. Bargaining capacity is determined by two distinct sources of individual power:
    economic and social. Economic bargaining power depends primarily on the wealth and assets each individual controls and
    his or her contribution to total household income, while social bargaining power results primarily from formal and informal
    institutions. For instance, a woman’s capacity to decide how to allocate her time across various activities in and outside the
    household may be weakened by her lack of asset ownership (low economic bargaining power) or by strong social proscrip-
    tions against female work outside the home (low social bargaining power) (World Bank 2012).
The constraints are most severe among women who face other disadvantages, such as being a member of an ethnic minority,
having a disability, or being poor.
The framework graph shows interconnected gears to represent how changes in one or more dimensions propel changes and
moves the household gear. The combined movement of these gears ultimately triggers the turning of the gear representing
gender outcomes, thus increasing gender equality. As the framework suggests, the subcomponents of equality also interact.
The graph also suggests movement going in the opposite direction—that is, with the gender equality gear moving those rep-
resenting households, markets, and institutions and ultimately generating higher economic growth. In this setting, market and
institutional constraints can be thought of as wedges that prevent one or more gears from turning, thereby weakening both
directions of the two-way relationship between economic growth and gender equality.

Internal and external aspects of agency
We complement our analysis with the conceptual framework proposed by Perova and Vakis in their report Improving Gender
and Development Outcomes through Agency (2013). The authors identify two aspects or enablers of agency:
•	 Internal aspect: The internal motivation to make a choice, the willingness to act upon one’s desires.
•	 External aspect: Measures to overcome exogenous constraints (external, or context-related).
The framework is useful for understanding the personal and emotional experiences by individuals. In this regard, it lends
itself for the type of qualitative and subjective exploration of what enables agency and how it can be enhanced. The authors
postulate that in order to successfully improve agency, both of its components-internal and external-should be addressed.
This may happen through a single intervention aimed at both components or through a combination of interventions and or/
enhanced external factors that complement each other

     In this respect, the study has three main objectives:

     •	 To provide fresh evidence and build awareness about
        the effects of gender- targeted activities in rural transport
        projects among policy makers to help garner support
        from key local stakeholders, which may fear resistance
        and backlash of dominant groups at the local level. Un-
        derstanding mechanisms behind impacts is important for
        scaling up and replicating gender approaches in other
        interventions and programs.
     •	 To incorporate lessons learned of gender-targeted activi-
        ties in the design of rural transport projects.
     •	 To provide guidelines and recommendations on how to
        improve gender-targeted activities in the implementation
        of transport projects.

     Following this introduction, the report is structured as fol-
     lows: The second section describes the gender dimensions
     and agency-enhancing approaches in transport projects
     and the gender approaches in project implementation in
     the selected case studies. The third section provides a sum-
     mary of the methodology of the study. The fourth section
     describes the key findings of the qualitative research. The
     fifth section presents the lessons learned to inform future
     rural transport interventions. The sixth section provides
     concluding remarks.

Gender approach in the implementation
      of the selected projects
This section provides an overview of integrating gender issues in transport projects
before describing the approach taken by the selected project case studies in fostering
women’s participation in project implementation.

Box 2. Rationale for addressing gender issues in transport design


•	 Women have disproportionate share of household transport burdens (Blackden 2003; Blackden and Wodon 2006;
   Quisumbing 2003; Priyanthi and Porter 2002).
•	 Women have more limited access to available means of transport (Venter and others 2007; Odufuwa 2007; Srinivasan
   2002).
•	 Men and women have different travel patterns and trip purposes (Anand and Tiwari 2006; Odufuwa 2005; Abidemi
   2002; Rosenbloom 1995; Malmberg-Calvo 1994; Hanson and Hanson 1980).
•	 Women spend more on transport (Kamuhanda and Schmidt 2009; Srinavasan 2002).
•	 Quality, safety, and security concerns (Okoko 2007).

What is the context of how the attention to gender emerged in the IPP of the Argentina Norte Grande Road
Infrastructure Project (2011-2016)?

The World Bank worked with specific champions both within the federal government (executing agency), and in the provincial
road agency in Chaco) on designing gender-specific consultation and communication tools as part of the social management
framework (including the preparation of the IP Plan for the road in Chaco). The Bank team relied on gender experts (both ex-
ternal consultants and internal bank staff) when working on these tools. In addition, the team included specific gender-based
indicators in M&E framework and in the design of an Impact Evaluation Study (currently ongoing) with technical support of
Bank gender and M&E experts. Furthermore, the bidding documents required the contractors to hire a social and indigenous
people’s specialist with strong gender background to manage and supervise the social management plan. The Bank carried
out training sessions for the federal government program implementation unit and provincial road agencies social specialists
on social management (including gender and IP perspectives). During project execution the consultations were carried out
and a communication plan was implemented. As part of this work, the indigenous women requested specific support, i.e.
family planning workshops first, then road safety awareness campaigns in their language for indigenous schools in the area
of intervention. For these activities, the Madres Cuidadoras de la Cultura Qom (Mother Caretakers of the Qom Culture)
were actively involved (as per their own request) in the preparation of the Road Safety awareness/education campaigns,
and in delivering the awareness workshops in these schools). These women also actively participated in the preparation of
environmental protection actions (identification of local fauna and flora for a baseline study that was carried out as mitigation
measure against risks of deforestation) and the identification of cultural heritage sites to be included in the signs along the
road being paved. As part of these activities, Madres Cuidadoras de la Cultura Qom requested support to strengthen their
association, and entrepreneurial skills, which is how the QCR initiative emerged. To design, supervise, and potentiate these
activities, the Bank team contracted a local Indigenous Peoples and gender specialist, who is the director of an NGO based in
Northern Argentina (Fundación Gran Chaco) that is actively involved in social and environmental issues in the Chaco Ecore-
gion. The Bank’s partnership with the NGOs active in the region was a key ingredient to ensure sustainability and successful
launching of the initiative.

What resources were allocated for the QCR initiatives?

•	 Project preparation: The Bank hired a gender expert during consultations and in the design of social management man-
   uals (both within Bank team, and in the Government of Argentina team)
•	 Implementation:
-	 Construction costs of gravel access to schools and women handicraft centers (approximately US$ 80,000)
-	 Construction costs of women community centers (approximately US$ 50,000)
-	 Workshops/mentoring sessions/training sessions: (approximately US$ 25,000)
•	 Monitoring and Evaluation:
-	 World Bank supervision costs on the Bank side (consultant fees, field work and travel costs for anthropologist/gender and
   Indigenous Peoples specialist, including research assistants that participated in the qualitative study) and supervision costs
   borne by the Government (both federal and provincial government) and supervision costs by social specialists in the
   contractors’ teams (two contractors participated in this sub-project).
-	 Impact Evaluation study costs, (approximately US$ 216,000).

     The “Fourth Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project”                    The Peru Decentralized Rural Transport Project (DRTP) (2007-
     approved in May 2006, and the “Rural Roads Infrastructure                    2013) is the third project in a series of rural transport proj-
     Improvement Project” referred to as the Fifth Roads Project,                 ects designed to improve and maintain rural roads, reducing
     approved in December 2011 aim to improving the access of                     transportation costs for local inhabitants and ultimately pro-
     the rural population living to markets and social and admin-                 moting the development of Peru’s poorest communities. In
     istrative services and supporting generation of short-term                   terms of project implementation, the project promotes the
     employment opportunities for the rural population living in                  participation of women in: (i) roads work through their roads
     the project areas. The projects promoted women’s partici-                    committees and roads maintenance microenterprises (Mi-
     pation in community-run modules for laying cobblestones,                     croempresas de Mantenimiento Vial –MEMV), (ii) rural pro-

     nados (MCAs) that perform road upgrading tasks (Box 4).                      (Ventana de Desarrollo Local – VDL).
     Women have been recruited to serve as presidents of the
     MCAs, supervise the works, and act as treasurers, traffic con-
     trollers, pavement joint fillers mostly. Women’s participation6
     in total has been increasing from 10 percent in the original
     6  The share of women participating under the 4th and the AF of the 4th
     was not recorded since the beginning of the implementation. Although sig-
     nificant efforts were made in order to measure female participation in the
     MCAs, this was not a task of the project in itself before 2011.

Box 4. Modulos Comunitarios de Adoquinados (MCAs)


MCAs are local entities formed under the leadership of local mayors with each MCA staffed by a board of 5 directors (with
the president of each MCA as the legal representative) to perform a specific road upgrading task. MCAs join together and use
economies of scale to contract an earthworks contractor and a cobblestones supplier. Individually, each MCA hires its own
local labor in order to construct a specified stretch of road. The MCA personnel receive technical support and training from
MTI from inception, and have an MTI supervisor and promoter accompanying them throughout the implementation process.
Cobblestones are concrete-like paving blocks that are precast in an offsite factory location with the raw materials being ce-
ment, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, filler and water. The MCAs have generated employment opportunities in the short
term, contributing towards technology transfer, building technical skills, and creating a sense of community and ownership
for the roads (Muzira and Hernandez de Diaz 2013).

The current project, Additional Financing of the Fifth Rural Roads Infrastructure Improvement Project (AF V) continues imple-
mentation of the MCA model in rural roads in Nicaragua. Moreover, it will pilot a results-based minor routine maintenance
targeting a total of 75 km on the cobblestones roads by converting MCA members into small micro-enterprises aimed at
making the MCA model more sustainable.

     Box 5. Types of training under MCAs


     MCAs are local entities formed under the leadership of local mayors with each MCA staffed by a board of 5 directors (with
     the president of each MCA as the legal representative) to perform a specific road upgrading task. MCAs join together and use
     economies of scale to contract an earthworks contractor and a cobblestones supplier. Individually, each MCA hires its own
     local labor in order to construct a specified stretch of road. The MCA personnel receive technical support and training from

     ment, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, filler and water. The MCAs have generated employment opportunities in the short
     term, contributing towards technology transfer, building technical skills, and creating a sense of community and ownership

     targeting a total of 75 km on the cobblestones roads by converting MCA members into small micro-enterprises aimed at
     making the MCA model more sustainable.



     Box 6. Micro-enterprises for roads maintenance
     (Microempresas de Mantenimiento Vial-MEMV) model


     Goal
     The goal of the micro-enterprise-based road maintenance model is to generate employment for poor men and women from
     rural communities living alongside the rehabilitated roads and thus ensure the benefits from improved access (following road
     rehabilitation) goes to the local community. The program also provides incentives for the most advanced micro-enterprises
     to diversify outside of the road sector.

     Payment and Incentive Mechanisms
     Micro-enterprise contractors (with 10–16 employees) received annual performance-based contracts. Micro-enterprises receive
     a fixed sum payment each month if performance indicators set in the contract have been met. Initially, payment was uniform
     for maintenance on all types of roads, but gradually roads were classified according to road conditions, traffic load, geographic
     location, and climate impact. Micro-enterprises are now required to submit at the end of each month brief reports of types of
     maintenance activities implemented, expenditures incurred and amount of materials used.

     The pressure of local municipalities and other members of their communities -- their next door neighbors -- is one of the
     main driving forces for micro-enterprises to comply with the level of service required. The employees of micro-enterprises are
     members of the local communities living along the roads they maintain.

     The other driving force is a possibility to renew their contract for another year without bidding subject to continuing compli-
     ance with the performance indicators set in the contract.

     Supervision
     Monitoring and supervision of micro-enterprises is regularly done by Technical Assistants. In addition to supervision, their oth-
     er responsibilities are to collect the data on road condition, to provide social assistance (dealing with gender and co-financing
     issues, and teaching employees of micro-enterprises to read and write). Roughly, one technical assistant is responsible for
     6-7 micro-enterprises. (35 of 87 Technical Assistants are involved in supervision). In addition, the Provincial Road Institutes
     sometimes undertake site inspections to verify the work done by the Technical Assistants and micro-enterprises.

     What are VDLs?

     The Local Development Window (VDL, for its Spanish acronym) was first piloted in the Peru Rural Roads II project. The idea
     for this intervention originated from the findings of the impact evaluations of the Peru Rural Roads I project, which found that
     the roads project did not have meaningfully increased economic opportunities for rural communities (Instituto Cuanto 2000,
     GRADE 2006). An additional catalyst was needed in order for these production opportunities to be acted on.

     The VDL intervention aims to complement the investments in road improvements with economic generation opportunities
     along the newly rehabilitated roads. VDL is a mechanism, managed by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), through
     which productive initiatives are identified and prioritized. The VDL component contributed to the rural economic development
     of 28 provinces in the following two ways: first, it assisted small associations of rural producers in developing 52 business
     plans, helping 46 of them obtain funding from various sources (mostly local governments) and providing assistance in their
     implementation; and secondly, it worked to strengthen the public sector’s involvement in rural development, by (i) assisting
     municipalities in the preparation of 30 local development plans; (ii) helping develop and approve 60 rural development res-
     olutions; (iii) and, most importantly, by convincing local governments to adopt many of their objectives and strategies. This
     approach to territorial development was unique in Peru, since it focused on demonstrating to public institutions the benefits
     of supporting rural producers and strengthening them so they can continue and expand these efforts in the future.

     The VDLs helps to strengthen both the municipalities and local stakeholders in defining territorial development strategies
     and plans, and identifying potential production activity sponsors. The executing agencies of the VDLs were selected on a
     competitive basis from among private operators and NGOs. The projects were aligned to the interests and aspirations of the
     stakeholders and to the potential products in the area.

     Example of VDL-sponsored livelihood project where women participated

     Fish Farms in Sauce, San Martín Department. The community of Sauce (San Martín Department) used the VDL to identify the
     start-up financial resources necessary for the development of tilapia fish farms. Road access between Sauce Lake and the pro-
     vincial market of Tarapoto prevented the community from taking advantage of the economic potential of the lake. In addition
     to road rehabilitation, which reduced the average time necessary to reach Tarapoto from six to two hours, approximately 61
     families benefited from the project, with female participation estimated at approximately 40 percent. The project also led to
     the creation of a cooperative composed of an Artisanal Fishermen’s Committee and a Women’s Committee, which assumes
     tasks related to product sales and coordination with the Municipality of Sauce.

4,330 women in different events, representing around 20 per-

Women were also encouraged to become more involved in
the VDLs, either by joining the staffs or by submitting proj-
ects. In all initiatives promoted, women had to account for
at least 20 percent of the executive committee. VDLs were
implemented in 28 provinces and involved an effort to de-
velop commodity sales strategies through the provision of
technical assistance, aiming to increase income-generation
activities in an effort to reduce poverty in rural areas (Box 7
provides a more detailed description of VDLs). Between 2008
and 2012, 90 productive organizations, and a total of 2,250
rural households benefited directly from the VDL component.
On average 24 percent of the managerial positions of these
organizations were held by women (100 women in total).
The majority of women’s managerial positions were treasur-
ers. Around 35 percent of people that received technical and
managerial training under the VDL were women.

            Methodology of case studies

Qualitative research methodologies were chosen for this study for its ability of providing
rich textual descriptions of intangible factors such as agency, social norms, and gender
roles. The use of open-ended questions and probing gives participants the opportunity
to respond in their own words, rather than forcing them to choose from fixed responses,
as quantitative methods do. In addition, open-ended questions have the ability to evoke
responses that are meaningful and culturally salient to the participant, unanticipated by
the researcher, and rich and explanatory in nature. Qualitative analysis attempts to iden-
tify trends, statements that are similar across different research participants.. Another
added advantage of using qualitative methods is the speed of data collection, given that
the sample size is much smaller, which also brings down the cost of data collection. This
section provides a summary of the study methodology. Annex 1 provides a comprehen-
sive overview of the research methodology, including details on sampling and fieldwork.

interpreting the findings:

•	 Potential selection bias: Program participants select-

   assigned. This was a reasonable procedure as imple-
   menting agencies had access to workers’ contacts and
   facilitated access to communities. In addition, commu-

This section describes the findings from the qualitative research that is mainly based
on individual interviews and a smaller number of focus groups with women program
participants and family members, women that did not participate in rural roads schemes
and key community informants. The findings are structured in three groups: (i) effects
of women’s participation in rural schemes at the individual, household and community
level; (ii) enabling factors and barriers for women’s participation; and (iii) challenges
faced by women participants in rural schemes. The first and second area describe some
implementation-related challenges that require more gender-sensitive approaches to

     Box 8. Findings from women’s participation in VDLs


     As mentioned in section 3, the field work in Peru also included individual interviews with female beneficiaries of the Rural
     Development Windows (Ventanas de Desarrollo Local – VDL). Given the very limited number of VDL women participants
     interviewed, the findings of this intervention is presented separately in the form of a brief overview.

     The women interviewed as members of the productive projects promoted by the VDLs, were rural and poor, mostly Quechua
     and Aymara women from communities in the departments of Arequipa and Puno. Ten were interviewed in total, out of which
     four belonged to an association of organic farmers and six to a group of women weavers. Both groups received technical
     assistance and training to develop business plans, as well as targeted support offered by the project.

     Motivators to participation

     Previous work experience significantly contributed to women’s participation in the VDL. The concept of the VDL was building
     on prior work engagement as the main purpose was not to establish completely new jobs but rather improving ongoing
     efforts.

     The group of agricultural producers was motivated to engage in the VDLs to improve their health situation, learn about and
     improve their nutrition and produce healthier food. On the other hand, for the group of weavers, the main motivation was to
     learn about design and weaving techniques, as well as issues related to the marketing and commercialization of their products
     in new markets such as Arequipa and Lima. In both groups, training was possibly the main interest of women before joining,
     related to improving their products for sale and achieving higher revenue.

     As in all other beneficiary groups interviewed for this study, the potential to increase their income was also a major motivator
     for VDL participants. Their first additional income encouraged the VDL women to an even more active participation according
     to their testimonies. The weavers reported an increase in their income of up to 40 percent from before the VDL intervention.
     The agricultural producers said they achieved an increase between 10 percent and 15 percent after having participated in
     VDLs.

     Challenges encountered

     While working in this initiative, women were exposed to similar difficulties as MEMV participants. The group of weavers
     referred to their partners not supporting them in their activities. This resistance seemed to be due to husbands’ opposition
     to women leaving their house and attend meetings with other women. This again, is another expression of the controlling be-
     havior which is central to machismo culture and which in some cases was exacerbated by physical and psychological violence
     against women according to the testimonies shared by key informants.

     Interestingly though, a very different situation was described by the second group, the women farmers of organic products.
     These women reported no conflicts with their husbands or situations of domestic violence. Agricultural production was rather
     viewed as extending the family activities and was not understood as a challenge to men’s dominating role within the house-
     hold. Women farmers reported that they worked jointly with their husbands and even resorted to their older children to help
     in the cultivation of vegetables. On the other hand, the organization of weavers was introduced as a women’s organization,
     and therefore was perceived as a challenge to the ‘order in place’ in the eyes of partners.

     However, the problems faced by agricultural producers were related to criticism from some of the residents of the community,
     specifically from those farmers using pesticides in agriculture. These negative comments seem to be routed much more in
     market competition issues than in questioning women’s role in farming or productive activities. The groups of weavers were
     also criticized by community members – but in that case, the criticism focused around women becoming members of an
     organization and taking on more public roles and responsibilities, while public space was understood to be exclusively male.

Box 8. Findings from women’s participation in VDLs (cont.)


Finally, similar to the MEMV members, VDL participants also reported that they had to fulfill extremely long work days as
they could not delegate the care and domestic work to anyone else, thus the work hours in VDLs were being added to their
regular work day.

“I suffered a lot of abuse from my ex –husband. He told me, ‘you’re a vagabond, a slut, I am sure you go to see your lovers’
... At the time I was hurt, but not anymore. For me, a new life began and I’m fine now.”
Woman participant of VDL, Puno

Positive effects of the VDLs

Women participants emphasized that their increased ability to manage their own income and their enhanced leadership
skills were key positive outcomes of their participation in VDLs. They also referred to changes at the personal level such as
increased self-confidence, ability to express their ideas, and interact with people including local authorities.

Besides social barriers, women VDL participants had to overcome their own fears of not being sufficiently prepared and
general doubts in their own capacities. The VDL suddenly placed them in the public sphere and required them to take on
new challenges and confront new and unfamiliar situations. The work-related challenges led to insecurity with respect to their
abilities. However, women interviewed emphasized that with the group effort and the support of other women, they were
able to overcome this fear.

Some of the women interviewed referred to political aspirations as a result from their increasingly public role experienced
through the VDLs. The group of weavers in particular showed enthusiasm in political participation and several of their mem-
bers are planning to actively participate in the upcoming October 2014 municipal elections. They referred directly to trainings
and workshops around citizenship and rights awareness as having contributed to this projection.

Similar to MEMV participants, the importance of meetings and ‘safe spaces’ provided for learning and sharing from other
women producers and professionals has shown to be a very significant factor for the participants. VDL participants appreci-
ated learning from other women.

     ularly in one of the selected communities, Pampa Grande.
     While men have actively participated in these processes, the
     main impulses came from the association of women. Women
     have played a key role in occupying this public space that in-
     volves negotiating with the government and public servants.
     Male community members were at odds with women taking
     on roles related to their leadership within women’s associa-
     tion around the recognition of the indigenous language and
     culture. This has caused some tensions in the community as
     women have entered traditionally male public spheres. Tradi-
     tionally, it was the male domain to protect the group against
     the “whites” and act as messengers. Men were responsible
     for communication with state representatives. Interestingly,
     this shows that while women’s economic empowerment
     does not necessarily lead to male resistance in a context of
     economic necessity, women’s greater voice and civic partic-
     ipation has not been welcomed by men in the community.

     “My husband’s family felt my participation in roads work
     was bad. They said I was wasting my time and not doing
     the things I need to do in the house. My neighbors were
     very jealous of my work, and male community authorities
     were also spiteful of my participation as President of the
     MEMV. I responded ‘if you want to participate, go on and
     participate, I will do the same, and we will see who wins the

                         and Recommendations

Reflecting on the study findings, this section identifies key lessons learned and strategies
(Figure 4) to address:

• barriers to participation;
• address challenges in program participation;
• enhance women’s agency during program participation; and
• increase sustainability and scale-up gender approaches.

     tive. An important feature of the MEMV program is that the
     program provides incentives for the micro-entrepreneurs to
     keep some of the profits and invest them in other economic
     activities diversifying their potential sources of income. Thus,
     MEMVs not only manage the routine maintenance activities
     but also use the training opportunities to create new econom-
     ic activities for themselves.

     Lessons learned #16: Develop graduation
     strategies to improve participants’ chances of
     obtaining employment after exiting from the
     rural roads program

     Projects can also devise graduation strategies for participants
     such as providing women with training on financial literacy,
     job search, and business development skills and access to
     credit to improve participants’ chances of obtaining perma-
     nent employment or of becoming self-employed once they
     exit the program. This is a lesson learned from the rural roads
     project in Nicaragua where women workers said they were
     frustrated that the roads maintenance and construction job
     was short term and temporary. The interviews with Nicara-
     gua MCA participants revealed that women use their salary
     to pay back debt, repair or improve their house, buy specific
     things for their kids – but not for longer term investments.
     Supporting women in making longer-term, potentially pro-
     ductive investments could be one option to extend the posi-
     tive effect from their participation further. The new pilot that
     will be implemented under the Additional Financing of the
     5th Rural Roads Improvement Project plans to expand wom-
     en’s work opportunities beyond only roads maintenance and
     construction by incorporating women into micro-enterprises
     to enhance long-term job prospects of women.

     Lesson learned #17: Build the evidence base
     on the benefits of women’s participation in
     rural roads and rural development schemes for
     advocacy with key stakeholders

     Finally, studies like this help to build the evidence base for
     advocacy with key stakeholders. Rural transport projects can
     include light quantitative and/or qualitative studies as part of
     project activities to assess the impact of women’s participation
     in roads works and productive activities linked to rural econ-
     omy revitalization. This evidence would inform government
     and development institutions to scale-up or replicate wom-
     en’s agency enhancing strategies in rural transport projects.

                Discussion and conclusion

The overarching conclusion from the study is that women’s integration into rural roads
projects enhances their agency, thus projects should capitalize on that. We apply the
WDR 2012 framework to understand how project activities to integrate women in ru-
ral roads works and ancillary activities had an impact on key determinants of gender
outcomes ( functioning of markets, formal and informal institutions, and households),
which in turn affected the three dimensions of gender equality: endowments, economic
opportunities, and agency (Figure 3).

On the other hand, community and husbands’ resistance
– sometimes expressed in the form of violence as in some
cases in Peru – also highlights how external constraints to
women’s agency have to be addressed with additional and
complimentary interventions. Project design should include
measures to address women-specific barriers to participate,
such as villagers and husbands’ resistance to women’s work
in male-dominated trades through community outreach and
sensitization, as well as gender-specific lifecycle demands
such as providing child care facilities that are culturally sensi-

mestic responsibilities and employment activities.

Lastly, given the time-bound nature of rural roads employ-

     Besides ethnicity, rural or urban background has a decisive
     influence on women’s and men’s opportunities in Peru. As
     Table 16 shows, women in rural areas face enormous dis-
     advantages in terms of education as opposed to women in
     urban areas and men. Women in rural areas have slightly
     higher labor force participation (73 percent) than women in
     urban areas (62 percent) primarily engaged in farm work and
     informal activities (Figure 9).
