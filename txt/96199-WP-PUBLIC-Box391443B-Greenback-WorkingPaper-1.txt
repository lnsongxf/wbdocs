    ABSTRACT


    M    onetary remittances represent the most visible transnational activity of migrants
         and can be considered as a function of migrant’s ability of producing savings from
    income and of remitting (supply side), and of the type of claims of family members,
    either left in the country of origin or residing abroad with the migrant (demand side).
    Hence, migrant’s remitting capacity is directly linked to the level of economic integration
    at destination. However, what happens to remittances when the labor market becomes
    uncertain and the earning potential decreases?

    Based on a recent survey, this paper explores the effect of the economic crisis on
    income trends and on the flow of monetary remittances sent to the families left home
    among three surveyed groups in Turin—Moroccans, Peruvians and Romanians. Results
    show a widespread worsening of the average economic conditions since the outbreak
    of the crisis in 2008. The protracted economic instability seems to have effects on
    migrants’ ability to keep remittance flows constant over time, with differentiated out-
    comes according to the national groups. While Moroccans show a higher propensity in
    receiving remittances, Peruvians are those who resist more to a remittance drop over
    the last five years. Beyond economic determinants, observed patterns in remittance
    trends can also be explained by migrant household characteristics in Italy and abroad
    and to unobserved variables (distance) related to the country of origin.
