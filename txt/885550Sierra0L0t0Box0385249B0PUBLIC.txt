        Leone perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Sierra Leone regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Sierra Leone;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Sierra Leone;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge

       Use data to help inform Sierra Leone team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In March-April 2013, 600 stakeholders of the World Bank in Sierra Leone were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office
of the Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a
ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/ contractors working on
World Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade
unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branches; and
other organizations. A total of 340 stakeholders participated in the survey (57% response rate).
Respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Sierra Leone; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the
World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with
the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Sierra Leone; and the Bank’s communication and
information sharing in Sierra Leone.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Sierra Leone: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Sierra
   Leone is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, and which areas would contribute most to reducing
   poverty and generating economic growth in Sierra Leone.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Sierra Leone, Bank staff preparedness to
   help Sierra Leone solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most

II. Methodology (continued)
    productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and weaknesses in
    its work, the most effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Sierra Leone, with
    which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what reasons respondents
    attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Sierra Leone, the extent to which the
   Bank meets Sierra Leone’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across forty-two development areas, such as education, energy,
   agricultural development, job creation/employment, infrastructure, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge work/activities, the areas on which the Bank should focus its
   research efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge
   work/activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes to development results
   and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as t he World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Sierra Leone’s institutional capacity,
   and providing effective implementation support. Respondents also were asked that to what
   extent they believed the Bank was adequately staffed in Sierra Leone.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Sierra Leone: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Sierra Leone’s development in the near future and
   to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value. They were also asked
   about the effectiveness of the donors in their work to see through development results on the
   ground and the effectiveness of the Bank in helping forge regional economic integration.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Sierra Leone, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 365 respondents (52% response rate) who completed the survey
in FY 2009 and the 82 respondents who completed the survey in FY 2005 (41% response rate).
Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

       PMUs were combined with consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported projects;
       respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from
       private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs, private foundations, community-
       based organizations, trade unions and faith-based groups were combined into a “CSO”

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
   Across all respondents, familiarity with the World Bank received a mean rating of 5.4; this
    was significantly lower than the mean rating received in the FY ’09 country survey (6.1).
        Respondents across all stakeholder groups and geographic locations had statistically
           similar levels of familiarity with the Bank.
         It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
          significantly, strongly correlated with respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall
          effectiveness in Sierra Leone and significantly, moderately correlated with their
          perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results and the Bank’s
          relevance to Sierra Leone’s development.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness across four of these forty-two areas of development in Sierra Leone. For the
        most part, respondents from the office of President/Prime Minister/Minister, PMUs and
        consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported projects/programs tended to have the
        highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas, whereas respondents from
        the media and the office of parliamentarian tended to have significantly lower ratings
        (See Appendix B for full details). Those areas with significant differences between
        stakeholder groups were:
                    “Crime and violence”
                    “Regional conflict and tensions”
                    “Climate change”; and
                    “Natural resource management”

       There were significant differences between geographic locations across many of these
        forty-two areas (See Appendix C for full details). For the most part, respondents from
        Eastern Region tended to have the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness, where
        respondents from Southern Region and Northern Region tended to have significantly
        lower ratings.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Sierra Leone, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the forty-two specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Sierra Leone. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                Crime and violence;
                Transport;
                Financial markets; and
                Agricultural development.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Sierra Leone, suggesting that
        ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s
        ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
        these analyses were:
                Agricultural development;
                Education;
                Financial markets;
                Disaster management; and
                Security/stabilization/reconstruction.

         Although most respondents from the PMUs and consultants/contractors working on
          Bank-supported projects/programs indicated that they consult the Bank’s knowledge
          work and activities a few times a year, a quarter of them indicated that they consult
          the Bank’s knowledge work and activities weekly.

         A large percentage of the respondents from local governments, CSOs, the media,
          academia/research institutes/think tanks, and other organizations tended to indicate
          that they consult the World Bank knowledge work and activities a few times a year.

         Nearly half of the respondents from the office of parliamentarian, the private
          sector/financial sector/private banks, and independent government institutions tended
          to indicate that they consult World Bank knowledge work and activities rarely.

      to which the Bank’s knowledge work and activities are useful in terms of the work you
      do compared to respondents in the FY’09 country survey ( 7.9). Respondents in this
      year’s country survey also gave significantly lower ratings for the extent to which the
      Bank’s knowledge work and activities are adaptable to Sierra Leone’s specific
      development challenges and country circumstances and are source for relevant
      information on global good practices compared to respondents in the FY’09 co untry
      survey (6.7 and 7.7, respectively).
    Respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister, PMUs and
      consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported projects/programs had the highest
      ratings that the Bank’s knowledge work and activities are adequately disseminated,
      whereas respondents from the media and other organizations had significant lower ratings
      for this area.
    There were significant differences between geographic locations in their ratings across
      many of these aspects of the Bank’s knowledge work and activities (see App endix C for
      full details). For the most part, respondents from Easter Region tended to have the highest
      ratings for these areas, whereas respondents from Northern Region and Southern Region
      tended to have significantly lower ratings (including the indicator question).
