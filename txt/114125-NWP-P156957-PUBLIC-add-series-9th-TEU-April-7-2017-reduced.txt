                        Key messages
                           Tanzania’s economic growth rate remains higher than that of most neighboring
                             countries, while the inflation rate remains relatively low. The current account deficit
                             has significantly improved, with gross reserves sufficient to cover four months
                             of imports. The shilling has also remained stable in 2016, following significant
                             depreciation and volatility in 2015.

                           The new administration continues to implement tight fiscal and monetary policies.
                             The Government is increasing its domestic revenue mobilization, but shortfalls in
                             external borrowing are constraining the full implementation of the development
                             budget. Government has also reduced the discount rate in order to boost domestic
                             credit growth, especially to the private sector, which has experienced significant
                             deceleration. The financial sector remains stable, though the ratio of non-performing
                             loans to total loans has increased.

                           The short to medium term macroeconomic outlook remains stable. However, the
                             full implementation of the public investment program is challenged by shortfalls in
                             external financing and implementation of reforms that will support private sector
                             development. The most significant external risks relate to a possible rebound in oil
                             prices and tight global financial conditions.

                           To maintain and increase the growth momentum, Government will need to focus
                             on three key growth enablers: continued macroeconomic stability; the effective
                             implementation of public investments; and supportive policies to promote private
                             sector investment and growth.

                           The private sector should be encouraged to play a more significant role in investment
                             and job creation, including through industrialization. This could be facilitated through
                             measures to improve access to affordable credit and reliable infrastructure such as
                             power and transport. Government efforts to streamline the regulatory environment
                             are also critically important.

                         Box 1: An Overview of Tanzania’s Financial Sector

  Financial Depth and Structure
  Tanzania’s financial depth is very limited, as shown by its ratio of total financial assets to GDP,
  which stands at only 43 percent. The ratio for banking system assets to GDP stands at only 30
  percent, while the ratio for credit to the private sector to GDP stands at only 17.1 percent (2015).
  Tanzania’s financial system is bank-centric, with the banking sector accounting for 71 percent
  of the total financial assets, split evenly between domestic and foreign banks. Pension funds
  and insurance companies account for 27 and 2 percent respectively, while collective investment
  schemes accounted for 0.1 percent.
  Banking System
  Of total banking assets, only about half go into lending, with lending fully funded by customer
  deposits, with a loan to deposit ratio of 85.8 percent in June 2016. This feature is not exclusive to
  Tanzania, as other African and lower income countries (LICs) are similarly characterized. However,
  even in relation to other LICs, Tanzania records a ratio of private sector lending to GDP well below
  the mean of 60-80 percent (see IMF 2016).
  Tanzania’s banking sector is small in terms of asset size and the percentage of individuals and
  businesses served (see table below). It is also crowded, with 58 banks in operation; concentrated,
  with a skewed distribution (with the two largest banks holding a market share of close to 40
  percent of total bank assets). The banking sector is also very segmented in terms of characteristics
  and products (with a large number of specialized small lenders) and geographically (with 12 local
  community banks and 7 regional (quasi) monopolies for public sector deposits and captured,
  civil servant borrowers)14 and a branch network concentrated in the three largest cities in a
  largely rural country with poor communications. Paradoxically, it can be said that Tanzania
  simultaneously possibly has too many banks, but not enough competition, or competition only in
  segments of the market for more common, low-risk financial products.
  The large number of banks is partly the result of the low minimum capital requirements: TZS
  15 billion (US$7 million) for commercial banks, TZS 5 billion (US$2.3 million) for deposit-taking

  microfinance institutions (MFIs), and only TZS 2 billion (US$900,000) for community banks.
  While BoT has already raised capital requirements in the recent past (2014), these levels are still
  very low compared to other countries (for example, Kenya’s minimum capital for commercial banks
  is equivalent to TZS 100 billion), and have not contributed to stimulating consolidation so far.

  Paradoxically, Tanzania might have too many banking institutions (58), but not enough
  competition, as the skewed structure of its banking has resulted in a very concentrated banking
  system with a few large banks, and a proliferation of small banks which do not have the scale, nor
  the sources of funding to perform adequate intermediation functions.
  Considering that the 4 largest banks represent about half of total bank assets, loans, deposits and
  capital, and the following 6 largest bank have a market share of around 20 percent, there is less
  than a third of the market left to be shared among 48 very small banks, with market shares below
  1-2 percent each. Even within the group of the 10 largest banks, the variance is very wide. For
  example, the total assets of the 10th largest bank represent only about 13 percent of the assets
  of the largest bank in the country.
  This very concentrated structure possibly implies there are high intermediation costs (due
  to the high fixed cost and lack of scale of the smaller banks), low efficiency, and small banks’
  dependency on non-deposit funding, with negative consequences for the cost of borrowing in the
  Tanzanian banking system. Moreover, the liberal licensing policy followed by the BoT is putting a
  lot of pressure on its capacity to adequately supervise the banking system.

  Looking at the profitability of the system: while aggregate figures show overall positive and high
  return on assets (ROAs) and return on equity (ROE) in the range of 1.5-2 percent and 10-15
  percent, respectively, 21 banks, out of 58, are actually making losses. The latter group includes
  mainly smaller foreign-owned, community and State-owned banks.15 On the other hand, large
  banks managed to obtain excellent ROAs of about 3 percent, and ROEs of up to 25 percent (except
  for one of them, Barclay’s, which made losses in 2015).
  In the second half of 2016 (from June to November) credit growth has stalled, in stark contrast to
  the double -digit credit growth experienced over the past years. The slow-down in credit origination
  is also connected to the build up of credit risk in the banking system: NPLs almost doubling in size
  and reaching 9 percent as of September 2016. The increase in NPLs was evident across sectors,
  but was particularly sharp in agriculture (25percent), real estate and manufacturing (10percent).
  However, the aggregate figures mask a very diversified situation across the 57 banking players
  active in Tanzania, with the smaller banks presenting signs of increased vulnerabilities (as shown
  in the case of the state-owned TWIGA Bank). A number of smaller banks now present level of

     More worrisome, some banks in the last two groups are reported to have exhausted their capital, with limited or slow BoT

NPLs above 15 percent indicating a point of no-return for the individual institution. Of particular
concern is the level of NPLs in the state-owned Tanzanian Investment Bank (TIB), whose level of
NPLs reached 30 percent as of September 2016.
The third structural characteristic of the banking system is the very short-term nature of the
deposits collected by the banking system, with an average maturity as of December of 2015 of
only 136 days, reflecting the high share of “sight” deposits in the system (i.e. deposits which could
be withdrawn any time versus time deposits). This makes it very risky for banks to undertake
what is called “term transformation,” in other words, financing longer-term loans with a short-
term deposit base. This feature makes banks a vehicle for funding short-term consumption
of individuals and short-term working capital of enterprises, but not able to fund longer-term
investment projects.
The fourth feature is the high cost and relative scarcity of bank credit. In Tanzania the key reference
interest rate (the T- Bill rate) is determined in a less than perfect Government securities market,
where few large banks – the only ones with a major branch network and a large deposit base - buy
Treasury paper auctioned by the BoT at very high interest rates. The result is that the reference
interest rate (for all floating rates) in the country stands at 14-15 percent. This high rate is the “risk-
free” rate, which sets a very high “floor” for all interest rates in the economy. At the same time high
T-Bill rates discourage banks from lending, for safety reasons and because banks do not need to
put capital lending to the Government or the BoT (zero risk-weight).
Finally, banks do not operate in a vacuum and complementary reforms to the judicial and court
systems in the country are essential for banks to be able to collect efficiently on the loans granted
and repossess quickly the collateral backing some of their credit exposures. Without an efficient
and clean court system the losses given default would continue to be too high and banks will
respond by increasing their interest spreads in a perverse system where honest borrowers are
penalized by delinquent ones.
Pension Funds
With about 26.5 percent of financial sector assets, the Social Security Funds (Pensions) represent
the second largest players after banks. The sector is increasingly under stress: benefit payments
increase significantly more than the expected contributions, while the return on assets is limited.
PSPF, one of the largest pension funds, has been recording negative cash flows since 2014,
to a large extent connected to the payments of benefits for “pre-1999” members on behalf of
the Government (for which PSPF is not being compensated). The quality of the asset portfolio
continues to remain problematic and the portfolio allocation shows a share of Government
loans larger than the regulatory threshold (of 10percent). This is a result of the (past due) loans
extended to Government-related projects and institutions (for an amount estimated at TZS 1.9
trillion), whose recovery has not happened. This large exposure risks undermining the longer-term
viability of the fund, with possible repercussions on the stability of the overall sector.
Insurance
The sector continued to grow rapidly (19percent increase in assets in 2015), but still it remains
extremely small vis-à-vis the rest of the financial sector as insurance assets are less than 1 percent of
the overall financial sector. Apparently, the sector remained well capitalized, with adequate solvency
ratios.
Capital Markets
The capital market is still at a nascent stage, not playing a major role in resource mobilization
and long-term financing. Financial instruments are limited both in the corporate and Government
securities market. Market turnover and the level of capitalization are low and over 2015 the market
experienced a slow-down, with market capitalization decreasing by 4 percent.
Mobile Financial Services (MFS) and other NBFIs
MFS accounts rose from 1 percent of adults in 2009 to 61 percent in 2015. Over 50 percent of
electronic transfers in Tanzania go now through MFS, reaching a volume of transactions of 50
percent of the GDP. This high degree of access to payment services is thanks to the network of
240,000 MFS agents across the country.

                        Key messages
                           Over the past decade, Tanzania’s mobile money revolution has facilitated a dramatic
                             increase in the share of population with access to financial services. Mobile money services
                             are now the vehicle of choice for secure and low cost electronic payments. They also have
                             the potential to offer an expanded range of services that would allow people to formally save
                             and borrow. This would have a positive impact on poverty reduction, including on women
                             and the youth, but it will also contribute to the formalization of the economy, hence spurring
                             economic growth.
                           The rest of the Tanzanian financial sector, particularly banking, has continued to grow.
                             However, the role of banks in intermediating savings into credit remains underdeveloped
                             compared to other regional peers. In particular, limited access to finance, as well as its high
                             cost and short tenure remain amongst the critical issues which constrain the development
                             of a vibrant private sector.
                           As a result, the Tanzanian financial sector remains increasingly bifurcated, with a very
                             dynamic mobile financial services sector competing against a very concentrated banking
                             sector. The GoT should make efforts to unlock competition in the banking sector, as well as
                             ensuring a seamless integration between mobile and traditional financial services. The full
                             interoperability obtained through an improved payment system infrastructure would set the
                             stage for a better integration.
                           Efforts should be made to expand access to those still not participating in financial services.
                             Similarly, the range of services available to those who are already active in the financial sector
                             should be expanded. A complete roll out of the National ID system and the shift towards
                             electronic payments for Government-related transactions, including for social transfers such
                             as TASAF, could greatly facilitate the expansion and deepening of financial inclusion.
                           Measures to extend access to credit and reducing its cost are also urgently required to
                             ensure that the financial sector is able to support growth. This requires action on two parallel
                             fronts. On the one hand, measures should be taken to reduce the crowding out of public
                             borrowing on the domestic credit market, which contributes to increased lending rates. On
                             the other hand, improving the credit reporting system and the collateral recovery process,
                             would help reducing the credit risk faced by financial institutions thus stimulating lending
                             to businesses and SMEs.
                           Greater attention should also be directed towards bridging the gender gap in access to
                             finance in rural areas where women involved in agricultural activities suffer significant
                             limitations. Although the proportion of women with access to an account has increased, a
                             significant gender gap, particularly in the rural areas, still negatively impacts women’s access
                             to financial services. This also limits the positive effects of increased access to finance on
                             the overall economy, hence posing serious constraints to poverty reduction and increased
                             shared prosperity.

                     Box 2: The Mobile Money Revolution in Tanzania

  Mobile money services were first launched in Tanzania in 2007 by E-Fulusi (T) Ltd, a local
  company that introduced a product known as Mobipawa. The product did not perform well, and
  the company winded up its operations. However, in 2008, Vodacom Tanzania Ltd introduced
  the M-Pesa product, followed by which Millicom (T) Ltd introduced Tigo Pesa and Airtel (T)
  Limited introduced Airtel money in 2009. Zantel introduced Ezy Pesa in 2010. In 2014, two more
  players joined the market, with the Tanzanian Informal Sector Worker Union introducing Dau
  Pesa and Smart Banking Solutions Limited introducing B-Pesa, although their participation and
  customer base is still very limited.
  From 112,000 subscribers in 2008, the total number of registered mobile money user accounts
  had grown to reach 53,300,000 by the end of February 2016 (see Figure 8), with 17,600,000
  active users who had conducted at least one transaction within a window of thirty days.  To
  facilitate the mobile money business, the providers use a network of agents for cash-in, cash-
  out (CICO) operations. As of February 2016, there were more than 260,000 agents to support
  mobile money services throughout Tanzania. All service providers share the agents and their
  infrastructure to perform money transfers. However, customers still need to refer to their
  own provider’s agents for cash withdrawals. Service providers hold trust accounts in different
  commercial banks based on their network coverage. Service fees have progressively decreased,
  with charges currently starting from a minimum of TZS 10 per transaction for small customers.
  For an average size transaction of TZS 32,500 (US$ 16.25), the average fee for the transfer is
  TZS 325 (US$ 0.16), or 1 percent of the value of an average transaction.
  Several factors have facilitated the development of mobile money in Tanzania.
  First, the presence of a thriving and highly competitive mobile telecommunication sector, with
  five main players, none of whom control more than a third of the market, has been a significant
  factor. The leading players all have experience of developing mobile money platforms elsewhere
  in the region. In addition, there have also been new entrants within the last two years, which
  has driven down prices. Lower prices and service innovation have helped drive increased
  penetration, with more than 36 million subscribers by September 2016 (around 75 percent of
  the population). Coverage is high, even in rural areas, despite remaining gaps. The World Bank-
  financed RCIP (Regional Communications Infrastructure Program) expects to extend coverage
  to a further 2.5 million people in rural areas by the end of 2017, through targeted subsidies to
  base station operators.
  Second, the interoperability arrangements among the mobile money providers introduced in
  2015 have allowed customers to transfer value throughout (most of) the networks. This has
  made P2P transactions more convenient and provided an additional incentive to people to sign
  up for mobile money accounts. Despite this important innovation, customers still need to refer
  to their own provider’s agents for CICO operations.
  Finally, the Bank of Tanzania has played a facilitating role, carefully balancing the need to ensure
  adequate supervision, while at the same time avoiding stifling market developments. The
  BoT initially adopted a test and learn approach to MFS (GSMA 2014) when the market was
  at its early stage. The 2007 amendment to the BoT Act (2006) gave BoT powers to oversee
  and regulate non-bank entities offering payment services and was operationalized through
  the Electronic Payment Schemes Guidelines of 2007, which allowed MNOs to offer payment
  services. Under this framework, MNOs were required to establish a trust account with a partner
  commercial bank, where they would deposit funds to cover mobile payments. The commercial
  bank would in turn seek a letter of no objection (which remained confidential) from the Central
  Bank that would allow the service provider to operate. Only after witnessing a boom in MFS
  did the BoT strengthen the regulatory framework through the development of the National
  Payment Systems (NPS) Act (2015) and the related Electronic Money (E-Money) Regulations
  (BoT 2015). The NPS Act improved transparency and the homogeneity of the system by issuing
  licenses to MFS providers, by establishing clear requirements and procedures applicable to all
  of them, and by imposing penalties for non-compliance.

     Box 3: Examples of Advanced Mobile Money Products Offered in Tanzania

Energy / Utility Bills Payment:
•	   The Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) has reached agreements with all
     MNOs that allow mobile money customers to pre-pay electricity (“Luku”) directly from their
     m-wallets.
•	   Similarly, the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Corporation (DAWASCO) and other providers
     including Auwsa in Arusha, Iruwasa in Iringa, Tuwasa in Tabolra, Shuwasa in Shinyanga, Uwasa
     in Tanga, and Mwauwasa in Mwanza allow water bills to be paid via mobile money.
•	   M-Kopa, which operates in Tanzania as well as Kenya and Uganda, has connected 400,000
     homes to off-grid solar energy through its digital finance, pay-as-you-go model. Approximately
     175,000 positive credit records are another by-product of M-Kopa’s finance model, as the firm
     participates in local credit bureaus.
International Remittances:
•	   MoneyGram allows Tanzanians located in more than 200 countries worldwide to send money
     to Vodacom’s M-Pesa account holders, who will receive it without additional charges.

     Pesa, and Zantel’s Ezy Pesa.
Savings Products:
•	   M-Pawa was launched by Vodacom in partnership with Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) in
     June 2014. M-Pawa allows customers of M-Pesa mobile money services to save money through
     their mobile phones. With over 5 million customers registered since inception, M-Pawa recorded
     deposits to a total value of TZS 34.6 billion (US$ 17.6 million) in September 2016. Interest on
     savings is calculated on a daily basis and paid back to the customer every quarter through his/
     her M-Pesa account.
Insurance Products:
•	   Bima Mkononiby was jointly launched in 2016 by Tigo and Bima Milvik and offers hospitalization,
     life and personal accident insurance at affordable, flat rates, that can vary from as low as TZS
     1,999 (US$ 0.96) for 2-month coverage, to TZS 15,999 (US$ 7.7) for 13-month coverage.
     Compensation can go up to TZS 3 million (US$ 1,450). The product has already registered more
     than 500,000 subscribers across the country since it was launched.
•	   Linda Mbegu, offered by Airtel in partnership with ACRE Africa, Seed Co. Tanzania and UAP
     Insurance Tanzania Ltd. to provide the first mobile crop insurance in Tanzania. The product

•	   BimaAFYA, a health coverage launched by Jubilee Insurance Company Tanzania and powered
     by Vodacom’s M-Pesa, is an affordable and comprehensive medical insurance plan that gives

     with a maturity period of one month. The total value of loan disbursements reached TZS 5.5
     billion (US$ 2.7 million) in September 2016.
•	   Timisa, launched in 2014 by Airtel in partnership with Jumo (a microfinance institution), also
     offers micro loans to its Airtel Money subscribers, repayable within 7 to 28 days.
•	   Nivushe, launched more recently in March 2016 by Tigo, also in partnership with Jumo, provides

                         Box 4: Are MFS crowding out NBFI in Tanzania?
   It is estimated that more than 2,000 NBFIs in Tanzania, including microfinance institutions (MFIs),
   savings, credit cooperatives (SACCOs), the Postal Bank and other NGOs, provide credit in various
   forms (Eusebius 2010). Despite their large number, NBFIs appear to play a more limited role in
   Tanzania than in other countries (see Figure 32).

  Figure 32: NBFI usage in Tanzania and Cross-Country Comparison (% adults), 2015




   Note: Question for usage of different providers in Tanzania allowed for multiple responses.
   Note: NBFI mostly serve low- and middle-income households located in urban and peri-urban areas around the
   main cities, but with the expansion of banks’ branch network on the one hand and the advent of MFS on the
   other, their role has significantly diminished. Interestingly, NBFIs appear not to be very popular among smallholder
   farmers, with only five percent of farmers having ever used MFI services and only three percent using SACCOs
   (CGAP 2016). However, some banks are currently working with Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs),
   which are informal savings group at the community level, to integrate them into MFS through tailored products.

                                          (CFA) and Vodafone

   The Connected Farmer Alliance (CFA) is a public-private partnership that was established in 2012
   by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Vodafone and TechnoServe to increase
   the productivity, income levels and resilience of farmers, particularly women farmers, in Tanzania,
   Kenya and Mozambique by developing and scaling mobile solutions tailored for the agricultural
   sector.In October 2014, the CFA signed its first commercial agreement with Olam International
   and Vodacom Tanzania in an effort to assist 30,000 smallholder coffee, cotton and cocoa farmers
   in Tanzania to improve their livelihoods through the use of M-Pesa and M-Pawa mobile finance
   services. Under the agreement, farmers can benefit from agronomic advice delivered by experts
   via text messages and from real-time information about market prices. They can also use mobile
   money transfers to increase the efficiency and security of their financial transactions. At the same
   time, the mobile-enabled supply chain benefits Olam’s business by enhancing communications
   with farmers, strengthening relationships and mutual confidence and improving overall efficiency.
   During the set-up phase, TechnoServe business advisors provided technical training to farmers
   and to Olam staff on the functioning of the new system.

             Box 6: The Tanzania National Financial Inclusion Framework

 The National Financial Inclusion Framework establishes the context for the Financial Inclusion
 vision based on the concrete improvements that Tanzania would like to see in the lives of all
 Tanzanians through the use of financial services. It galvanizes all relevant stakeholders in the
 financial services sector through the formulation of one common vision of success and provides
 strategic direction for all initiatives for financial inclusion in the country. The working definition
 of financial inclusion for Tanzania entails the regular use of financial services, through payment
 infrastructures to manage cash flows and mitigate shocks, which are delivered by formal providers
 through a range of appropriate services, provided with dignity and fairness.

 In working towards the long-term vision and achieving set targets in the medium term, the
 Framework has identified fundamental barriers that limit the growth of financial inclusion in
 Tanzania. These include supply-side barriers ranging from high interest rates, inappropriate
 services that do not meet demand-side needs, and high costs due to inefficiencies of service
 delivery. There are also demand-side barriers such as information asymmetry, irregular income
 patterns, and financial literacy. In addition, structural and regulatory barriers include stringent or
 disproportionate requirements for client on-boarding, the lack of regulatory framework for broad
 based micro-finance services, and delays in rolling out a national identification system, to mention
 a few.

  Hence, the Framework attempts to address the broad barriers on financial inclusion through the
  implementation of key priority areas for identified core enablers to build a robust infrastructure
  that will enable growth and outreach of all financial services. The key priority areas include:

  Proximity: Enhancing and implementing access channels, such as agent banking, mobile telephony
  financial services, point of sales, stand-alone ATMs etc., and a regulatory framework that creates
  a conducive environment;

  Robust electronic platforms: Improving and developing Information and Communication
  Technology (ICT) payment platforms that facilitate cost effective access to financial services;

  Robust information and easy client on-boarding: Implementing, monitoring and enhancing the
  use of credit bureaus, proportionate Know Your Client (KYC) requirements, and an improved
  Identification (ID) system that is linked to financial systems and credit bureaus;

  Informed customers and consumer protection: Implementing a financial consumer protection
  mechanism and a financial education strategy.

  The Framework comprises of a monitoring mechanism to ensure that key stakeholders implement
  the key priority areas. The National Financial Inclusion Council, a policy body, shall ensure that the
  priority activities stipulated in the Action Plan are implemented and the set targets are achieved
  within the agreed timelines.

  The Framework is a private-public initiative and has been developed through a consultative
  approach using the various committees encompassing representations from all relevant
  stakeholder institutions.”

    	A few success cases have been identified in Tanzania – such as the collection of motor vehicle license fee
     payments (BTCA, 2016) – however, initiatives remain limited to few Government agencies developing   dedicated
     solutions.

  	 Importantly, the figure on voter coverage is biased because the survey was undertaken in the two months before
     the election and after a mass biometric voter registration drive. The figure that will exponentially go down over
     time as people lose or damage their voter cards.
42
     For the 2015 Presidential election in Tanzania, voters were registered with fingerprints by the National Election
     Commission to prevent them from being registered twice. Voters were not verified with fingerprints at the time
     of voting, since the cost of the necessary equipment and infrastructure could not be justified for use once every
     five years. On the other hand, a national ID offers enhanced capabilities and economies of scale when it comes
     to verification because it is designed to be used for any time someone needs to prove they are who they say they
     are when accessing services, including for future elections, financial services, healthcare etc.

   NIDA was established in 2008 and launched the current national ID system in 2011, which utilizes biometrics (10
    finger prints) to ensure the uniqueness of each person and holds 72 fields of data. By March 2016, approximately
    2.5 million adults had registered and received their NINs and smart cards. NIDA has since then changed its
    approach to use the biographic and biometric data already in the National Election Commission (NEC) database
    to enroll citizens and generate NINs. As of December 2016, 11.5 million NINs have been generated this way (but
    not issued) and NIDA has separately enrolled and issued NINs to 500,000 civil servants as part of a Government
    initiative to remove ghost workers from the public payroll. The adult population of Tanzania is estimated to be
    25 million.
44
  	 The process foresees the initial issuance of unique national ID numbers (NINs) and smart cards to all adult
    citizens, residents and refugees by June 2017.

     Through the pilot project “Catalyst – Inclusive Cashless Payment Partnership” (a collaboration among USAID, the
     Indian Government and the non-profit organization IFMR LEAD launched in October 2016), India is supporting
     the establishment of a platform to expand consumer-to-merchant digital payments, especially among low- and
     middle-income populations. The project will provide incentives and rewards to consumers and businesses to
     embrace digital payment mechanisms, such as the availability of digital cash-management tools to gain higher
     interest on balances, or guaranteed loans (with up to 50 percent insurance against default). Source: USAID 2016.

Box 7: The importance of a stronger banking system: “The tail cannot wag the dog”

  While there has been significant progress in providing access to basic financial services in
  Tanzania, there is a long, pending reform agenda in the banking sector going forward, for
  the sector to contribute even more to Tanzania’s economic development. The IMF’s Financial
  Development Index shows that, with the exception of access to finance, Tanzania has seen very
  limited progress since the 1980s.


  Small size of the Banking System: First, Tanzania’s financial system is too small for the needs
  of the country. Standard measures of financial depth look at the ratio of total financial assets
  to GDP, and Tanzania’s ratio is very low at 43 percent, out of which 30 percentage points are
  total banking assets, and 15 percent the credit to the private sector. All are well below the levels
  recorded by other low-income countries. The banking system has not shown much increase
  over the past decade. Moreover, the latest IMF Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan
  Africa (2016) points out that: “The region’s median ratio of private sector credit to GDP has
  increased by almost 10 percentage points since 1995, to about 21 percent in 2014. However, it
  remains only about half the size of that in the Middle East and North Africa, East Asia, and Latin
  America and the Caribbean, driven by sub-Saharan Africa’s relatively high number of low-income
  countries in which the median level of credit to the private sector is comparable with other low-
  income countries.”


  This is critical because the lack of finance reduces the options to increase economic growth
  and productivity-enhancing investments. Mobile banking is a good complement to, but cannot
  replace, the formal banking sector.


  Number and concentration of Banks: Paradoxically, Tanzania might have too many banking
  institutions (58), but not enough competition, as the skewed structure of its banking system
  is very concentrated. The four largest banks have a 50 percent market share of total loans
  and deposits, with the ten largest banks having a market share of 72 percent, followed by
  a proliferation of small banks (47) which do not have the scale or the sources of funding to
  perform adequate intermediation functions.


  Banking Products: The third structural characteristic of the Tanzanian banking system is the
  very short-term nature of the deposits collected, with an average maturity (as of December,
  2015) of only 136 days, reflecting the high share of sight deposits in the system (i.e. deposits
  which could be withdrawn any time). This makes it very risky for banks to undertake meaningful
  term transformation: that is, financing longer-term loans with a short-term deposit base. This
  feature makes banks a vehicle for funding the short-term consumption of individuals and short-
  term working capital of enterprises, being unable to fund longer-term investment projects.


  Intermediation Costs: The fourth feature is the high cost and relative scarcity of bank
  credit. It should be noted that in Tanzania, interest rates are largely determined in a less than
  perfect Government Securities Market, where an often cash-strapped Treasury (in view of a
  structural and rather wide fiscal deficit) seeks short-term funds. Only two or three of the largest
  banks, each of which has a large branch network and a large deposit base, buy most of the
  Government securities, yielding very high interest rates. The result is that the interest rate on
  Government paper is determined in this imperfect market at a very high level: currently, it stands
  at 14-15percent. This rate is the risk-free rate. As such it sets a very high floor on all (flexible)
  interest rates in the economy, while at the same time it reduces the incentive for banks to lend
  to the private sector. The latter is made worse by the fact that banks do not need to put capital
  in their lending to the Government or the Bank of Tanzania, as the risk-free assets have a zero
  risk-weight for calculating their capital asset ratio.

   Asset Quality: Banks’ asset quality has deteriorated, with the NPL ratio for the whole banking
   system reaching 9 percent as of September this year. However, NPLs have grown to worrisome
   levels (over 15percent) in some of the smaller, rural, community and cooperative banks. Out of
   58 institutions reporting to the BoT, 14 (almost one third in number, but representing only 9
   percent of the total value of banks’ gross loans) report very high NPL ratios as a group, with an
   average of 30 percent.


   Unique Identifier: Tanzania needs to improve the conditions for the operation of financial
   institutions with the right measures to have a national identification card with unique identifiers
   to allow banks to reduce fraud and to improve the collection and dissemination of financial
   information through the Credit Bureaus. Without these reforms, banks face too many risks in
   their lending activities. As discussed later, the operation of the two credit bureaus is less than
   adequate.


   Loss Given Default: Banks do not operate in a vacuum. Complementary reforms to the judicial
   and court systems in the country are essential for banks to be able to collect efficiently on the
   loans granted and to repossess quickly the collateral backing some of their credit exposures.
   Without an efficient and clean court system, the losses given default would continue to be too
   high and banks will respond by lending less to the private sector and increasing their interest
   spreads in a perverse system where honest borrowers are penalized by delinquent ones.


   Financial Stability: Needless to say, financial stability is a precious public good, being essential
   to reduce poverty and make the financial system an engine of growth and poverty reduction.

                    implemented by the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF)

   One potential way to include many of the “last mile” consumers would be to integrate electronic
   payment mechanisms into conditional cash transfer programs. Currently, the PSSN relies on a manual,
   cash-based distribution mechanism. Beneficiaries are gathered at the pay-point, typically located
   outside a local Government office, to attend a community informative session which usually last about
   45 minutes. They then wait for Community Management Committee (CMC) members to go to the
   bank where they collect the program funds. Once the CMC return to the pay point, they organize
   themselves into stations or ‘desks’ where a number of payment activities are carried out, including the
   verification of names against the payroll list, checking program ID cards against beneficiaries’ personal
   IDs, disbursing the cash transfers and issuing payment receipts. The waiting time between the start of
   the community session and the disbursement can range from between two to four hours.

   Moreover, for beneficiaries based in rural areas, it can take up to two to three hours to commute to
   the pay-point, with a transportation costs of up to TZS 10,000, or 35 percent of the value of their
   cash transfer (ISPA 2016). Some informal arrangements exist among beneficiaries to share the cost of
   transport (such as a motorbike fare) or to nominate a single person to travel and collect transfers for
   multiple peers.

   The security required during the cash payment disbursements also raises the costs of the program.
   CMC members are escorted by the police from the bank branch to the pay-point and then overseen
   by municipal officials at the pay-point. In addition, gathering large numbers of beneficiaries and paying
   them in a public setting exposes them to the risk of robbery. This is a higher risk in urban areas where
   external parties may be aware of who beneficiaries are and when and where payments take place.

   A recent study has demonstrated that up to one third of G2P cash payments may be lost through the
   manual delivery system (CGAP 2015a).

   The case could be made for a transition to an electronic payment system, including through mobile
   services. In fact, Mobile, 2G network coverage is estimated to cover up to 85 percent of the Tanzanian
   population, with 77 percent of adults possessing a mobile phone (InterMedia FII 2016), placing
   Tanzania in the top ranks of African countries in terms of mobile phone ownership.58 An electronic social
   payments system could be catalytic in providing volume and scale to make it profitable for providers to
   reach these last mile consumers. 59 In turn, it would allow recipients to save time for more productive,
   income-generating activities, eliminate the transport costs for collection, and avoid the risks of being
   robbed of their cash. The transition of such programs to an electronic payment system could not only
   increase the transparency, cost-effectiveness and security of funds, it could also facilitate the inclusion
   of vulnerable consumers into the financial system, enabling beneficiaries to become familiar with mobile
   money and to gradually start using those services for personal or even small business transactions.

   Smallholder farmers in Tanzania – who are largely located in remote, rural areas, seem to reflect the national trend.
    Two-thirds (66 percent) of them have their own mobile phone, and 82 percent have used a phone. In contrast,
    only 46 percent of smallholder farmers in Uganda and 33 percent in Mozambique have their own phone (CGAP
    2016).
59
    TASAF has been envisaging a transition to electronic payments for some time, and is expected to start piloting
    the approach in early 2017. The transition should be first implemented in communities with existing presence
    of financial access points (for CICO services), such as urban and peri-urban areas (ISPA 2016), and then expand
    towards rural areas. Moving to electronic transfers would also provide greater transparency and hence security
    of funds, as it would spare people from being exposed to outsiders and to potential corruption instances when
    collecting their money.

                                    Box 9: National ID system in India

     In 2009, the Indian Government, through the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), launched
     an ambitious biometric identification program named “Aadhaar” (which means “Foundation” in Hindi).
     Aadhaar assigns a unique 12-digit random ID number to all residents of India based on the secure
     registration of their personal (name, address, gender and date of birth) and biometric data (fingerprints,
     iris and face). The data is stored and reduplicated in a centralized database managed exclusively by
     UIDAI, which service providers can use to verify an individual’s identity quickly and easily. For instance,
     a customer who wants to open a low value bank account or make a transaction requiring verification
     would present his/her Aadhar number to a bank representative and have their fingerprints/iris scanned
     using a low-cost machine (as low as US$ 100). The number and biometric data are sent to UIDAI on
     a GPRS or faster network for verification against the database, and a positive or negative response is
     returned, usually within five to 60 seconds, and other relevant data for the transaction is made available
     (in the case of a bank account, this is the name, address and date of birth of the individual – the only
     additional information that requires verification in Tanzania, according to AML regulations, is the place
     of birth). This online verification model means that the Government does not have to issue expensive
     smart cards and that service providers need only have a fingerprint or iris scanner (and not a card or
     NFC reader as well), which are increasingly common features on regular tablets and smartphones.


     Aadhaar has not only facilitated a cost-efficient, accurate and fully electronic KYC (e-KYC) process, it
     has also improved Indians’ access to financial services and social protection. By April 2016, Aadhar had
     established 1 billion digital identities, linked to 254.8 million bank accounts. Aadhaar has also generated
     substantial fiscal savings. By utilizing Aadhaar to verify the identity of fuel subsidy recipients, the
     Government was able to identify individuals who were claiming subsidies in excess of their entitlement
     or more than once, which resulted in savings of nearly US$ 1.5 billion.

          of retail payment platforms and

                               Box 10: Interoperability of payment instruments

     Interoperability of payment instruments is achieved when users are able to pay through their instrument
     of choice at any terminal present in the country, regardless of such terminal being affiliated directly with
     the issuer of the said payment instrument. For example, terminals may include ATMs, POS terminals
     at merchants’ premises, unmanned kiosks, and, in a conceptual sense, the websites of e-commerce
     merchants.

     There are a number of means to achieve the interoperability of payment instruments across a national
     payment system. In essence, all require that banks and other providers of payment instruments and
     terminals be somehow interconnected to each other. This can be achieved by participants being
     directly connected to each other on a bilateral basis or by interconnecting to some sort of multilateral
     infrastructure. This infrastructure may be domestic or international. It may also consist of a single
     infrastructure or of multiple infrastructures interconnected to each other. Finally, hybrid models also exist.

     In a bilateral arrangement, the authentication and clearing of payments flowing between two financial
     institutions is handled by the institutions themselves. Multilateral clearing arrangements are based
     on a set of procedures whereby financial institutions present and exchange data and/or documents
     relating to funds transfers to other financial institutions under a common set of rules. The following
     notable differences can be identified between bilateral and multilateral arrangements:

     •	        Bilateral arrangements do not typically provide efficient solutions when large volumes of
               payments need to be processed by a large number of participants (i.e. issuers and acquirers).
               Rather, multilateral arrangements make the processing of payment instructions more efficient

The World Bank Group Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global Practice, Africa Region




            by coordinating and simplifying the exchange of payment instructions across participants and
            operating communications networks and by providing processing services.

     •	     In principle, multilateral arrangements could make the access of a new entrant onto the market
            easier, as a single link needs to be established by the new participant with the central entity. By
            contrast, where bilateral arrangements are in place, a new entrant needs to negotiate conditions
            with each existing participant, hence creating a potential barrier to entry.

     •	     Lastly, multilateral netting allows participants to minimize the liquid balances necessary for
            settlement.

     “Payment switch” in general refers to the technical infrastructure, on top of which there are business
     rules, procedures, branding, and products, defined as a “scheme”. A “national payment switch” is an
     infrastructure mandated to process all card payments and also, in some cases, mobile and internet
     payments. A country can have one or more switches that operate nationally. National payment
     switch(es) are a common way to achieve interoperability.

     These switch(es) can play a critical role in a retail payment system by facilitating the establishment of
     direct connections between transactional accounts of multiple payers and payees operated by diverse
     providers. Direct connections enhance transactional efficiency and reduce friction costs. In this way,
     national payment switch(es) enable fungibility and ease of use of money balances held in electronic

   The IMF concluded in a recent Report that “Budget credibility needs to improve, and needs to be accompanied
   by better cash forecasting on the part of the fiscal authorities. This will also allow the authorities to announce
   and stick to a Government securities issuance schedule, which ultimately would strengthen the Government
   securities market. Tap sales should be phased out while transparent rules that govern the bidding process in
   primary auctions should be adopted. Arbitrary changes (changing or even canceling offered amounts) should
   be eliminated. Greater communication with financial market participants would also help in setting the stage for
   a more effective Government securities market.” IMF, Tanzania. Selected Issues — Macrofinancial Issues, June
   30, 2016.

  The views of business managers of the top 100 mid-sized companies in Tanzania have been collected every six months
  since April 2013. However, in December 2016, it was collected after 12 months. This data is collected by KPMG through
  electronic questionnaires, with anonymous responses. In December 2016, two thirds of responding managers assessed
  the performance of the economy to be worse than in the previous year, while less than one third reported that it had
  remained the same. Looking forward, more than half of the managers were pessimistic about the economy and their
  own businesses, a reversal of the opinions expressed in December 2015.

  How do you believe the Tanzanian economy is performing compared to last year?

                                                          •   In December 2016, only 18 percent of the managers
                                                              believed that the economy performed better in the last

                                                          •   62 percent of the views were unfavorable, 28 percent
                                                              higher than in December 2015, also worse since we
                                                              started the survey in 2013.
                                                          •   20 percent of the managers saw no change, which is
                                                              11 percent lower in December 2015 but almost the
                                                              same as in May 2015.



  How do you expect the Tanzanian economy to perform in the coming year?


                                                          •   In December 2016, only 16 percent of the managers
                                                              expected the economy to perform better in 2017 than
                                                              in 2016, significantly lower than 53 percent in
                                                              December 2015.

                                                          •   55 percent of the managers anticipated economic to

                                                              than December 2015.



  How do you think that your own business will perform during the next 12 months compared to its current level
  of performance?

                                                          •   In December 2015, 52 percent of the managers

Public and private sector commitment, legal and regulatory framework, and financial and
ICT infrastructures are the basic foundation that countries need to have in place to be
able to expand access to transaction accounts. Designing useful payment and transaction
accounts products which are made available through widespread access points, coupled with
awareness and financial literacy efforts to inform and educate people on how to select and
use them, as well as accelerating adoption of transaction accounts by shifting large volume
use cases like wage or social benefit payments into those accounts constitute key elements
that will make universal access to and frequent usage of transaction accounts possible.
