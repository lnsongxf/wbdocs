II. Methodology
In May-July 2012, 694 stakeholders of the World Bank in Croatia were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; international partners; bilateral
and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary
branch. A total of 198 stakeholders participated in the country survey (29%).

Respondents received questionnaires via post or email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Croatia; their overall attitudes toward the
Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the
World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Croatia; and the Bank’s communication and information
sharing in Croatia.

A. General Issues facing Croatia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Croatia is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to achieving EU integration and
   EU income convergence for Croatia, and which areas would contribute most to generating
   economic growth in Croatia.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Croatia, Bank staff preparedness, the extent
   to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, their agreement

II. Methodology (continued)
    with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an
    effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on
    which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest
    values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective instruments in
    helping Croatia achieve EU integration and EU income convergence, with which groups the
    Bank should collaborate more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow
    reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Croatia, the extent to which the Bank
   meets Croatia’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level
   of effectiveness across thirty-six development areas, such as EU integration and EU income
   convergence, economic growth, job creation, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, the
   Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise, and the extent to which
   Croatia received value for money from the Bank’s fee-for-service products.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Croatia’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Croatia: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Croatia’s EU integration and EU income
   convergence in the near future and to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of
   greater value in Croatia.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s website s.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Croatia, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 207 respondents (35% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY 2008 and the 122 respondents (27% response rate) who completed the survey in FY
2003. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
    Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 6.4; this was
     significantly lower than the mean rating received in the FY ’08 country survey (6.9) and
     statistically similar to the mean rating received in the FY ’03 country survey (6.5).
          Respondents from the office of Minister and PMUs/consultants on Bank supported
           projects indicated the highest levels of familiarity whereas respondents from NGOs/
           CBOs/ trade unions indicated significantly lower levels of familiarity.
          It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
           significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
           effectiveness in Croatia, the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results, and
           the Bank’s relevance to Croatia’s development.

       There were significant stakeholder differences in their ratings of the Bank’s effectiveness
        across eight of these thirty-six areas. For the most part, international partners,
        respondents from multilateral agencies, and PMUs/consultants on Bank supported
        projects had the highest ratings across these areas whereas respondents from
        NGOs/CBOs/trade unions, private sector organizations/financial sector/private banks,
        and the media tended to have significantly lower ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness
        across these areas. Those areas with significant stakeholder group differences were:
             “Environmental sustainability”;
             “Global integration”;
             “Water and sanitation”;
             “Law and justice”;
             “Health”;
             “Rural development ”;
             “Domestic private sector development”; and
             “Poverty reduction”.

       There were significant differences between geographic locations across three of these
        thirty-six areas. In all three instances, respondents from Zagreb had significantly higher
        ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas than respondents from other
        locations. Those areas with significant differences were:
             “Information and communications technology”;
             “Economic growth”; and
             “Public financial management”.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Croatia, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-five specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in crease.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Croatia. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             Poverty reduction;
             Equality of opportunity; and
             Monitoring and evaluation.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Croatia, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             Equality of opportunity;
             Foreign direct investment; and
             Governance.

Knowledge: Qualities
        There were significant differences between stakeholder groups across three of these
         qualities of the World Bank’s knowledge and research: accessibility (well written and
         easy to understand), relevance to Croatia’s development priorities, and including
         appropriate level of stakeholder involvement during preparation. For the most part,
         international partners, respondents from multilateral agencies, PMUs/consultants on Bank
         supported projects, and independent government institutions gave the highest ratings
         regarding these three aspects of the Bank’s knowledge and research whereas respondents
         from NGOs/CBOs/trade unions and the media tended to give significantly lower ratings.
        There were significant differences between two geographic locations. Respondents from
         Zagreb gave significantly higher ratings for the Bank’s knowledge and research being
         adaptable to Croatia's specific development challenges and country circumstances than
         respondents from other geographic areas in Croatia.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates
The World Bank’s Work in Croatia

        Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly lower levels of agreement
         that the Bank currently plays a relevant role in development in Croatia and that its work
         is aligned with respondents’ development priorities compared to respondents from the
         FY’03 country survey.
        There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement that the
         Bank currently plays a relevant role in development in Croatia, that its work is aligned
         with respondents’ development priorities, and that its programs and strategies are
         realistic. International partners, respondents from multilateral agencies, and independent
         government institutions tended to have the highest levels of agreement with these
         statements, whereas respondents from NGOs/CBOs/trade unions and private sector
         organizations/financial sector/private banks tended to have significantly lower levels of
         agreement.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
The World Bank as an Effective Development Partner
       Respondents in this year’s country survey gave significantly lower ratings for staff
        accessibility, straightforwardness and honesty, and flexibility in terms of the changing
        country circumstances, compared to respondents in the FY’08 and FY’03 country
        surveys.
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings across eight of these
        aspects of the Bank being an effective development partner: collaboration with
        international and European partners, staff accessibility, openness, straightforwardness
        and honesty, being inclusive, responsiveness, collaboration with groups outside of the
        Government, and flexibility in terms of the Bank's products and services. International
        partners and respondents from multilateral agencies tended to have the highest ratings for
        these eight aspects whereas respondents from private sector organizations/financial
        sector/private banks tended to have significantly lower ratings.
       There were significant differences between two geographic locations. Respondents from
        Zagreb gave significantly higher ratings for staff accessibility than respondent from other
        geographic areas.
