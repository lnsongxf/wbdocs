EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Malawi is among the poorest countries in the world, with limited resources and an
economy that relies heavily on agriculture. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is
US$362 per year1 (World Development Indicators 2014) and 62 percent of the popu-
lation lives on less than US$1.25 per day. Malawi is relatively small in size, is densely
populated, and has high population growth, all of which put pressure on available land
for smallholder farming and on the environment and the natural resource base, nota-
bly land and forests. Oﬃcially, the population amounts to 15.9 million people, about
80 percent of whom live in rural areas (World Development Indicators, 2010–12 year
ﬁgures, accessed March 2014).

Agriculture is the backbone of Malawi’s economy, contributing 30 percent of total
GDP (2011) and 76 percent of total national exports (2012). With 78 percent employed
in the sector in 2013 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO
Country Proﬁle, accessed May 2014), agriculture is also a main source of employ-
ment and income. Increasing food security is one of the main objectives of Malawi’s
Agricultural Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp 2010) and a strong focus on increasing
maize production since the mid-2000 has resulted in rapidly increasing production.
However, production risks continue to result in high losses to the sector, including for
maize. Further, price interventions in the sector over the past year have implied greater
price risks for producers and traders.

As evident in Malawi, risks can have potentially signiﬁcant implications on stakehold-
ers, investments, and development in the agriculture sector. Adverse movements in
agricultural commodity and input prices together with production-related shocks (for
example, from weather, pests, diseases) not only aﬀect farmers and ﬁrms active in
particular supply chains, but may also put severe strains on a government’s ﬁnances.
Rapid or signiﬁcant declines in production and/or trade may reduce government tax
revenues, aﬀect balance of payments, necessitate compensatory (or recovery) expendi-
tures, and/or otherwise adversely aﬀect a government’s ﬁscal position. The prevalence

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT
With more than three-quarters of its workforce employed in agriculture, Malawi is
highly vulnerable to any adverse events aﬀecting the agriculture sector, and agricul-
tural risks are ever present in the country. Over the past decades, Malawi has been
struck by several severe droughts that have resulted in spikes in food insecurity and
prompted the need for humanitarian aid. During the last major drought in 2005,
40 percent of the population was in immediate need of food aid as a result of poor
harvest.

Increasing food security is indeed one of the main objectives of Malawi’s Agricultural
Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp 2010), and its strong focus on increasing maize pro-
duction since the mid-2000s has resulted in rapidly increasing production. However,
production risks continue to result in high losses to the sector, including for maize.
Further, price interventions in the sector over the past year have induced greater price
risks for producers and traders.

Agricultural risks can obstruct development and enforce poverty traps, particu-
larly for a country as reliant on agriculture as Malawi. Because of the size of the
sector in the economy and the importance of agricultural products for export,
agricultural growth correlates closely with GDP growth. This means that drops in
agricultural growth aﬀect the entire economy, as shown in ﬁgure 1.1—agricultural
value added growth was negative in ﬁve years between 1992 and 2010, and the
correlation coeﬃcient between agricultural value added and GDP is 78 percent.
Further, any drop in agricultural growth in a given year will aﬀect the ASWAp
annual growth target of 6 percent that Malawi committed to under Comprehen-
sive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). For individual actors
in the sector, these risks reinforce poverty traps by cycles of loss-recovery-loss and
result in lower returns on investments in productive assets.

Malawi’s eﬀort to manage risks and to provide relief in response to adverse events
diverts signiﬁcant resources from longer-term development investments. In recent
years, the government and donors have spent US$80–US$100 million annually on
coping mechanisms alone (such as food aid). This was in addition to the approximately

MALAWI’S AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM

AGRICULTURE SECTOR OVERVIEW AND
PERFORMANCE
Malawi is among the poorest countries in the world, with limited resources and an
economy that relies heavily on agriculture. Per capita GDP is US$362 per year4
(WDI 2014) and 62 percent of the population lives on less than US$1.25 per day
(purchasing power parity [PPP]). Malawi is relatively small in size, is densely popu-
lated, and has high population growth, all of which put pressure on land available for
smallholder farming and on the environment and the natural resource base, notably
land and forests. Oﬃcially, the population is 15.9 million people, about 80 percent
of whom live in rural areas (World Development Indicators, 2010–12 year ﬁgures,
accessed March 2014).

Agriculture is the backbone of Malawi’s economy, contributing 30 percent of total
GDP (2011) and 76 percent of total national exports (2012). With 78 percent of the
population employed in the sector in 2013 (FAO Country Proﬁle, accessed May 2014),
agriculture is a main source of employment and income. The variability of agriculture
has been a determinant of the overall economy’s volatility (recall ﬁgure 1.1). For exam-
ple, in years when agriculture suﬀered signiﬁcant setbacks because of weather-related
or other risk events, GDP growth also experienced an inﬂexion. In ﬁgure 1.1, this can
be seen in 1992 and 1994, when severe drought caused signiﬁcant drops in agricultural
production that translated into in negative GDP growth rates. More recently, such cor-
relations occurred in 2001, 2005, and 2010.

In terms of production indexes, the gross cereal production index shows a lot more
volatility than do food production and total agricultural production indexes. The
cereal production index in ﬁgure 2.1 also corresponds with the ﬂuctuations in agricul-
tural value added growth (ﬁgure 1.1). This is in line with ﬁndings from other studies
that Malawi’s GDP is strongly correlated with maize production.

    rity, Malawi introduced an input subsidy program in 2005.                            (mm) IN MALAWI
    The purpose of FISP is to increase smallholder farmers’
    access to improved agricultural farm inputs with the objec-
    tive of achieving food self-suﬃciency and increased income
    for resource-poor households through increased maize and
    legume production. FISP also subsidizes certain posthar-
    vest infrastructure to decrease postharvest losses. FISP has
    since accounted for more than 50 percent of the Ministry
    of Agriculture and Food Security’s (MAFS) budget. The
    program subsidizes fertilizers, maize and legume seeds,
    and, in certain years, cottonseed and chemicals. Under the
    program, farmers receive vouchers that cover a share of
    the input cost. The number of vouchers went from 166,000
    in 2005/06 to 216,000 in 2008/09 and to 140,000 in 2012.
    Maize seed subsidized under the program went from 4,524
    MT in the 2006/07 season to 8,245 MT in 2011/12.

    For fertilizers, the biggest component of FISP, farmers’
    contribution declined from MK 950 per bag in 2005 to
    MK 500 per bag in 2012, whereas the value of the voucher
    increased from MK 1,750 per bag to MK 6,536 per bag in
    the same period.

    The actual results of the program are mixed. According to
    a recent World Bank evaluation of the program, FISP has

    reasons are that fertilizers are shared and therefore not       TABLE 2.1. LAND USE IN MALAWI (km2)

CHAPTER THREE
AGRICULTURE SECTOR RISKS
Droughts and pests and diseases are cited by Malawian stakeholders as the most dam-
aging production risks, especially for food crops. Droughts are probably the most vis-
ible risk to the sector; very bad droughts in the past have had a strong ﬁscal impact on
Malawi, necessitating help from the international community. The damaging impact
of pests and diseases is signiﬁcant but the extent of damage depends on agricultural
practices and mitigation activities. The eﬀects of pests and diseases are at times exac-
erbated by adverse weather events. Erratic rainfall and hailstorms are frequent but of
moderate or low impact.

Price volatility is an important market risk in Malawi, particularly in key crops such
as maize, tobacco, and cotton. Causes for these volatilities depend on the crop: cot-
ton prices ﬂuctuate according to world prices, whereas tobacco and maize prices are
mainly determined by the domestic market. Maize price volatilities are largely a result
of enabling environment risks due to unpredictable domestic market interventions and
export bans. Regardless of the reason, sudden ﬂuctuations in prices negatively aﬀect
farmers, the segment of the supply chain with the least risk-management capacity.

This chapter presents ﬁndings regarding the production, market, and enabling envi-
ronment risks for selected food and export crops. The impact of adverse events on
diﬀerent stakeholders is discussed in chapter 4.

FOOD CROPS—PRODUCTION RISKS
WEATHER-RELATED RISKS
Weather-related risks such as droughts, dry spells, and erratic rains constitute some of
the most important risks to the sector, although they are more predictable than they
might seem at ﬁrst glance. Drought in Malawi happens in a number of diﬀerent ways,
notably in shortened rainy seasons (because of late starts, early cessation, or both) and/
or dry spells during the rainy season. Although these weather events often come as a
shock to producers, there are certain patterns in their occurrence. The short cycles or
waves of weather patterns are aﬀected by so-called teleconnections, especially El Niño
and La Niña. Teleconnections are linkages between weather variations or anomalies

CHAPTER FOUR
ADVERSE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL RISK

OVERALL AGRICULTURAL LOSSES
Although the previous chapter provides a good overview of the types of risks pres-
ent in Malawi, for policy purposes it is important to understand their impacts in
terms of the magnitude of losses, geographic occurrence, and stakeholders aﬀected.
Without knowing how much the impacts of risks cost, where they occur, or whom
they aﬀect, it is diﬃcult to target often limited resources in a manner that eﬀectively
minimizes the impacts. This chapter attempts to quantify losses in the sector that are
larger than what could be considered as normal, to compare production and losses
between regions, and to map how this aﬀects diﬀerent stakeholders in the agriculture
sector.

The quantiﬁcation of losses captures production risks such as drought and pest and
disease outbreaks. The indicative value of agricultural output lost for particular years
(when yields are below one-third of the standard deviation of the long-term trend) is
calculated as the deviation of the actual yield from a historic yield trend multiplied by
the actual area that year. The production value is then multiplied with current pro-
ducer prices and converted into US dollars at the prevalent exchange rate. Indicative
loss values are also compared with agricultural GDP to provide a relative measure of
the loss. Figure 4.1 shows the basis for estimating indicative losses. The dark red curve
is the yield, the lighter red dotted line is the long-term trend, and the pink line with
triangular shapes marks one-third of the standard deviation. Losses are measured in
years where they fall below this point (denoted by the arrows in the ﬁgure).

Table 4.1 shows the average annual losses from production risks for selected crops.
The annual risk-related losses amount to US$149 million on average, or 3.98 per-
cent of the total annual agricultural production value in Malawi. Almost 30 percent
of losses is from maize, which suggests the great impact of agricultural produc-

RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
To better utilize scarce resources, it is important to understand which risks cause major
shocks to the sector in terms of losses and to observe the frequency at which they
occur. This chapter summarizes the risks faced by the agriculture sector and the pos-
sible solutions, as identiﬁed by the mission and validated and prioritized with stake-
holders at diﬀerent levels and at a workshop with MAFS in Lilongwe.

RISK PRIORITIZATION
Table 5.1 summarizes stakeholders’ opinions regarding agricultural risk prioritization,
deﬁned on the basis of the probability of the event and its expected impact, for food
and export crops. The darkest area of the table lists the most signiﬁcant risks based on
their potential to cause the greatest losses to the agriculture sector as a whole and the
frequency of their occurrence for any of the crops aﬀected.

From the risk prioritization exercise, and based on the frequency of realized risk events,
their capacity to cause losses, and stakeholders’ ability to manage the risks, the follow-
ing emerged as the most important risks to Malawi’s agriculture sector:
     » Drought events
     » Price volatilities and government market interventions
     » Pests and diseases

PRIORITY RISK-MANAGEMENT MEASURES
The drought and diseases/pests hazards challenging Malawi confront it on a contin-
uum of scales (for example, small, medium, and large). The vulnerability of Malawi’s
food crop sector to these risks is largely a result of the often-poor performance by
its stakeholders, institutions, and infrastructure. Low yields, inadequate infrastructure,
underfunded and low-performing supporting institutions, and unstructured markets
all leave those engaged in the agriculture sector with minimal incomes and the barest
capacity to cope with hazards.

The fact that Malawi’s climate patterns are somewhat predictable (particularly episodes
of drought at intra-seasonal, seasonal, and decadal time scales) opens up pathways

WEATHER-YIELD ANALYSIS

MALAWI’S POLITICAL DISTRICTS
To determine whether and the extent to which yield is aﬀected by climatic events, a
study was conducted on the relationship between several climatic events and diﬀer-
ent crops’ yield for Malawi. Malawi is divided into 28 political districts, as shown in
map A.1.

WEATHER INFORMATION IN MALAWI
The Malawi Meteorological Services Department’s database of 23 weather stations
has daily data from 1961–2011, or about 50 years of data from most of the stations.
Map A.2 provides the geographic location of each weather station (red dots).

DISTRIBUTION OF MONTHLY
RAINFALL IN MALAWI
Rain in Malawi follows a clear seasonal pattern throughout the year: most of the
rain falls from November to March, with the months of May–September being
generally dry. The period from January to March is usually the most humid across
the entire country. All regions within the country follow this pattern with few varia-
tions. Figure A.1 shows the average monthly distribution of rain for several weather
stations:

The pattern is evident in all stations: most of the rain falls from November to March,
with approximately 200 mm falling per month; even though the period from May to
September is generally dry, some stations receive almost no rain at all during these
months.

DROUGHT AND EXCESS
RAINFALL ANALYSIS
Once the yearly rainfall pattern has been established, it is useful to determine the
annual variability in rainfall. To determine whether a year was dry or wet, the

CLIMATE AND CLIMATE CHANGE

CURRENT CLIMATE AND WEATHER
PATTERNS IN MALAWI
Malawi has a subtropical climate (meaning hot, humid summers and mild win-
ters) that is distinctly seasonal. The warm, wet season runs from November to
March, during which most of the annual rainfall takes place. This is the main
agricultural growing season. May to August is the cool, dry season; and Septem-
ber and October constitute the hot, dry season. Although Malawi is a relatively
small country, it has large variations in topography that create significant dif-
ferences in temperature ranges and rainfall totals across the country, and thus
a diverse range of agroecological zones. Higher elevations typically see cooler
temperatures and more rainfall; for example, in the northern and southern high-
lands. The hotter and drier zones are located at lower elevations, as is the case in
the Shire River valley.

The main drivers of rainfall are the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the
Congo Air Boundary (CAB). The ITCZ is where the northern and southern hemi-
spheres’ weather systems meet. The CAB is where Indian Ocean and southern Atlan-
tic Ocean air masses meet. Flooding in Malawi is associated with both the ITCZ and
CAB bringing rain at the same time. The rainy season in Malawi is demarcated by
the passage of the ITCZ over the country. In normal years, the ITCZ begins to move
across Malawi in late October, moving southward throughout November, and begins
its return north in late March–April, marking the beginning of the dry season. Late
arrival of the ITCZ means a late start to the rainy season, and an early departure
means an early cessation. Intra-Seasonal Oscillations (ISOs), or dry spells of 10–60
days duration, can be caused by a number of atmospheric circulation patterns, includ-
ing episodes of tropical cyclone disturbances east of Madagascar and high-pressure
cells over South Africa.

Figure B.1 shows annual temperature patterns, with warmer temperatures corre-
sponding to the wet season and cooler periods to the dry season(s).

APPENDIX C
VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS15

CONTEXT
The Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee16 divided the country into 11 live-
lihood zones based on the livelihood options that households use to make a living
(table C.1). In all livelihood zones, the main source of food is own crop production,
often supplemented by food purchases from local markets. Poor households also often
sell their household labor (locally known as “ganyu”) in exchange for food.17 In some
livelihood zones, wild foods are also an important source of food, especially dur-
ing lean periods. Crop sales remain an important source of cash for households in
all the livelihood zones. In some zones where cash crops (such as tobacco and cot-
ton) are widely grown, they provide an important source of cash for households. In
all zones, food crop sales also contribute signiﬁcantly to household incomes. Other
important sources of income for the majority of households, especially the poor,
include ganyu, self-employment, and sale of nonfarm products, such as ﬁrewood and
charcoal. Table C.1 provides details of sources of food and cash in each of Malawi’s
11 livelihood zones.

Vulnerability can be perceived as the existence and the extent of a threat of pov-
erty and destitution (Dercon 2005). Regardless of how vulnerability is deﬁned, its
underlying factor is a sense of insecurity regarding the extent to which a shock or a
hazard will result in a decline in household or community welfare (Makoka 2008).
Although poverty is perceived as a static phenomenon, vulnerability is a forward-
looking measure of household welfare. Poverty can therefore be deﬁned as an ex
ante measure, whereas vulnerability is an ex post measure of household well-being
(Dercon 2001).

   MVAC is a consortium of the Malawi government, NGOs, and UN agencies in Malawi and is chaired by the Minis-
try of Economic Planning and Development. Its role is to provide accurate and timely information on food insecurity,
thereby informing policy formulation, development programs, and emergency interventions to reduce food insecurity
and vulnerability of the population.
17
   The household economy approach distinguishes the sources of food mainly into “purchase,’” “own crops,” and
“ganyu.”
