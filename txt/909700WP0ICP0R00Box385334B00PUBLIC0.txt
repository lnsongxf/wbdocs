Opening Remarks
The 11th Meeting of the International Comparison Program (ICP) 2011 Regional Coordinators (RCs)
was held on March 3, 2014 at the United Nations in New York, NY. The meeting was organized in
two sessions: I. implications of the 11th Executive Board meeting decisions; and II. regional and global
publication and communication plans. Annex 1 provides the agenda of the meeting.
In attendance were the RCs from Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, Western Asia,
and Georgia as well as secretariats of the ICP Global Office (GO), as listed in Annex 2. The meeting
was chaired by Michel Mouyelo-Katoula, ICP Global Manager.
Michel welcomed RCs and announced that the meeting would circumference the decisions made at
the 11th Executive Board meeting. He assured the RCs that the focus of the 4th and 5th waves of
results computation was to secure the consistency between the Global Office and regional results in
order to obtain the endorsement of the Executive Board. Now that the Board’s endorsement of the
results was secured, the GO would ensure that no discrepancy exists between the input data
submitted by the RCs and those used in the subsequent wave of computation. It was established
that two stages would take place in order to achieve final results: (i) the GO will confirm the regional
input data with the RCs; and (ii) the GO will apply fixity to the results and share them with RCs for
onward confirmation. Given the amount of work ahead, the RCs decided that the summary ICP 2011
results should be released on April 30, 2014.


Session I. Implications of the 11th Executive Board Meeting Decisions
GDP expenditure data
To resolve discrepancies in expenditure data, the GO will share with RCs what was received and
highlight inconsistencies and any other issues found in the data. RCs will provide answers and
improved data whenever applicable. However, if no response was received by the set deadline, the
GO will resort to fixing the issues as best they can and provide an explanatory note.
It was agreed that a basic heading for which there is a direct PPP (prices) but no value in terms of
expenditure, the GO shall either use an expenditure share borrowed from 2005 or impute a value
like 0.0001 for computation purposes.
Population
The GO will return the population data to RCs for confirmation.
Metadata
RCs will provide all outstanding metadata since the final report will show the information per
country. Africa still had a few countries remaining and Western Asia needed to translate some
responses into English.


Session II. Regional and Global Publications and Communication Plans
Each RC provided an update on their regional publication and communication plans. The GO
provided information on the global publication and communication plan.

Asia-Pacific was working on the proper language is needed for incorporating China’s data. The
release of results was anticipated by April 24, 2014.
Africa planned to present their results to the President of the AfDB and then to the Ministers of
Finance by the end of March 2014. Thus, they expected to publish a press release for the region
while the countries simultaneously produce press releases around March 25, 2014.
Latin America and the Caribbean intended to publish their results along with the GO and link via
videoconference.
Western Asia already published their regional results.
The GO planned to publish a press release along with the results. Additionally, global results would
be sent to regions for RCs to communicate to their respective regions directly. It was noted that
revised 2005 PPPs (CAR and national accounts revisions) would be published as an appendix in the
final global report. The GO would also share with the RCs the 2005 revisions for their confirmation
prior to the release.
