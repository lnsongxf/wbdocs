Preface
1.     Under the Standards and Codes Initiative, the World
Bank was mandated by the Financial Stability Forum – now
the Financial Stability Board – to develop a unified standard
for the comparative examination of business insolvency and
creditor/debtor regimes (the “ICR Standard”). The ICR
Standard is composed of the recommendations from the
United Nations Commission for International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL) Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law (the
“Guide”) (2004) and the World Bank Principles for Effective
Insolvency and Creditor Rights Systems (the “Principles”),
which were originally formulated in 2001, and subsequently
revised in 2005 and in 2011, in consultation with UNCITRAL,
the IMF and the World Bank’s international partners.
Together in the ICR Standard, the Principles and the Guide’s
recommendations represent a single point of reference for
the evaluation of enterprise distress resolution regimes. The
World Bank is responsible for supporting the efforts of
developing countries to strengthen the legal, regulatory and
institutional frameworks that govern ICR regimes through
the preparation of in -depth diagnostic Reports on the
Observation of Standards and Codes (“ROSCs”), the provision
of technical assistance and the development and
dissemination of knowledge and expertise on insolvency -
related issues.

2.    The World Bank’s Insolvency and Creditor/Debtor
Regimes Task Force (the “Task Force”) is fundamental to the
implementation of the World Bank’s mandate. Bringing
together experienced judges, expert practitioners, academics
and policymakers from around the world, the Task Force
provides an important forum for a collaborative and inclusive
dialogue on the ICR Standard to further increase
understanding and expertise on law and policy in the
insolvency area.

3.    The World Bank convened the Task Force on January
10-11, 2011 to discuss revisions to the ICR Standard as well
as a number of insolvency -related issues that arose in the
wake of the global financial crisis. As part of this discussion,
the Task Force was asked to consider, for the first time, the
topic of the insolvency of natural persons. This issue was
brought into sharp focus upon the occurrence of national
mortgage crises and the resulting global financial crisis, and
is characterized by the different regulatory treatment
afforded under national laws, with implications for
international financial stability and for economic
development and access to finance.



                               1
    4.    The World Bank conducted a preliminary survey on the
    laws of insolvency of natural persons in effect throughout
    the world in order to gather information about the existence
    of legislation addressing this issue. 1 The survey covered 59
    countries, of which 25 are high -income economies and 34
    are low - and middle -income economies. The countries
    surveyed covered 67.5 percent of the world population. The
    survey found that in more than half of the low- and middle -
    income countries surveyed there is no legislative system for
    the insolvency of natural persons at all.

    5.     Recognizing the significance of the treatment of the
    insolvency of natural persons, the Task Force discussed the
    feasibility of utilizing its expertise to study the key regulatory
    aspects underlying the insolvency of natural persons, the
    variation in legal treatment under national legal regimes and
    the implications of these divergences for international
    collaboration and coordination. 2

    6.    In the closing statement to the January 2011 Task
    Force meeting, it was stated that:

       [O]ne of the lessons from the recent financial crisis was
      the recognition of the problem of consumer insolvency as
      a systemic risk and the consequent need for the
      modernization of domestic laws and institutions to enable
      jurisdictions to deal effectively and efficiently with the
      risks of individual over -indebtedness. The importance of
      these issues to the international financial architecture that
      has been recognized in various ways by the G -20 and by
      the Financial Stability Board has today been reconfirmed

1 The survey was directed by Adolfo Rouillon, from The World Bank. The
results      of    the     survey     can        be    accessed     at

WB_TF_2011_Consumer_Insolvency.pdf. The Task Force meeting
devoted two sessions to the treatment of the insolvency of natural
persons. In the first session, participants gave a panoramic view of
comparative approaches to the insolvency of natural persons. The
session was chaired by Adolfo Rouillon (World Bank) and the panellists
were Jason Kilborn (USA), Alexander Byriukov (Ukraine), P. R. Chinien
(Mauritius), Kazuhiro Yanahira (Japan) and Luiz Fernando Valente de
Paiva (Brazil) In the second session, participants examined the issue of
the lack of guidance for personal insolvency regimes from the point of
view of international organizations. Adolfo Rouillon (World Bank)
chaired the session, and the panel included representatives from
UNCITRAL, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the
International bar Association (IBA), and the International Association of
Restructuring, Insolvency & Bankruptcy Professionals ( INSOL).


                                    2
      and emphasized by this Task Force. It is important to
      recognize the diversity of policy perspectives, values,
      cultural preferences and legal traditions that shape the
      way jurisdictions may choose to deal with the problems of
      individual over indebtedness. Yet recent events suggest
      that the expansion of access to finance, the extension of
      modern modes of financial intermediation, and the
      mobility and globalization of financial flows may have
      changed the character and scale of the risk of consumer
      insolvency in similar ways in many different economies. In
      response to these concerns, the World Bank, through the
      Legal Vice -Presidency, will organize an appropriate
      Working Group of the Insolvency Law Task Force to begin
      work on identifying the policies and general principles that
      underlie the diverse legal systems that have evolved for
      effectively managing the risks of consumer insolvency and
      individual over indebtedness in the modern context. The
      World Bank will work with its international partners and
      use its convening power to bring together a representative
      group of internationally recognized experts in order to
      address these important issues .3

   7.    Following up on the discussion at the Task Force
   meeting, the World Bank and the Task Force created a
   special working group of expert academics, judges,
   practitioners and policymakers (the “Working Group”) to
   study the issue of the insolvency of natural persons and
   produce a reflective report on this matter, suggesting
   guidance for the treatment of the different issues involved,
   taking into account different policy options and the diverse
   sensitivities around the world.

   8.    The Working Group met in Washington DC in
   November 16 -17, 2011. Over the course of the sessions, the
   participants debated numerous issues relevant to the
   insolvency of natural persons and commented on the draft
   that was submitted to the Working Group. Written
   comments were also received during the sessions and
   afterwards, in subsequent revisions of the draft. The
   comments enriched the document and were taken into
   account in the preparation of this report. Finally, the Working
   Group met again in Washington DC in December, 13 -14,
   2012, and completed its work.

I. Introduction
9.    This report addresses the insolvency of natural persons
following this structure: a first part introduces the objectives
and nature of the report, deals with general issues, and
describes the foundations of a system for the treatment of
the insolvency of natural persons. The second part of the
report analyzes the core legal attributes of system for the
treatment of the insolvency of natural persons: within this
system, the most relevant questions are analyzed in depth,
namely the design of the system and the institutional
framework, access to the system, the participation of
creditors, the solutions to the insolvency process, and
discharge.

I.1. Objectives and Nature of this Report
10. The main objective of this report is to provide
guidance on the characteristics of an effective insolvency
regime for natural persons and on the opportunities and
challenges encountered in the development of such a
regime. In this regard, the report raises awareness about the
importance of a regime for the treatment of the insolvency
of natural persons, and explores the advantages and
disadvantages of the solutions to the numerous practical
issues that have to be confronted in the design of an
insolvency regime for natural persons.

11. This report provides guidance on policy issues that
need to be addressed in developing modern legal regimes for
the treatment of the insolvency of natural persons, but it
does not purport to identify any set of “best practices” for
the regulation of the insolvency of natural persons. The
report addresses issues that fall outside the scope of the
benchmark or standard used in the ICR assessments under
the ROSC program of the World Bank and the IMF. In this
regard, it is important to recall that the ICR ROSC assessment
standard, consisting of the World Bank Principles and the
recommendations of the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide, seeks
to address the treatment of business insolvency, both for
corporate entities and for business activities of natural
persons. This report acknowledges the value of the ICR
Standard in its treatment of business insolvency and
recognizes its fundamental role in providing guidance for the
development of business insolvency regimes.


                               4
12. There is general consensus that it would be premature
to identify a single approach (or “best practice”) for the legal
treatment of the insolvency of natural persons not engaged
in business activities. The insolvency of natural persons is
intertwined with social, political and cultural issues that
present too many differences to be treated uniformly. It
would be difficult for a uniform approach to emerge out of
this effort. Policymakers should be aware of the social, legal
and economic peculiarities that may affect the functioning of
a regime for the insolvency of natural persons.

13. The fact that the development of a common set of
“best practices” is unlikely in the present state of affairs does
not imply that the insolvency of natural persons should be
left out of the scope of research and of the reform efforts of
policymakers worldwide. Indeed, this report presents a case
for the analysis that policymakers should carry out in their
own legal systems in order to better understand the effects
and benefits of the various policy choices involved in
designing an effective system for the treatment of the
insolvency of natural persons. By setting out the advantages
and disadvantages of the different and sometimes competing
approaches to the regulation of the insolvency of natural
persons, this report is designed to help policymakers develop
a better sense of the social and economic benefits of some
of the modern approaches to the regulation of the
insolvency of natural persons.


I.2. Methodology
14. This report offers a reflective, non-prescriptive
approach to the treatment of the insolvency of natural
persons: by describing specific problems, and specific
solutions with their positive and negative consequences, it
provides a map of the questions faced in the complex task of
creating a regime for the treatment of the insolvency of
natural persons, as well as ideas and alternatives for the
benefit of those involved in insolvency reform and of those
affected, in any capacity, by the application of insolvency
laws.

15. The report presents solutions to problems experienced
in the regulation and implementation of systems for the
insolvency of natural persons. The countries on which these
observations are based are not identified, for the sake of
universality, to which this report aspires, and on the
understanding that the lessons learned in certain systems
may provide very valid precedents for other countries. At any
rate, the observations included in this report are based on
tested models and practical experiences.


                               5
16. The report also references a number of empirical
studies. Legal scholarship on the insolvency of natural
persons has benefited from the work of specialists who have
produced research based on the empirical analysis of the
implementation and application of systems of insolvency of
natural persons. Those invaluable studies have been taken
into account in the elaboration of this report, and some of
them are referenced in footnotes to provide ready examples,
though these references should not be regarded as an
exhaustive list of all available studies that have influenced
the observations provided in this report.

I.3. Terminology
17.    By “insolvency,” this report refers not to a particular
legal structure or approach, but rather to the distressed
condition of the debtor and the constellation of potential
approaches to treating that condition. This report uses the
term “insolvency” rather than the variety of terms in use
throughout the world today to describe various systems
offering some combination of collective creditor redress and
alleviation of the burdens of debt on an insolvent debtor.
Whether it be called “bankruptcy”, “sequestration”, “debt
relief” or “debt adjustment,” the common, unifying factor, is
the focus of this report: any system for alleviating the
burdens of excessive debt and allocating benefits and losses,
both among creditors and as between creditors and natural
person debtors, falls within the intended ambit of
“treatment of insolvency of natural persons.” If such a
system exists or is contemplated in any given country, to
whatever extent, its characteristics and effects are intended
to be encompassed within the discussion to follow,
regardless of the label assigned to that system.

18. This report refers, generically, to the “insolvency of
natural persons”. As discussed below, the coverage of all
situations of insolvency of natural persons presents some
problems of delimitation (see Section I.7.C below). The focus
of this report is on all the questions that affect the debtor as
a person, and the report does not adopt the approach of
defining painstakingly all of the debtors who are natural
persons and who are the objects of the analysis here
developed. Having recognized the value and relevance of the
ICR Standard, and stating clearly that the ICR Standard
governs the insolvency of natural persons who are engaged
in business activities (i.e. traders or merchants), this report
focuses its attention on the personal aspects of insolvency:
these aspects are prevalent in the insolvency of persons who
cannot be said to be engaged in significant business activity,
but they also exist in the cases of individuals who can be
classified as “traders”, “merchants”, or “entrepreneurs”. The
report avoids the use of the expression “consumer
insolvency” because it would raise similar questions as to the

                               6
distinction between consumers and non -consumers in
numerous legal systems. Instead, the report uses the
expressions “insolvency of natural persons” and “personal
insolvency” indistinctly. The report addresses the questions
posed by the insolvency of individuals, rather than the
questions raised by the interaction of business activities and
commercial credit. It is for policymakers to determine the
relevance of the analysis contained in this report to the
specific circumstances that affect insolvent individuals in
their particular legal systems.

I.4. Precedents
19. This report was prepared using numerous sources for
and experiences in, the regulation of the insolvency of
natural persons around the world.

20. The national experiences in the design of effective
insolvency regimes for natural persons are too numerous to
be listed here, but they have served as the basis for the
analysis developed in this report.

21. The study of the regimes of the insolvency of natural
persons has benefited from reports from different
international organizations, including the following:

   (a) INSOL International’s Consumer Debt Report I (2001)
   and Consumer Debt Report II (2011);
   (b) The Council of Europe’s report Legal Solutions to
   Debt Problems in Credit Societies (2005);
   (c) The European Commission’s reports, Consumer
   Overindebtedness and Consumer Law in the European
   Union (2003), and Towards a Common Operational
   European Definition of Over -Indebtedness (2008);
   (d) Consumers International’s Model Law on Family
   Insolvency for Latin America and the Caribbean (2011).
I.5. Intended Users of this Report
22.    The potential readership of this report comprises all
those who are interested in the development of regimes for
the insolvency of natural persons:

   (a) Policymakers wishing to design a balanced system for
   the treatment of the insolvency of natural persons;
   (b) International organizations, both governmental and
   non-governmental;
   (c) Members of the judiciary;
   (d) Lawyers and insolvency practitioners;


                              7
   (e) Financial and credit institutions that provide credit to
   natural persons; and
   (f) All persons and institutions involved in insolvency
   reform and reform assistance.
23. Not all of these potential readers will have legal
training. Accordingly, the report is intended to be formulated
in an accessible “plain language” style.

24. The report has been formulated in a fashion that
enables it to be used by countries with diverse legal
traditions. It uses neutral generic terminology, except where
the analysis requires the use of specific legal terms belonging
to certain systems.

I.6. Context and Coordination of Insolvency Treatment
     for Natural Persons
25. Any consideration of a regime for addressing the
insolvency of natural persons should take into account the
surrounding context of laws, policies, and practices with
which such a regime must necessarily coordinate. Perhaps
most directly, a regime for addressing the insolvency of
natural persons is essentially an extension, a final stage of
the enforcement system, in particular the procedural regime
for enforcing obligations and property rights. Less directly,
but no less importantly, insolvency regimes for natural
persons implicate salient issues of data protection and
personal privacy, as well as a host of social and economic
regulatory issues such as individual counseling, education,
social welfare provision, and family and housing policy. Both
practically and as a matter of legal policy, financial distress
and insolvency are inextricably linked with credit extension,
banking, taxation, and business entrepreneurship, as well as
with the more fundamental laws of contractual and delictual
obligations and property—and the interaction of the
obligations and property regimes. How any society regards
debt will affect any consideration of the treatment of the
excessive burdens of that debt. For example, a given legal or
cultural system might regard debts as a collective obligation
of a family, tribe or some larger group beyond the individual
debtor most directly responsible for the creation of the
obligation. The need for and proper structure of a system for
treating insolvency would be profoundly affected by such a
perspective, which differs from the basic notion of individual
liability upon which the discussion in this report—and most
present insolvency systems—is premised.

26. The degree to which each of these coordinate systems
functions satisfactorily -or not - in any given country will
necessarily affect a proper assessment of a potential
insolvency regime for natural persons, both in general and

                              8
with respect to specific provisions and implementation
strategies. Many countries, for example, continue to struggle
with “rule of law” issues, including low popular acceptance
of and adherence to law generally, an insufficiently
supported or qualified judiciary, and even corruption in one
or more levels of government. The degree to which an
insolvency mechanism might function against—or in spite
of—a backdrop of such systemic weaknesses is an important
consideration to take into account.

27. The need for and the desired extent and operation of
an insolvency system for natural persons will not only be
influenced by such coordinate areas of law and society, an
insolvency regime will also influence the structure and
operation of these surrounding systems. To take a simple
example, a country without a robust system of lending and
borrowing may well have far less need for a system of natural
person insolvency, but other sources of obligations and their
enforcement may produce the pernicious effects discussed
below, and thus an insolvency system could play at least a
limited role in achieving some of the benefits described
below. Conversely, the existence or absence of a system of
natural person insolvency might well affect the willingness or
ability of creditors to make financing available to consumers
or entrepreneurs, though the specific direction and extent of
these theoretical effects is subject to substantial uncertainty,
despite a wealth of research and academic debate on the
issue.

28. Likewise, a country may choose to deal with the
challenges of personal financial distress not through a
specific system concentrated on the treatment of insolvency,
but through broad limitations on the enforcement of
judgments and other claims. Another alternative could be an
aggressive regime of what might be called “consumer
protection,” even if such a system protects small
businesspeople and others who are not “pure” consumers.
Conversely, the existence of an insolvency regime for natural
persons may well alleviate or exacerbate pressure in other
areas of a country’s legal and social infrastructure. For
example, issues of inefficient enforcement of claims, poor
counseling and financial education infrastructure, weak (or
liberal) credit regulation, and incentives for entrepreneurship
might be dealt with to a greater or lesser degree in an
insolvency system rather than through more direct
regulation.

29. Different policymakers may well come to different
conclusions as to the proper methods and places to guide
and influence behavior through social or economic
regulation (or the lack thereof). Part of an assessment of an
insolvency regime for natural persons, however, must be to
take into account how such a system might fit within broader
societal factors and the policy choices made in other areas of
                               9
law that constrain or allow the kinds of practices and
behaviors implicated in the insolvency of natural persons.
Some of these practices and behaviors are discussed in
Section I.8 below, and Section I.7.E again emphasizes that
diversity of approach is all but inevitable in a world marked
by different policy choices in what might be called “non -
insolvency law.”

I.7. Scope, General Goals and Distinguishing
     Characteristics of an Insolvency Regime for Natural
     Persons
30.     The notion of an insolvency regime for natural persons
is by no means a monolithic concept. Natural persons engage
in a wide variety of activities with implications for debt and
indebtedness. Financial distress can manifest itself in very
different forms, insolvency can arise from a diverse range of
causes, and policymakers might select from among a range
of very different approaches to combating one or another
form or degree of financial distress. Therefore, any
discussion of a regime of insolvency for natural persons must
begin by considering the scope of the topic to be
encompassed—or left aside for treatment elsewhere. This
section thus identifies the carefully limited scope of this
report, focusing on the characteristics of the debtors and the
type of financial distress treatment addressed here. It also
clarifies the primary distinctions among the general goals
and key elements of different kinds of regimes for
responding to financial distress involving natural persons,
especially those engaged to a greater or lesser degree in
business activity.



A)   Treatment, not Prevention, of Insolvency
31. As discussed in Section I.6 above, the relatively narrow
subject of this report is situated in the midst of an extremely
broad constellation of topics with a direct or indirect
relationship with the financial distress of natural persons.
One topic especially closely related to the treatment of
insolvency is the prevention of insolvency. Policy discussions
and legal reforms in many current systems have incorporated
a desire to address insolvency by avoiding it altogether
through such techniques as more expansive credit reporting
and financial literacy training. Financial literacy education in
particular might be implemented within a system for treating
existing insolvency, although the primary purpose of such
education is not to treat existing insolvency, but rather to
prevent repeat insolvency.

                              10
32. An entire report could be devoted to an exploration of
the need for, proper structure, and effectiveness of such
preventive measures. These issues are quite complex and
subject to substantial debate and disagreement among
experts. Accordingly, to avoid getting mired in a parallel
series of disputes and to maintain focus, this report will not
address preventive measures. Rather, it will address only the
treatment of already existing insolvency in the context of
natural persons.

B)   Treatment of Insolvency, not Poverty
33. Regimes for providing insolvency relief to natural
persons are commonly compared to regimes for providing
social or welfare assistance, especially to the impoverished.
While insolvency and social support regimes can work in
tandem, and there might be a small area of overlap in
coverage, these distinct systems are designed with distinct
goals in mind. As discussed in Section I.8, below, most of the
goals of insolvency regimes are economic in focus, avoiding
waste and enhancing productivity. While the structures and
goals of social assistance regimes vary greatly, they are
generally driven primarily if not exclusively by humanitarian
concerns for social solidarity and social planning, often
whether or not this has any positive economic impact on any
segment of society. While some of the goals of insolvency
also involve compassion and a general desire to relieve
suffering, goals relating to economic performance and
efficiency are at least equally as prominent, if not
predominant.

34. The primary goal of most social support regimes is
simply to redistribute income or other types of resources to
individuals who lack them and are somehow inhibited from
accumulating appropriate resources for themselves. This
redistribution often occurs over extended periods of time,
and it might be offered regardless of “need.” Social
assistance systems generally are designed to ensure that
every member of society has access to a baseline level of
resources to meet their basic needs such as food, shelter,
and healthcare. Of course, this goal is marked by conflicting
visions of an appropriate baseline. Some social assistance is
extended to support other social goals, such as reproduction
and parenthood (e.g., child allowances). One need not have
any debt burden to qualify for social assistance.

35. Insolvency regimes are less like social assistance , and
more like social insurance, protecting individuals from
financial tragedy. For some debtors, an insolvency regime
might function somewhat like a social assistance program
designed specifically to support individuals with
unmanageable debt and prevent unnecessary suffering and
social exclusion. But insolvency systems do not offer cash

                             11
support payments, and far from every overburdened debtor
faces social exclusion and utter destitution. Lack of resources
to meet basic needs may well lead to problems managing
debt, but these two problems do not always appear together.
Indeed, some have questioned the appropriateness of
extending insolvency relief to impoverished debtors who are
completely and permanently reliant on social assistance.
Many of the benefits for creditors and society discussed in
Section I.8 below are not available in such cases. Others have
pointed out that some of the benefits are present even in
such cases; e.g., those relating to reducing wasteful
collections costs and stress and health problems, not to
mention the humanitarian and religious concerns for offering
relief to debtors themselves. These advantages are present
even—and perhaps especially—in cases involving so -called
“judgment -proof” debtors, with no assets or income that can
be seized by creditors under ordinary restrictions on
enforcement.

36. Most debtors served by an insolvency regime will rely
on social assistance -e.g., unemployment or medical
assistance - only temporarily, if at all. An insolvency regime
serves mainly individuals who do not suffer from a long -term
disability or general surfeit of resources and who thus do not
need affirmative social support. Insolvency regimes are
designed primarily and work best for individuals who are
capable of producing sufficient income to support
themselves and their families, but an overwhelming debt
burden saps their initiative and depresses their productive
capacity. These debtors do not seek more government
intervention in their lives; they seek less government
intervention from officially sanctioned wasteful and
destructive debt enforcement action. The goal is to stop
counterproductive debt collection, not to receive financial or
other resources.

37. Fundamentally, the core distinction between regimes
to combat poverty and regimes to treat insolvency is that the
problem of poverty cannot be “solved” in one procedure for
any given individual, whereas the practical problems of
insolvency can be solved in one procedure. The real
problems of insolvency flow not from the fact of inability to
pay, but from creditors’ and the state’s failure to recognize
inability to pay and to appropriately curtail the pointless and
destructive pursuit of uncollectible debts. Stopping these
pursuits, or at least striking a rational compromise for
satisfying them, is an almost instantaneous solution to the
core practical problems that distressed debt poses for
creditors, debtors, and society.

38. One might argue that an insolvency regime imposes a
redistribution of resources away from creditors, but as
discussed below, preventing creditors’ pursuit of an illusion
of collectable debt does not deprive creditors of a real
                             12
    “resource”, it simply prompts them to accept reality and stop
    the wasteful continuing pursuit of chimerical returns. The
    losses confirmed in this process may well be financed
    indirectly by society -much like a social assistance regime - as
    creditors increase the cost of credit, but this is in many cases
    the result of the fact of the debtor’s insolvency, not the
    result of the insolvency relief process itself.

    39. In addition, a properly functioning insolvency regime
    should provide relief only to those debtors in need, and relief
    should be delivered in a brief procedure. Most debtors are
    able to manage their reasonable debt burdens, even if they
    experience some measure of distress along the way, so only
    a limited percentage of all debtors are expected to obtain
    relief through an insolvency procedure. Such a regime is
    designed only to provide relief needed by debtors whose
    means are expected to be overwhelmed by their debt
    servicing obligations for some extended period of time. This
    state is often referred to as “over -indebtedness.” Although
    this term is variously defined, 4 the core concept generally is
    the debtor’s ongoing inability to service current obligations
    on all outstanding obligations as they become due. This
    situation often leads to a downward spiral of growing
    indebtedness from which the debtor cannot escape without
    intervention from the type of relief system envisioned in this
    report. Most likely, this mismatch between disposable
    income and debt service will have been triggered by one of
    the many accidents of life, such as unemployment, illness,
    divorce, or other income interruption or unexpected
    expense. Any well -designed insolvency regime will impose
    some entry requirements, as discussed below. By removing
    or alleviating the unserviceable debt burden and
    reinvigorating the debtor’s capacity for self -support, an
    insolvency procedure provides relief not gradually over an
    extended time, but quite quickly. Within a relatively short
    period of time following an insolvency procedure, most
    debtors who can benefit from an insolvency system will be
    back on solid financial footing, and most of these debtors
    will not be expected to seek more relief later.



C) Insolvency of Natural Persons: “Pure” Consumers
versus those Engaged in Business
    40. One particular area of law with which a regime for
    natural person insolvency must coordinate is business

4 For a discussion of the challenges involved in defining ‘over -
indebtedness’, especially in contrast to other measures of financial
distress, such as insolvency, see Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills, Credit, Debt & Financial Difficulty in Britain , 2009/10: A
Report using data from the YouGov DebtTrack Survey (2011).

                                  13
insolvency. Many of the same issues of law, policy, and
practice that arise in business insolvency might also arise in
the context of addressing the insolvency of natural persons.
This is especially true when the insolvent natural person is or
has been also engaged in business, whether or not the
insolvency arises as a direct consequence of business
activity. See Section I.7.D below for a discussion of the main
policy distinctions between business insolvency and the
insolvency of natural persons.

41. In some insolvency systems, traders, artisans and self -
employed professionals can become debtors in general
insolvency procedures, whereas other natural persons may
be excluded from these procedures. On the other hand, in
many other countries, the debtor in an insolvency procedure
can be, in principle at least, any individual or entity, including
natural persons who have become indebted in their private,
non-business capacity. However, if the insolvency law of such
a country does not include a discharge of debt—or makes it
quite difficult to obtain a discharge—natural persons not
engaged in business rarely file for insolvency, even if the
procedure is available. In recent decades, many systems have
evolved to provide debt relief to natural persons, and some
of these systems exclude debtors with significant on -going
business activity, though there is a notable trend to find
specific solutions for debtors with relatively limited ongoing
business activity.

42. As explained in the Preface of this report, the ICR
Standard governs the proper treatment of business
insolvency. For natural persons with substantial business
activity representing most or all of the indebtedness giving
rise to the situation of insolvency to be treated, the ICR
Standard represents the source of guidance on the proper
approach to and structure of a regime of business insolvency.
This report does not diminish the relevance of the ICR
Standard.
43. Two essential differences distinguish this document
from the ICR Standard: First, unlike the ICR Standard, this
document makes reflections and provides guidance, as
explained in Section I.1 above. It is explicitly non -
prescriptive, leaving readers to arrive at their own
conclusions taking into account different policy options and
the diverse sensitivities around the world. This document
does not create a “standard,” and it contains no
recommendations or “best practices”; rather, it simply
identifies particularly salient issues and offers empirical
observations from experts regarding evolving practices and
the results of those practices around the world.
44.    Second, while the ICR Standard concentrates on the
resolution of business insolvency, whether the debtor is a
natural or artificial entity, this report focuses on those issues
                               14
most relevant to natural persons as debtors, whether or not
engaged in business. To be sure, the ICR Standard contains
discussion of several topics that are equally relevant for the
treatment of insolvency of natural persons not engaged in
business; for example, the functions and qualifications of
insolvency representatives and other system administrators,
and the importance and design of a moratorium or stay of
actions against the debtor and the debtor’s property to
provide “breathing space” for the development of a payment
plan or other resolution. Nonetheless, the ICR Standard was
not designed to address the specific and often unique
concerns of natural person debtors whose insolvency has
limited or no connection to business activity. Consequently,
such concerns are the primary focus of this report. Legal
issues that are relevant primarily to the insolvency of
businesses or traders are only referred to here when some
salient distinction is to be drawn between the operation of
such issues in business cases and in those involving natural
persons engaged in little or no significant business activity.

45.     This report is not restricted, however, to debtors with
little or no business activity. The premise of this report is
that insolvent natural persons face a shared core of key
issues, whether or not business activity is a part of the
context of the insolvency, and these concerns differ in
important respects from those discussed in the context of
the ICR Standard. All insolvency regimes have the potential
to share key elements and issues; nonetheless, this report
proceeds from the standpoint that any debtor’s status as a
natural person raises unique considerations that are at least
equally central, if not more so, to the proper structure and
assessment of a system for addressing natural person
insolvency. A multi -national corporate conglomerate
certainly has relevant similarities with the individual
proprietor of a local food stand in terms of regulating the
insolvencies of these businesses. However, the shared
characteristics are at least as central, if not significantly more
so, as between the local food stand owner and a “pure”
consumer with no business activity.

46.     This report focuses on the issues that differentiate any
natural person’s insolvency from the insolvency of an
artificial entity, and it addresses common insolvency issues, if
at all, only from the distinct perspective of individual natural
persons and their specific needs, motivations, and other
characteristics. In other words, as discussed in Section I.7.D,
below, this report focuses on issues most implicated by the
“human factor” inherent in any insolvency case involving a
natural person as debtor.

47. Similar “scope” observations might be made with
respect to natural persons engaged in other specific business
or professional activities. For example, this report highlights
concerns that will inevitably arise in the context of natural
                               15
persons engaged in farming operations; thus, it does
conceivably apply to the insolvency of farmers. Once again,
however, the focus here is on natural persons and the issues
that unite a farming debtor and a non -farming debtor in that
context. Little or no specific reference is made to the specific
concerns of natural persons engaged in agricultural
production or any other specific industry, though this report
should not be read as downplaying the existence or
importance of specific challenges related to, for example, the
insolvency of debtors engaged in farming (e.g., land tenure,
government subsidies, and farm financing).

48.      As the ICR Standard expressly acknowledges, it is
often quite difficult to draw a meaningful distinction
between “business” and “non -business” or “pure consumer”
debtors. Natural persons commonly carry heavy debt loads
after a termination of business activity. This kind of debt load
may derive from a business that debtors have carried out in
their own name or in a partnership, in which the partners
have personal liability for the debts of the partnership. Quite
often debtors have become personally liable for debts
because they have given personal guarantees for the loans of
a company with limited liability. Such debtors may have
different connections with that company, for example, as
shareholders or directors of the company or as next of kin of
such persons. Also, persons who engage in small -scale
business activity in their own name are often essentially in a
similar situation as wage -earning debtors who have become
insolvent. For example, if the main source of debt is a
housing loan or a guarantee for another person’s loan, there
is little salient difference between wage earners and debtors
who earn their living by providing services to a small number
of different clients. While this kind of business activity has
traditionally been common among artisans, craftsmen,
traders, farmers, and many providers of professional
services, the transformation of the labor market during the
past few decades has turned many providers of low -skill
services from employees into self -employed service
providers.

49. Where and whether to draw a boundary line in the law
at the point where business (or farming) considerations end
and personal considerations begin, or where business (or
farming) insolvency considerations predominate over natural
person insolvency considerations is, once again, a matter for
individual readers to assess. This report highlights the most
salient considerations for natural person debtors of all kinds,
to allow policymakers to evaluate for themselves whether
and to what degree the specific and unifying concerns of
natural person insolvency warrant special treatment in the
distinct context of any given country.



                              16
D) Distinction between Business Insolvency and the
Insolvency of Natural Persons
50. The contrast between business and natural person
insolvency regimes is essentially the opposite of the contrast
between insolvency and social assistance relief, discussed in
Section I.7.B above. Whereas social assistance programs
usually rest almost exclusively on humanitarian goals,
insolvency relief for natural persons also involves a powerful
element of economic concern. Business insolvency regimes
lie at the other end of this spectrum; that is, while insolvency
relief for natural persons does include some element of
humanitarian empathy, business insolvency policy is driven
almost exclusively by economic concerns. At the very least,
arguments supporting business insolvency that are not
entirely economic in nature usually respond to a desire to
support communities and jobs as a positive side -effect of
saving failing businesses. In addition, the desire to relieve
individual suffering is more direct and more central in the
context of natural person insolvency. On the other hand, in
the insolvency of companies and other legal entities, the
debtor can be and often is completely dismembered and
allowed to die. One of the primary goals of a regime of
insolvency for natural persons, in contrast, is avoiding this
fate for the debtor, not just in light of the negative
consequences for other people in the debtor’s household
and community.

51. As explored in Section I.8 below, many of the goals of
the two types of insolvency regimes overlap, such as
increasing and more fairly distributing payment to creditors,
reducing waste and redundant burdens on official entities,
and enhancing economic performance for the ultimate
benefit of society. The human element often adds a slight
but important twist to several of these economic goals. Take,
for example, the goal of reinvigorating natural person
debtors and offering them an incentive to engage in income -
producing activity. Artificial entities need not be given
incentives to remain productive; their human owners can
simply shut them down and restart their business activity
somewhere else, though at significant expense. Nonetheless,
the process of restructuring a company’s debt burdens
results in continued productivity, avoiding a long interruption
while the entrepreneurs re -launch their business elsewhere.
Often in the context of business insolvency, it is
fundamentally the human element behind the business that
needs to be protected. If the entrepreneur is ruined with no
access to personal insolvency relief, the opportunity for
accessing future productive, entrepreneurial energies is lost.
Only a regime of insolvency relief for natural persons can get
to the heart of this problem.


                              17
    52. Not only the goals and techniques, but also the
    assumptions underlying the two different types of insolvency
    systems differ for important reasons. For example, business
    insolvency rules are often crafted on the -usually unstated -
    assumption that the actors involved, including the debtor,
    are fully rational economic actors who took on -or should
    have taken on - debts with full and adequate information. A
    wealth of behavioral studies now makes clear that this
    foundational assumption is wholly inappropriate in the
    context of most natural persons. 5 Especially if the debtor has
    not had the benefit of expert advice—as will usually be the
    case for debtors with mainly consumption -type loans—
    natural persons seldom behave in a way consistent with the
    classical economic ideals on which business insolvency
    systems are founded. Likewise, the positive and negative
    incentives, and the benefits and sanctions built into business
    insolvency systems are less likely to influence natural persons
    -especially those not engaged in business - in the same way
    as sophisticated commercial entities with well -supported
    advisory resources.



E) The Divergence in the Treatment of Natural Person
Insolvency under National Legal Regimes
    53. In the design and implementation of an insolvency
    regime for natural persons, it is most likely the case that one
    size does not fit all. As acknowledged in Section I.6 above,
    various regions, nations, groups, and even individuals have
    starkly contrasting views on the religious, moral, cultural,
    and economic implications of debt, risk, and forgiveness.
    Other important topics are similarly subject to widely
    divergent viewpoints, including notions of collective versus
    individual responsibility, obligations running from society to
    individuals and vice versa, and formal versus informal
    dispute resolution. More concrete factors also create very
    different foundations for supporting an insolvency system,
    including institutional capacities of a variety of kinds, the
    stability of the banking or other lending sector, and the
    scope and nature of economic activity, especially the
    prevalence of personal versus impersonal exchange and

activity involving credit and borrowing. Not all creditors are
large institutions, and the ripple effects of declaring some
claims to be uncollectible can wreak havoc on a small
economy, especially one based on close personal
relationships—though, as discussed below, it is likely the fact
of insolvency, not the system for confirming and relieving it,
that is responsible for this problem. The many factors that
affect and are affected by an insolvency system were
mentioned in Section I.6 above.

54. In light of these widespread and fundamental
divergences in circumstance, philosophy, and capacity,
international institutions must take care in avoiding a
“mainstreaming” approach, compelling countries to adopt
regimes or aspects of regimes that are incompatible with
local conditions. The many benefits of such regimes may be
more or less attractive, and more or less applicable, in
various countries. Likewise, discrete aspects of these regimes
might be more appropriate for some social, cultural,
economic, political, and judicial structures than for others.
The current state of insolvency regimes for natural persons
demonstrates this. Despite the close connections and
similarities among the some two dozen nations that have
adopted full -fledged insolvency regimes for natural persons
today, the structure and operation of these systems differ,
often dramatically, from country to country, even in the
closely clustered nations of Northern, Central, and Western
Europe. Many of these differences will be explored in this
report, though the reasons for these differences remain
difficult if not impossible to explain adequately.

55. In light of these considerations, this report offers not
prescriptions and direct recommendations, but simply
reflections. It represents the observations of expert
researchers not on the state of the art, but on the variety of
approaches taken to various aspects of insolvency relief
systems, and the benefits and obstacles that have revealed
themselves over the past several decades of especially
vibrant growth in these systems. It identifies issues to be
considered in any insolvency regime for natural persons,
alternative means of addressing those issues, and the
consequences of making one or another choice, based on
empirical observations from existing systems. This report
thus does not endeavor to convince policymakers throughout
the world to follow the example of the various regimes
existing today; it aims to enrich their own independent
development process by considering the successes and
struggles of a growing number of countries that have reaped
the benefits of an insolvency regime for natural persons.


I.8. Foundations of Insolvency for Natural Persons

                             19
56. In order to evaluate any regime of insolvency for
natural persons, one has to consider the particular salutary
effects of such a system. In particular, as discussed above,
one has to distinguish these effects from those pursued by
other similar systems, such as social safety nets (welfare) and
business insolvency. In considering whether to adopt an
insolvency regime for natural persons, and which approach
to take with respect to various aspects of the structure of
that system, lawmakers should bear in mind the broad range
of purposes to be served and the degree to which each of
these purposes is relevant for any given country’s cultural,
political, and economic circumstances.

57. In the past several decades, lawmakers from a variety
of regions have explicitly identified and evaluated a wide
range of desired benefits to be achieved by an insolvency
regime for natural persons. The desired benefits fall into at
least three distinct categories: First, benefits for creditors
have historically constituted the main objective of insolvency
regimes, which until the late twentieth century had been
often primarily if not exclusively designed for business
debtors. Second, more recent discussions of insolvency
regimes, especially those specifically designed for non -
business debtors, have focused on the benefits for debtors
and their families. While the creditor -debtor relationship
often has been viewed in simple binary terms, a third
category of much more substantial benefits has now also
received substantial attention: benefits redounding to
broader segments of society and to society as a whole. As
the discussion below will reveal, this third category
encompasses a much longer and more significant list of
benefits and purposes for an insolvency regime for natural
persons. It is this category on which lawmakers seem to have
concentrated most attention when evaluating the need for
and the desired effects of such systems. In general,
policymakers have taken care, as they should, to maintain a
balanced approach in evaluating the distribution of benefits
and burdens among these three interest groups.



A)   Benefits for Creditors
58. A legal regime of insolvency never exists in a vacuum.
From the perspective of creditors, such a system is necessary
in large part in response to a weakness or failure in a
coordinate system. An insolvency regime benefits creditors
primarily by addressing two major weaknesses of the system
of ordinary enforcement of obligations (collections); namely,
(1) ineffective mechanisms for finding value and the resulting
waste resulting from individual creditors’ blindly pursuing
enforcement actions to the detriment of themselves and
other creditors, and (2) inequitable distribution of available

                              20
value to one or a few aggressive or sophisticated creditors, to
the detriment of the collective of all creditors. These
weaknesses theoretically could be overcome without a
separate insolvency system if the enforcement system were
restructured. Proposals for such an approach have arisen in
some countries, though to date, lawmakers seem to have
concluded that adopting an insolvency system represents a
more efficient and effective means of increasing payment to
creditors and enhancing the fair distribution of such
payments among all creditors. These benefits and the
arguments that support them are largely identical in the
context of insolvency of both debtors engaged in business
and “pure” consumers, and they have existed largely
unchanged since the very advent of the idea of a formal
response to financial distress.

      (i)    Increasing Payment to Individual Creditors
59. Most fundamentally, an insolvency regime might
address weaknesses in the ordinary system of enforcement
of obligations by supplanting it entirely as the collection
mechanism of choice. When the ordinary enforcement
system is hindered by formalities, restrictions, and
inefficiencies of a variety of kinds, independent insolvency
regimes might offer creditors a more effective means—
perhaps the only effective means—to coerce payment from
debtors. Even if the ordinary enforcement regime works
relatively well, however, an insolvency regime might enhance
its operation in several important ways.

60. The simplest enhancement of a collective insolvency
system is eliminating the waste inherent in multiple
individual enforcement actions and fire sales of the debtor’s
assets. Without a collective insolvency regime, each creditor
has to engage and finance its own investigation of the
debtor’s assets. If the debtor claims financial distress, each
creditor has to decide whether the debtor’s claims of
inability to pay are credible and whether further investment
in collections efforts should be avoided. In close cases, each
individual creditor has little incentive to maximize the value
of a limited pool of assets or to avoid wasting value in
depressed “fire sales.” Laboring under the dual burdens of
information asymmetry and uncertainty, each creditor has an
incentive to spend money on enforcement action, acting
hastily to extract as much value as possible to protect its own
interests. Individual, uncoordinated enforcement actions
might represent a dead -weight loss if the assets produce no
return beyond the enforcement costs. Even if significant
asset value is available, such actions inevitably destroy value
and increase losses for many if not most creditors that could
be avoided by coordinated, collective action. An insolvency
regime can offer creditors more convincing evidence of the
folly of further collections, allowing creditors to avoid the

                             21
expense of a multiplication of unsuccessful enforcement
actions. For whatever assets are available, a collective
insolvency regime concentrates the administrative expenses
of enforcement into one proceeding in which an
administrator maximizes the value of assets for all creditors.

61. A related enhancement concerns the identification and
location of the debtor’s assets. Maximizing the value of
assets requires creditors first to find assets. Even if some
source of value is found, individual creditors face significant
costs in pursuing those sources of value, often in
competition with a debtor intent on evading or at least
hindering these pursuits. Ordinary enforcement proceedings
generally contain some mechanism for coercing the debtor
to reveal the location of assets, but positive incentives
generally work more effectively in making debtors reveal
their assets than do negative threats. At the very least,
debtors might be more forthcoming with respect to the
location of assets if they can rest assured that they will have
to undergo such an inquiry only once in a collective
proceeding, avoiding a multiplicity of inconvenient
interruptions of their lives. More likely, an insolvency
proceeding can provide an incentive in the form of a global
delay or even discharge of renewed collections actions in
exchange for debtors’ being forthcoming about the location
of their present assets.

62. As attractive as these “asset -based” benefits are in the
business context, they are generally far less valuable in the
context of natural persons, especially those with no ongoing
business activity. Although natural persons engaged in
business might have business assets to distribute among
creditors, most individual debtors have little or no available
asset value by the time enforcement actions have begun to
multiply. As discussed in Section II.5.B below, creditors are
likely to recover payment from a natural person only if they
can gain access to some source of future value. Luckily for
creditors, unlike corporations, natural persons cannot fade
out of existence, dissolving upon the conclusion of
insolvency proceedings. Individuals will continue to produce
income from business or work or to receive external support
of some kind. More important than locating assets, the
benefit of an insolvency system lies in creating asset value by
encouraging debtors to be productive, facilitating
compromise payment of some of that future value to
creditors, and monitoring compliance with that compromise
over a period of years. Experience suggests that such
benefits can be severely limited in the context of natural
persons not engaged in business, as discussed in Section II.5
below, but even the promise of a limited benefit is better
than a sure loss. Another effect of the existence of an
insolvency system for natural persons is that it encourages
proper valuation of claims, and in this way creditors admit

                             22
their losses and, in most systems, claim tax deductions for
them (see Section I.8.C (i) below).

63. Most ordinary enforcement systems contain no
mechanism for forcing debtors to work to produce future
value for creditors. Indeed, the abolition of slavery and debt
peonage in most areas by the mid -nineteenth century
rendered unlawful most forms of legally coerced labor to pay
off debt. Even debtor’s prison is not a sure method of
coercing debtors to pay, and the tragic irony of imprisoning
debtors in order to goad them into working to pay creditors
ought to be obvious. Imprisonment for debt was abandoned
in most areas at the same time and for many of the same
reasons as slavery and debt peonage, though also because it
was spectacularly ineffective in producing payment for
creditors.
64. Although the debtor’s person today is largely insulated
from debt enforcement, the debtor’s property is not, and the
most important type of property —wages and other
earnings— has become the dominant target of collections
actions. Garnishment of wages and other debts owed to
debtors was limited in the middle of the twentieth century in
many systems, but even with these limitations, garnishment
exposes a significant portion of debtors’ income to
expropriation by creditors. If most or all of their future
earnings are destined for creditors, debtors have little
incentive to produce income and instead they have a natural
incentive to “go on strike” and simply refuse to work for the
benefit of their creditors. Debtors might simply rely on public
assistance to support themselves and their families, or they
might withdraw into the underground or “black market”
economy, producing value that cannot be accessed by
creditors. Indeed, even in the regular economy of some
especially large nations, natural person debtors can easily
move from job to job and hide business income entirely,
temporarily or permanently hindering creditors’ efforts to
find value.
65. Here again, positive incentives are far more effective
than punishment, and an insolvency regime can offer a
respite or discharge as a very effective incentive for debtors
to produce value to share with creditors. Without the
incentives an insolvency system can offer, the alternative for
creditors of natural persons is generally not payment; it is a
lifetime of fruitless pursuit by creditors of debtors
completely withdrawn from regular economic life.
Experience in many countries over the past several decades
attests to the effectiveness of insolvency regimes in
providing incentives to debtors to produce value for creditors
that simply would not have been realized otherwise.
66. An essential aspect of getting debtors to produce value
is striking a compromise that binds all creditors in exchange
                             23
for a distribution of that value. In the ordinary enforcement
system, each creditor has to decide whether the debtor’s
compromise offer of less than full payment should be
accepted as reasonable. As discussed in Section II.1 below,
informal workout negotiations are just as common among
natural person debtors as they are in the corporate context,
but for a variety of reasons, creditors often find natural
persons less trustworthy than corporate managers. Also,
creditors’ perspectives and expectations in the context of
natural persons often differ markedly from the corporate
context with respect to reasonable sacrifices and the moral
compulsion to fulfill obligations. A settlement proposal that
creditors might accept as a reasonable business measure for
a corporation tends to be viewed in much more moralistic
and judgmental terms when advanced by an individual,
especially one who is not engaged in “morally neutral”
business activity. Questions of appropriate personal
sacrifices and standards of living make the process of
deciding whether to pursue an individual debtor all the more
complicated.

67. Coordinating the decision by numerous individual
creditors to accept whatever the debtor has to offer presents
a classic collective action problem that is unlikely to be
overcome without some external control. In an insolvency
regime, a neutral administrator might more efficiently and
effectively coordinate the investigation, evaluation, and
negotiated division of the debtor’s productive capacity.
Creditors are more likely to accept the conclusions of a
neutral administrator, and empowering one administrator to
strike the most reasonable compromise deal for creditors
benefits the collective by overcoming the problem of
irrational holdouts and conflicting strategic behaviors by
isolated creditors.

68. A final potential benefit of an insolvency system for
creditors concerns continuous monitoring. Once a
compromise deal with the debtor is in place, someone has to
ensure that the debtor abides by the new arrangement. In an
informal workout, each creditor would bear its own costs of
monitoring the debtor’s ongoing financial situation and
performance under the workout agreement. An insolvency
system might again eliminate wasteful duplication of
monitoring costs by concentrating that task on one
administrator with greater authority to scrutinize the
debtor’s activities than any individual creditor would. The
insolvency representative might be empowered to take
remedial action in case of default by the debtor, further
alleviating the burden on creditors in pursuing maximum
payment from the debtor.




                             24
          (ii)   Enhancing Fair Distribution of Payment
                 among the Collective of Creditors
    69. In addition to increasing payment to any one creditor,
    an insolvency regime might enhance the ordinary
    enforcement system simply by its collective nature. Taking
    into account the interests of all creditors at once, an
    insolvency regime is better able to ensure a fair distribution
    of available value among all creditors. This redounds to the
    particular benefit of unsophisticated creditors, who are
    unable or unwilling to pursue individual collections actions,
    or who have weak bargaining positions with respect to the
    debtor. Indeed, this effect is enhanced in an insolvency
    system where debtors have an incentive to seek relief
    themselves, rather than waiting for creditors to engage the
    insolvency system. If individual sophisticated creditors are
    better off engaging the ordinary enforcement system, seizing
    all available value and leaving nothing for other creditors, a
    system that encourages the debtor to engage the collective
    redress system offers the potential of all of the benefits
    discussed above to unsophisticated creditors without any
    action or expense on their part.

B)      Benefits for Debtors and their Families
    70. Perhaps even more obvious than increasing payment
    to creditors, providing relief to “honest but unfortunate”
    debtors has long been a primary purpose of insolvency
    regimes for natural persons. Although business insolvency
    systems have developed in the past several centuries with an
    all-but -exclusive aim of enhancing collections for creditors,
    insolvency systems have been used also to provide relief for
    debtors for an even longer period. Policymakers for millennia
    have developed legal frameworks akin to insolvency systems
    based on a variety of motivations related to relieving the
    suffering of debtors, including religious conviction, ideals of
    social solidarity, and basic sentiments of empathy and
    humanitarian concern for reducing long -term hardship.

    71. Unmanageable debt burdens cause a host of serious
    psychic, and ultimately physical, problems for debtors.
    Empirical studies have documented widespread and
    profound debtor suffering from the fear and anxiety
    produced by constant worry about inability to repay debts,
    as well as nagging feelings of failure. 6 Constant anxiety

 arising from inability to pay or from harassment by creditors
 can cause serious emotional and other problems for debtors,
 including depression and social withdrawal. Ironically,
 overwhelming debt burdens might cause debtors to be
 unable to concentrate on work and other responsibilities,
 thus preventing debtors from responsibly managing their
 own financial distress and plunging them into a descending
 spiral of failure. This situation of hopelessness can sap not
 only the debtor’s motivation to engage in productive work,
 but also the debtor’s essential joy or even desire for living.

 72. Left unaddressed, these psychic maladies can manifest
 themselves in serious physical problems. High stress levels
 and constant anxiety have been known to produce a wide
 range of physical ailments in debtors, ranging from sleep
 deprivation to inability to concentrate at work to more
 serious maladies, such as indigestion, heart and nerve
 problems, weakness and depression, and even thoughts of
 suicide. In one country, the system of insolvency for natural
 persons arose largely in response to a call by a doctor who
 observed a high incidence of physical ailments directly linked
 to the counterproductive operation of the debt collection
 system. In another country, media reports have drawn
 attention to the desperate plight of numerous debtors who
 have taken their own lives as a result of their hopeless
 insolvency.

 73. Systems for treating insolvency generally provide quite
 direct and often immediate relief from the stress, anxiety,
 and other negative emotional and physical reactions
 associated with inability to manage debts. Studies of debtors
 in insolvency systems have reported on the tremendous
 sense of relief that a simple respite—even a temporary
 one—can offer to debtors plagued by anxiety, guilt, shame,
 and helplessness. 7 Many policymakers around the world
 have concluded that relieving the long -term pain and
 suffering of these debtors is a worthy goal in and of itself.
 74. As discussed below, however, most of the benefits for
 debtors have spillover effects on society, and modern

discussions of insolvency regimes for natural persons most
often rely on these broader benefits rather than concentrate
on compassion for individual debtors.

75. One important set of wider benefits moves only
slightly beyond the debtor to the debtor’s family. The
spouses and especially children of distressed debtors suffer
through no fault of their own and thus are especially
deserving of compassion and relief. Children of hopelessly
distressed debtors suffer seriously deleterious effects
growing up in a household constantly hounded by creditor
calls and financial strain, especially if the parent debtor
withdraws from productive economic activity as a result of
this constant pressure. These childhood effects can manifest
themselves later in life in the form of poor socialization due
to social exclusion, as well as unconstructive attitudes
toward financial responsibility, paying taxes, and productive
engagement. Already moving toward the next, broader set of
goals, ensuring that children grow up in environments of
constructive engagement with obligations, work, and society
redounds to the benefit not only of the debtor and his
children, but also to the benefit of society.

C)   Benefits for Society, National and International
76. If financial distress were an isolated phenomenon,
affecting only small pockets of individuals, an official regime
for treating insolvency would most likely not be regarded as
a moral or political imperative. The benefits to the few
creditors and debtors involved would be the same as
discussed above, but these benefits would not warrant the
efforts and other significant costs of setting up and
administering a relief system. Even where levels of financial
distress have risen high enough to justify consideration of
formal relief, the numbers of creditors and debtors directly
affected have been quite limited, representing only small
fractions of the total population. The primary goals of an
insolvency regime for natural persons are thus not so much
based on isolated benefits to specific creditors and debtors,
but rather on the more widespread benefits to the broader
society on which those creditors and debtors have a variety
of important indirect influences.

77. The most powerful driving concerns behind an
insolvency regime are about ameliorating the negative
systemic effects of unregulated distressed debt. Thus, as
mentioned in Section I.6 above, in societies that lack a broad
base of instances of distressed debt, or that address those
problems effectively by cultural responses such as collective
responsibility within families, tribes, or villages, an
insolvency regime for natural persons might not serve a
sufficiently substantial purpose to warrant the costs of
implementation. But where traditional methods of collective

                             27
redress have begun to break down, a societal response may
well be warranted in light not so much of the benefits to
individuals, but of the follow -on benefits flowing through the
web of relationships in complex societies.

78. These benefits to society can be grouped loosely into
two categories. One category encompasses a variety of
benefits associated with disciplining creditors to
acknowledge the reality of their low -value claims against
distressed debtors, internalize the costs of their own lax
credit evaluation, and more effectively and fairly redistribute
those costs among the society that benefits from the
availability of credit. The other category focuses on the intra -
national and inter -national benefits of maximizing
engagement and productivity by debtors, especially
considering the increasingly competitive global marketplace.

      (i) Establishing Proper Account Valuation
79. For institutional creditors, the value of their own
accounts receivable plays an important role in a variety of
interactions with broader society. Properly valuing those
accounts is vitally important to providing a basis on which
investors and regulators can manage their relationships with
such creditors. Investors’ decisions with respect to managing
and investing in such companies depend, often to a very
significant degree, on an accurate vision of the expected cash
flow and value to be derived from these accounts. More
broadly, government regulators often rely on statements of
account value, especially for lending institutions, in assessing
the strength of these institutions, in judging the need for
regulatory intervention, and in allowing these institutions to
take deposits and otherwise manage the money of individual
accountholders.

80. An essential aspect of valuing an account receivable is
assessing the likelihood that the account balance will, in fact,
ultimately be collected from the account debtor. While the
overwhelming bulk of accounts are collected in the ordinary
course, a rising tide of financial distress among account
debtors can quickly erode the real value of accounts. Even if
creditor institutions honestly perceive this erosion of value,
the full scope and extent of the problem may be difficult to
assess. To maintain good standing with external interests,
creditors have powerful incentives to underestimate the
degree of distress, perhaps grossly miscalculating a delay in
collecting on a series of accounts or failing to charge off
uncollectible accounts as worthless. A human propensity for
over-optimism, combined with a desire by creditor
institutions to report pleasing figures to investors and
regulators, can all too often lead to overly optimistic
estimates of the collectability and therefore the value of
accounts owed by distressed debtors.

                              28
81. If the value of a key asset like accounts is improperly
inflated, a chain reaction of negative effects can flow quite
quickly once the reality of the situation is discovered. If this
occurs as a result of a series of unexpected defaults by
account debtors, the negative effects can be immediate and
quite severe. The housing crisis that spread from the United
States to the global economy in the late 2000s offers a vivid
illustration of this problem. Banks and investors with
interests in loans secured by home mortgages generally
failed to admit until it was far too late that borrower
financial distress had severely undermined the value of these
accounts, a problem that was exacerbated by inflated
valuations of many homes securing such loans. For distressed
accounts that could be saved, creditors failed to take proper
remedial action to put debtors back into a position from
which they might reasonably service their debts. Similar
stories have played out with respect to many different kinds
of receivables.

82. Accounting standards reflect the need for proper
discounting of distressed account assets, and banking
regulations often require non -performing loans to be written
off after a relatively short period of time. Regulations and
regulators in some countries are quite strict about this, but
in many countries, the substantial flexibility inherent in
accounting and banking regulatory standards often allows
institutional creditors to convey a misleading picture of the
value of their accounts. If this situation is allowed to drag on
for years, the ill effects of this over -valuation of accounts can
grow extensively, and by the time when the reality of the
value -destroying insolvency is acknowledged, it is too late to
avoid serious disruptions that reverberate far beyond the
creditor’s own balance sheet.

83. An insolvency system cannot avoid this problem
entirely, but it can force creditors to acknowledge in a more
timely fashion the reality that financial distress has
destroyed or undermined the value of their accounts—and
compel creditors to accept proper remedial action. An
official declaration and confirmation of the account debtors’
inability to pay prompts a more effective reevaluation of
creditors’ non -performing loan portfolios and more sound
decisions with respect to investment in and regulation of
such creditors. In addition, the confirmation of the debtor’s
inability to pay may have a tax effect in most systems,
allowing creditors to claim tax deductions for their losses.
Ultimately all of these effects produce a healthier climate for
investing and managing the increasingly important role that
such creditors play in the economy and in society.

84. The fear that an insolvency relief system will
undermine the balance sheets of institutional lenders—or of
an entire lending industry—may well ignore a difficult but
important reality: It is not an insolvency relief system that
                               29
might destroy value, but the fact of account debtor
insolvency itself that has already destroyed that value.
Propping up a creditor institution and even an entire industry
of such creditors may simply delay the inevitable.
Acknowledging the fact of account debtor insolvency and
swallowing the bitter medicine of an insolvency relief system
can put creditors and their troubled industry back on the
right path toward healthy financial dealings. Delaying this
adjustment by treating non-performing loans as potentially
performing will likely increase the severity and duration of a
lending industry crisis when the reality of account debtor
insolvency can no longer be ignored.

      (ii)   Reducing Wasteful Collection Costs and
             Destroyed Value in Depressed Asset Sales
85. Policymakers in several countries have expressed
concern that the enforcement system commonly sustains an
illusion that certain debts are enforceable. This phenomenon
becomes a problem when creditors engage the official
collections apparatus against debtors who have either no
assets at all or too few assets to cover anything beyond the
costs of collection. In cases where the debtor’s assets are
seized and sold to no effect other than paying the costs of
seizure and sale, the use of the collections process produces
little more than a dead -weight loss. The question is whether
it is preferable to leave the debtor’s meager assets alone
rather than redistribute their value in a socially
counterproductive way to enforcement officials and
distressed auction buyers.

86. When creditors are allowed to pursue enforcement
actions against hopelessly insolvent debtors, at least three
negative effects follow. First, the courts are clogged with
ordinary enforcement actions that strain their often already
overtaxed resources. In most countries, the ordinary courts
of first instance are charged with debt collection cases in
addition to most other sorts of general disputes. Liability in
debt collections cases is often not disputed, yet because
creditors sustain a sliver of hope of collecting on judgments
against insolvent debtors, they engage the scarce resources
of the general court system to obtain a default judgment that
often proves to be practically uncollectible. Although
creditors bear part of the costs of such proceedings, their
filing fees do not fully cover the direct and indirect costs of
burdening the judicial system with a formalistic and usually
fruitless process. Second, if an official authority is charged
with enforcing these fruitless judgments, its time and
resources are expended in vain as well. These costs may also
not be recovered fully by charging the pursuing creditor.
Finally, if available assets are located, their value is often
consumed in covering enforcement costs, leaving the

                             30
creditor’s position largely or entirely unchanged, as much of
the real objective value of these assets is wasted in an
inefficient piecemeal sale process. Indeed, many
policymakers have identified a fourth negative effect in
having deprived debtors of assets that likely had far greater
personal value to them than to any third party, an effect
further exacerbated by imposing significant replacement
costs upon debtors.

87. An insolvency regime can reduce or eliminate this
waste. Rather than imposing upon the courts the duty to
manage multiple collections actions, a single collective
proceeding can efficiently and effectively establish the
essential fact of the debtor’s insolvency and save time and
other resources for the court system. If an objective
evaluation compels creditors to accept that their claims are
not covered by the paltry value of the debtor’s assets,
creditors themselves avoid wasting their own resources, as
discussed above, but they also avoid wasting the official
resources of the judicial and enforcement authorities.
Moreover, the dead -weight loss of value in seizing and selling
the personal effects of insolvent debtors can be avoided, and
property can remain in a context where it has its greatest
value, if a neutral administrator is able to properly evaluate
the lack of real available value in such property. This
advances more than simple humanitarian concern for the
debtor’s comfort and convenience; it achieves a more
appropriate distribution of resources, which benefits any
society.

      (iii)   Encouraging Responsible Lending and
              Reducing Negative Externalities
88. The variety of harms that an insolvency regime seeks
to avoid all represent costs caused at least in part by
creditors’ inaccurate risk assessment. Particularly in the
context of modern individual lending, with aggressive
advertising and computerized credit scoring, sophisticated
institutional creditors are in a far better position than most
borrowers to manage the inevitable risks of default and debt
distress. An insolvency regime can encourage creditors to
engage in more responsible credit underwriting and loan
extension by concentrating the risks of overly aggressive
credit decisions on lenders themselves.

89. When creditors make loans that ultimately default,
they incur costs themselves, but they also externalize costs
onto others. For creditors, these costs may be expected,
almost welcome casualties of an aggressive business model
of high -risk, high -profit lending. Even substantial losses can
be managed if an aggressive lending model produces
countervailing substantial returns from the “can -pay”

                              31
debtors. Creditors can reduce the impact of their own lax
credit underwriting decisions by factoring a loss ratio into
their costs of doing business. They can plan for and adjust
accordingly to expected losses, reducing the effect if not the
incidence of default.

90. Debtors and society, in contrast, are either unable or
ill-equipped to plan effectively for future default risks. While
one might think that debtors are in the best position to
simply avoid taking loans if the risk of default is too great,
this is easier said than done. A voluminous literature on
behavioral economics has revealed that human cognition is
not well suited to decision making under circumstances of
uncertainty. Borrowers suffer a bias toward overconfidence,
inflating their perceived likelihood of success and
underestimating the risk of default. They also discount the
ultimate cost of credit more powerfully than they discount
the expected future value of a present good. These
tendencies are known to and often exploited by
sophisticated lenders. While lenders can factor statistically
likely losses into their investment and lending decisions,
debtors are all but incapable of striking the proper balance of
future risks.

91. Indeed, for some creditors, the cost of anticipated
defaults might well be less than the cost of a more diligent
credit assessment and underwriting process. The “payday”
and other “subprime” lending industries offer an extreme
illustration of this business model. These creditors can
predict with virtual certainty that a substantial number of
their low - to moderate -income borrowers will fail to repay
their loans timely. Consequently, their business model
accounts for such losses and recoups them on the front end
with substantial fees charged to every borrower, in addition
to steep default fees and penalties charged to those who fail
to pay on time. This industry has enjoyed spectacular
profitability despite an expected high rate of debt default;
indeed, arguably because of an expected high rate of default.
92. These and many other creditors simply externalize the
losses resulting from their lax credit underwriting onto third
parties. Other borrowers pay substantially higher fees than
they would if their own credit were properly evaluated; the
communities where these borrowers live suffer from the
effects of constant chain indebtedness; the court system
devotes time and other resources to entering uncollectible
default judgments; and society suffers from the existence of
a constant underclass of debtors trapped in a never -ending
debt spiral. In extreme cases, this process has even resulted
in the loss of some debtors to suicide. Not only are these
costs not absorbed by the creditors whose subprime lending
practices caused them, but they represent the leverage that
produces the elevated returns on investment that are the
core of that business model.
                              32
    93. Once again, an insolvency regime cannot eliminate
    these problems, but it has the distinct potential to reduce
    them. In addition to directly alleviating other negative
    externalities as discussed in this section, an insolvency
    system can sharpen creditors’ attention to a more
    responsible lending model. 8 Creditors who know that their
    borrowers have ready access to an escape hatch have an
    incentive to engage in more careful underwriting. They have
    an incentive to bring to bear their own risk calculations on
    their lending decisions, rather than rely on their debtors’
    innumeracy and overconfidence and on the creditors’ ability
    to externalize or counterbalance expected default losses.
    Ultimately, direct regulation of certain extreme lending
    practices is necessary to avoid a continuing expansion of risk
    and externalized leverage from subprime lending. And given
    the costs involved in challenging unlawful predatory lending,
    a collective insolvency proceeding may be the only forum in
    which such practices might meaningfully be contested by
    debtors. For both prime and subprime lending, an insolvency
    regime puts a greater premium on responsible lending and
    avoiding losses that are more foreseeable to and that can be
    more quickly and directly redirected back onto lenders. This
    produces a safer and healthier lending industry for all.
    Naturally, the issues of regulation of the credit industry and
    lending practices are much broader than the effect of
    insolvency law on that industry, but natural personal
    insolvency law can have a prominent role in the promotion
    of responsible lending practices.

          (iv)   Concentrating Losses on More Efficient and
                 Effective Loss Distributors
    94. The other side of the responsible lending and loss
    avoidance coin is the closely related benefit of concentrating
    inevitable losses on the actors best suited to distribute the
    pain efficiently, effectively, and fairly. If failure to fulfill
    obligations were solely a function of debtors’ irresponsibility
    or immorality, redistributing the consequences of
    undesirable behavior onto the rest of society would itself be
    undesirable. But default is seldom solely the consequence of
    factors within the debtor’s control. Debtors in agricultural
    societies are at the mercy of weather and other
    environmental factors. Debtors in industrial societies are at
    the mercy of business cycles and commercial developments.

Debtors in modern financial societies are at the mercy of
swings in currency valuations and actions taken by finance
houses seemingly far removed from the debtors’ lives.
Similarly, economic cycles may take their toll on debtors’
home purchase and investment decisions. Indeed, the
globalization of many world economies has made debtors
helpless before forces in far -flung areas of the globe whose
influence is neither anticipated nor controllable. Debtors in
all societies face potential health problems, divorce,
childbirth, and other life events that strain an otherwise
manageable budget to the breaking point. Many individuals
live paycheck to paycheck, and it may well be the loss of a
job, a medical emergency, or a divorce that pushes the
debtor over the edge and leads the debtor to seek insolvency
relief. Indeed, the mere fact of living for an extended period
“on the razor’s edge”, in a situation of poverty or near
poverty, may expose low -income debtors to a constant risk
of inability to service even modest debts, even if such
debtors incurred those obligations during a period of relative
prosperity or, perhaps more commonly, in an instance of
extreme desperation.

95. One tragedy concentrated on a few debtors is likely to
destroy these individuals. But dividing and dispersing the
burden of tragedy among all members of society produces an
equitable and solidary solution that avoids such an outcome.
Everyone contributes a little in exchange for the promise of
salvation from devastating demands. Rather than using such
a direct collect -and-distribute approach, many modern
societies instead use insurance to fairly and effectively
redistribute the inevitable casualties of expected but
unpredictable phenomena like fire, weather, and auto
accidents. An insolvency regime fulfills a similar function by
redistributing the inevitable casualties of expected but
unpredictable financial distress. No one can accurately
predict where financial distress will strike, but the lenders in
charge of a substantial portion of the debts behind any given
instance of financial distress are able to factor aggregate
losses into their business model and to incorporate the costs
of such casualties into the rates they charge all borrowers.
Lenders who increase the likelihood that individual
borrowers will experience financial distress should bear the
resulting losses, as discussed above, and some measure of
official regulation might be an appropriate response if such
behavior becomes extreme. But for “honest but unfortunate”
debtors who meet the entry requirements for an insolvency
regime, a natural role for lenders is to concentrate and
redistribute the increased costs of inevitable financial
distress among all borrowers. All borrowers benefit from the
availability of credit despite the risk of default, all borrowers
benefit from the variety of positive effects that flow from the
availability of a safety -valve insolvency regime, and thus, all
borrowers can fairly be expected to share in the widely
distributed costs of default and rehabilitation.
                              34
96. Some have argued that this approach imposes an
unfair penalty on “responsible” borrowers who would never
default. This perspective, though, is akin to equating auto
insurance premiums with a penalty on safe drivers who
would never experience an accident. No matter how
carefully one drives, one never knows when, through forces
beyond one’s control, an auto casualty will occur. Likewise,
no matter how carefully and responsibly one manages one’s
finances, one can never be sure when financial distress will
strike unexpectedly as a result of distant and perhaps
unexpected forces. Some element of “moral hazard” will
always be present, as is the case with auto insurance. Some
people will choose to drive in a riskier way, and some people
will consume credit in a riskier way. But the answer to these
hazards is not to eliminate either auto insurance or
insolvency relief. Proper enforcement of driving rules will
isolate and punish those who drive in an excessively risky
way, and careful entry and exit requirements for an
insolvency regime will isolate and exclude debtors who
engage in excessively risky credit behavior.

97. Auto accidents and distressed debt could both be
entirely avoided, of course, by never driving or borrowing
against future earnings. This raises distinct issues and a
different debate, however. The societies to which this
discussion is directed do not wish to discourage driving or
borrowing. A society that wishes to restrain borrowing likely
has no need for an insolvency system. But this discussion is
directed at societies that have accepted the benefits of
lending; e.g., smoothing consumption and reducing the
volatility of financial supply and demand over time. A society
that has embraced the good of lending is in a similar position
to one that has embraced the benefits of driving. Each
carries inevitable risks and casualties, and some form of loss
spreading is a healthy way of maximizing and smoothing the
benefits for all. An insolvency regime thus represents a sort
of trade -off for deregulation of consumer lending. If natural
persons are to be exposed to inevitable risks that they do
not—and likely cannot—understand or avoid, insolvency
restores fair equilibrium by offering insurance against those
risks, with the “premiums” financed through small and
appropriately distributed increases in the cost of credit.

98. Natural persons have a variety of creditors, not all of
which are well -suited to aggregating default losses and
distributing the costs of financial distress throughout society.
More direct and effective methods of redistributing these
costs might be identified, such as taxation or even a specific
regime of mandatory credit insurance. These alternatives,
however, require careful regulation, are subject to inaccuracy
and undesirable manipulation, and they are sufficiently
unwieldy and costly that no significant movement for
regulating default risk for natural persons has arisen
anywhere in the world today. Insolvency regimes are
                              35
increasingly serving as a second -best alternative means of
concentrating risk on creditors, who are the most efficient
redistributors of default risk available. Once again, at the
very least, these creditors are in a much better position to
redistribute the costs of financial distress than are the
natural person debtors stricken by unexpected financial
tragedy.

    (v) Reducing the Costs of Illness, Crime,
        Unemployment, and other Welfare-Related
        Costs
99. Turning from creditor -oriented benefits to debtor -
oriented benefits, a second series of goals of insolvency
regimes for natural persons relates to the advantages to
society of lifting the debilitating thumb of collections
pressure from debtors and reinvigorating their productive
potential in the mainstream economy. This series of benefits
can be viewed from two perspectives: removing negatives
and enhancing positives.

100. As for removing negatives, an insolvency regime can
reduce or eliminate a variety of direct and indirect social
costs of leaving debtors to languish in a state of perpetual
debt distress. Individuals trapped in an endless debt cycle
consume precious social benefits, especially but not
exclusively in states that provide some measure of social
support (welfare). Most obviously, debtors discouraged from
working might collect unemployment benefits. In states that
offer other sorts of transfer payments (e.g., child
allowances), this money directly or indirectly might find its
way into the pockets of creditors rather than be applied for
its intended purpose. Even more troubling, as discussed in
Section I.8.B above, constant harassment by creditors has
been identified as the cause of chronic health and medical
problems in debtors. States that provide medical support
thus face an increased burden from greater numbers of
patients suffering from debt -related maladies. Even in states
that do not offer direct medical support, emergency rooms
and other forms of last -resort health care can be clogged
with people suffering from man -made distress. Moreover,
simple medical problems often become much more serious
and resource -intensive as a result of debtors’ having
foregone preventive care due to inability to devote resources
to avoiding future health problems. At the extreme, financial
desperation has driven many debtors to take out grey - or
black -market loans at usurious interest rates, to engage in
crime, or even to commit suicide, thus imposing significant
costs on society.
101. No one system could ever eliminate all of these costs,
but an insolvency system can reduce or eliminate the
                             36
artificial causes of such problems. If a neutral arbiter can
confirm that the debtor is not able to pay, or that a more
rational, long -term repayment plan is appropriate, the acute
stress of constant creditor pursuit of immediate payment can
be alleviated. The unwarranted costs of unproductive
enforcement pressure can thus be substantially reduced, if
not eliminated, in very short order. Even if a full discharge of
liability is not available, any process for coordinating and
humanizing the collections process can put debtors on a
healthier path to supporting themselves, addressing their
obligations in a more measured and regular way, and
participating in society rather than viewing themselves as
victims of it.

      (vi)   Increasing Production of Regular Taxable
             Income
102. Along with reducing social costs, an insolvency system
can affect the other side of the ledger by increasing social
contributions, again both directly and indirectly. The direct
benefits of offering debtors an incentive to re-enter society
and again have the opportunity to produce regular income
were discussed above in terms of benefits to creditors. The
direct benefits to society are much more significant and long -
term.

103. Active and engaged debtors contribute to society in a
variety of ways, some of which are explored in the following
section. One obvious and often cited contribution involves
tax revenue. Debtors pushed into the grey or underground
economy might produce revenue, but taxing authorities are
unable to benefit from that production. Insolvency regimes
can provide incentives for debtors to apply their productive
energies to the regular economy, maximizing their long -term
future productive potential and making income tax and social
security contributions from their income. The renewal of tax
and benefit contributions from hopelessly indebted potential
workers has been a prime consideration in the adoption of
many current insolvency regimes. To be sure, unemployment
and a lack of available jobs are among the primary causes of
insolvency of natural persons, so the problem of a lack of
suitable job opportunities may well need to be addressed as
a prerequisite to achieving the benefits of returning debtors
to active, formal employment.

104. Where regular jobs are available, some lawmakers
have perceived a pernicious competition between creditors
and society when creditors continue to pursue insolvent
debtors for years on the slim and likely illusory hope of a
small payment. For example, policymakers in one country
acknowledged the undesirable but understandable tendency
for debtors to go “on strike” and refuse to work to produce

                              37
regular income if most or all of the fruits of their efforts will
be siphoned off by creditors. This lost income harms not only
the pursuing creditors, but society as a whole, and the losses
to society far outstrip the losses to creditors, especially in
light of the fact that continuing pressure from creditors often
produces not payment from debtors, but their continued
self-exclusion from the regular workforce. By keeping
potentially productive debtors under threat of expropriation
of any excess income, these creditors for the sake of a
relatively small sum rob society of the potentially much
larger long -term productive energies of these repressed
debtors.

105. The pursuing creditor can often be the state taxing
authority. Even if the state itself is the pursuing creditor,
inhibiting future productivity by pursuing fruitless collections
on past obligations is no less undesirable. The moral hazard
of relieving debtors of duties to the state (and society) might
be theoretically more troubling in this context (see Section
I.9.A below), but lawmakers in many countries have accepted
the stark reality that it makes little practical sense to sacrifice
a large potential future benefit in the pursuit of a smaller
past -due debt in such situations.



    (vii) Maximizing Economic Activity, Encouraging
          Entrepreneurship
106. The benefits to the state of an engaged citizenry
extend far beyond mere tax receipts. Lawmakers in some
countries have been especially concerned about the problem
of social exclusion in general, particularly as it affects the
hopelessly indebted. Effectively removing citizens from
active participation in public life carries many costs, not only
in terms of economic productivity, but also in terms of
fostering a vibrant society. One desired effect of an effective
insolvency regime, as envisioned particularly by lawmakers in
the countries just mentioned, is reinvigoration and
reinsertion of the hopelessly indebted into society.

107. Activating as many members of society as possible has
at least two prominent positive effects. First, removing the
weight of creditor pressure not only encourages regular
income production, but it can also enhance the debtors’
willingness and desire to be creative and even
entrepreneurial. When debtors know that they will enjoy
most of the value of their creative enterprise, they are more
likely to push beyond mere subsistence and maximize returns
for themselves and, indirectly, for society. Moreover, if
potential entrepreneurs know beforehand that the risks of
failure are mitigated by an insolvency regime, they are more

                               38
 likely to confront the risks involved in entrepreneurship.
 Small - and medium -sized business is a major driver of many
 world economies, and a well -functioning insolvency regime
 can provide a powerful impetus to undertake the risks that
 necessarily accompany the rewards of starting a business.
 Facilitating entrepreneurialism was the primary goal behind
 the fundamental revision of at least one insolvency law for
 natural persons in the early 2000s.

 108. Second, enhancing entrepreneurialism and general
 social engagement maximizes national economic activity and
 international competitiveness. Every disengaged citizen is a
 link in a long chain of lost economic and social potential. In
 closely integrated modern economies, one person’s activity
 leverages the activity of many others. This is especially true
 in countries whose economies are heavily reliant on
 individual service and consumer spending. A few distressed
 debtors here and there are likely to have little impact on
 national GDP, but the substantial numbers of debtors seeking
 relief each year in many nations today represent a
 significant, even if not particularly substantial, portion of
 these nations’ economic potential. As countries compete in
 foreign markets and vie for foreign direct investment, a
 maximally engaged citizenry is essential to achieving
 maximum competitiveness with other nations.

 109. Ultimately, part of achieving maximum economic
 activity is reasonable individual consumption itself. Although
 spending from available means is generally regarded as the
 optimal approach to sustainable consumption, many
 policymakers around the world today recognize an important
 value in individual borrowing from future income to smooth
 and optimize consumption patterns over time. Simply
 engaging in modern economic life is a sort of entrepreneurial
 risk, and international competitiveness calls for nations to
 encourage individuals to take reasonable risks in smoothing
 consumption through credit transactions. Excessive
 borrowing is surely a problem to be avoided, but as
 discussed above, avoiding all risk is not a cost -free
 proposition. Excessive saving and avoiding financial risk
 altogether can lead—and has led in some countries—to
 stagnation and its accompanying loss of economic potential.
 If individuals are overly cautious, saving more than necessary
 to appropriately hedge against potential income
 interruptions, unnecessarily voluminous savings represent
 lost potential to the present economy. 9

 110. The optimal rate of insolvency is not zero if reasonable
 maximization of economic activity is desired. Risk is an
 inevitable aspect of pushing an economic system to
 acceptable limits. An insolvency regime accounts for
9 SeeInternational Monetary Fund, “Dealing with Household Debt,”
World Economic Outlook 2012 1 (2012).

                              39
inevitable miscalculations, spreading the costs across society
in exchange for the societal benefits of this approach. It
offers individuals a backstop, a safety net, encouraging them
to be as economically active as society believes is reasonably
appropriate. As discussed in Section I.9.A below, identifying
the line between reasonably appropriate risk and moral
hazard is a challenging task, but one goal of an insolvency
system is to signal where the line is and to police access to
the recovery system for those who honestly miscalculated its
location or who suffered the misfortune of having been
pushed beyond it.

    (viii) Enhancing Stability and Predictability in the
           Broader Financial System and the Economy
111. Many of the benefits discussed in this section are
derived, at least in part, from a more fundamental and
nuanced benefit of an insolvency system: the stability and
predictability that such a system lends to the broader
financial and economic environment. Insolvency systems
function essentially as a safety valve, to release pressure that
builds up in a financial system as a result of excessive
leverage and pent up productivity. Indeed, many lawmakers
have described the function of their new insolvency systems
for natural persons in precisely these terms: to offer a safety
valve in order to regulate financial and economic activity
more smoothly. Supervisory regulation can maintain stable
and predictable economic activity by preventing excessive
incentive for activity, a build -up often called a “bubble,” in
one or more segments of the economy. Conversely, an
insolvency system can help to maintain stability and
predictability in the opposite situation, where activity is
excessively burdened by widespread debt. Rather than
relying on natural, long -term economic forces to correct the
negative imbalance, an insolvency system can assure a more
timely and less disruptive treatment of the casualties of
economic activity, ensuring a smoother, more stable and
predictable continuation of economic activity throughout the
system.

I.9. Countervailing Factors: Combating Moral Hazard,
      Fraud, and Stigma
112. Despite the many advantages offered by a system for
treating the insolvency of natural persons, three particularly
salient concerns might hinder the adoption or proper
implementation of such a system. As the following discussion
suggests, these concerns have been overcome in many
existing insolvency systems, and they need not stand in the
way of lawmakers hoping to reap the benefits described
above.

                              40
A)   Moral Hazard
113. Applying a classical theoretical economic concept,
many policymakers have expressed concern about the “moral
hazard” created by offering improper incentives for debtors
to act irresponsibly with respect to their finances and
obligations. The classical idea of moral hazard appears most
prominently in the context of insured risks, the concern
being that the availability of insurance or other protection
against downside risks will produce undesirable incentives
for insured parties to act less prudently and carefully than
they would in the absence of insurance. If the extraordinary
option of escaping one’s obligations is made widely available,
the theory goes, debtors will have a greater incentive to act
in an immoral or irresponsible way, both by recklessly taking
on more debt than they can reasonably service, and by
abdicating their responsibility to deal with their obligations
once insolvency has set in.

114. As discussed above (see especially Section I.8.C (iv)),
however, the specter of moral hazard is an inevitable part of
accepting the broader benefits of a system of insolvency
treatment. Some debtors may well consume credit in a
riskier way in response to the presence of a “safety net” in
the event of failure, and some debtors will attempt to evade
their obligations by seeking insolvency relief when they could
address their obligations through reasonable sacrifices and
modifications to their budgets and lifestyle choices.
Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the most sensible
response to moral hazard in this context, and the one
adopted by many existing insolvency systems, is to design
and implement proper access requirements—both for entry
into the insolvency system and for receipt of a discharge or
other relief— in order to isolate and exclude debtors who
engage in excessively risky or other undesirable credit
behavior.
115. To be sure, the goal of offering relief to debtors and
their families is tempered by a countervailing goal of
preventing the dishonest evasion of responsibility by debtors
capable of paying their debts with reasonable sacrifices. The
importance of abiding by one’s obligations if reasonably
possible is a bedrock notion that need not be undermined by
the introduction of an insolvency regime, no matter how
generous the relief offered might be. An overarching goal of
any insolvency system is striking a careful balance between
two competing considerations: first, demanding much of
those who incur obligations; but second, not demanding
more than can be reasonably borne by the victims of
economic volatility and other common dangers of life. Just as
an insolvency relief system carries a risk of undermining
payment morality, there is an equally significant risk in losing
the many benefits of an insolvency system by failing to

                              41
 provide effective relief. Some danger of moral hazard (and
 fraud, as discussed below) will be present in any system, but
 these slippages should not overshadow the substantial
 benefits of providing relief in the overwhelming majority of
 cases involving debtors who have tried and failed due to
 factors largely or entirely beyond their control. Care should
 be taken to avoid sacrificing the great good of such a system
 simply because perfection cannot be assured.

 116. Finally, as mentioned in Section I.8.C (iii) above,
 policymakers in recent years have increasingly considered
 the countervailing positive effect that an insolvency system
 has on reducing creditors’ moral hazard. In making lending
 decisions, creditors face their own moral hazard in balancing
 the desire for maximum profitability with the need to engage
 in careful underwriting and evaluation of borrowers’ ability
 to pay. The possibility that an insolvent debtor will now have
 access to a relief system sharpens creditors’ incentives to
 engage in responsible credit extension behavior. Thus, the
 moral hazard issue has both potentially negative and
 potentially positive aspects, which should be considered
 together, to reduce the concerns that moral hazard poses for
 a well -designed and implemented insolvency system.

B)   Debtor Fraud
 117. Closely related to the issue of moral hazard is a
 commonly expressed concern related to debtor fraud.
 Policymakers have for centuries expressed deep concerns
 about debtors improperly gaining the extraordinary
 advantages of an insolvency system and evading their
 legitimate obligations by means of fraud. Debtors might
 perpetrate this fraud in a variety of ways, including by lying
 about their financial situation or by concealing assets or
 income. Preventing an insolvency relief system from being
 perverted to give an advantage to fraudulent debtors is, on
 the one hand, a serious concern, and no easy or perfect
 solution to this problem exists. Careful monitoring by
 administrators and creditors is the only effective way to
 minimize debtor fraud.

 118. On the other hand, one should not overemphasize the
 danger that such fraud represents. Empirical observation of
 many existing insolvency systems has confirmed repeatedly
 that the instances of real fraud are vanishingly low (on the
 order of 1 -3 percent of all cases). 10 Proper monitoring by
10 Unfortunately, most of these empirical observations have been
informal and have not been published. The sparse available evidence
from formal insolvency system oversight, however, confirms the
widespread anecdotal accounts; s ee, e.g., The Insolvency Service,
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 - 11, at 33 - 35, available at
www.bis.gov.uk/insolvency/Publications; US Department of Justice, US
Trustee Program, Annual Report of Significant Accomplishments 2010 , at

                                  42
 system administrators and creditors seems to have rooted
 out most instances of debtors’ attempting to take improper
 advantage. This is an issue to which system designers and
 policymakers remain sensitive, and appropriate safeguards
 can be incorporated into the system to detect and deter
 fraudulent conduct by debtors and others. This might be a
 particularly relevant concern in areas where cultural or other
 differences lead to greater tolerance for fraud. But in the
 final analysis, isolated anecdotes never provide a solid basis
 for policymaking. For every shocking instance of material
 fraud in existing systems, all available evidence suggests that
 many hundreds or even thousands of honest debtors seek
 and receive relief legitimately.

 119. As with moral hazard, isolated instances of debtor
 fraud are present in virtually every system that has ever
 existed, and perfect exclusion of fraud is not an achievable
 goal. All existing systems accept the risk—indeed the
 certainty—that some limited amount of fraud will creep into
 the system and some undeserving debtors will take improper
 advantage. This has not dissuaded policymakers from
 pursuing the greater good of relief for the vast majority of
 honest but unfortunate debtors who can derive legitimate
 benefit—and pass on significant benefits to creditors and
 society, as discussed above in section I.8 —and it need not
 dissuade policymakers in the future.

C)    Stigma
 120. A much more intractable challenge relates not to the
 problem of keeping undeserving debtors out of an insolvency
 system, but to enticing honest but unfortunate debtors into
 the system. Even in well -developed insolvency regimes,
 significant numbers of debtors continue to avoid seeking
 relief, or they seek relief far later than would be optimal—for
 themselves and the other beneficiaries of an insolvency
 system.

 121. The notion of announcing one’s failure, either in
 writing or in person before a public or private administrator,
 is a deeply embarrassing and stigmatizing event. Formal and
 informal surveys of debtors in many well-established
 insolvency systems reveal pervasive and profound feelings of
 guilt, shame, and stigma. These feelings act as powerful
 disincentives to debtors considering seeking insolvency relief.
 Indeed, if inability to pay is dealt with through private

17 - 19, www.justice.gov/ust/eo/public_affairs/annualreport/index.htm.
Voluminous academic empirical studies have more clearly belied the
notion of “fraud” in the broader sense of solvent debtors’ attempts to
evade their obligations. See, e.g., Teresa A. Sullivan, Elizabeth Warren &
Jay Lawrence Westbrook, Less Stigma or More Financial Distress: An
Empirical Analysis of the Extraordinary Increase in Bankruptcy Filings, 59
STAN . L. REV . 213 (2006) (and earlier studies cited therein).

                                   43
cultural traditions, or if a powerful stigma is associated with
debt and admission of failure, an “official” mechanism for
administering such problems may turn out to be superfluous,
as debtors and creditors alike refrain from using it.

122. Declaring oneself unable to manage one’s obligations
has for centuries signaled a sort of social and economic
death in many parts of the world, and such connotations are
difficult to overcome. Policymakers need to be particularly
sensitive to the cultural context of shame and stigma in the
context of admission of financial failure, as these notions can
prevent the effective uptake of debtors even in the best
designed system.

123. Some aspects of the problem are easier to address
than others. For example, if debtors are unaware of the
benefits of the system, or if they overestimate the downsides
and dangers of seeking relief, a public campaign of education
and awareness can correct misimpressions as to new options
for relief. At least one country launched an aggressive
campaign of public information regarding its new insolvency
relief system to overcome the potential problem of low
debtor acceptance. Some countries have redesigned their
insolvency systems for natural persons to minimize or
eliminate stigmatizing elements that had undesirable effects.
In several countries in which insolvency law had subjected
debtors to a long list of civil disabilities and restrictions
following an insolvency case, lawmakers have reduced or
eliminated these disabilities and restrictions, thereby
reducing in part the stigma. Similarly, the enactment of
discharges from debt and the liberalization of property
exemption have a similar effect. Such steps over time may
create incentives for natural person debtors to seek relief.

124. There is certainly nothing inherently wrong with a
healthy bit of stigma to deter debtors from seeking an easy
way out of their legitimate obligations. Ideally, debtors
should be prompted to do their utmost reasonably to
address their debt problems on their own. But policymakers
in many countries in recent years have discovered to their
dismay that excessive stigmatization of debtors seeking relief
can powerfully undermine an otherwise well -designed
system and curtail the many benefits outlined in Section I.8
above.

125. Attitudes about debt and cultural stigma change
slowly, and relatively little can be done to affect such an
expansive and disperse notion directly, but policymakers can
make and have made choices to minimize stigma by avoiding
or repealing judgmental language and punitive measures in
existing laws, such as by referring to the “debtor” as opposed
to the “bankrupt,” or by reducing post -relief restrictions on
activity by debtors. The process of reducing stigma thus goes

                              44
hand in hand with appropriately containing concerns about
moral hazard and fraud, as discussed above.


II. Core Legal Attributes of an Insolvency Regime for
Natural Persons


126. An effective and well -developed regime for the
insolvency of natural persons addresses a number of critical
issues. As stated before, there are many areas of the law in
which the solutions of the general business insolvency
regime will provide adequate solutions for the problems of
personal insolvency. However, the challenges presented by
the peculiarities of the insolvency of natural persons require
the consideration of different approaches to the general
design of the regime, its institutional framework, access to
the formal insolvency regime, the participation of creditors,
the solutions to the insolvency problems, and the discharge.



II.1. General Regime Design: Procedural Options and
the Relation with Informal Workouts
127. An essential aspect of the design of a regime of formal
insolvency treatment for natural persons is its interaction
with informal systems for resolving financial distress
amicably. One important function of a formal insolvency
system is to encourage informal negotiation and resolution,
as creditors and debtors “bargain in the shadow of
insolvency.” A clear trend has emerged in natural person
insolvency policy to favor informal, negotiated alternatives
and to avoid formal intervention between debtor and
creditors. The methods by which this preference is
expressed, especially the degree to which debt -and-credit
counseling might support negotiated alternatives, and the
results of these methods, are vital considerations that should
precede a discussion of formal regime design. As for the
design of the formal regime itself, legislators face another
important preliminary choice of where to locate the system,
either within an existing insolvency regime—probably
designed for business debtors—or in a separate, perhaps
even free -standing law. This section addresses these two key
preliminary considerations.

A)   Informal alternatives to insolvency procedures for
     natural persons


                             45
128. Legislators in many regions have emphasized the
priority of preventing formal insolvency proceedings, in part
by favoring negotiated solutions to debt problems. This
preference is apparent in the common requirement that
voluntary agreements between the debtor and the creditors
should have priority over court proceedings. In several
countries, negotiations between debtors and their creditors
are a precondition for filing formal insolvency proceedings,
and the law provides for an institutionalized debt negotiation
and settlement framework. In some countries, before a
formal insolvency procedure for natural persons came into
force, an institutionalized network of consumer and debt
counselors had developed, and the counselors in this system
had acquired significant expertise in advising debtors and
negotiating with creditors on their behalf. Therefore, it was
natural to continue and buttress the role of these debt
counselors in the new context of formal insolvency and debt
relief. But also countries with relatively little experience in
debt counseling have introduced negotiation with creditors
as a precondition for access to formal insolvency procedures
for natural persons, at least for those debtors whose debts
arise predominantly from non-business sources.

129. The preference for voluntary settlement has, in many
countries, led to a two -stage procedure in the natural person
insolvency laws. In such systems, debtors are required to
make an effort to reach a voluntary settlement with their
creditors before they are allowed to file for formal insolvency
relief. A debt counselor is usually available and required to
assist the debtor in the negotiations for a voluntary
settlement. In some countries, the attempt to reach a
voluntary settlement is regulated in a more formal
framework, such as a commission for over -indebtedness or
the debt enforcement authorities. In others, debtors are left
to find counseling and negotiation support from semi -private
or private -sector actors.

130. The following arguments can be advanced in favor of
voluntary debt settlements:

      a) The debtor may avoid the stigma of insolvency and
      registration in the credit information data banks that
      follows from an officially recorded insolvency procedure.

      b) The costs of a court procedure are higher than those of
      informal settlement negotiations.

      c) The debtor may have an incentive to make a higher
      offer to creditors to avoid the inconvenience of the court
      procedure, which would benefit the creditors.
      d) The filing that comes to the courts after an
      unsuccessful attempt to settle is already well prepared
      and, thus, easier to process. This preparatory work is done
                              46
      by debt counselors, whose fees are lower than those of
      insolvency lawyers.

      e) Voluntary settlements allow for more flexibility that
      can serve the needs of the debtor and the creditors. For
      example, the guarantors of loans can be included in the
      settlements in a flexible way, which is often not possible in
      judicial debt adjustments. If the debtor is a homeowner,
      the home can sometimes be better protected in a
      voluntary settlement than in a judicial debt adjustment
      procedure.

      f) Financial institutions regularly renegotiate repayment
      terms with their debtors. It may be a desirable political
      goal to emphasize the importance of such renegotiations
      as a matter of policy.
131. Experience in many existing systems, however, has
revealed that the merits of voluntary settlements are often
illusory. In practice, it is not easy for debtors to reach
voluntary settlements with all their creditors. There is also a
risk that creditors will use their bargaining power to pressure
debtors into accepting onerous payment plans that are not
viable. Debtors often face long delays in obtaining counseling
sessions, and counselors often face even longer delays in
collecting    the     necessary     information,    formulating
compromise proposals, and receiving creditor feedback on
these proposals. Delays of weeks or even months have
plagued many systems that require counseling as a
prerequisite to filing a formal insolvency case.

132. At least one system has abandoned its previous
requirement of informal negotiation with creditors as a
condition to seeking formal insolvency relief. Policy
researchers discovered that many creditors were simply
refusing to participate in good faith in this process, rejecting
any modification of their claims. Under such common
circumstances, the negotiation stage was rendered little
more than a pure formality, and lawmakers ultimately agreed
to scrap the requirement and allow debtors to proceed
directly into the formal insolvency system if they met the
standard entry requirements.

133. Even in countries where debt counselors had a more
positive experience in negotiating settlements before a
formal insolvency law was enacted, only a small portion of
cases were settled voluntarily. Budget and debt counseling
more often than not simply reveals the hopeless situation
faced by the debtor, and the counselor has little option but
to recommend the pursuit of a formal insolvency case. In
many countries studies have shown and counselors report



                               47
 that few debtors have any hope of achieving a consensual
 arrangement and avoiding a formal insolvency procedure. 11

 134. There are several reasons for the low rates of voluntary
 settlements:

        a) Creditors demanding enforcement of their claims may
        make negotiations impossible.

        b) Just one of several creditors may make the settlement
        impossible through a veto.

        c) Some creditors trust formal, monitored procedures
        more than informal settlement proposals. In particular,
        public creditors, such as the tax authorities, have often
        been reluctant to accept voluntary settlements, either
        because they lacked legislative authority to accept such
        settlements, or because they simply had greater
        confidence in a more transparent, formal procedure.

        d) Sometimes tax and banking regulations of accounting
        for bad-debt losses give preference to a formal decision as
        creditors write down (deduct) the losses.

        e) Some creditors are quite difficult to locate and some
        others remain passive when a proposal for voluntary
        settlement is presented to them. Unless the law stipulates
        that passive creditors are bound by a settlement, they will
        not be bound and will feel free to disregard attempts at
        negotiation.

        f) The law concerning third party guarantees is often a
        disincentive for creditors to agree to a settlement. Under
        general private law, the guarantor may be freed from
        liability when the debtor and creditor agree on relief,
        whereas in a formal debt relief procedure the guarantor is
        required to pay.
 135. In many countries, policymakers favor the idea of
 informal settlements. The desire for voluntary settlements
 will not, however, be fulfilled automatically or by the order
 of the law; some institutional support and incentives are
 needed.

 136. In the few systems where voluntary settlements have
 been most successful, which has been achieved in as many as

11See, e.g., Bund - Länder -Arbeitsgruppe “Insolvenzrecht,” Probleme der
praktischen       Anwendungen          und       Schwachstellen      des
Verbraucherinsolvenzverfahrens (2000); Ett steg mot ett enklare och
snabbare skuldsaneringsförfarande , SOU 2004:81; Nat’l Found. for
Credit Counseling, Consumer Counseling and Education Under BAPCPA
(2006); Institute for Financial Literacy, First Demographic Analysis of
Post -BAPCPA Debtors (2006).

                                  48
one -third of all cases, one of two factors generally explains
this higher success rate: either the negotiation is overseen or
even facilitated by a particularly persuasive government
regulator—such as a central bank—or a central, well -
established counseling agency has developed deep and
productive relationships with key creditors, and the agency
has leveraged this position of trust to negotiate broad -based
concessions, such as from taxing or fine -collection
authorities. The widespread use of negotiation guidelines
and codes of best practices can also represent a positive
factor in the development of a voluntary restructuring
practice. Only under circumstances of well -organized and
carefully structured negotiation have informal alternatives to
insolvency relief proven reliable, and even then, only a
relatively small fraction of cases can be resolved through
negotiation. Informal arrangements are more likely to
succeed in cases where debtors are experiencing mild or
temporary financial difficulties, rather than severe
insolvency.

137. Experience in many systems suggests that the
successful informal negotiation mechanisms as alternatives
to formal insolvency procedures include some elements that
promote a plan confirmation:

      a) First, professional, low-cost or free assistance has to be
      available and advisors should have experience in
      negotiations with creditors. The counselors or mediators
      need to have credibility in both debtors’ and creditors’
      eyes. Experience in several systems demonstrates that, if
      creditors do not regard counselors as impartial, they might
      refuse to acknowledge and cooperate with the negotiation
      process entirely.

      b) Second, the negotiations proceed better if they can be
      carried out without a threat of debt enforcement. Some
      reliable, formal mechanism should be available for
      suspending enforcement while the negotiations are
      ongoing.

      c) Third, creditor passivity should not prevent the
      acceptance of the settlement, which should be binding on
      all creditors who have been notified. Passive creditors are
      bound by a settlement under the laws of some countries.
      This kind of regulation seems to be a condition for a
      meaningful debt settlement program, but it requires that
      the institutional setting in which the proposals are
      prepared be well regulated and supervised.

      d) Fourth, the rights of a dissenting creditor should be
      regulated. There is usually no vote on the payment plan.
      Generally, any dissenting creditor can bring the case to the
      court. Dissent by a minority of the creditors should not
      lead to an automatic dismissal of the plan.
                               49
 138. A different possibility consists of the use of “hybrid” or
 “semi -formal” arrangements. These debt restructuring
 arrangements are not purely contractual: they require a
 qualified majority of claims in order to bind the minority, and
 they can also have some terms prescribed by the law as part
 of the restructuring arrangement. In general, however,
 experiences with hybrid restructurings have not had a high
 rate of success. At any rate, the existence of these hybrid
 restructuring mechanisms illustrates the continuum of
 solutions to personal insolvency, from purely contractual
 restructuring to formal insolvency proceedings.

B)   Formal Insolvency Law and its Placement within
     the Broader Legislative Scheme
 139. The fundamental legal issues in insolvency law concern
 the rights and obligations of creditors and debtors, both in
 relation to debtors and their creditors and among the
 creditors generally. These are rights and obligations that in
 all systems are ultimately adjudicated and enforced by the
 courts. The recourse to courts is protected under the human
 rights instruments that confirm the right of access to courts
 in the determination of the civil rights and obligations of a
 person. Furthermore, most human rights instruments
 acknowledge the right to property as a fundamental right,
 even though the exercise of this right needs to take into
 account the respect for the rights of others and the
 community. Traditionally, it has been held that the regulation
 of insolvency situations is not hampered by the demands of
 constitutional rights, and this doctrine is today confirmed by
 some human rights bodies—provided that the insolvency law
 does not encroach on the property rights of creditors more
 than is appropriate. It is necessary to keep in mind that the
 insolvency law seldom deprives creditors of any substantial
 claims that they would have been able to enforce outside the
 formal insolvency procedure, given that a right to enforce a
 claim against a hopelessly insolvent debtor has little or no
 practical value. The right to property may, however, have a
 special effect on the regulation of the rights of secured
 creditors under personal insolvency law.

 140. In addition to property rights, the right to work and
 fair remuneration and other social rights are also at issue in
 personal insolvency law. Even if social rights are not
 acknowledged as enforceable rights in all parts of the world,
 they should have a place in the design of legal frameworks.

 141. Furthermore,        all   human      rights   instruments
 acknowledge the right to a fair trial. The content of this right
 is regulated in detail in national laws. One important aspect

                               50
of this right is the right to be heard in matters that concern
one’s rights. Even if the right to be heard can be regulated in
an insolvency procedure in forms that differ from ordinary
civil procedure, it is important to emphasize that the human
rights instruments do not allow limitations of the right to a
fair trial. However, it is an established interpretation of
human rights instruments that access to courts can be
subject to a prerequisite of processing of the case by
administrative boards or bodies, and that the process as a
whole fulfills the requirements of a fair trial.

142. The traditional law of obligations, and constitutional
and human rights doctrines have resulted in insolvency
regimes having some degree of court involvement. There
are, however, somewhat differing opinions on how much
court involvement is needed. See Section II.2.B below.
Besides the civil and human rights considerations noted
above, a number of insolvency -specific matters are of
relevance when the issue of court involvement is addressed.

143. A substantial number of countries have introduced
insolvency proceedings for natural persons only since 1990,
and thus lack a long tradition of dealing with the challenges
of this particular type of proceeding. This lack of tradition
has led to innovative procedural solutions that vary from
country to country. Some countries emphasize the social and
administrative aspects, while some others highlight the
rights of the parties, leading to different procedural designs.
One key question is whether the systemic context of
personal insolvency laws should be contained either in a
specific law or in the general insolvency law.

144. As described in Section I.7 above, insolvency laws for
natural persons have a lot in common with general
insolvency laws designed primarily for business debtors, but
the former differ in their more pronounced interest in the
rehabilitation of the debtor and in the social good.
Depending on legal culture and traditions of the respective
countries, either the systematic similarity or the differences
between business insolvency and personal insolvency are
emphasized. These different approaches are to some extent
reflected in the choice of placing natural person insolvency
laws either within a general (business) insolvency law
(Bankruptcy or Insolvency Code) or in a separate law.

145. Historically, natural person insolvency developed as
part of the general insolvency law, primarily in several Anglo -
American systems. As debtors were granted relief in these
systems, certain regulations specifically designed for natural
persons developed within the broader insolvency law. Still
today, many countries have incorporated procedures for
natural person insolvency into their general insolvency
codes. Even if insolvency for natural persons is incorporated
in an insolvency code, it is usually a summary and quite
                              51
simple court proceeding, distinct from the more complex
procedures applied in business cases.

146. In contrast, several countries that have enacted
personal insolvency laws during the last two decades have
opted for a separate law. These laws are often not called
“insolvency” laws, much less “bankruptcy” laws. Rather, the
titles of these laws refer to rearrangement or adjustment of
debts. Many countries use a derivation of the word sanering
(“rehabilitation”), drawing a parallel between individual
insolvency and business reorganization.

147. Some of these laws are specifically designed to serve
natural persons not engaged in significant business activity.
Quite often the term “consumer debtor” is used, either in
law or, even more often, in legal scholarship, to point out
that the purpose of these laws is to provide an insolvency
procedure for persons who seek relief in their private
capacity as opposed to business debtors. The term consumer
does not necessarily mean that the debtor would have
become indebted through the consumption of goods and
services. It only means that the debtor is not pursuing a
business (or at least that the debtor’s business activity is
limited) at the time of filing.

148. In many countries, these laws come close to traditional
insolvency regulations, with an emphasis on rehabilitation.
For example, the debt adjustment laws in one region offer
the debtor a full insolvency procedure. These specific
procedures tend to focus more on the evaluation of the
debtor’s pre -insolvency behavior than the procedures in the
insolvency context. These systems also tend to offer debtors
counseling on budgeting and managing debts.

149. Placing debt relief within the general insolvency
context and enacting a separate law each seem to have their
merits. A separate law offers a better opportunity to take
into account the special needs of insolvent individuals as
opposed to businesses. This is helpful where there is a need
for a broader range of counseling services, including financial
counseling and referrals to social agencies. These services
are easier to attach to a specific procedure than to the
general insolvency regime. In addition, specific regulations
on access to the procedure and on the content and proposals
for payment plans are easier to formulate in a separate law.
In some countries, the personal insolvency procedure is
delegated to a different authority than the court, such as
specific commissions or debt enforcement authorities. In
others, specialized counselors have specific responsibilities
to aid the debtor and prepare the case before going to court.
These special needs are easier to take into account in the
design of the system if personal insolvency is regulated in a
specific law.

                             52
150. The placement of personal insolvency into the general
insolvency context has its merits as well. Separate laws are
often enacted for relatively simple cases, especially for
debtors with low income and few assets, but some
insolvency cases for natural persons include complicated
legal issues. Examples include cases of natural persons who
have a considerable debt load from prior businesses or who
at the time of filing are self -employed and/or debtors with
notable assets to distribute among the creditors. If natural
person insolvency is regulated in the context of general
insolvency law, it is possible to resort to the specific
institutions of insolvency law, such as the automatic (or court
imposed) stay of execution and other creditor actions,
exceptions from the stay, other effects of the opening of the
procedure, voidable transfers and other avoidance actions,
and protection of the family home, as well as to general
principles of insolvency law, such as equality of creditors. As
many natural persons’ insolvency cases have a background in
business failure, in some cases a smooth transfer from
business insolvency to natural person insolvency treatment is
needed. The placement of natural person insolvency in the
general insolvency law makes these kinds of overlaps
between business insolvency and personal insolvency easier
to manage.

151. The political discourse about natural person insolvency
takes quite different tones in different countries. In some
countries, the idea of straight discharge has been difficult to
accept. In other countries, the idea of a separate law on debt
relief for consumers has been related to excessive consumer
spending and use of consumer credit, whereas the general
insolvency regime has been understood as a more neutral
area of regulation.

II.2. The Institutional Framework
152. An effective institutional framework for the insolvency
of natural persons minimizes overall social costs. These
include the costs of error in determining the validity of debts
and levels of repayment, and the costs to creditors, debtors,
and third parties. An effective framework provides timely
outcomes and achieves confidence in its operation by
stakeholders and the general public.

153. An institutional framework for the insolvency of
natural persons is part of the ground rules for consumer and
commercial credit. Establishing a framework for the
insolvency of natural persons should be integral to the
development of consumer credit and debt collection
institutions within a country. These institutions include
banking regulations, procedures for the enforcement of
judgment debts, credit reporting and data privacy
regulations, financial education programs, debt counseling

                             53
services, and housing and social welfare policy. Insolvency
institutions are often linked closely to court systems and
confidence in the court system by both creditors and debtors
is a pre -condition to the effective operation of the
institutional framework of an insolvency system for natural
persons.

154. Individual insolvency cases are not a high stakes game,
even if in the aggregate they represent large numbers of
debtors in high income countries. The overwhelming
majority of individual debtors has few assets to liquidate and
limited income to repay debts or pay for advice. A significant
percentage has no capacity to repay (see Section I.8.C
above). However, individual insolvency may raise legal,
budgeting, and social issues that are not always simple.
Moreover, there is not one individual “insolvency type”.
There are different reasons for insolvency, and debtor
repayment capabilities. Several insolvency systems have
developed options for both partial repayment or
restructuring and an immediate discharge. “Gatekeepers” –
who may be lawyers, debt counselors, insolvency
practitioners, state officials, and judges – play an important
role in screening and channeling individuals to the
appropriate solution.

155. The growth of significant numbers of over -indebted
debtors in high -income countries has created a challenge in
fashioning an efficient and fair system of personal insolvency
administration. More individuals may be over -indebted but
cost pressures on financing justice systems and public
programs also exist. The treatment of over -indebtedness,
which addresses both consumption and production risks,
raises problems in public administration and governance,
such as the relative balance of public and private actors and
the appropriate role of legal, economic and social expertise.
Insolvency as a modest method of redistribution raises issues
similar to social welfare programs in terms of assuring access
to qualified applicants, similar treatment for individuals
similarly situated, the prevention of fraud and abuse (see
Section I.9.B above), and the reduction of unnecessary
bureaucratic requirements.

156. Experience suggests that as the numbers of individual
debtors needing insolvency relief increases – there is no
definite “tipping point” – individual insolvency becomes a
routinized process where the policy issues become those of
cost-effective targeting of relief based on relatively clear
rules that can be applied in a straightforward manner by
decision makers. Section II.5.B documents this movement
from individualized discretion to standardization in
repayment plans in those countries with substantial numbers
of individual insolvents.


                             54
157. Institutional frameworks are related to many factors,
including the history and politics of insolvency reform that
shape different countries’ conceptualization of the
insolvency of natural persons. Insolvency relief may be
conceptualized as part of welfare or consumer protection,
integrated with educational and preventive measures to
address debt, or treated as simply an issue of economic
adjustment between private actors permitting an individual
reentry to the credit market. This conceptualization affects
issues such as financing of the system and access, as well as
the type and role of intermediaries (lawyers, debt
counselors, and accountants) involved in the system.
Irrespective of the nature of the intermediaries, experience
suggests that many countries are unwilling to invest
substantially in support systems to address debtors’
problems in a comprehensive manner, so that intermediaries
tend to be primarily concerned with shepherding individuals
through the system. This is a modest but valuable role.
Insolvency can also be a mechanism for referring individuals
with social problems to other social institutions.

158. Institutional frameworks are linked to the complexity
of the law. Open-textured and complex provisions may
increase disputes and the need for specialist expertise.
Relatively bright line rules, while creating potential individual
injustice, can be computerized, and processed quickly by
individuals without high levels of professional expertise. A
routinized approach may work best in the context of a
majority of cases where creditors are to receive a minimal
distribution for their claims, if anything at all.

159. Responsibility for the overall management of the
system may be assigned to a Ministry or specialized agency
that can oversee individual insolvencies and the institutional
actors involved as part of economic and social policy.
Specialist agencies can exercise policing, rulemaking and
enforcement powers, as well as intervene in matters of
public interest. The existence of a robust, yet neutral,
policeman is often a key part of ensuring public confidence
in the integrity of the insolvency system. Reliable data on the
operation of the system should be collected because
individual over -indebtedness and insolvency are politically
charged issues and the media often reports “atrocity stories”
about the conduct of debtors and creditors.

A)   Existing Frameworks for the Insolvency of Natural
     Persons
160. Institutional frameworks exist on a continuum ranging
from: (1) systems in which an administrative agency
dominates, to (2) hybrid public/private systems where public
processing of insolvency co -exists with private restructuring

                              55
alternatives, and to (3) court -based systems primarily
serviced by publicly funded or private intermediaries. These
are, of course, ideal types. Thus, courts play some role in all
systems. Personal insolvency may be included within existing
insolvency law, or may be part of a distinct code. The
comparative advantages of these options were discussed
earlier in Section II.1.

161. Systems can be classified according to the balance of
public and private sector alternatives and actors. Some
countries ban private debt management companies and a
public agency administers the system. In contrast, other
countries provide alternatives that include both state
processing of individual insolvents and the involvement of a
significant private sector in administering restructuring
alternatives. The main arguments against the existence of a
large private sector are the potential dangers of exploitation
of a vulnerable population of debtors and the belief that
debt problems are a social issue that can only be effectively
addressed by courts and/or public agencies. The existence of
private over -indebtedness industries has certainly given rise
to abuses and necessitated public regulation, itself a cost
that must be factored into any assessment of the role of the
private and public sectors. However, there are benefits in
terms of expertise and costs in harnessing the private sector
to address over -indebtedness: any system that relies solely
on the public sector is likely to incur delays in the treatment
of debtors; thus, a careful balance needs to be achieved
between the role of the private and public sectors.

B)   Court-based Systems and the Role of Courts
162. The majority of countries have court -based systems for
personal insolvency and restructuring. However, in practice
the role of courts may vary significantly and include the
following: acting as gatekeepers to entry, establishing
repayment plans, determining issues relating to assets and
liabilities of a debtor, monitoring insolvency representatives,
and determining the dischargeability of debts. There is an
increased tendency in high income countries to limit the role
of courts, for example, by dispensing with the requirement
of a court hearing for filing for insolvency, and to recognize
that the court hearing is often a formality in the insolvency
of natural persons. In some countries, individuals apply for
insolvency through an administrative agency. In other
countries, judges or their deputies may ensure that
formalities have been complied with where much of the
work will already have been completed by debt counselors,
lawyers or accountants. These observations do not mean
that courts play an unimportant role in determining
individual rights in insolvency, but rather that their
intervention is the exception rather than the norm.


                             56
163. Courts have a number of institutional advantages.
Judges can act as impartial and trusted decision makers.
Indeed, courts may be required to play some role in personal
insolvency in the light of constitutional and human rights
norms (see Section II.1.B above). They can oversee those
intermediaries involved in administering repayment plans
addressing in summary procedures exceptional cases of
disputes that may arise between the parties.

164. However, courts have disadvantages. Courts and judges
are costly; may be regarded as inaccessible and intimidating
by individual debtors; and are designed to resolve adversarial
legal disputes. However, adversarial legal disputes between
creditors and debtors are rare in individual insolvency cases;
thus personal insolvency adjudication is primarily an
administrative process even in those systems where lawyers
and courts are central actors. If courts are to be involved,
there is a need to educate judges on issues related to credit
and debt, budgeting, and social issues. The ability of courts
to oversee and regulate the individual insolvency procedure
is limited. Courts can act only when individuals bring issues
before them and thus, are heavily dependent on individual
initiative. Given the stakes in individual insolvency neither
creditor nor debtor may have adequate incentives to bring
issues before a judge.

165. Court -based systems may face significant delays. The
pressure on public funding of the judicial system, the limited
ability of lower courts to address economic and social issues
of debt, and the variable decision making by judges create
pressure for increased specialization and administrative
processing, particularly for the large percentage of “NINA”
(no income, no assets) debtors, and more effective sorting of
cases where private negotiation will be meaningful.

166. Several countries responded to the upsurge of over -
indebtedness after the late 1980’s recession by modifying
court procedures to permit judicially sanctioned debt
repayment plans with the possibility of discharge of debts
after a period of repayment. These countries endeavored to
conserve judicial resources by requiring an attempt at a
supervised negotiated settlement before filing a court
application. However, this was often not successful in
decreasing the number of cases filed before the courts, and
resulted in queuing by debtors for both advice and court
hearings.

C)   The Role of Trusted Intermediaries
167. Intermediaries in the insolvency of natural persons
may be lawyers, accountants, or debt counselors. These
intermediaries    may     have   different  backgrounds,
qualifications and roles. They may be public officials or

                             57
 private professionals; they may be acting as officers of the
 court or be subject to professional norms. In the majority of
 countries, the activities of intermediaries are not subsidized
 by the state. In some countries, the local or central state
 budgets subsidize their activities, when individual debtors
 are unable to finance insolvency. Thus, state -accredited
 institutions employing lawyers and social workers may
 undertake judicial mediation and act as court appointed
 administrators of debt repayment plans. In other countries, a
 combination of state -financed debt counselors and lawyers
 may assist debtors.

 168. A court -based system inevitably relies more heavily
 than an administrative system on trusted intermediaries to
 assist debtors and to negotiate, administer and supervise
 repayment plans. Their role is crucial in establishing the
 viability and integrity of the system. Trusted intermediaries
 can significantly reduce transaction and error costs. They can
 ensure realistic repayment schedules, check the validity of
 debts, identify and investigate different types of debtors,
 administer repayment plans and provide impartial advice. A
 loss of trust in intermediaries can undermine the
 effectiveness of a system of debt relief. One reason for
 creditors’ preference in one country for the use of the
 statutory court process rather than informal settlement was
 a perception of the courts as more impartial than debt
 counseling agencies. In another, a combination of complex
 legislation and a limited number of trained debt counselors
 resulted in a large backlog of cases and in a breakdown in
 trust between debtors’ intermediaries and creditors.

 169. Intermediaries often play a number of potentially
 conflicting roles – acting as counselor to the debtor,
 administering plans, reporting to courts, and ensuring
 compliance by debtors with insolvency requirements and
 repayment plans. Debtors may often lack knowledge of an
 insolvency system and the potential implications of their
 choices, particularly in systems where there are several
 possible procedural avenues for the treatment of individual
 insolvency ( multi -track systems). This confers significant
 power on intermediaries, whether they are lawyers,
 accountants or debt counselors. Studies in some countries
 indicate that intermediaries may further their own financial
 or ideological interests by inappropriately steering of debtors
 to particular solutions without a debtor being aware of this
 fact. 12 It is probably impossible to avoid the exercise of

12 See, e.g., Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Committee on
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Profiteering
in a Non - Profit Industry: Abusive Practices in Credit Counseling (2005);
Consumer Federation of America & National Consumer Law Center,
Credit Counseling in Crisis: The Impact on Consumers of Funding Cuts,
Higher Fees and Aggressive New Market Entrants (2003); Iain Ramsay,
Market Imperatives, Professional Discretion and the Role of

                                   58
discretion by a professional, but a simplified system can
reduce the need for extensive professional intervention and
reduce costs to the debtor.

170. Whatever          their     professional      background
intermediaries are generally constrained by costs—either
through budget limitations or through the limited ability of
individuals to pay for advice. Processes become routinized to
reduce costs. Sophisticated computerization can identify
swiftly a significant number of alternatives for debtors. Given
the limited human resources for providing individualized
advice to debtors, there may be a tendency for overworked
advisors to provide a limited number of standard solutions.
Computer programs can address this problem and also
monitor decision making to ensure the appropriate use of
discretion. Careful attention to the design of computer
programs for channeling consumer debtors to distinct
solutions may attain long term economic and social benefits.

171. In light of the above observations, it is important to
promote strong ethical codes and/or regulation for
intermediaries dealing with debtors. The UNCITRAL
Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law (Part II, Section III.B 1-7)
provides a guide to qualifications and personal qualities for
insolvency representatives. The insolvency of natural persons
raises budgeting, family, and social issues as well as the legal
rights of the parties. There are advantages to intermediaries
being qualified in these areas, at least to a level of
knowledge appropriate to refer an individual to a family or
social agency. There is always a danger that professional
licensing may unduly restrict entry to the profession. Thus, in
determining who may act as intermediary, a balance needs
to be struck between ensuring intermediaries are qualified
to address the problems of individual insolvents, on the one
hand, and on the other hand, not unduly limiting the range
of individuals who may provide advice and assistance.

D)   Administrative           Models         of     Insolvency
Processing
172. In several countries, public agencies play a significant
role in sorting, processing, and administering the insolvency
of natural persons.

173. Administrative processing can introduce a stable
bureaucracy with the ability to develop experience in
identifying and sorting cases that deserve examination and
investigation and providing impartial advice and information
to debtors and creditors. It can act proactively to deter abuse
of the system and address moral hazard issues. But
administrative processing also has disadvantages, including

Canadian Trustee in Bankruptcy , 74 A M . BANKR . L.J. 399 (2000).

                               59
the dangers of capture by creditors, debtors or professional
groups, and potential conflicts of interest within the
administration. Since public agencies often do not have clear
measures of success (in terms of profit and loss) ensuring an
appropriate monitoring and reporting framework for an
agency is also necessary.

174. Experience of administrative processing does not
indicate the existence of capture, although using existing
institutions such as tax enforcement regimes to administer
insolvency of natural persons may require retraining
employees. Conflicts of interest may be addressed by
separating the administration and investigation functions.
There are significant differences between existing public
processors of individual insolvents. The following discussion
outlines the main contours of distinct approaches that reflect
partly historical path dependence and political factors.
175. Several countries have a modified Official Receiver
model where a state agency investigates an insolvent
debtor’s affairs and acts as the administrator of small
insolvency estates -which have always constituted the vast
majority of estates- where the assets of the insolvency estate
do not justify the appointment of a private insolvency
representative and outsources the larger, more complicated
cases. In some systems adopting this model, there has been
a movement to try to outsource all cases. The original
rationale for this state regulation was the failure of creditor
control. State supervision might protect small creditors and
ensure the maintenance of commercial morality. The
transformation of individual insolvency during the past few
decades, from a creditor -initiated process primarily used
against small businesses, to one where individuals initiate
the great majority of insolvency cases means that these
agencies administer primarily individual cases. Some
countries using this model have developed low -cost
summary procedures, requiring no court involvement,
available on -line for those individuals with no significant
income or assets. These agencies can also provide
information and advice to over -indebted individuals. The
existence of such an agency reduces the need for (and costs
of) professional advice and representation and may reduce
formalities and costs through the use of modern
technologies.

176. Some countries have developed a state -financed “one -
stop shop” for over -indebted individuals. This institution
determines whether a debtor meets the entry criteria,
suggests a conciliated plan (including moratoria or
rescheduling of debts), and, where necessary, asserts the
power to impose a composition or recommend a discharge
of debts after a short period of time for individuals who have
no possibility of putting in place a repayment plan. Courts
now play a residual role within such a system and the key to
                             60
the operation of the system is the secretariat staffed by state
employees. Other countries have adapted existing
institutions such as tax collection agencies or debt
enforcement agencies to administer individual insolvency
proceedings.

177. Hybrid public -private models also exist where the
primary actors are private insolvency practitioners who
assess, administer and investigate debtors, but there is close
supervision through a public regulator that licenses
practitioners and may also intervene in the process.

178. The existence of a state-administered procedure for
insolvent debtors who rarely have significant assets or
income to pay for the costs of the process raises the issue of
how to fund a public insolvency system (see Section II.2.F
below).



E)   Comparative Institutional Issues in the Choice of
     the Institutional Framework
179. Sections II.2 C and D outlined advantages and
disadvantages of courts and administrative agencies in the
design of an institutional framework of the insolvency of
natural persons. A comparative institutional analysis of the
role of courts and administrative agencies must take into
account the context of existing institutions in particular
countries, and the regulation of those providing professional
services to debtors. If there is little general confidence in the
court system of a country or limited numbers of qualified
professionals to assist debtors, then court reform and the
development of qualified professionals might possibly
precede or coincide with the introduction of insolvency
procedures. It may be useful to develop ADR mechanisms or
experiments with new procedures in some courts as a
prelude to national implementation.

180. Developing economies with increasing levels of
indebted individuals may face significant costs in establishing
a novel, nationwide infrastructure of officials and
intermediaries for an effective personal insolvency system.
Research on other areas of the law concludes that it may not
be desirable to transplant overly complex procedures from
richer to poorer countries since the courts in these countries
may not have the administrative capacity to address these
issues. Therefore, there may be advantages in building upon
existing institutional infrastructures and keeping procedures
simple, at least initially.


                              61
181. Several high income countries developed an
institutional framework for the insolvency of natural persons
by modifying available judicial procedures. Others modified
existing administrative structures. A few introduced novel
frameworks for addressing consumer over -indebtedness. The
process in many countries has generally been one of
incremental responses to the changing nature of the demand
for insolvency, for example the recognition of the need for
NINA procedures. This experience also counsels in favor of
informed incrementalism rather than comprehensive
rationality in institutional design. Such an approach may be
more acceptable in the politically contentious area of
personal insolvency.

182. The use of computer technology might provide an
opportunity for reducing both processing and error costs.
Online access to insolvency procedures through approved
intermediaries using standardized insolvency programs with
the possibility of random audits and using data from credit
bureaus, where available, could provide relief while assuring
the prevention of abuse. Several countries have adopted this
approach sometimes restricting it to individuals with debts
under a certain level. Random audits are especially
important; if debtors believe that proper investigation will
not take place in cases in which there are no assets, some
debtors might be tempted to “dispose” of all of their assets
pre -petition.

F)    Financing Issues
183. Many individuals have difficulties in financing access to
the insolvency procedure. Five approaches to financing exist:
(1) state funding of the process (including both creditor and
debtor costs); (2) cross -subsidization of low value
insolvencies by higher value estates; (3) state subsidies to
professionals involved in the process and write-off of court
costs where there is an inability to repay; (4) levies on
creditors, such as taxation of distressed debt to fund those
cases where individuals have no ability to pay; and (5) no
state support beyond any general public funding of the court
system. The majority of countries have adopted the final
alternative. In some countries, the challenge of funding
individual debtors and providing access to insolvency
procedures has been met through innovative methods of
private processing by private professionals. In other
countries, the absence of state support is likely to undermine
the possibility of relief. Providing high quality professional
support for personal insolvency systems where debtors have
few resources is a policy challenge. All of the above systems
of funding have some disadvantages. Full public funding of
the process subsidizes both debtors and creditors whose
costs of recovery are thus reduced. Since these are paid from
general revenues there is likely to be continuing pressure to
reduce the level of expenditure. Cross -subsidization depends
                             62
on a significant level of non -subsidized insolvencies that may
vary in amount over time. Taxation of distressed debt may be
subject to manipulation. User pay systems may result in
exclusion from access for those unable to pay the fees or in
poor preparation of the necessary documentation by
debtors, increasing administrative costs.

184. Section I.8 above described the economic and social
benefits to debtors, creditors, and third parties from the
existence of personal insolvency. If the existence of these
benefits is accepted, it follows that all parties should
contribute their fair share to the financing of the framework.
“Fair share” may mean that creditors contribute through a
levy. Creditors may pass along these costs to the public, but
they may also have incentives to reduce the number of
debtors in default. For some debtors with limited resources
fair share could mean no contribution.
185. Financing issues can be softened quite effectively by
addressing the expense side of the system. Several countries
have reduced the costs of personal insolvency by introducing
summary procedures, so that the traditional formalities of
insolvency such as creditors’ meetings, or the examination of
a debtor occur only in exceptional cases. These changes
often reflect the reality of existing practice. As mentioned in
Section II.2.E above, use of the Internet in the initial
processing of cases has increased. The use of online systems
can reduce costs throughout an insolvency system, for
example, through standardized programs for assessing and
calculating debtors’ disposable incomes and monitoring
repayment plans. Intelligent use of online programs could
achieve the desired balance between uniformity and
discretion in the treatment of debtors.

II.3. Access to the Formal Insolvency Regime
186. Independently of other policy decisions taken in the
design of a personal insolvency regime, the standards for
access to individual insolvency and restructuring procedures
should be transparent and certain, and should ensure against
improper use by either creditors or debtors. Both creditors
and debtors can initiate individual insolvency proceedings in
several countries. However, almost all the countries that
have introduced distinct systems of insolvency of natural
persons in recent decades only accept filings by debtors to
commence these proceedings. As indicated in Section II.1
above, creditors’ insolvency petitions against individual
debtors are uncommon even in most of the countries where
such petitions are possible. There are some systems,
however, where personal insolvency is used as a threat in the
collection efforts of creditors, and the threat is more intense
where the stigma attached to insolvency is greater. This use
of personal insolvency may undermine many of the potential

                             63
benefits of a regime of insolvency of natural persons
outlined in Section I.8 above.

187. If creditors’ insolvency petitions are permitted then
controls may be desirable on the extent to which insolvency
can be used as an individual creditor’s remedy and to
prevent its abuse as a collection tool. This may be either
through a requirement that more than one creditor initiate a
petition, or by establishing a high financial floor for an
individual debt as a prerequisite for a petition. The
disadvantage of the latter approach is that the financial
limits must be kept under review to ensure that they do not
become outdated.

188. Insolvency systems traditionally appeal to two
standards as a gateway to insolvency proceedings: a
“cessation of payments test” and a “balance sheet test” (see
generally UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law, Part
II, Section I, A -B; and World Bank Principles for Effective
Insolvency and Creditor Rights Systems, Principle C4.2). The
cessation of payments test is the primary test in insolvency
of natural persons and is simpler to apply than a balance
sheet test. In addition, some countries include further “acts
of bankruptcy” as a trigger for an insolvency application.
These are historical criteria that fit uneasily into
contemporary personal insolvency law where the central
issue is inability to repay rather than wrongful actions by
debtors.

A)   Debtor Access
189. Personal insolvency and debt adjustment systems
differ on the extent to which there is open access for
debtors. Open access refers to the idea that an individual
who meets an insolvency test such as the inability to pay
debts as they fall due may, without more, gain access to an
insolvency procedure that would permit an ultimate
discharge of debts. Open access may reduce the hesitation
by “honest but unfortunate” debtors -as noted in Section
I.9.C above- to seek relief. There is a system that does not
require a debtor to be insolvent as a condition of access. The
advantage of this approach is that it reduces the initial
screening costs of an insolvency test, delaying them to a later
stage when a filing may be challenged for abuse. It also may
encourage over -indebted individuals to petition for
insolvency relief. There are, however, disadvantages. In
practice, individuals who are not insolvent do not file, but
the absence of an insolvency requirement is politically
contentious, raising unnecessary debate about moral hazard.
Indeed, though this system does not require an insolvency
test, it does impose both a presumption of abuse when
individuals are classified as having excess income available to
pay creditors and also requires mandatory counseling for

                             64
debtors as a condition for filing that may add over inclusive
screening costs.

190. Some systems provide relatively open access but
require a debtor to undergo a period of good behavior over
several years before being permitted to discharge debts.
During this period, individuals must set aside a certain
portion of their income for the repayment of debts, though
in practice the majority of them make no repayments
because they have no surplus income.

191. Debtors’ access to insolvency procedures may be
subject to several legal and practical conditions including the
following: a minimum level of debt; a future oriented test of
“permanent insolvency;” “good faith;” and a requirement
that debts be caused by events beyond a debtor’s control
such as illness or unemployment. A debtor may have to
demonstrate that he has consulted an approved
intermediary, obtained counseling, or attempted a
negotiated settlement before being permitted to make an
application for insolvency. Access may depend on ability to
pay. The costs of insolvency procedures may limit access for
eligible debtors (see Section II.2.F above, on methods of cost
reduction).

192. A distinction may be drawn between those systems
that define insolvency as a current inability to meet present
debts and those that include the possibility of debtors being
able to improve their financial situation and repay debts at a
future date. Some countries adopt this forward -looking
perspective of “permanent insolvency.” This is a more
speculative and consequently uncertain standard that raises
decision making and error costs and may result in the
adoption of over inclusive proxies. Thus, in certain systems it
may be more difficult for younger debtors to access
insolvency.

193. Restrictive approaches often reflect the objective of
using the access criteria to maintain the principle pacta sunt
servanda (“agreements must be kept”) and protection against
moral hazard, avoiding the risk that individuals may be
tempted to incur excessive debts knowing that they can be
discharged in insolvency. Some countries limit access to
individuals who have experienced severe economic and
social distress, such as long term involuntary unemployment;
or impose good faith requirements on debtors. It is difficult
to measure the effects of this approach on maintaining a
payment morality but there is little substantial evidence of
moral hazard in existing systems (see Section I.9.A above)
where there is relatively open access. Such systems often
apply intermediate sanctions (see Section II.2.F above) to
individuals after entry to the insolvency system rather than
bar initial entry. In addition, any reduction in moral hazard
needs to be balanced against the increased screening costs
                             65
and the social costs of more restricted access, which may
include loss of productivity and effects on families and
health. Section I.8.C outlined the potential extent of these
costs.

194. One method of addressing potential moral hazard is to
limit the frequency of access to insolvency. This might be
accomplished by applying a bright -line rule restricting access
to a second insolvency procedure within a defined period of
time. Various countries prevent repeat access within two,
four, six, or ten years following a first insolvency case.
Alternatively, some countries subject a repeat filer
automatically to more intensive investigation, and only
“exceptional” cases are admitted to a second relief
proceeding.

195. The concept of “good faith” is an explicit criterion for
access in several countries. This open -textured standard has
resulted in substantial litigation in several systems with lower
courts basing their decisions on a variety of perceptions of
the debtor’s situation and conduct. It is often difficult to
judge the conduct of an individual ex post facto and to
determine whether his conduct was unfortunate, imprudent
or negligent, and where the boundary exists between
negligence and bad faith. As a consequence of these
difficulties, most systems have adopted a lower standard of
intentional fraud or of the concept of honesty. It may
actually be impossible to excise moral judgments from
insolvency administration. However, the good faith
requirement is likely to lead to variable decision making and
increase disputes. This is particularly problematic in
countries with a relatively decentralized judiciary.

196. Access criteria may be a combination of rules and
standards. Insolvency systems may both specify, through
rules, conduct which might prevent access to the procedure,
such as failure to disclose assets or the provision of false
information, while also leaving judges or administrators a
residual discretion to police for abuse through a standard. It
is difficult to determine the optimal balance of rules and
standards in policy making. The over - and under -
inclusiveness of rules (i.e., including individuals who do not
fit the underlying policy and excluding those who do) must
be balanced against the costs of application of a general
standard. In the context of access to individual insolvency
there are advantages to favoring rules over standards. This
requires legislatures to articulate clearly the rules for
insolvency relief and to avoid the easy political choice for
hard decisions, namely to make the judiciary responsible for
managing access to the system through the enactment of a
standard. Rules are also less costly to administer, reducing
the need for unnecessarily high levels of expertise.


                              66
197. High access barriers to the formal system of relief may
result in leaving some individuals in a state of “informal
insolvency.” Individuals unable to access debt relief lose
incentives to participate in society; they may require
continued state support or might go “underground” for
several years to avoid creditors until their problems go away
or passions cool off. Creditors may be unlikely to recover
significant amounts in the free -for-all of individual collection
actions but they nevertheless inflict a significant social and
emotional toll. Inability to access debt relief may also result
in political backlash such as debt strikes. Sections I.8.A, B,
and C above have already described these issues in outlining
the benefits of an insolvency system.

198. In some countries, access may be dependent on a legal
requirement to consult an intermediary and obtain advice on
alternatives to insolvency. These intermediaries may include
lawyers, debt counselors, accountants, or social workers.
This requirement may be premised on an assumption that
individuals may not think through the consequences of
insolvency or may be unaware of potential alternatives. It
may also be intended to protect against potential abuse of
the system. This requirement can be useful if there is
adequate, high -quality advice and if there is evidence that
the benefits of this intervention are likely to exceed its costs.
Existing evidence suggests that mandatory pre -insolvency
counseling is radically over -inclusive in protecting against
abuse or in assisting debtors in avoiding insolvency. A general
requirement of such counseling may divert limited
counseling resources from those cases where counseling may
be most productive.

199. A distinction may be drawn between those systems
that create high initial barriers to access based on a debtor’s
conduct and those where individuals may be permitted to
enter the system but may be sanctioned for their conduct.
Thus, in some systems there is relatively open access but if a
debtor has engaged in culpable conduct, such as incurring
before insolvency a debt that the debtor has no reasonable
expectation of being able to repay, then such an individual
may be subject to a sanction or may have limits imposed on
the discharge of debts. Open access does not mean,
therefore, that an individual’s conduct will not be reviewed
or sanctioned in insolvency. Insolvency can provide both a
protective and disciplinary function. Creditors or state
agencies can play a role here through opportunities to
challenge an individual’s discharge.

200. An opportunity for a creditor or agency to challenge a
discharge or otherwise sanction a debtor provides a
protection against moral hazard and adds legitimacy to a
system of individual insolvency by increasing participation by
creditors. However, creditors have other opportunities to
participate in the procedure (see Section II.4 below) and
                              67
unless the criteria for such a challenge are clear, the increase
in decision making and error costs may outweigh the
benefits. Some systems that confer substantial discretion to
judges to determine discharge issues exhibit wide variation
in decision making. Courts face difficulties in making
accurate judgments on whether an individual’s behavior was,
for example, extravagant. There is a danger that errors here
can undermine the opportunity of a “fresh start” for an
individual debtor. Section II.6 below discusses those specific
debts that many systems exclude from a discharge that
reflect political decisions by legislatures.

B)   Controlling Access in a Multi-Track Insolvency
     System
201. Insolvency systems offer a variety of options ranging
from temporary moratoria, to restructuring to a full
discharge. Section II.5.B below discusses the role of
repayment plans. The law may structure access to these
options through income or asset criteria, or through the
requirement that all debtors must go through a similar
procedure, for example a repayment program, before being
able to access a discharge. Ideally, options should match the
broad contours of the different types of over -indebted
individuals as discussed in Section II.2 above (Institutional
Framework). The existence of insolvency options raises the
question of the extent to which access should be (a)
dependent on consumer choice or (b) a decision of a public
agency or official. Existing systems differ on this question:
systems that permit significant consumer choice require
public or private intermediaries to assist individuals in
decision making, due to the complexity of the system and
the important consequences of the decision. Mechanisms
that permit creditors or public agencies to monitor and
challenge consumer choice also exist in these systems.
Systems that rely primarily on public agency decision making
reduce debtors’ costs and can provide disinterested decision
making that will safeguard the integrity of the system.
Procedures will be necessary in these systems to ensure the
consistent application of rules and to permit challenges to
agency decisions. The relative balance of consumer choice
and public decision making will affect the costs to be borne
by the debtor and the public system, and the role of
intermediaries.

202. The more complex an insolvency system is in terms of
distinct and overlapping procedures, the greater will be the
difficulties that an over -indebted individual, who may be in a
vulnerable position, will face in making an effective choice.
203. Impartial intermediaries can assist individuals. In a
multi-track  system    based    on    consumer     choice,

                              68
intermediaries may however have significant power and may
be tempted to steer individuals to a particular solution based
on their financial or ideological interests rather than on the
best interests of the debtor, and this provides support for the
regulation of such intermediaries. Simplification also reduces
the power of intermediaries, debtors’ information costs, and
information processing costs. Appropriate information for
debtors and creditors provided by an agency or ministry
might reduce information costs.

204. Some systems use initial screening based on income
criteria to determine the debtor’s choice. This is based on
the simple –but often difficult to apply in practice -
distinction that debtors who “can pay” “should pay” a
portion of their income. This approach may be desirable at
the point of entry in a system where post -insolvency income
is not treated as part of the insolvency estate. It also helps in
getting creditors to support the process. Other systems that
do not screen as aggressively at the initial stage may
automatically apply a surplus income requirement, based on
regulations, which will capture any surplus income over a
period of time (see discussion in Section II.5.B below). In a
few systems, a central agency effectively decides the
particular option for a consumer.

205. Some systems restrict access to debt relief to
individuals with consumer rather than business debts.
Restrictions on access to those with only consumer debts
may result in litigation over the nature of debts, particularly
given the increased overlap between consumption and
production debts in small businesses. Experience indicates
that in many countries a significant percentage of individuals
using the insolvency system have debts related to failed
businesses. The advantage of a separate consumer
insolvency system is that it will consider more
straightforward consumer cases. The disadvantage is that it
increases screening costs and may deny access to individuals
with business debts who differ from consumer debtors in
only modest ways (see Sections I.7.C and II.1 above).

II.4. Participation of Creditors

A)   Creditor Participation in General
206. In business insolvency, significant value is often
available for creditors, and the restructuring of a company
and the regulation of debt are subject to vote by the
creditors and to the involvement of creditors’ committees
(especially in large cases). The voting rules may be complex
and the outcome may depend on the number of creditors
and on the amount of outstanding debt.


                              69
207. In insolvency procedures for natural persons, in
contrast, very little value is usually available, and the
creditors normally play little or no role in the procedure.
Even where creditors are invited to participate, their
participation in natural personal insolvency cases cannot be
taken for granted. Creditors will participate when they view
it as being in their best interest to do so, and they will be
reluctant to participate when they believe that their
involvement is unlikely to increase their dividend. Thus, in
the great bulk of natural person insolvency cases, where
little or no dividend to creditors is expected, creditor
passivity might well be the rational choice. In insolvency
cases involving natural persons, creditors have most often
regarded the likely dividends from such proceedings to be
insufficient to warrant their participation. Even if a creditor’s
objection against the commencement of insolvency
proceedings might be sustained, the result is most likely to
be an uncollectible claim against a debtor who is practically
insolvent even if not legally entitled to relief. Consequently,
in the overwhelming majority of insolvency cases involving
natural persons in the world today, active creditor
participation is exceptional.

208. Some systems deal with this issue by lowering the
quorum for creditors’ meetings (in one system to as low as
one creditor); in other cases, systems have found ways to
simplify or reduce creditor participation; and finally, in other
systems, there are only mechanisms for creditor
participation in cases where significant value from assets or
future income is expected. In recent years, lawmakers from
many countries have concluded that the paltry gains to be
had from inviting creditors to participate in most natural
person insolvency cases are far outweighed by the significant
administrative costs and delays occasioned by creditors’
meetings. As a result, a notable trend has developed to scrap
creditors’ meetings, and simplify the submission and
verification of claims and other forms of creditor
participation, taking into account that there is only a small
fraction of cases in which a significant sum is expected to be
distributed to creditors.

B)   Creditor Participation in Plan Confirmation
209. An especially important contrast with business
insolvency is that, in the insolvency of natural persons,
creditors generally have little if any meaningful influence
over the establishment (confirmation) of a payment plan or
other requirement for discharge or other relief. Even in those
relatively few systems in which creditors may vote on the
plan, their vote generally influences how much the debtor
has to pay but not the issue of discharge as such. Some
systems vest more authority over plan approval in creditors
holding certain identified percentages of claims (usually at

                              70
least a majority, if not more), though in such systems, a fully
non-consensual route to discharge is available to most
debtors if creditors refuse the proposed plan. In one system
in particular, the availability of a standard discharge
procedure is explicitly regarded as a “stick behind the door”
to threaten creditors with undesirable consequences if they
refuse to accept a consensual plan.

210. In the business context, renegotiation of distressed
debt is regarded as almost entirely a matter of private
contracting, rather than social planning. The limited liability
of business entities offers powerful inherent leverage to
debtors in such situations, and the state might well have
little specific interest in preventing creditors from simply
demanding that the debtor -company liquidate and go out of
existence. To be sure, this position has been evolving rapidly
over the past several decades, as a culture of rescue and
rehabilitation has swept the world of business insolvency, as
well. But the desire for rescue and preservation of business,
particularly artificial entities, is generally regarded as far less
pressing than the moral and economic imperatives to protect
and preserve natural persons and their families.

211. Most societies today are not willing to allow creditors
to push their natural person debtors over the edge, or even
to confine them to a distressed state indefinitely. Moreover,
natural person debtors most often occupy a substantially
weaker bargaining position than their business debtor
counterparts, and at the very least, they are generally less
capable of making sophisticated financial analyses or of
engaging professional assistance to help them in doing so.
Once the situation has deteriorated to the point where a
natural person debtor would seek formal insolvency relief,
natural market forces and freedom of contract are no longer
sufficient safeguards of the public health and welfare.

212. For societies that have chosen to adopt an insolvency
regime for natural persons, the decision as to how debts will
be adjusted through legal intervention is generally regarded
as more than a simple matter of contract law. Creditors are
protected not through their negotiation leverage, but
through their representation by state authorities. The proper
levels of sacrifice by distressed debtors, and the appropriate
levels of protection of and compromise by their creditors,
are sensitive matters of social policy. Policymakers from a
wide variety of regions seem to have all but unanimously
concluded that these questions in the final analysis are best
resolved by political representatives whose task is to balance
the competing interests of different constituencies, such as
debtors and creditors. Rather than leaving these questions to
private negotiations among creditors and debtors, state
authorities have consistently been assigned to make the key
decisions with respect to the duration and level of sacrifice
in insolvency payment plans. If debtors are willing and able
                               71
to fulfill the carefully structured demands placed on them by
the insolvency system, they will receive the relief offered by
that system, despite what would be in virtually every case
vociferous creditor objection if creditors were asked their
opinion on the terms of relief.

213. Even if a fully coercive endgame stands as the final
option, some element of contractual freedom and creditor
participation continues to play a central role in many
insolvency systems. The discussion in Section II.1 above
regarding informal, out -of-court arrangements offers a
primary example. Even in the formal relief system, the
resolution of any individual case might be influenced at least
in part by creditors’ agreement. In several systems, for
example, creditors have an option to avoid the court -
imposed payment -plan-and-discharge process by accepting a
compromise plan. If a majority of creditors accepts the
debtor’s offer of five years of projected non -exempt income,
such a plan can be confirmed over the objection of a
dissenting minority of creditors. This combination of creditor
assent and court coercion has met with success in a
substantial number of natural person insolvency cases in a
few systems in recent years. Such intermediate approaches
have enjoyed markedly less success elsewhere, however,
especially where more than simple majority support from
creditors is required. Concerns about eroding contractual
freedom have been addressed by giving creditors a chance to
accept the reality of the debtor’s distress. If they refuse,
however, the underlying premise of most existing insolvency
systems is that the goals of such a system can be achieved
only if a higher authority is willing to step in and impose a
compromise arrangement for the benefit of creditors,
debtors, and society in general.

214. The reasons why the decision on plan confirmation and
discharge is generally assigned to the court or relevant
administrative body rather than creditors include the
following:
     Creditors adopt very different policies regarding debt
    adjustment. Sometimes important creditors, such as the
    tax authorities, major banks, or debt collection agencies
    who have bought a large number of claims, make policy
    decisions to oppose all or most categories of insolvency
    filings by natural persons. In some systems, some types of
    creditors are on record as opposing relief in such cases “on
    principle.” In many systems, tax authorities and other
    governmental actors are prohibited by law from voting to
    offer relief from public debts. Such policies and laws can be
    very detrimental to the debtors, especially because those
    broad policies ignore the worthiness of the debtor or the
    quality of the payment plan, and such policies ultimately
    undermine the achievement of the many benefits of the

                              72
    system for other creditors and society, as discussed in
    Section I.8 above.

     There is a problem of creditor passivity. This can have
    serious consequences in a vote: a “majority” decision may
    reflect a random majority if most of the creditors remain
    passive. A few systems have devised a solution to this
    problem short of excluding creditors entirely from
    participation in the plan confirmation process: creditors
    are invited to vote on a plan, but creditor passivity is
    interpreted as a lack of opposition against the plan or a
    discharge. Thus, if a vote is taken, passive creditors are
    counted as implicitly accepting the plan rather than not
    included in the quorum.

     Creditors may not be well informed about the debtor’s
    circumstances and situation. Thus their opinion can be
    based on partial information. According to general
    principles of civil procedure, the creditors as parties have a
    right to access and examine all relevant information. But
    very often creditors lack interest and they neither attend
    the hearings nor request full documentation. The court or
    other administrator gathers the needed information and
    has a duty to study it, and to hear the debtor when
    appropriate. Thus the court or administrator is in a better
    position to make decisions based on the total
    circumstances of the debtor.

      Creditors may also find themselves in a situation where
    other motives affect their ability to make a rational
    judgment about the consequences of insolvency
    proceedings for the debtor. In these circumstances,
    creditors might be heard and be given a chance to present
    their case but conflicting interests may prevent them from
    being in the best position to judge the consequences of
    the case.

215. In insolvency systems for natural persons, creditors’
rights are guaranteed in different ways. Generally, creditors
are given an opportunity to be heard in the court or
administrative procedure, and they have the right to object
to the relief requested by the debtor. They also have the
chance to offer evidence of circumstances that make the
relief unwarranted. They may request that an examination of
the debtor or of third parties be commenced. They are
sometimes also allowed to make comments on the content
of the plan and, for example, to demand higher payments
than the debtor proposes. There may be a hearing in the
court or in front of an administrator if the discharge and the
plan are opposed by the creditors but usually creditors make
their interventions in writing. In those systems in which an
administrative body or an insolvency representative has the
main responsibility for conducting the proceedings, a
dissenting creditor has the right to bring the case to the
                               73
court. After the court has confirmed a plan, a creditor may
appeal to a higher court. As mentioned above, however, such
instances of creditor participation have been exceptional, as
the economic stakes are usually simply too small to justify
the investment.

216. One particular way in which creditors’ rights are
sometimes protected despite their lack of participation is for
the law to provide a procedure for cases in which assets or
unexpected income are discovered post -discharge or post -
confirmation. Several systems include a mechanism for
allowing creditors or system administrators to request re -
opening of such cases and collecting and retroactively
distributing the new value to creditors. In several systems,
however, debtors keep such windfalls. Finality or termination
of the effects of the procedure over the debtor is a crucial
consideration that some systems regard as being even more
important than ensuring that creditors receive maximum
payment from debtors’ later discovered resources.

C)   Claims Submission and Verification
217. As mentioned above, some systems have eliminated or
simplified the submission and verification of creditor claims
in cases involving natural person debtors, especially in cases
where a system administrator establishes that no substantial
value is expected to be available for distribution to creditors.
Where filing of claims has not been abolished, the
procedures for creditors to file proofs of claim vary from
system to system. Much of the claims process is premised on
the voluntary and honest compliance by the parties, and
many countries therefore have sanctions applicable to
debtors or creditors who file incorrect or fraudulent claims.
This topic is covered in the ICR Standard, and claims
submission and verification raises few unique issues in the
context of natural person debtors.
218. At least one insolvency law developed specifically for
natural persons, however, contains a unique provision on
claims disallowance. This law singles out creditors who
extended credit to natural person debtors without taking
sufficient account of the debtor’s other existing debts,
income capacity, or general creditworthiness. Although this
provision has been applied rarely in practice, it represents an
important reflection of lawmakers’ common desire to
inculcate responsibility not only among debtors accessing
credit, but also among creditors offering it. This desired
effect was discussed above in Section I.8.C (iii) above, and
this provision is a unique manifestation of how the desire for
emphasizing creditor responsibility might be effectuated in
the claims verification process.



                              74
219. One final issue of particular importance to natural
person insolvency cases is the strict enforcement of claim
filing deadlines, especially in cases involving payment plans.
Some systems simply deny any distribution to creditors who
file claims beyond a deadline, while others retroactively
adjust the payment plan or other value distribution
mechanism to take into account late -filed claims. This has
caused significant problems in cases where debtors’
obligations are retroactively modified in a way that makes
them unable to fulfill the new demands. As a result, at least
one system specifically designed for natural persons has
been revised recently to prohibit such post -confirmation
modifications of payment plans and to deny recovery to the
affected creditors unless the debtor is regarded as somehow
culpable in having neglected to mention such debts in the
original application for relief.

II.5. Solutions to the Insolvency Process and Payment
of Claims

A)   Payment through Liquidation of the Estate
220. Historically, insolvency systems looked to the debtor’s
assets as the sole source of value to be distributed among
creditors in payment of their claims. There is one system that
uniquely relies on debtors themselves to sell their own
assets and distribute the value to creditors before seeking
relief, as a sign of the seriousness of debtors about dealing
with their debt problems and responsibly applying available
value. In virtually every other system, however, a public
administrator or trustee of some kind is appointed to
inventory, collect, and sell the debtor’s assets to produce
value for creditors. A notable trend has developed in many
insolvency and creditor/debtor regimes to abandon exclusive
reliance on public auctions for such sales and instead to give
the insolvency representative flexibility to choose to dispose
of the debtor’s assets in private sales if that solution is likely
to produce greater value for creditors.

221. Most modern systems continue to take the approach
of focusing on the debtor’s assets, at least initially (for a
discussion of payment plans, see Section II.5.B below), but
usually this is little more than a formality. As a matter of fact,
the overwhelming majority of debtors in every existing
system of insolvency for natural persons have proven to have
few if any assets of any value that are available for
liquidation and distribution to creditors. Consequently,
several systems have all but abandoned the step of
attempting to liquidate the debtor’s available assets unless
the debtor appears to have substantial assets to warrant the
significant administrative expenses of the inventory and
liquidation process.

                               75
222. One reason for the paucity of debtor assets available
to creditors is that most societies have decided that debtors
cannot be left with no assets whatsoever with which to
support themselves and their families. Any discussion of
liquidation of debtors’ assets must therefore focus on which
assets are not available as a matter of law, as very few other
assets of any value are likely to be available as a matter of
fact.

      (i) Property Exemptions
223. The notion of exempting some of the debtor’s property
from liquidation and distribution to creditors is closely tied
to the discharge principle. It is also related to the exemption
policy in many countries’ non -insolvency law that safeguards
certain assets from post -judgment (and in some countries,
pre -judgment) execution and garnishment. The idea is that
when debtors receive a discharge, exit from insolvency, and
obtain a fresh start, they should first be provided with
sufficient property to meet post -insolvency minimum
domestic needs for themselves and their families and, where
necessary, minimum business needs. The discussion below
distinguishes between exemptions relating to property
existing at the time the insolvency case is commenced and
property that comes into existence post -commencement.

224. In some systems, property exemptions function as an
imperfect alternative to an insolvency relief regime. In these
systems, exemptions have historically played the role of
alleviating the condition of the insolvent debtor, especially in
the absence of a discharge. However, the effects of
exemptions are insufficient to provide debtors with a real
opportunity for starting anew. While insolvency relief
conclusively limits creditors’ rights and offers debtors a
“fresh start” and new incentives for future productivity,
exemptions generally do not limit creditors’ rights over time.
That is, while debtors derive some protection from
exemptions, their incentives for productivity remain
depressed because any future excess property or earnings
beyond the exemption limits remain available to creditors,
often indefinitely. An exemptions regime is thus insufficient
to achieve most of the benefits of an insolvency system,
discussed in Section I.8 above.

225. Many systems have mechanisms for dealing with the
abuse of exemption policies by debtors. For example, in
some systems, if debtors try to hide assets, the law may
react by not allowing those assets to be exempted.
Avoidance actions play an important role in deterring

226. Historically, most systems set exempt property at very
low levels. In some countries, the fact that exemption
provisions set a low monetary limit to the total value of
goods that the debtor may retain, inclusive of tools of the
trade and necessary apparel and bedding for the debtor and
dependents, reflects a harsh approach that relates to a
cultural environment in which creditors were skeptical about
the good faith of insolvent debtors, which allowed debtors to
keep just the bare minimum. A problem that arises with an
outdated provision for exemptions is that they become
unworkable and are thus ignored in practice.

227. There is a growing trend to liberalize property
exemptions. When countries modernize their property
exemptions they generally increase the levels and scope of
exempt property. This also saves on expenses because
valuation in many countries has become increasingly
burdensome.

228. There are primarily three different approaches for
deciding which property may be exempted. The first
approach is to set aside a range of assets with a value up to a
specified limit that the debtor may seek to get exempted
from the insolvency estate. Historically, this was a popular
approach. A second approach currently adopted by many
systems modernized the first approach and set out
categories of particular assets (and values) for these assets
that the debtor may seek to get exempted. The burden is on
the debtor to seek to get those assets exempted from the
estate. A third approach that has also been adopted in many
systems is to adopt a more general standards -based
approach that exempts most property from the insolvency
estate and places the burden on the system administrator to
object to the exemption of valuable domestic or household
assets so that such assets may be brought back into the
estate.

229. It can be seen from the operation of these three
different approaches that the adoption of one approach over
the other has significant ramifications for insolvency
procedures and processes, for example, in its effects on the
behavior of debtors or in relation to the amount of time and
expense that administrators must dedicate to policing the
debtors' assets. It is important to keep in mind that, as a
general principle, exemptions do not interfere with security
interests granted over assets that otherwise would be
exempt. Thus, if debtors are experiencing problems with
mortgages over their homes, a home exemption will not
prove of assistance.

       a) Exemption of a Narrow Range of Assets by a
       Debtor up to a Total Value

                             77
230. Under the first approach, all debtors’ assets existing at
the time of the petition (or order) for insolvency relief
automatically become part of the insolvency estate, and
debtors are then given the opportunity to exempt a narrow
range of assets for themselves and their families. Historically,
assets available for exemption under this approach were
often quite limited and only included the tools of the
debtor’s trade, necessary apparel and bedding for debtors
and their families up to very low levels. This approach to
exemption dated from an era in which insolvency law was
more penal in nature. Under such a level of exemptions,
debtors and their families would live at close -to-poverty
levels.

231. The limitations on both the amount and the scope of
the exempt assets in these old laws are far from reasonable
by modern standards, as they left many debtors in a
depressed state, sacrificing their future contributions to
society. Over the years, in many countries adopting this
approach, if the levels and the scope of the exemptions were
not increased, the limits were often ignored in practice.

        b) Exemption of Particular Assets by the Debtor
232. The second approach is a modern adaptation of the
first approach, whereby all of the debtor’s assets existing at
the time of the petition (or order) for insolvency relief are
technically available for distribution to creditors, and the
debtor is then given the opportunity to exempt particular
assets in particular categories and up to a certain amount.

233. This approach grew out of the mechanism used in
many systems for providing protection for debtors from the
execution (usually post -judgment) against their assets. In
such systems, the exemptions that are provided to a debtor
depend on a variety of factors, such as where a debtor lives,
what the debtor’s profession is, and whether the debtor has
a family. Thus, the exemptions and the values of exempt
property might be different in farming and urban areas; or
they might be different for individual debtors and for debtors
with families. In the systems that follow this approach, the
law sets out a broad range of categories of assets that the
debtor may seek to exempt including family homes,
automobiles, household goods and furnishings, and tools of
the trade.

234. The procedure will set out exemption limits for broad
categories of assets, including the debtor’s home, the
debtor’s motor vehicle (or mode of transport), general
household goods held primarily for the personal, family, or
household use of the debtor or the debtor’s family,
professional books or tools of the trade of the debtor,
unmatured life insurance policies, and health aids.

                              78
235. In some systems, if the debtor is unable to use up the
exemption limits in some categories of assets (e.g., the
family home) the debtor may instead apply the unused
amount (perhaps up to a limit) to other assets. Some systems
even allow the debtor to sell off some assets to buy exempt
assets. Taking this to the limit, in those places where the
exemption law places the family home entirely outside the
reach of creditors, there are incentives for debtors to buy as
expensive a house as they can afford. This behavior would
not be considered fraudulent in such systems because the
debtor is merely taking advantage of an available exemption
in the law. To prevent these types of machinations some
systems have established a limit on the value of a home that
may be exempted for those debtors who have purchased the
home within a certain period (perhaps as long as 3 or 4
years) preceding the insolvency case.
236. In situations where the value of an asset is only
partially exempt, leaving some equity value available for
creditors, if the insolvency representative sells off an asset in
which the debtor has an exemption, the insolvency
representative must pay the debtor up to the amount of the
exemption (within the limit) that the debtor has in the asset.
To avoid a variety of direct and indirect losses associated
with forced sales, some systems instead permit the debtor to
pay the insolvency representative the amount above the
exemption if the debtor wishes to keep the asset.

237. The use of an exemption mechanism that allows the
debtor to claim exempt property from certain categories and
up to certain values has the advantage of general fairness.
This approach may be of interest in countries in which many
insolvent individuals are middle -class with many assets.
However, this fairness comes at the expense of efficiency
because there can be disagreement between the debtor and
the insolvency representative (or the debtor’s creditors)
when the debtor tries to maximize benefits under the
broader categories. Another weakness of this approach is
that the limits on the value of exempt assets that may be
excluded from the insolvency estate are often too low, or
become too low over time if their values set forth in the
legislation are not increased to keep in line with inflation.
When that happens, the practice in some systems is to stop
strictly enforcing the exemptions and to allow debtors to
retain more than their statutory entitlement. In some
countries that have experienced hyperinflation, the system
includes artificial or notional measures of value—i.e., a unit
of value whose value is regularly updated by the
Government—in order to avoid the problem.




                              79
        c) Standards-based Approach in which the
        Insolvency Representative seeks to Reclaim
        Items of Excessive Value
238. The third approach, a standards -based approach,
approximates the issue from the opposite perspective of the
first two approaches. Under this approach, all of the debtor’s
assets existing at the time of the insolvency petition (or
order) are exempt, and the burden switches to the
insolvency representative or the government regulator to
petition to reclaim particular items of excess value that could
be of value to the creditors and the insolvency estate.

239. An underlying assumption of this approach is that most
of the personal items of debtors are of greater value to them
and their families than they are of economic value to their
creditors. In systems in which most insolvent debtors have a
limited amount of personal assets, this approach can be
much more efficient. The insolvency representative or the
government regulator only needs to intervene in those cases
in which the debtor has particular items of excess value.

      (ii)   Specific Exemptions by Asset Type

        a) Family Home Exemptions
240. Debtors’ homes are usually their most valuable asset
and, in many cases, the asset in which debtors have lost the
most equity. Homes are arguably also the most important
asset from a psychological standpoint, for they provide
shelter for the family and serve as the family meeting point.
Losing one’s home in foreclosure or insolvency can take a
significant toll on a debtor. The family home is thus arguably
one of the most important assets to be protected.

241. Although there is agreement as to the importance of
the exemption for the family home, there is a great variety of
limits that are permitted. In countries that have a more
complicated federal system, there can be great variety even
within a single country. For example, some states may have
no limit at all on the amount of a family home exemption
and may even permit debtors to sell off other assets with a
view to buying an expensive home.

242. Another approach to the family home exemption that
some systems have adopted is to provide that debtors and
their dependents are entitled to continue residing in the
family home for a specified period of time (e.g., six months)
with the ability to apply for a further extension. Under this
approach, debtors are unable to exempt the family home
from liquidation and distribution to creditors, but are able to

                             80
ensure that the commencement of an insolvency case does
not lead to the immediate eviction from the family home.

243. The family home often involves complicated matters
involving joint ownership and the related issues of whether -
and how - creditors can seek a partition of the joint assets or
a split of the assets between the insolvent and the non -
insolvent party (See Section II.5.A(v) below.)

244. In some systems, upon the granting of a discharge, the
debtor’s assets that vested in the insolvency estate will not
return to the discharged debtor. This rule caused
complications in some systems in which the insolvency
representative delayed selling the debtor’s home – in some
cases until after the debtor was discharged – in the hope of
getting a better price. There is one system in which this
practice ended when the law was amended to provide that
the interest in the family home would revert to the debtor
three years after the commencement of the insolvency case
if the insolvency representative had not realized the asset for
the benefit of creditors or commenced proceedings to do so
during that period.

       b) Automobiles/Mode of Transportation
245. A debtor’s automobile or mode of transportation is
another of the debtor’s most valuable assets. Depending on
where debtors live, if they are not able to exempt their mode
of transportation, they might be unable to get to work and
could lose their job. Therefore, the treatment of the
automobile and other modes of transportation is similar to
that of tools of the trade, with the same justification for the
introduction of an exemption.

       c) Household Furnishings
246. In most cases, the debtor’s household furnishings have
a de minimis value. Most countries adopting the individual
category approach will set out both an overall amount of
exemption for all household furnishings and a limit on the
amount of exemption for any individual item.

247. In those systems that adopt the standards -based
approach, the debtor will generally be permitted to retain all
of his household furnishings. The insolvency representative
will be permitted to reclaim items of significant value for
creditors. Similarly, some countries that adopt the exemption
of particular assets by debtor approach specify that certain
items above a certain value cannot be included as
“household assets.”




                             81
       d) Exemption of Part of Salary and Pension
       Plans
248. Most systems allow the debtor to retain earnings from
services performed after the commencement of the
insolvency case. Some systems then provide for the entering
of an income payment order against the debtor or encourage
the debtor to voluntarily agree to pay over to the insolvency
estate a portion of his post -commencement earnings. (See
the discussion of payment plans in Section II.5.B below). At a
minimum, debtors are able to retain sufficient post -petition
income that is adequate to meet their and their family’s
reasonable domestic needs. Permitting the debtors to retain
sufficient income responds to humanitarian concerns, but it
also favors the creditors because it increases repayment
capacity.

249. At present, for many middle class debtors, the largest
asset is their pension/retirement assets. The effect of
insolvency law on pension rights is one of the most confusing
and difficult areas of insolvency law, as the law tries to
balance debtors’ obligations to pay off their creditors against
the debtors’ “fresh start” and right to pension assets to
assist with their retirement.

250. Some systems make a distinction between (1) a
debtor’s personal pension policies, which are contractual
agreements entered into with pension providers and (2)
occupational schemes, which are pension trusts set up by
employers. In systems that adopt this distinction, as a
general rule the personal pension contracts vest in the
insolvency representative. As for occupational schemes, the
treatment is more confusing. In some systems, a forfeiture
clause, that is, a clause pursuant to which a member’s
interest would be forfeited upon insolvency and paid to the
member (i.e., the debtor or the debtor’s spouse or
dependent) would not be effective against an insolvency
representative– subject to the language of the individual
forfeiture clause. In some systems, in regard to pre -
insolvency contributions, a distinction is made between the
validity of forfeiture clauses as to the employer’s
contributions (permitted) and the employee’s (insolvent
debtor’s) contributions (not permitted). As for post -
insolvency contributions, there is a line of authority that
provides that post -insolvency contributions form part of the
insolvency estate and thus, when they become payable to
the debtor, they should be paid to the insolvency
representative. Another approach is for the insolvency
representative to agree not to lay claim to the mandatory
contributions of both the insolvent debtor and the employer
as long as the funds remain in the general fund.



                             82
251. Other systems take a simpler approach and allow for
certain defined retirement schemes to be exempt either in
full, or up to high limitations that exceed even very
substantial sums.

252. Overall, the situation in many systems is confusing and
would require some type of legislative intervention to clarify
whether the debtors’ pension or retirement assets should be
made available for distribution to creditors –and if so, up to
what amount -, or should be immune to creditor attack and
preserved for the debtors’ eventual retirement.

        e) Exemption     of    Professional     Books,
        Implements, Equipment, or Tools of the Trade
253. Most systems exempt at least a defined amount of
professional books, equipment or tools of the trade.
Limitations might be in place in systems adopting the
exemption of particular assets by debtor approach. Systems
adopting the standards -based approach in which the
insolvency representative seeks to reclaim items of excessive
value would normally be more generous. With the increasing
focus on the rehabilitation of debtors, it is logical that higher,
rather than lower limitations for these assets would be
included in the system.

254. In some systems, the exemption of an automobile is
tied to arguments based on tool -of-trade exemptions. In
some economic activities, a vehicle is an essential asset for
the business. In many geographical areas, the use of an
automobile or other mode of transportation may be
necessary to conduct most kinds of businesses or to
commute to work. Therefore, exempting automobiles makes
it easier for debtors to engage in productive economic
activities and to repay their creditors. See Section II. 5. A. ii b
above.

      (iii)   The Consequences of the Exemption
              Regime
255. As can be seen from the immediately preceding
discussion, there are significant consequences flowing from
the choice of an exemption regime. Historically, the level of
exempt assets for debtors left them slightly above the
poverty line. The modern trend is to enable debtors to have
a true “fresh start” and the debate revolves around defining
the level of sufficiency. The issue of retirement assets is one
of the most important, given the large amounts that many
debtors have in their retirement accounts.
256. There are also significant differences in the efficiency
and costs of administration. The approach based on the
                               83
exemption of particular assets by the debtor can be more
costly to administer than the standards -based approach in
which the insolvency representative seeks to reclaim items of
excessive value. However, the differences might be narrower
in systems in which many debtors are in the middle -class and
have numerous assets of excessive value.

257. A factor to be taken into account in the design of an
exemption regime is that the administrative costs incurred in
liquidating low -value assets rarely represent an efficient use
of resources. There are many assets that are highly valued by
their owners, but whose value is insignificant to other
parties. Exempting those assets represents a negligible loss
to creditors, but a significant benefit for debtors.

      (iv)   After-acquired Property
258. Most systems generally make a distinction between
assets that a debtor has as of the commencement of an
insolvency case -which are available for distribution to
creditors - and assets that the debtor obtains post -petition or
post -insolvency order, as the case may be -which usually
remain with the debtor -. However, insolvency regimes want
to prevent debtors from strategically timing the filing of
insolvency petitions so as to allow them to escape from
paying creditors the entirety of their claims, and at the same
time benefiting from post -petition or post -insolvency order
windfalls, such as inheritances. Thus, insolvency laws in
many countries provide that certain interests that the debtor
acquires post-petition or post -insolvency -order within a
certain time period (for example 180 days after the initiation
of the procedure) will become property available for
distribution to creditors. These interests might include
property acquired by bequest, devise or inheritance;
property obtained as a result of a settlement agreement with
the debtor’s spouse, or of an interlocutory or final divorce
decree; property acquired as a beneficiary of a life insurance
policy or of a death benefit plan, or from winning the lottery.
In the absence of rules providing for these occurrences,
debtors could strategically file and keep the post -petition
windfalls for themselves.

      (v)    Family Property and Division of Assets
259. As noted above, joint ownership brings about
complicated legal issues for individual debtors, and such
problems frequently arise in regard to assessing the interests
of debtors and their spouses. The resolution of such issues
will often depend on the ability to split such interests under
the relevant non -insolvency law.



                              84
260. In some systems, there is a presumption that, in the
absence of evidence to the contrary, upon the issuance of an
order for insolvency relief, the half of the property owned by
the debtor as a joint tenant shall be held by the insolvent
debtor and vest in the insolvency estate -as long as the
property is not exempt -. Of course, whether the insolvency
representative will be able to sell the debtor’s interest in
such property (especially where the property is being used
by the debtor and his/her spouse) is a separate issue. In
other systems, courts are less sympathetic to a creditor’s
request to sell a family home when the co -owner (the
spouse) objects, the creditor is unlikely to get a large
financial benefit, and there will be significant dislocation and
psychological and emotional injuries to the spouse and the
dependents.

261. Complicated issues in regard to the family home can
also arise with respect to the contributions by the non -
insolvent spouse that were used to purchase the home or to
pay the mortgage. Thus, sales of joint tenancy or other co -
owned property are easier when the property is not the
family home, when the co-owners are not husband and wife,
or when there is a large financial benefit to the creditors.

B)   Payment through a Payment Plan
262. Because most natural person debtors have little value
in available assets, existing insolvency regimes most
commonly require some contribution from debtors’ future
income in exchange for whatever benefit the system offers –
usually, a discharge of unpaid debt. Whatever the form and
extent of the relief offered, most systems envision an
“earned start” for natural persons, rather than a simple
“fresh start” with no contribution or exertion expected of
debtors. Some of the most difficult questions in natural
person insolvency policy arise in the context of formulating a
payment plan, especially the twin issues of how long debtors
should be required to toil for the benefit of their creditors,
and how much debtors should be required to pay during that
period; that is, how much they can retain, with all the
“excess” being applied to paying off debt. Once the plan is
established, an effective insolvency regime will contain rules
for monitoring the debtor’s compliance and providing for the
possibility of modifications to the plan for changed
circumstances. These issues are discussed in the following
subsections.

     (i) Plan Duration

263. Constructing a payment plan regime begins with a
seemingly simple but devilishly divisive and challenging
question: How long should debtors be expected to devote

                              85
their surplus income to paying down their debts?
Policymakers have long struggled to formulate a reasoned
basis for choosing any particular time period, and no single
choice has attracted a consistent following among existing
systems. The answer to this question partly depends on the
desired goals of imposing a payment plan on debtors in
exchange for a promise of insolvency relief.

264. If the goal is simply to maximize payment to creditors,
one might think that a longer term would be appropriate,
but this immediately raises the most salient countervailing
consideration here. Recall that several of the primary goals
of insolvency regimes for natural persons generally relate to
removing disincentives to being productive. A lifetime of
liability can be a debilitating disincentive to productivity, but
even a limited repayment term can squelch the debtor’s
motivation and delay the debtor’s rehabilitation and the
attainment of the many other goals of the insolvency regime
discussed earlier. The point of rapidly diminishing returns can
be reached quite quickly when deciding on the proper
repayment term. Moreover, experience in every major
insolvency regime in existence has revealed that few debtors
will have the wherewithal to produce anything substantial
for creditors beyond covering the debtor’s basic needs and
the administrative costs of the insolvency system, no matter
how long or short the repayment period might be. Increasing
the repayment period is thus likely to actually depress
creditor returns and to reduce the numbers of debtors who
can be helped by the system, sharply limiting its positive
effects.

265. A more generally attainable goal is simply to inculcate
payment responsibility and avoid moral hazard among
debtors. Accepting that most debtors are unlikely to be able
to produce a significant return to creditors, many existing
systems seem to pursue primarily this sort of educational
goal. Habituating debtors to regular budgeting, paying bills,
and submitting tax returns has been regarded by some
policymakers as a benefit in its own right. This approach is
far more complicated than trying to maximize returns to
creditors. Returns to creditors can be easily quantified and
measured, whereas making debtors more financially
responsible represents a hidden battle with minds and
attitudes. Whether or not an insolvency system can have a
meaningful impact on debtor attitudes and behaviors is a
question that eludes a satisfactory analysis. Nonetheless, the
available evidence suggests that it is all but certain that a
longer repayment term will have a quite powerful
suppressing influence on the number of debtors who seek
and receive the relief and thus achieve the goals of such a
system. Experience in many existing systems has shown that,
once debtors discover the demands and rigors of an
extended, multi -year payment plan, some will abandon the
process for fear that they will be unable to withstand the
                              86
sacrifices, and many will be forced out by their actual failure
to do so.

266. Whatever term is ultimately chosen for the duration of
payment plans, there are at least two techniques for making
that choice, and one is rather clearly less effective than the
other: first, the decision might be left to the case-by-case
discretion of a decision maker, such as a judge, or second,
the solution might be pre -defined in the law and applied to
all cases in like manner. In either event, as discussed in
Section II.4 B above, creditors are seldom invited to
participate in this decision making process.

267. The former, more flexible approach has most often led
to one of two undesirable and self -defeating results. First,
early systems that took that flexible approach soon
discovered that the decision -makers too often imposed
overly extended repayment terms (e.g., more than ten
years), all but assuring that debtors would fail to complete
their plans. Few of the goals of an insolvency system can be
achieved if the requirements for relief are practically
unattainable. At the very least, if a flexible approach is to be
taken successfully, the decision -makers must be properly
educated on the variety of practical and behavioral
impediments to debtors’ compliance with payment plans
that extend beyond a few years.

268. The second and quite common result of the flexible
approach has been a spontaneous and systemic
standardization of the repayment term. This has been true
especially in systems that have offered ranges of time as a
“guideline” for the ultimate determination. More often than
not, the actors in these systems have perceived too few
benefits from adopting various approaches to various cases,
and they have simply applied one single, more or less
uniform approach to the repayment term in the
overwhelming majority of cases. Two opposite examples
illustrate this point. In one country, though the law allows for
plans of between three and five years, in practice the term
was quickly standardized such that the overwhelming
majority of plans are set at the five -year term. In contrast,
the law in another country as originally promulgated granted
the judge discretion to design plans extending over three to
five years, but there, the lower end of the scale became the
norm, as very few plans in that country have exceeded the
standard three -year term. This rejection of flexibility and
gravitation toward a standard can be observed even more
prominently in the determination of the amount of payment
demanded, as discussed below, but the same phenomenon
has affected the plan repayment term, as well.
269. If a single standard term is to be chosen for all plans,
what might be the optimal length of time? Unfortunately,
very little uniformity can be observed in existing systems.
                              87
The most common repayment terms tend to fall between
three and five years, with a notable congregation of laws
with a standard five -year term. The rationales for these
decisions, however, are seldom clear or particularly
convincing. The choice of five years in one country, for
example, was based on a scattered sampling of comparable
practices, including existing norms for forgiveness of social
assistance repayment debts and general offer -in-compromise
practice by tax authorities, as well as the evolving norms in
other countries’ laws. The most empirically meaningful basis
for selecting one term over another appears in the legislative
history of another insolvency law, in which policymakers
concluded that accumulated experience with voluntary
workout arrangements indicated that expecting debtors to
live longer than three years at a subsistence level would be
“from a social point of view, not responsible.” Indeed, the
experience in many countries indicates that plans that are
longer than three years produce more failure than success.

270. This is obviously a value judgment in one sense, but
lawmakers have also borne in mind the need to strike a
balance between setting high goals and setting attainable
goals. Practice in many countries has indicated that plans
longer than three years produce more failure than success. In
one system, for example, a consistent two -thirds of all
payment plans fail before they reach the end of their five -
year term. Unfortunately, very little empirical evidence exists
on plan performance in most countries, so strong
conclusions on the results of longer plan periods are not well
supported by data. Existing evidence and widespread
anecdotal reporting, however, consistently indicate an
inverse relationship between plan length and plan success.
Particularly in developing countries with economies marked
by high levels of volatility and uncertainty (especially
rampant inflation), rapidly changing economic conditions can
make successful planning for even a short period all but
impossible.
271. The negative effects of longer plan terms might be
mitigated, as illustrated by the unique experience in two
recently reformed systems. In these systems, the law
contains an ingenious tactic for encouraging debtors to
struggle through by offering debtors standard, graduated
“motivation rebates” of 10 or 15 percent of their annual
assigned income as a reward and incentive for making it
through the later years of the extended payment plan
period. In addition, to avoid the unintended problem of
extending the payment period beyond the already longer
than average standard term, its starting point was explicitly
tied to the beginning of the sometimes protracted insolvency
administration process, not its conclusion.
272. More recently, policymakers in two systems have made
or proposed a more thorough -going reform by reducing the
                             88
payment term to three years. The latest proposal from one
of these systems, however, imposes a quid-pro-quo
requirement that excludes all but a small portion of debtors.
It offers the shorter term only to debtors whose surplus
income covers at least one -quarter of their debts. Given the
often observed fact that the overwhelming majority of
debtors in this system have insufficient income to make any
distribution to creditors, the proposed reduction of the term
for debtors who can pay a substantial portion of their debts
in three years is most likely an illusory reform.

273. Nonetheless, there is something to be said in favor of
the idea of adopting a sliding -scale approach that imposes a
longer repayment term for debtors unable to make
significant contributions, but release debtors early as a
reward for making more substantial payments, thus creating
incentives for debtors. On the other hand, imposing longer
repayment terms on chronically destitute debtors seems
rather counterproductive. This approach offers few benefits
to creditors; it only enhances the pain and sacrifice suffered
by debtors; and it delays the societal benefits of an
insolvency relief system without an obvious countervailing
benefit. This point will be taken up again below.

    (ii) Payments to Creditors: Reasonable Expenses
    and “Surplus” Income
274. The common goal of imposing a payment plan on
debtors is to encourage and extract the debtors’ reasonable
efforts at servicing their debts during a defined—and
limited—repayment term. How much payment to expect or
demand of debtors is a core issue that, like the
determination of the repayment term, has divided
policymakers along several different axes. Most agree,
however, that the proper resolution of this issue is less a
matter of defining a predetermined benefit for creditors than
of defining a predetermined level of sacrifice for debtors.
Whether from a moral or simply pragmatic standpoint, the
determination of the potential payment to creditors should
begin with the computation of an amount to be reserved for
the reasonable support of the debtor and those dependent
on the debtor. Only income in excess of this, and probably all
income in excess of this threshold, represents “surplus” that
might be assigned to creditors. There is mild disagreement
even on this basic starting point, and beyond this, existing
systems are divided on the details of evaluating both income
and reasonable support expenses.

       a) Actual or Projected Income, Exclusions and
       Enhancements


                             89
275. Because payment plans regulate future activity, an
immediate complication arises with respect to determining
the most basic term: How much income does the debtor
have, from which reasonable expenses can be deducted to
produce an offer of payment? There are two broad
approaches to this foundational question.

276. One approach makes no projection and instead bases
future payments on the debtor’s actual income in any given
period. In the most prominent example of this simple and
elegant approach, debtors formally (i.e., contractually) assign
whatever portion of their future income that exceeds the
standard exemption, and these assignments are collected by
an insolvency representative for distribution among creditors
once per year. When the plan is confirmed, no one can
predict exactly how much creditors will receive, but they are
assured maximum payment based on the debtor’s income
and the simple statutory exemption (discussed below, see
Section II.5.B(i)).

277. The other approach defines a specific payment for
each creditor by projecting an income for the debtor over
the repayment term. Although this is the most common
approach, it has obvious weaknesses. Any projection of
something as volatile as individual income over a period
stretching three or five or more years into the future is
bound to be inaccurate. The inaccuracy might be small, but it
might be quite large. The projection might under - or over -
estimate the debtor’s income, and either case presents
problems. An underestimation leaves value with the debtor
that might more appropriately have been distributed to
creditors, while an overestimation may well leave the debtor
unable to make the necessary payments from a smaller than
expected income.

278. Despite the complications of using an income
projection, there are compelling reasons to accept these
limitations and take this approach. The reason has little to do
with offering creditors greater certainty. Even if creditors are
involved in the process of accepting or rejecting a plan
(which is rare, as discussed above), they should prefer a
solution that offers them the maximum possible return in
light of the debtor’s actual abilities and income, not a
projected return that might or might not square with the
debtor’s actual means. On the other hand, the primary
complication with an “actual receipts” approach is a
potentially significant monitoring burden. Someone has to
calculate the fluctuating amount to be ceded to creditors
each month (or other payment period). In systems where
debtors are allocated a uniform allowance, this calculation is
simple and might be done by employers, much like in the
ordinary wage garnishment system. If employers cannot be
relied on to perform this function—especially if the debtor is
self-employed—or if concerns such as privacy or avoiding
                              90
stigma prevent them from doing so, or if debtors’ expense
allowances are not based on a simple and straightforward
calculation, the periodic turnover of actual surplus income
involves a significant monitoring and administrative burden.
Thus, the optimal method for determining the debtor’s
income is closely tied to the chosen method for determining
reasonable expenses. In many cases, the compromise from
both creditors and the system in general is to accept greater
uncertainty in exchange for avoiding a substantial
administrative cost. But given the movement toward greater
standardization of expense allowances, discussed below, it is
not entirely clear that this compromise is justified.

279. Even if projecting income is unavoidable, experience
suggests that one specific approach to such projections
should be avoided. In one country, a particularly problematic
approach to anticipating future income has drawn
widespread criticism and produced a litany of unintended
negative results. One aspect of this recently reformed system
imposes payment plans on debtors if their current monthly
income is sufficient to cover their allotted expenses and offer
a minimum return to creditors. Projecting the debtor’s future
income based on current income is problematic by itself, but
“current monthly income” is not “current.” Instead, that term
is defined to mean the average of the debtor’s monthly
income over the preceding six months. Naturally, most
debtors seeking insolvency relief have experienced an
income disruption (e.g. , unemployment, divorce, medical
problem) that has depressed their income during the
preceding six months. In addition, experience with this
approach has revealed a substantial number of debtors who
happen to have received an extraordinary income boost
during that six -month period (a bonus, tax refund, sale of a
large asset, gift, etc.). In either event, a future projection
based on this exceptional six months of past income is very
likely to produce substantial inaccuracy. A variety of actors
have called for efforts to anticipate what the debtor’s actual
future income will likely be, and in some cases, this approach
was ultimately mandated by the courts. Although past
experience can be useful in making projections of future
income, the rigid approach described here has been roundly
criticized.

280. In systems that make transfer payments to debtors
through social assistance or social support systems,
consideration should be given to whether these payments
should be excluded from the debtor’s available income. On
the one hand, if the expense allowances in insolvency are
coordinated with or even keyed to the social assistance
standards, this might not be an issue at all. Any income that
debtors receive from state transfer payments might be
excluded by virtue of the fact that these debtors’ incomes
are by definition below the level at which any “surplus”
might be available to creditors. In many such systems,
                             91
however, transfer payments are made to debtors without
regard to incomes that exceed the “poverty” or “social
minimum” level. For example, many countries provide child
allowances to families with children largely without regard to
family income, and the same is true of social insurance
pension payments. In such cases, these transfer payments
might subsidize payments to creditors rather than flow to
their intended beneficiaries. If non -transferable income is
displaced into the creditors’ pockets because this “surplus”
income is no longer necessary to cover basic expenses in
light of the extra transfer payment, this might be less
objectionable. But if low -income debtors wholly reliant on
transfer payments receive child allowance or pension
benefits that are diverted to creditors, the inevitable
diversion of state funds to creditors might be regarded as
problematic. The most recent revision of one individual
insolvency law placed child allowance transfer payments
outside the scope of “income,” while a neighboring country
with a very similar system continues to consider these and
other transfer payments as available income. In another
system, transfer payments related to the “social security”
system are excluded from consideration as “income.”

281. Finally, since one of the main goals of an insolvency
system is to encourage natural person debtors to be
productive and avoid going “on strike,” consideration should
be given to how the system might enhance the former effect
and sanction the latter. The most prominent, fundamental,
and effective way of encouraging debtors to be as productive
as possible is simply to offer the relief of a discharge of
unpaid debts. Most systems simply hope that this incentive
will encourage maximum productivity by debtors. Rarely
have existing systems done anything specific to address the
possible moral hazard of debtors continuing to be
unproductive until they have obtained relief.

282. A few countries have prominently incorporated both
incentives and penalties into their approach. As discussed
above, two systems offer debtors an incentive to be
maximally productive by refunding 10 or 15 percent of their
incomes assigned during the later years of a payment plan.
As small as this reward is, it at least represents an effort to
enhance the incentive already inherent in the insolvency
system in general. On the other side, several systems require
debtors to earn their discharge by at least seeking, if not
engaging, in productive work. Debtors who fail to apply at
least reasonable efforts to do so can be denied the relief
otherwise offered by the system. While rejections of
discharge for insufficient effort have been vanishingly rare,
the mere statutory requirements add pressure on debtors to
exert themselves reasonably in exchange for the
extraordinary relief the insolvency system offers. Another
system with a presumption of a four -year period leading up
to discharge for debtors who are declared insolvent for the
                             92
first time, offers an early discharge for debtors who
cooperate and a delay in discharge for up to four additional
years for those who do not.

       b) Expenses: Flexibility and Standardization
283. As mentioned above, the heart of any payment plan
regime is the particularly sensitive issue of what resources to
reserve for the support of debtors and their dependents.
Given the depressed income -earning capacity and elevated
cost of living faced by most insolvent debtors, the ultimate
return to creditors will be determined predominantly as a
function of how much of debtors’ income is placed beyond
creditors’ reach. This crucial issue has challenged
policymakers for centuries, and the evolving modern
insolvency systems for natural persons have struggled
mightily with the proper balance between providing
adequate support for debtors and producing a desired
benefit for creditors. Moreover, these systems have
increasingly perceived a problem with unequal treatment of
similarly situated debtors facing decision -makers in different
areas. This poses serious problems for modern societies who
prize equal access to justice and predictably equal treatment
of citizens.

284. Perhaps the most significant challenge in defining a
proper reserve budget for debtors is deciding how best to
achieve fair and equal treatment. Should equality be pursued
through a flexible approach that seeks to meet each debtor’s
specific, unique basic needs, or should this determination be
made in like fashion for all according to some objective,
neutral guideline as to basic needs, with only minor
variations for specific circumstances? Many existing systems
have begun from the former position, assigning the
responsibility to judges or other decision -makers to use their
discretion to establish debtor budgets in a manner that
ensures “human dignity” or some similar vague principle.
Some of these systems have attempted to steer that
discretion toward austerity, suggesting that decision -makers
should use their discretion to establish “modest” budgets,
though most have hewed closer to a middle line, using
subjective guidelines like “ordinary and necessary expenses”
or “reasonable needs.”

285. One lesson that seems to have emerged most clearly
from the last three decades of experience is that a flexible,
discretionary approach, while theoretically attractive, is
quite problematic in practice. When legislatures have
delegated to judges broad or narrow authority to define
appropriate debtor budgetary guidelines, at least four
serious problems have emerged. Lawmakers in many of the
existing insolvency systems for natural persons have


                             93
reformed their laws in the past several years in large part to
address these four problems.

286. First, a rather isolated problem arose in one system
where, for a variety of historical reasons, the insolvency
courts have tended to regard their primary duty to
rehabilitate debtors and thus to favor debtor interests to a
substantial degree. Consequently, when faced with the task
of defining the “amounts reasonably necessary” to support
the debtor and the dependents of the debtor, the insolvency
courts took what many regarded as an extremely debtor -
friendly position, interpreting “reasonable necessity”
liberally to encompass a wider variety of expenses than
many lawmakers and policy commentators regarded as
appropriate. The legislature ultimately responded to this
perceived imbalance in a particularly unconstructive way, as
discussed further below, but an exercise of discretion overly
favorable to debtors was a consequence, one might say a
potential danger, of a discretionary approach to debtor
budgeting.

287. Second, the opposite problem undermines the success
of an insolvency system even more, as lawmakers in another
country discovered. In the early years of this country’s new
system for treating “individual over -indebtedness,” the
commissions in charge of this system exercised their
discretion to establish debtor budgets in a strikingly over -
conservative manner. Proposed payment plans there often
allocated less income to debtors than would be available to
destitute recipients of social assistance. The commissions’
methods for determining debtor budgets ignored the
modern realities of basic human needs for such things as
utilities, insurance, and other basic non -food expenses.
Analysts predicted that as many as three -quarters of these
plans were destined for failure in light of these “scandalously
low” budgets. To prevent this disastrously counterproductive
exercise of discretion from undermining the entire system,
both the administration and ultimately the legislature had to
intervene to establish clearer budgetary guidelines, as
discussed below.

288. A third problem with relegating debtor budgets to the
discretion of system administrators relates to the inevitable
variation in how decision makers in various regions will
exercise this discretion. While some variation is to be
expected in light of natural differences among debtors and
even judges, insolvency regimes have too often produced
extreme differences even within the same regions, raising
serious concerns of fairness and equality of treatment. A
prominent study of payment plans in one system in the early
1990s revealed that different courts in the same
jurisdictional division were imposing strikingly different
demands for payment. Some courts in one district demanded
that debtors abide by budgets that would produce nearly full
                             94
payment to creditors, while other courts had more realistic
expectations of often quite modest payment. Another new
insolvency system for natural persons underwent its first
reform primarily to address the problem of extreme variation
in payment plan budgeting practices. The original law in this
system had vested the courts with discretion to establish
budgets to support “modest” lifestyles for debtors. Even in
this relatively small and homogenous country, different
courts in different regions arrived at strikingly different
conclusions as to the makeup of a “modest” budget. These
extreme variations prompted some debt counselors to
suggest that their clients move from districts with especially
strict judges to nearby areas where insolvency relief was
available on more livable terms. This problem has plagued
many systems whose perceived flexibility and discretion
were deemed as strengths, and the legislatures of many of
those countries have since stepped in to constrain that
discretion.

289. Finally, in some instances, discretion has been set
aside not by external regulators, but by the system actors
themselves. In at least two particularly notable instances,
judges and administrators who have had to deal with these
cases have concluded that flexibility and discretion are not
virtues given the relatively standardized nature of the
financial problems to be addressed. Debtors’ reasonable
needs do not deviate far enough from a set of standards to
warrant a largely unbridled flexible approach. Moreover, the
time spent carefully tailoring an appropriate budget for each
case will most likely turn out to be a poor investment, as this
expenditure of resources will consistently far outweigh the
depressed maximum returns that might be extracted from
debtors for creditors in these cases. In two particularly
noteworthy examples, the law initially provided a base
budgetary guideline (discussed below) designed simply to
“guide” the decision -maker in the formulation of appropriate
payment plans. In both systems, however, administrators
rejected the discretion inherent in the suggested “guideline”
and chose instead to develop a largely uniform approach
across all cases. The legislatures in these two countries
eventually confirmed this practice by amending the laws to
abandon the wholly discretionary approach.

290. The appropriate measure of sacrifice to be demanded
of debtors in exchange for whatever relief an insolvency
system offers is a crucial and inherently political decision.
Such a central issue of public policy is likely better made by a
legislature or other representative entity, rather than by the
administrators of the insolvency system. While the relevant
judicial and executive actors indeed do have close contact
with debtors and creditors, and thus have insight into the
specific needs of the people most closely affected by the
system, they are simply not in the best position to make the
sensitive social policy decisions that drive an insolvency
                              95
regime. As discussed below, discretion need not be totally
eliminated, but experience suggests that it is probably better
that politically responsible entities at least make a uniform
choice as to an agreed baseline from which mild discretion
might then depart.

291. Selecting an optimal approach to payment plan
budgeting is not a simple binary choice between wide open
discretion and rigid, bright -line rules. Even if a standard
budgeting rule or rubric is adopted, some discretionary
element is likely desirable if not unavoidable. An example
from one system illustrates a moderate compromise in this
regard in two ways. First, as in many other systems, the base
budgetary exemption is designed to cover all of a debtor’s
expenses other than housing costs, which are separately
allowed so long as they are “reasonable” according to
guidelines developed by the Tax Service. In addition,
however, the “standard” can be supplemented by non -
standard allowances for debtors’ actual expenses for
transportation to and from work, childcare expenses, as well
as support and sometimes even extra medical expenses. A
similar “lodestar” approach of allowing discretionary, case -
by-case additions to a basic subsistence budget was taken in
several other systems. In addition, however, administrators
in those systems developed a practice of further
supplementing debtors’ basic budgets with a small monthly
“buffer” for possible unanticipated expenses. This second,
mild incursion of discretion into an otherwise standard
approach has been adopted elsewhere. While administrators
in another system were eventually required by law to
allocate at least a standard minimum budget to all debtors,
this minimum is described as “one part” of the necessary
resources for supporting the debtor’s household. This
bifurcated approach to budgeting represents a common and
probably sensible compromise between the many
undesirable effects of discretion and the constricting
imposition of one inflexible norm.
292. The easiest and most widespread approach to
selecting the basic budgetary standard has been simply to
regard the insolvency system as an extension of –and a
limitation on - the existing ordinary system of debt collection.
The same limitations on “garnishment” or seizure of wages
and other income that would have applied in ordinary
collections cases will also apply in defining available income
for an insolvency payment plan. This is the straightforward
approach taken in many current laws, though as mentioned
above, at least one system defines this minimum budgetary
reserve as only “one part” of a proper budget. Indeed, as
discussed earlier, while some laws suggested that insolvency
administrators simply consider the ordinary income
exemption law as “guidance,” that standard already allowed
sufficient discretion to accommodate the mild variations

                              96
among insolvency cases, so it was simply adopted as the
norm.

293. Co -opting an existing “minimum income” norm poses a
substantial danger, however, as illustrated by the experience
in one system in particular. When this country’s insolvency
law was implemented, the general wage exemption law had
been revised only once each decade, and the exemption
level had not been increased for inflation in many years.
Expecting debtors to live on an income that might have been
appropriate seven, eight, or even nine years earlier was
obviously inappropriate in a country where consumer buying
power was constantly eroded by rising costs, not to mention
the effect of currency fluctuations on the many imported
goods consumed by natural person debtors. Lawmakers
responded quickly and responsibly by increasing the
statutory wage exemptions substantially for most debtors
and providing for indexation every other year to keep
constant pace with inflation.

294. A choice of one objective and uniform standard does
not necessary entail a single monetary figure to be applied to
all debtors in all situations. Instead, existing systems
commonly establish bands of uniformity, with categories of
debtors with various vital characteristics, and different
exemption amounts are calculated for each of these
categories, often with a possibility of increasing these
standard amounts for specific, variable expenses. In many
countries, the “exempt” income level is not one simple
figure. Indeed, it is not even a series of simple figures to be
applied to debtors with and without spouse or children.
Instead, various figures are often established for debtors
with spouses and different numbers of children of various
ages, and these figures are often supplemented by
allowances for “reasonable” expenses for housing and child
care, as discussed above.

295. Because they apply in ordinary debt collection cases,
these wage exemptions are perhaps the most common and
appropriate standards for establishing repayment budgets in
insolvency cases. If creditors are subject to the same
restrictions on available income in both the ordinary
collections system and the insolvency system, this approach
clarifies exactly what the insolvency overlay is designed to
do: rather than taking the more radical (though often
proposed) approach of limiting all creditors to a much
shorter prescriptive period (statute of limitations) for
enforcing their claims, the insolvency system identifies a
small subgroup of debtors for whom general collection
activity will be limited to the term of the repayment plan. All
creditors will share in the administrative costs of
expropriating available income from debtors, and all will be
included in the distribution of whatever would have been
available to any creditor collecting on its claim in any event,
                             97
but all creditors will be limited to whatever the standard
collections process would have extracted from the debtor
during a limited period (as discussed above, usually five
years or less).

296. In some countries, the “minimum income” that is
insulated from seizure in ordinary collections actions is (or
has later become) coextensive with the “subsistence
minimum” income reserved for supporting debtors’ essential
expenses. In one system, for example, the standard budget
allowance for insolvency payment plans is defined by statute
as 90 percent of the minimum income assured by the social
assistance system. This ultra -depressed allowance would
likely lead to mass failure of payment plans, even in light of
the short three -year repayment term in this country’s
practice. The unique application of this statute by local
judges, however, is particularly ingenious. A national working
group of insolvency judges boldly took the initiative to
develop harmonized budgetary guidelines that would
eventually be applied to both ordinary collections actions
and insolvency payment plans. They started, as directed by
law, with the baseline of 90 percent of the national social
assistance minimum income, but in part to further
encourage debtors to find productive work, this minimum
reserve was augmented in virtually all cases with substantial
supplements for debtors working full-time, for debtors with
children, and for a variety of itemized expenses for housing,
transportation, and child care. Once again, choosing a
standard baseline need not exclude salutary exercises of
discretion to supplement the minimum budget allocation.
Indeed, such supplements may be necessary if the floor is set
too low, as in the preceding example.

297. Finally, if general enforcement restrictions or social
assistance minimum incomes are unavailable or incompatible
with social policy for insolvency cases, a basic budget
standard might be built from scratch using the sorts of
techniques that have produced these other guidelines.
National statistical, labor, consumer, or taxing authorities in
many countries have identified baskets of standard
household items consumed by various family sizes during, for
example, a month, and constructed a budget based on
surveys of the costs of these items. Often these costs
fluctuate, and subsequent surveys then track the fluctuations
and alter the budgetary guidelines, sometimes several times
each year. The range of items that might be included in these
baskets varies considerably from country to country based
on local views of “necessity” and dignified existence. In one
country, for example, a standard expense was recently added
to the basket to cover charges for the use of cellular phones,
and internet access has increasingly been regarded as a
necessity in many parts of the world. To be sure, living
standards vary significantly around the world, and simple
access to basic food staples and water may well be a more
                             98
pressing concern than internet access in many areas. The
point is simply to observe that appropriate standard budgets
can be developed on the basis of widely varying expectations
in different regions and countries. Many examples of
constructing a basic consumer budget in this way are
available to policymakers interested in developing a sensitive
and livable approach to payment plans.

       c) What to Do with Debtors with No Income,
       No Assets (NINAs)
298. For some, and likely many debtors, the result of
deducting the standard expense allowance from actual or
anticipated income may well reveal little or no surplus.
Indeed, a common and quite sensible approach to the
expenses of administering payment plans is to charge these
expenses against any surplus before distributing the
remainder to creditors. Whether or not debtor income is
further reduced by administrative costs, substantial numbers
of debtors will have no surplus income available for
distribution to creditors. These debtors may well have
sufficient resources to cover their basic needs, but they have
no extra to pass on to creditors. Significant numbers of
debtors in all insolvency systems for natural persons today
fall into this category.

299. Because these debtors produce no value for creditors,
thus failing to achieve one of the most salient goals of an
insolvency system, a minority of insolvency systems has
excluded them from relief. One system in particular has long
held firm to its “economic benefit” perspective of allowing
relief only to debtors with sufficient surplus income to cover
not only administrative costs, but also a minimum 10 percent
dividend to creditors. Another relatively new law is similarly
restrictive, demanding at least a 30 percent projected
dividend in order to confirm a payment plan. The former law
provides for hardship relief for debtors stricken by specific,
compelling, and exceptional circumstances, but many no -
income, no -asset debtors have been denied relief.

300. The preferred position among both commentators and
in established insolvency systems, however, is to avoid this
kind of discrimination and provide the same relief to all
debtors, regardless of their financial means. So-called “zero
plans” have consistently represented a significant portion of
all “payment plans” in insolvency cases for natural persons. It
is not uncommon for payment plans in one -third, two -thirds,
or even a greater proportion of all confirmed cases to be
purely symbolic, paying only the fees of the insolvency
representative, or not even those fees. In one well -
established system in particular, early resistance by courts to
confirming “zero plans” was quickly overcome, and such
plans came to represent an estimated 80 percent of all

                             99
individual insolvency cases. In another system where
resistance to “zero plans” did not subside on its own, judicial
intervention at the highest levels resolved the matter in favor
of debtors with insufficient income or assets to offer
creditors any dividend. This country’s constitutional court
ruled that extending relief only to debtors who could pay
some portion of their debt violated the equality principle in
this state’s Constitution. It is probably both more honest and
more meaningful to refer to these arrangements as “debt
adjustment” plans, rather than “payment” plans, or better
yet something like “rehabilitation” plans, to focus on their
real purpose.

301. Indeed, efforts have been made to help these
particularly distressed debtors to overcome an ironic
challenge. Given their depressed financial condition, these
debtors might well be unable to afford the administrative
costs of seeking relief, at least in systems that charge fees to
debtors for access to insolvency relief. In one relatively new
system, for example, barely 150 insolvency cases were
opened for natural persons seeking discharge during the first
three -and -a-half years after the passage of the new law,
probably because the majority of cases are dismissed if the
debtor’s income is insufficient to cover the insolvency
representative’s estimated fees. More established systems
have struggled to find solutions to problems like this one.
Volunteer lawyers in one country often agree to waive their
fees—the most substantial cost in this country’s insolvency
system—for low -income debtors, and another system allows
low-income debtors to delay paying the administrative costs
of the insolvency case until after they have completed the
six -year “good behavior period.” Authorities in another
country have recently developed a formal solution for this
particular problem. The multi -option menu of debt -relief
processes now includes a low -cost alternative for destitute
debtors. For individual debtors with limited debts, little
income, and few assets, a low -cost administrative proceeding
is available from the state authority charged with overseeing
the insolvency system. By reducing the formalities and
expenses of the court -based “insolvency” procedure, the
new administrative process was specifically designed to
make relief available to low - and no -income debtors for
whom court costs would otherwise have been a barrier to
relief.

    (iii) Plan Implementation, Monitoring and
    Supervision
302. The challenges do not end with confirmation of a plan.
Debtors who struggled to budget and distribute proper
payments to creditors before an insolvency procedure are
likely to struggle afterward, as well. To facilitate the proper

                             100
implementation of, and debtor compliance with, a plan, a
neutral insolvency representative is most commonly
appointed to monitor and even collect and distribute
payments for creditors. Generally, the insolvency
representative collects periodic payments made by debtors
on their own, though some systems require or allow for plan
payments to be formally assigned to the representative and
automatically deducted from the debtors’ periodic income to
ensure timely payment. The insolvency representative also
divides these collected amounts for distribution to individual
creditors and is responsible for actually making the payments
(often electronically). After early experiments with more
frequent payments to creditors, many systems have settled
on annual distributions, both to reduce cost and because
more frequent distribution often results in very small
payments to creditors. The processing fees for these
payments can exceed the amounts transferred to the
individual creditors unless larger payments are allowed to
accumulate over a longer period.

303. The qualifications and role of such an insolvency
representative are mentioned in Section II.2.C above, and in
greater depth in the ICR Standard and other sources. The
administration of payment plans is the most time - and
resource -intensive task that the insolvency representative
generally fulfills in those systems that provide for this
requirement. As mentioned above, the remuneration of the
insolvency representative is most often drawn from
whatever surplus income the system extracts from debtors,
and only income in excess of the fee of the insolvency
representative is then distributed to creditors. Often the
surplus is insufficient to even cover the fees of the insolvency
representative, and in only a small minority of cases do
creditors receive any significant distribution. A dual logic
supports charging the fees of the insolvency representative
against amounts otherwise destined for creditors. First, this
operates as an incentive for creditors to agree to informal
arrangements (workouts) with             debtors to        avoid
administrative transaction costs. Second, appointing an
insolvency representative to manage these payments frees
individual creditors from the time and expense of monitoring
debtor performance, both in terms of payments and in terms
of any other obligations the debtor might have under the
plan, such as actively seeking work. Insolvency
representatives are often charged with objecting to
discharge or other relief at the conclusion of a plan term if
the debtor has failed to adequately comply with the
requirements of the plan.

304. Not all existing insolvency regimes for natural persons
invoke the aid of an insolvency representative, however. In
some countries, payment plans developed in the natural
person insolvency system are regarded as ordinary contracts.
Debtors receive no guidance or supervision in making the
                             101
required payments, and creditors bear the burden of
monitoring these payments and enforcing the debtor’s duty
to perform via ordinary enforcement mechanisms. This
approach might be explained in part by the fact that such
payment plans arise only in cases involving mildly distressed
debtors who remain fully solvent. Cases involving more
distressed debtors generally result in global moratoria on
collections and possibly a full discharge, with no ongoing
payments under a rehabilitation plan. In one country,
however, even significantly distressed debtors are left on
their own in collecting and distributing payments to
creditors.

305. One system has developed an admirable middle -
ground approach of helping debtors to organize and process
their payments, but leaving it to debtors themselves to make
the appropriate deposits, thus leaving monitoring burdens
on creditors. That system engages trustees to develop
payment plans, but once the plan is confirmed, the
insolvency representative’s job is complete. To help debtors
to manage the payments by themselves, at the beginning of
the insolvency procedure the insolvency representative
opens a dedicated bank account to which debtor -applicants
immediately begin depositing their disposable income, thus
immediately starting the five -year payment plan clock and
reducing the total period during which debtors are forced to
live on depressed resources. For plans that are ultimately
approved, the insolvency representative generally forwards
to the bank a list of creditors, their account numbers, and
the percentages of the debtor’s accumulated monthly
deposits to be transferred to each creditor’s account
electronically once a year. Debtors are encouraged to make
the required deposits and payments through automatic bank
transfers, but they generally retain the free disposition of
their income and are responsible for making the monthly
deposits themselves. Despite the debtor’s freedom and the
creditors’ lack of ability to monitor monthly deposits, this
arrangement had functioned quite well in practice. However,
the cooperation of banks in supporting this system and
charging more reasonable processing fees, not to mention an
advanced technological infrastructure, were necessary.

      (iv) Modification of Payment Plans for Changes
      in Debtor’s Circumstances
306. Finally, even if debt adjustment plans are reasonable at
first, much can change over the long rehabilitation periods
called for by many existing laws. If the debtor’s financial
position unexpectedly deteriorates, the debtor will likely be
unable to make the payments called for in the plan without
undue sacrifice. Conversely, if the debtor’s financial position
improves markedly, creditors might have a legitimate interest

                             102
in sharing in that improvement, given that their future rights
against the debtor will likely be curtailed.

307. For payment plans that call for fluctuating payments
based on the debtor’s actual income and expenses, this
poses little problem. Such plans are inherently self -
modifying. The debtor’s payment requirements change
automatically as the debtor’s income rises and falls. This
approach has been taken in a handful of countries. As
mentioned above, the benefits of such self -modifying plans
come at a potentially higher monitoring price. Creditors or
the insolvency representative are responsible for tracking
changes in plan payments and assuring themselves that
these changes represent appropriate responses to changed
circumstances, rather than simple debtor failure to fulfill the
terms of the plan.
308. The more common approach is to base future plan
payments on projected income and expenses, so changes in
circumstances lead to problems that call for affirmative
solutions to avoid plan failure and possible repeat requests
for relief. In such systems, the law usually anticipates the
possibility of a debtor’s (or creditors’) application to modify
plans prospectively, to take into account the effect of
deterioration or improvement in the debtor’s actual situation
as compared to the projections embodied in the plan. One
system takes a unique approach, allowing modification only
in the debtor’s “most exceptional interest.” That is,
modifications to reduce the debtor’s payment obligations are
allowed, but creditors are not allowed to request an increase
in payments if the debtor’s situation improves. Indeed, as
recently reformed, this system allows for plan modification
to reduce the required payout to as little as zero.

309. For systems that rely on debtors to pay for lawyers or
court costs to request a modification, this may produce the
ironic problem of debtors’ being unable to request a
modification to allow them to pay less money because they
do not have enough money even to ask for such relief. Some
policymakers have considered allowing -or requiring - the
insolvency representative to request modifications on
debtors’ behalf. Otherwise, common deteriorations in
debtors’ positions may result in needlessly burdensome
repeat filings seeking relief anew, which benefit no one and
produce cost and resource burdens for debtors and the
system. Policymakers in several regions have concluded that
these burdens can and should be avoided by developing a
more rational approach to modifying plans in the event of
unexpected complications.

C)   Advantages and Disadvantages of the Different
     Approaches to Payment

                             103
310. To advance the primary historical goal of insolvency
systems—enhancing efforts to achieve some return for
creditors—most insolvency regimes for natural persons today
combine the two approaches to payment discussed here.
That is, they require both a turnover and liquidation of
debtors’ non -exempt assets owned at the time of the
procedure, in addition to a multi -year payment plan to
access the usually much more significant value in debtors’
future earning capacity. While there are obvious advantages
to combining the two approaches, proceeding through both
stages in every case arguably has significant disadvantages,
and not all systems force all debtors to proceed through both
methods of value extraction.

311. The basic disadvantage of each approach to value
extraction is waste in terms of time, money, and other
already thinly spread administrative resources. Consistently,
the overwhelming majority of debtors in existing systems
have been shown to have few if any non -exempt assets of
any significant value. The realization costs for these assets
often exceed their depressed value, to say nothing of the
simple cost of investigation if an administrator is required to
verify the debtors’ own descriptions of their assets.
Consequently, though most existing systems purport to make
the value of debtors’ assets available to creditors, this
provision is more theoretical than practical. Rather than
extracting value from available assets, the primary benefit of
the collective approach to insolvency in the context of
natural persons is avoiding wasteful and unproductive
pursuit of value. As discussed in Section I.8 above, a single
official investigation can reveal the folly of pursuing the
debtor’s low -value assets, and creditors can be convinced or
at least prevented from wasting their own resources and
those of society in a fruitless pursuit of illusory asset value—
and they can be more effectively prevented from destroying
the purely personal value of the debtor’s household items.
Asset investigation in the insolvency of natural persons most
often results not in the discovery of value for creditors, but
in the confirmation that further pursuit of chimerical value is
fruitless and should stop.

312. Much to the frustration of creditors and policymakers
alike, the same has very often held true of mandatory
payment plans. As discussed above, though the majority of
debtors have some future income, most have insufficient
future income to cover their own reasonable living expenses,
the costs of administering a payment plan, and a distribution
to creditors. In the majority of existing systems, in which
fewer than one -fifth of cases initiated each year produce any
return to creditors at all, it is highly questionable whether
the administrative costs of the “good behavior system” are
justified. Many commentators and even lawmakers have
questioned the value of imposing plans on individuals who

                             104
have little or no ability to pay simply as a result of feelings of
retribution.

313. For the great majority of cases in most areas, the
payment plan process achieves no financial goal beyond
funding its own operation. Indeed, many of these systems
fail to achieve even self -sufficiency, relying on subsidization
from other government funds to meet basic operating costs.
Even in areas where more debtors manage to produce some
distribution for creditors, very seldom do these distributions
amount to more than about 10 to 15 percent of creditors’
claims, even when accruing interest is halted and several
years of surplus income are accumulated.

314. Careful empirical study of the situation in one country
in particular reveals that the result of the payment plan
process may be even more troubling when debtors realize
the magnitude of their sacrifices. Debtors in this unique
system self -select into the payment plan track, and only
those with “regular income” are even allowed to petition for
relief in this track. Only about one -third of all debtors choose
the payment plan track, and one would thus expect these to
be among the most viable candidates for successful
completion of a payment plan. Unfortunately, a consistent
two-thirds of these payment plans have failed. Most debtors
have simply not been able to withstand the rigors of a multi -
year plan on a strictly limited budget. Granted, these dour
figures may be explained in part by the fact that the payment
plan track in this country is sometimes used by debtors
simply as a short -term delay tactic to prevent foreclosure on
a home mortgage or car loan, and most debtors have the
option to change their minds and seek relief in the less
demanding one -time -asset-liquidation track. Nonetheless,
decades of unsatisfying experience cast significant doubt on
the effectiveness of payment plans to achieve the goals of
natural person insolvency.

315. That being said, required payment plans have
remained extremely popular with lawmakers in many areas,
especially those that have extended insolvency relief to
natural persons only in the last few decades. As mentioned
above, these lawmakers seem to have concluded rather
consistently that even if these plans fulfill a financial purpose
only poorly at best, they at least serve an important moral or
educational purpose. Multi-year plans remind debtors and
those around them that everyone must do their best to fulfill
their obligations, whatever that “best” is, and relief from
one’s duly undertaken obligations does not come lightly and
without sacrifice. More than exacting a monetary return for
creditors, these plans inculcate good payment morality
among debtors. One country’s government and parliament
made this point explicitly, noting that zero -payment plans
have a “symbolic character,” with debtors demonstrating
worthiness for discharge by subjecting themselves to the
                              105
plan’s constraints and making an effort to pay their debts
over several years. While lawmakers in more and more
countries have concluded that lifelong indebtedness and
social exclusion for debtors are not reasonable expectations,
lawmakers in all but a handful of countries continue to
adhere to the position that creditors might legitimately
expect debtors to apply their full disposable payment
capacity over a reasonable period of time to service their
debts—however modest that payment capacity might be.

316. Thus, few systems allow significant percentages of
debtors to receive relief without passing through both an
asset liquidation and a payment plan. In particular, the idea
of affording relief without at least offering creditors a
possibility of payment from debtors’ future income is widely
regarded as unjustified. But several systems notably do
provide relief to many debtors without one or another of the
two value -extraction approaches.

317. For example, in two long -standing systems, an
administrator evaluates the future earning capacity of each
debtor, and only about one -fifth of debtors are required to
make substantial payments from future income in exchange
for insolvency relief. Debtors with depressed incomes are not
required to make future contributions; they are routed
immediately to a liquidation of any non -exempt assets
(usually none) and an eventual discharge. A somewhat
similar approach is taken in another system. Since the late
1990s, a rising proportion of especially distressed debtors—
exceeding one -quarter in recent years—have been routed by
the system administrator into a full or partial discharge of
their debts without a payment plan. Indeed, while the assets
of most of these debtors are inventoried and any non -
exempt assets are sold, some debtors avoid even this step.
After the most recent amendments to this framework, the
administrator can conclude, based simply on the paperwork
filed by the debtor that no significant value is reasonably
likely to be realized from an asset sale, and a discharge
should be offered with neither a payment plan nor a
liquidation of assets. In each of these systems, an
administrator can and often does make the decision that
administering a payment plan—or even a liquidation—is an
inappropriate expenditure of time, effort, and other
resources given the likelihood of no return to creditors.

318. One insolvency system has faced particular and
significant problems in continuing its long -standing practice
of allowing debtors to self -select into either a liquidation
track or a payment -plan track. This practice is likely the
product of path dependence resulting from decades of
gradual system development, rather than a carefully
measured policy decision. In any event, leaving this choice to
debtors has created significant problems, and attempts to
develop a standard for imposing payment plans on “can pay”
                            106
debtors have proven counter -productive. After creditors
demanded that some mechanism be put in place to force
payment plans on debtors whose future income might
provide creditors a respectable return, the legislature revised
this system to impose a complex new test for identifying
debtors with sufficient “means”—that is, future disposable
income—to make some reasonable payment to creditors.
The costly and complex test for establishing “ability to pay”
revealed only a small fraction of debtors with substantial
“means,” and implementation of this screening mechanism
saddled the system with a substantial administrative sorting
burden and sustained litigation about which debtors should
gain access to relief and on what terms. Moreover, this
approach achieved little if any long -term effect on increasing
the percentages of debtors in payment plans. This
experience underscores the importance of basing any
screening mechanism on the reality of debtors’ ability to pay,
rather than on presumptions of ability, and it illustrates the
difficulty—or as many have argued, futility—of trying to
steer debtor choice rather than assigning the sorting
function to other, disinterested actors.

D) Special Consideration of the Payment of
   Mortgages and other Secured Loans
319. In general, secured credit does not play a very
important role in systems for addressing the insolvency of
natural persons. Most debtors have few valuable assets that
have been used or could be used as collateral for debts, and
secured creditors have usually already seized whatever
collateral had formerly secured certain debts by the time
when a debtor files for insolvency relief. If a debtor has
assets that serve as collateral for a claim, these assets usually
have to be sold before relief can be offered or a payment
plan can be confirmed, as the plan does not leave room for
payment of claims secured by these items. In many countries
the starting point of the insolvency legislation is that debtors
do not and should not have secured debt or non -essential
assets that can be used as collateral.

320. In some other countries, especially those where
insolvency is more of a middle -class phenomenon, the
attitude towards certain assets and secured debt is not so
restrictive. In some countries, assets that are important for
the debtor’s post -insolvency existence, such as a home, a car
and necessary household items, may under certain
conditions be encompassed within the insolvency procedure
even when they are collateral for a debt (on exemptions, see
Section II.5.A above).
321. Even so, secured creditors are in principle protected in
insolvency procedures. The strong position of secured

                              107
creditors is deemed justified in order to protect confidence
in the credit markets. In addition, the constitutional right to
property is frequently invoked as a principle that defends the
integrity of the rights of secured creditors in insolvency
cases, as security interests are normally defined as property
rights.

322. Policymakers generally fear that any measure that
undermines, even slightly, the rights of secured creditors will
have a broad and deeply detrimental effect on the
availability of credit to finance important social activities,
especially home acquisition. In societies where home
acquisition lending is widespread, such high -value lending
activity is often a central component of national financial
markets and a foundation for a healthy economic system. A
broad array of benefits flow both from the activity of lending
and the stability that broad -based home ownership provides
as a societal support for economic activity. As financial
institutions collect large portfolios of claims secured by
home mortgages, the value of these rights to collect—and
the value of the home assets backing up the right to collect—
becomes a vital component of the balance sheets and
financial health of these financial institutions. In many
countries, it has been argued that any significant weakening
of the creditors’ rights to collect claims secured by home
mortgages could have devastating impacts on the health of
broad segments of the lending sector and the financial
stability of entire national economies.

323. Despite these fears, and within legal limitations, some
countries have found solutions that respect the interests of
debtors and the rights of secured creditors in the insolvency
procedure. Several distinct systems have developed to
balance, for example, the competing fears of destabilizing
the mortgage credit markets and of displacing significant
numbers of debtors from their homes, especially in light of
the negative effects of mass mortgage foreclosure activity in
depressing home values.
324. The key to understanding the motivation behind these
systems is that policymakers have acknowledged that the
financial damage and the losses they fear have already
materialized. A properly structured system for relieving
insolvency or mortgage distress does not cause losses to the
banking sector and does not destabilize the financial sector;
rather, these losses already exist , due to the unavoidable fact
of debtors’ inability to service their debts properly,
sometimes exacerbated by chronically depressed collateral
values, especially homes. Policymakers who have taken one
or more of the approaches described below have most often
been motivated by a desire to force creditors to acknowledge
the reality of their debtors’ long -term distress and the long -
term loss of value of the collateral, including homes, securing
their claims. Real healing at a macroeconomic, societal level
                             108
is delayed by allowing creditors to maintain the illusion of
debtor’s capacity to pay, or worse yet, the illusion that
collateral values either have not fallen or will eminently
return to previous inflated levels. Even more damaging,
healing is actively undermined by unchecked foreclosure
actions that, in large volumes, cause substantial downward
pressure on collateral values, especially for homes, resulting
in a downward spiral of ever falling home values and rising
defaults.

325. These systems are to a greater or lesser degree
designed to compel creditors to accept the bitter reality of
the distressed state of debtors and/or collateral values,
accept whatever payment capacity debtors realistically have
to offer to finance whatever value is realistically present in
collateral, and avoid taking rash action to enforce rights in
collateral and create further avoidable losses. By introducing
systems to debunk illusions of value, establish real values
based on current market conditions, and crystallize and limit
losses, policymakers in a number of areas have sought to use
legal levers to break unhealthy impasses and force creditors
and debtors to move on toward healthy and sustainable
economic relationships, for the sake of the many benefits
discussed in Section I.8 above.

      (i)    Home Mortgages
326. Home mortgages differ from other secured debts of
natural persons in importance to the debtor, as well as in the
value and nature of the collateral. The most important
secured debts for households are those that have collateral
in the house or apartment of the debtor. Since debtors who
file for debt adjustment are very seriously over -indebted, the
point of departure in most insolvency systems for natural
persons is that debtors do not own their homes or, even if
they do, they will not be able to keep the home in the
personal insolvency procedure. Therefore, in most countries,
the debtor’s home is sold either before or during the
personal insolvency procedure. Usually the creditor can sell
the home or file for forced sale if the debtor is in default on
secured debt irrespective of a personal insolvency
procedure. After the sale the outstanding debt for a now -
unsecured deficiency is treated like any other debt in
personal insolvency.

327. In some other countries, protection of homeownership
is considered a noteworthy value even in insolvency cases.
Protection of homes and access to housing are fundamental
elements of human well -being (see Section II.5.A(ii) above).
To some degree they have even been recognized in human
rights instruments, such as the United Nations Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 (article 11).
Many countries rely on their policy on private housing

                             109
ownership to such an extent that alternative housing is not
easily available. It is also acknowledged that notable
economic value may be lost if large amounts of foreclosures
take place at the same time during an economic crisis. These
considerations have led countries to adopt either temporary
protection measures in times of crisis or to include some
degree of protection of homeownership in the insolvency
law.

      a) Crisis Measures
328. The post -2007 worldwide economic crisis was at its
core a mortgage crisis, nurtured and amplified by the
securitization of loans, in which millions of homeowners
were no longer able to continue servicing their mortgage
debts. Property prices collapsed in many countries and
foreclosure rates hit levels not seen since the Great
Depression. The high levels of foreclosure, in turn, led to the
collapse of many financial institutions in several countries.
The crisis showed very clearly the connection between the
indebtedness of individuals and the stability of financial
systems.

329. In many systems, policies have been implemented to
support the housing market and assist homeowners in
retaining possession of their homes. Most of these responses
were aimed at debtors in the worst financial predicament;
i.e., those debtors with negative equity (where the value of
the homes is less than the amount of the mortgage debt)
and debtors in serious arrearage in the payment of their
mortgage debts. There has been a broad range of responses
to facilitate the restructuring of home mortgage
indebtedness. Many have been out -of-court; others have
been administrative or court -based. Many involve alternative
dispute resolution (ADR), some on a mandatory basis and
others on a voluntary basis. Some initiatives have been
undertaken by government entities or with government
financing; others have been undertaken on a voluntary basis
by financial institutions either individually or on an industry -
wide basis.

330. Of course, these measures put a heavy burden on
financial institutions if substantial numbers of homeowners
seek to modify the terms of their mortgages. For this reason,
many systems have limited the scope and/or duration of such
measures. Similarly, other systems have not moved forward
with such measures in the absence of financial industry
support.

331. Among the policy measures that have been
implemented, the following ones are relevant for the
treatment of the insolvency of natural persons:


                              110
         i) Broad variety of moratoria

         ii) ADR mechanisms

         iii) Reduction of interest rates and/or extension of
         repayment periods

         iv) Reduction of principal

i)     Broad Variety of Moratoria

332. Moratoria responses have been aimed at delaying, or
stopping, foreclosures by staying the enforcement of
mortgages. In the midst of a financial crisis, it is often
difficult for lenders to find purchasers for foreclosed
property, as there is a severe liquidity crunch, and as more
and more foreclosed property comes on the market, prices
continue to fall, and the crisis worsens. Moratoria are
intended to slow down this spiral and provide a breathing
spell for both debtors and lenders, perhaps enabling them to
work out a solution to their differences. Moratoria are more
likely to prove successful where they are in place for as long
as the relevant debtors are affected by the crisis. These kinds
of temporary crisis measures are usually implemented and
regulated through the laws of property or enforcement of
obligations, instead of in insolvency law, but temporary
measures may be considered in the context of insolvency law
as well.

ii)    ADR Mechanisms

333. Like the moratoria, the ADR mechanisms are a
procedural device to slow down the foreclosure. There are
many variants of this approach, but what they have in
common is that they attempt to get debtors and lenders to
sit down and talk to each other with a view to finding a
constructive compromise arrangement for moving forward
and avoiding the many negative effects of a foreclosure
action.

334. ADR mechanisms might be enacted independently or
jointly with moratoria measures. The combination of ADR
mechanisms and moratoria is used in instances where a crisis
threatens to overwhelm the enforcement system and to
cause the collapse of the real estate market.

335. Indeed, each of these first two mechanisms – the
moratoria and the ADR mechanisms – are likely to be more
effective against a backdrop of severe systemic distress in
which lenders are either unable to sell foreclosed property or
can only sell at depressed prices. They often fail to gain the
support of lenders when the property markets are operating
more efficiently and it is easier for them to find buyers for
the distressed property.
                             111
iii)   Reduction of Interest Rates and/or Extension of
       Repayment Periods

336. These measures have been implemented either on a
large -scale out -of-court basis or through their inclusion in
insolvency laws. These measures are aimed at debtors who
are unable to meet their current repayment obligations but
who will likely be able to meet modified, smaller monthly
financial obligations. These measures are more likely to
prove effective when they provide substantive overall relief
(e.g., decreasing the total amount of debt through the
lowering of the interest rate). Where the debt extension
merely enables the debtor to pay out the debt over a longer
period of time, the ultimate resolution of the debtor’s
financial problems is often merely delayed – and months or
years later the debtor finds that it is necessary to again try to
re-negotiate with the financial institution. One system in
particular has faced this “revolving door” phenomenon, and
policymakers revised it to include more aggressive relief to
make debtors’ first pass through the door more effective.

iv)    Reduction of Principal

337. For many homeowner debtors, merely being able to
lock in a lower interest rate and pay back the loan over a
longer period of time will not solve their longer-term
problems and might well burden them with a lifetime
obligation that they will never be able to repay. Moreover, in
situations where home values have fallen broadly,
homeowners face powerful disincentives to make their best
efforts to maintain their home loan obligations. They may
perceive it as unjustified to continue to “throw good money
after bad” by paying an inflated price for an asset, the value
of which has declined precipitously and has little prospect of
returning. As a matter of fact, one reason why some financial
institutions are reluctant to sit down and re -negotiate
mortgage terms with their borrowers during a financial crisis
is that the bankers fear that once homeowners realize that
they will be in debt forever - or that it is unlikely that the
value of their homes will ever exceed the amount that the
homeowners borrowed to buy their homes - the
homeowners might decide to simply default and walk away
from their mortgages, which might well be the rational
decision to be made. Against this backdrop, the first three
remedial measures are likely to prove insufficient in the
absence of a reduction in the principal amount owing by a
debtor on the mortgage loan.

338. Of course, reducing the principal amount of the debt
forces financial institutions to write off parts of their loans
and to mark down the value of their mortgage collateral.
This, in turn, puts greater pressure on the financial
                              112
institutions’ balance sheets and might well force them to
seek additional capital at the very time that sources of
additional capital are hard to find. In addition, financial
institutions fear that if such relief is too easily granted to
debtors it will create the perverse incentive for some “can-
pay” homeowners to “strategically” default with the hope of
having the principal amount of their debts reduced.

339. As discussed above, however, writing down claims and
marking down the value of mortgage collateral may in many
cases represent a simple acknowledgement of the
unavoidable reality, not the creation of losses or balance
sheet pressure. If the true value of the home collateral or the
debtor’s ability to repay is compromised, the “value” of full
recovery on such a loan is not value at all, but simply an
illusory hope of value. Practically, a loss already exists, and
the bank’s action in finally recognizing this fact and taking
appropriate remedial action by modifying the principal
balance of the loan is a starting point for healing, not the
cause of further distress. The process of acknowledging such
pre -existing losses may be painful, but maintaining an
illusion of non -existent value simply delays—and perhaps
complicates—the healing process.

340. To make proposals for reducing the principal of
secured loans acceptable to the financial sector – and to take
into account that such a change would adversely affect
financial institutions’ rights as secured creditors – proposals
have been made to allow financial institutions to share in a
certain percentage of any future increase in the home’s value
over a certain period of time. For example, a lender who had
written down the principal of a home loan might regain the
right to collect some of the written -off claim if the home’s
value increased during the following five years (whether or
not the debtor sold the home during this period). In this way,
the creditor would be granted a potential future benefit in
exchange for the reductions in interest and principal.
341. The four groups of measures that have been described
are among the most frequently discussed responses to the
crisis. Another possible solution is to transfer ownership of
mortgaged property to the lender, with the possibility of the
debtor retaining possession of the property under a lease.
This solution, of course, comes at a great financial and
psychic loss to the debtor, and leads financial institutions
into new business lines (e.g., property management), for
which they may be ill-equipped.

342. Another proposed solution to the mortgage crisis that
is relevant to personal insolvency involves a rebalancing of
pension and insolvency policies. Normally, a debtor with
retirement assets would not be allowed to draw upon those
assets to avert mortgage foreclosure, under the reasoning
that such funds are intended for the debtor’s retirement.
                             113
However, as noted above (see Section II.5.A (ii)(d) above), in
many systems, debtors’ retirement assets are increasingly of
substantial value. One proposal is that during times of
systemic crisis, debtors should be able to either receive a
distribution or borrow from pension/retirement assets
(perhaps up to a certain limit) to enable them to avert
mortgage foreclosure. An advantage of this proposal is that it
enables debtors to draw upon their own funds without the
need to enter into perhaps lengthy or contentious
negotiations with third parties. A major disadvantage is that
raiding retirement savings might well leave the debtor with
insufficient support during retirement, possibly externalizing
the burden of supporting the debtor in retirement onto a
public support system. Some have argued that it is
unjustified for creditors to recover full payment in the
present at the expense of a future burden on society,
especially if a reasonable compromise arrangement could
avert both a foreclosure and future complications with the
debtor’s retirement.

343. Lastly, when considering the effectiveness of possible
remedial measures in a given system, it is important to take
into account whether the loan secured by a mortgage
lending is a recourse or a non-recourse loan; that is, whether
the debtor remains personally liable for the home mortgage
loan if the home is sold in foreclosure for less than the
amount of the secured loan (recourse) or not (non -recourse).
In a system where loans secured by mortgages are recourse
loans and it is difficult for a debtor to get a discharge, the
result can be unlimited liability for a debtor from which there
is little likelihood of escaping. In such systems, the pressure
for some sort of relief from this burden is particularly acute.
In contrast, in a system where loans secured by mortgages
are non-recourse loans, at some stage debtors can walk away
from their mortgage obligations (and leave the financial
institution with the property) and try to start over even in
the absence of specific insolvency relief.

      b) Home Mortgages in Personal Insolvency
344. Informal measures have proven largely unsuccessful in
achieving solutions to the systemic problem of large numbers
of distressed home mortgages. Although proposals have
been put forth repeatedly over the years in many different
countries, only a few systems have developed special
regulations on home mortgages under insolvency law. These
systems have arisen in countries that rely strongly on
homeownership in their housing policy. When protection of
homeownership under insolvency law is adopted on a
permanent basis, the starting point has been that the rights
of the secured creditors are essentially protected, but also
subjected to some modifications. The decision on which


                             114
modifications to allow is subject to a number of difficult
considerations.

345. The requirements for retaining homeownership
through the insolvency procedure vary. In some systems, the
only allowed modifications involve reductions of interest
rates or extensions of the payment period. In others, an
insolvency case prevents the initiation or continuation of a
foreclosure action, but regular payments on the mortgage
loan must continue, along with some payment plan for any
arrearage. Another variation is to allow the debtor to pay
only interest during the first years of the plan, and resume
normal mortgage payments thereafter. In some cases the
payments go first to the outstanding capital and then to the
interest (usually this measure is equivalent to the lowering of
the interest).
346. The most aggressive form of relief is to modify the
principal owing on a home mortgage loan. Where
modification of the principal is allowed in an insolvency case,
the first issue to address is whether the home mortgage is
treated as a unified whole or whether it is divided into to a
secured part that is covered by the value of the collateral
(home) and an unsecured part. If the home mortgage debt is
considered as a unified whole, the debtor is usually required
to pay the entire debt according to the terms of the original
contract. In some systems this is based on specific insolvency
regulations, in some others, the law is silent on home
mortgages but the courts may allow debtors to keep their
homes if that alternative is not economically less favorable to
the creditors than selling the home. Such a situation may
occur when the home has little economic value and the
associated costs of living in it are low.

347. In those systems in which the home mortgage debt is
divided into a secured part and an unsecured part, the
unsecured part may be treated in personal insolvency like
any other unsecured claim. The unsecured part of the debt
may also be subject to a liquidation test; that is, debtors
have to pay at least as much of the unsecured part of the
debt as they could have paid in an insolvency in which the
home would have been sold. It is apparent, however, that
such a test may be quite complicated in design. As for the
secured part of the debt, as a basic rule, it has to be paid in
full or with some modification.

348. To avoid unfairly depriving the mortgage creditors of a
future increase in home value, two systems allow for the
reduction of the principal amount of a home mortgage down
to the value of the home, but the value of the home is
enhanced by a buffer of ten percent over its market value
(110 percent of current market value). In other systems,
proposals have been made to provide for a recapture or
“claw -back” of any future rise in value, automatically
                             115
increasing the secured creditor’s claim by all or a declining
percentage of this increase in value over time. No such
recapture proposal has been enacted as law yet.
Policymakers continue to search for appropriate
compromises, however, as a counterbalance to any proposal
to reduce the principal owed on a home mortgage in light of
a reduction in the value of the home.

349. To guarantee that the secured debt is paid in full (or
with some modification) the payments often have to be
extended up to twenty years or more. Thus, the payment
plan concerning the secured debt may be much longer than
the plan for the unsecured debt, which usually has an upper
limit of five years (see Section II.5.B (i) above). Obviously,
there is the risk that the debtor will face other hardships
during such a long time, possibly leading to the loss of the
home after considerable sacrifice. This danger is generally
accepted, as no current system is designed to keep debtors
in homes despite their long -term inability to service proper
repayment of the real value of the home.

      (ii)   Debt Secured by other Household Assets
350. Other assets besides homes might serve as collateral
for a secured loan, particularly the debtor’s automobile.
Some systems allow debtors to retain these assets in the
event of personal insolvency, including those that are
necessary for the debtor’s household or for earning a living.
The debtor may often keep them as protected assets
(beneficium; see the discussion on exemptions at Section
II.5.A above).

351. These assets often have very little real economic value
to creditors. Almost invariably they have a far higher utility
value to debtors and their families as compared to their
economic value to the creditors. Moveable items like
automobiles often experience a steep value depreciation
that makes them of very little value to a foreclosing creditor,
especially taking into account the costs of foreclosure.

352. Especially for assets that are normally necessary in a
household, the payments that the debtor has to make on the
secured loan may be included in the household budget as a
necessary living cost (as opposed to a debt payment). Thus,
some systems allow debtors to maintain such items by
paying the secured loan as a reasonable allowed living cost.

353. At least one system allows the court discretion to
modify the secured payment obligation of the debtor on
loans secured by movables, such as automobiles. Such loans
are divided into a secured portion (backed by real collateral
value), which must be paid in full, and an unsecured portion
(not backed by real value), which is paid pro rata along with

                             116
other unsecured claims. Even in this system, however, the
rules for bifurcating such claims into secured and unsecured
portions are subject to exceptions for newer items, allowing
bifurcation only for automobiles and other items purchased
in the more distant past.

II.6. Discharge
A) Purpose and Characteristics of the Discharge
354. One of the principal purposes of an insolvency system
for natural persons is to re -establish the debtor’s economic
capability, in other words, economic rehabilitation .
Rehabilitation includes three elements. First, the debtor has
to be freed from excessive debt. The benefits of the
discharge have been extensively discussed from the point of
view of the debtors, creditors, and society in Section I.8
above. Second, the debtor should be treated on an equal
basis with non -debtors after receiving relief (the principle of
non-discrimination). Third, the debtor should be able to
avoid becoming excessively indebted again in the future,
which may require some attempt to change debtors’
attitudes concerning proper credit use.

355. The most effective form of relief from debt is a “fresh
start”, which in historical usage refers to a straight discharge;
that is, to the possibility to be freed from debt without a
payment plan. Several recently implemented systems have
moved away from requiring payment plans of all debtors,
offering an immediate straight discharge to at least the most
impecunious debtors. In contrast, in one system in particular,
the concept of “fresh start” can be identified with the
ideology of a nation of immigrants, many of whom started a
new life after having left everything, including debts, in their
home countries. After a recent reform of that system,
however, the discharge for some debtors is no longer so
straight, as debtors are subject to closer scrutiny of their
attempt to receive a discharge without offering creditors
payment from future income, and some debtors with
payment capacity are now required to pay part of their debts
according to a payment plan before they receive a discharge.

356. Most systems continue to reject the notion of a
straight discharge. The majority of them require a partial
payment of debts as a condition for discharge, or at least set
forth a period of time during which the debtor’s economic
life is regulated by a debt adjustment plan or payment plan
that lasts usually from three to five years. Thus, the debt is
only reduced to such an amount that is considered
reasonable for the debtor to pay. Instead of a “fresh start”
we could speak of a delayed or earned new start. (On
different plan models, see Section II.5.B above).


                              117
357. A small number of systems require or at least expect a
minimum payment from debtors as a pre -requisite to
obtaining a discharge. Such minimum payment would usually
be in proportion to the debt, perhaps ten percent, or maybe
even a symbolic payment of some modest amount. As many
debtors have very few assets and little income, this kind of
rule invariably produces undesirable results. Significant
numbers of “honest but unfortunate” debtors who otherwise
qualify for relief have been denied a discharge because of
their inability to make minimum payments to creditors in the
few countries that impose such a requirement. In some
countries, however, courts have found such requirements to
be discriminatory against debtors with little or no means.
Another variation of this rule, followed in a few countries,
establishes that the length of the payment plan is related to
the amount of payment. If the debtor pays a certain
percentage of the debt, the payment period may be shorter
than the one normally provided under the law. This variation
has affected very few insolvency procedures for natural
persons, however, given that only a small fraction of debtors
in such systems have been able to produce the larger
payments to creditors necessary to benefit from the reduced
payment period.

358. The payment plan is often assessed from the point of
view of its -quite modest - yield to creditors. In many
countries, however, the payment plan is conceived
differently, as “the price” of an earned new start (i.e.,
discharge). There are different views on how high this “price”
should be. When a country is considering introducing a new
law on natural person insolvency, an onerous payment plan
is easily deemed consistent with the general principle of
private law known as pacta sunt servanda . A realistic view of
debtors’ situations, however, often leads to prioritizing more
lenient and shorter payment plans, as discussed in Section
II.5. B)(i)-(ii) above.

359. The benefits of a discharge may become illusory if the
discharge is not respected after the insolvency procedure has
concluded. To deal with this potential problem, two other
elements are sometimes included in the legal framework as
ancillary support for the concepts of discharge and
rehabilitation.

360. First, the principle of non-discrimination is an
important consideration for achieving the full benefit of a
discharge. Debtors should not be discriminated against solely
because they have filed for insolvency or have received
insolvency relief. Since payment plans last for several years,
discrimination both during the plan and after its completion
may be a problem that warrants careful attention. Actually,
discrimination issues have rarely been discussed in this
context and there seems to be no explicit prohibition against
discrimination in most laws addressing the insolvency of
                            118
natural persons. Data protection regulations in some
countries prohibit the recording and use of information on
completed payment plans, which is in effect a prohibition
against discrimination. In many other countries, however,
any insolvency filing is recorded along with other “negative”
credit entries, at least for a limited number of years following
conclusion of an insolvency case, which often gives rise to
discrimination against former natural person debtors who
have gone through insolvency procedures. It would be
advisable that both researchers and lawmakers pay attention
to the principle of non -discrimination in the future.

361. Second, inculcating healthier and more responsible use
of credit as a goal and a result of a debt relief procedure is
much more difficult to achieve or measure. One indication of
the idea that one should not incur debts again after
obtaining relief is the virtually universal bar to a repeat filing
for debt relief. The length of such a prohibition reflects
different attitudes. In most countries, a new filing is possible
only after a period of several years, while in some others
consumer debt adjustment is generally regarded as a “once
in a lifetime” event, with some exceptions for extremely
compelling cases.

362. During the past decade there has been growing
interest in financial education, the importance of which is
acknowledged both in school systems and in adult
educational facilities. From this perspective, the fact that a
debtor has filed for debt relief is sometimes taken as a sign
of financial mismanagement. While the reasons for debtors’
economic failure may vary, there is evidence that a
considerable portion of debtors have insufficient financial
skills.

363. In the context of an insolvency system for natural
persons, instilling better credit use habits in debtors is often
sought either through individual debt counseling or
compulsory financial education. As explained in Section II.1,
many countries require the debtor to engage with budget
and debt counselors and to enter into prior negotiations with
creditors before filing for a formal debt relief procedure.
While a debt counselor almost always assists the debtor in
such negotiations with a view to filing for insolvency, this
counseling is also an opportunity to assist the debtor in
financial planning more generally. The limitation here is that
the focus of the work of debt counselors is the insolvency
procedure and resources for individual budgeting advice are
often limited. In recognition of these limitations, some
countries require classroom financial education for consumer
debtors in insolvency proceedings. The efficacy of these
classes, the likelihood of modification of the debtors’
behavior and the mandatory nature of such courses are
contested issues, and this is a field for ongoing development
work and research.
                              119
364. The completion of the payment plan can be a proof of
the debtors’ capacity to control their financial affairs. In
some countries, debtors also have a special “good behavior”
obligation during the plan. That is, debtors are obliged to
work during the plan or to look for a job if they are
unemployed. Since this is a legal obligation, creditors may
claim that the debtor has not fulfilled it and ask for denial of
the discharge at the end of the payment plan if the debtor
has not fulfilled it. As a matter of fact, however, in countries
with such a system of pre -discharge scrutiny, creditors have
proven reluctant to expend time and money objecting to
relief, and the more likely source of objections has been the
appointed insolvency representative.

365. Along the same lines, the principle of good faith is
present in almost all insolvency laws. A central idea of
insolvency law is to help unfortunate but honest debtors. In
principle, all laws require that debtors who abuse the system
be denied discharge. If the debtor has incurred debt in a
fraudulent manner, it is very difficult to obtain a discharge in
any country. Even more severe is the attitude towards fraud
committed while the insolvency procedure is pending. Such
fraud leads to denial of discharge and even to criminal
prosecution. The standards on disclosure are also quite
stringent in order to prevent fraud. Debtors are required to
disclose their economic affairs in the insolvency procedure
subject to the penalty of denial of discharge for failure to
make the requisite disclosures.

366. Moral hazard from the debtors’ side, that is, risky
borrowing that is not fraudulent per se, is more difficult to
assess. Although simple “irresponsibility” in borrowing too
much generally does not lead to denial of relief, some
countries deny discharge when the debtor has incurred debt
in an unscrupulous manner or in a way that the court regards
as obviously and objectively reckless or speculative. This
leads to the denial of discharge on the basis of debtors’
behavior and may lead to precluding discharge for debtors
who genuinely need it. But on the other side, granting
discharge to high -flyers and risk takers can seriously
undermine the legitimacy of the system. For a discussion of
moral hazard and fraud, see Section I.9 above.

B)   The Scope of the Discharge
367. For rehabilitation it is important that as many of the
debtor’s debts as possible be included in the scope of the
discharge. The more debts that are excluded from the effect
of the discharge, the less effective the insolvency regime can
be in achieving the debtor’s rehabilitation and the many
related goals outlined in Section I.8 above. The old
insolvency law principle of equality of treatment of creditors
is another important principle in personal insolvency law, in

                             120
relation to the debts to be included in the discharge. Most
insolvency laws for natural persons continue to adhere to the
principle of equality of creditors so that very few claims are
excepted from the discharge. But there are some exceptions
to this general trend, even in countries that are known as
“debtor-friendly.” Some debts that are not created in the
market context are in many systems excluded from the
discharge, in particular, child support and sometimes spousal
support. Similarly, taxes and fines are often excluded, though
the recent tendency in insolvency law has been to eliminate
the special treatment for debts owed to public bodies. These
exceptions are discussed below.

      (i) Maintenance: Child/Spousal Support
368. The most important and common exceptions apply to
child and sometimes spousal support obligations. These
debts are generally excluded from the discharge for
fundamental public policy reasons. Insolvency policy
generally concerns the proper allocation of responsibility and
burden, and most systems are not willing to allow the
debtors’ most fundamental responsibility, to their families, to
be avoided, nor to allow debtors to externalize this burden
onto other, equally vulnerable parties. Disrupting children
and former spouses’ rights, by depriving them of their claims
to support would endanger their welfare and undermine the
public policy of family support, which is as important as the
policy of freeing the debtor from undue financial burdens.
The notion of family responsibility creates a “non-market”
obligation that is regarded as falling outside the appropriate
realm of insolvency relief. While many non-business and
even non -financial debts are included within the discharge
for natural persons, insolvency relief remains largely focused
on debts created in the marketplace, rather than within the
confines of family relations.
369. Several systems take a variety of approaches to
excluding support obligations from the discharge. Some
systems exclude both spousal and child support; others
exclude only child support obligations. In some welfare
states, if a debtor has missed any support payments,
especially to a child, the state steps in and pays the
delinquent support obligations to the child’s guardian and is
then subrogated to the rights of the child to collect the
overdue support obligations from the debtor. In such
systems, the state’s right to step into the shoes of the
support claimant by subrogation is excluded from discharge
just as the claimant’s direct claim would have been excluded.

      (ii) Fines and Other Sanctions



                             121
370. Another common exclusion concerns fines and other
liabilities that are a consequence of crimes. A few systems
have extended this reasoning so as to exclude also private
claims for restitution arising from personal injury or even
property damage. The underlying policy concerns the proper
allocation of responsibility. Insolvency relief is designed to
offer relief to “honest but unfortunate” debtors, who suffer
from volatile economic and social conditions beyond their
control. Debts related to criminal sanctions and fines are all
but universally regarded as not falling within this paradigm.
Debtors can avoid incurring fines simply by abiding by the
rules, and thus very few systems are willing to allow debtors
to evade punishment for violations of rules. Fines are thus
even less “market -based” than family support obligations,
and they are thus generally regarded as not appropriate
subjects for the extraordinary relief of an insolvency
discharge.
371. A few systems also exclude private claims for
restitution arising from tort -related injuries to persons or
property. The tort claims excluded are those based on some
level of culpable conduct, such as intoxication or reckless
disregard for the welfare of others. But claims for simple
negligence resulting in unintentional harm to another person
or property are very seldom excluded from discharge.

      (iii) Taxes and Other Government Debts
372. While taxes and other non -punitive liabilities towards
the state were commonly excluded from discharge in the
past, a notable trend of abolishing the exception for such
debts has emerged recently. In the many countries where
taxes and other government claims remain excluded from
discharge, this responds to the same reasons for the
exclusion of family support debts, i.e. taxes and government
debts are part of the fundamental obligation of citizens to
support their society. These are not simple debts arising in
bilateral relations in the marketplace, rather, they are
higher- order debts owed to society as a whole to support
the operation of government. Allowing individual debtors to
evade this fundamental responsibility not just to one
creditor, but to society, is widely regarded as unjustified.

373. In recent years, a number of countries have repealed
special priorities and exceptions to discharge for taxes and
other government debts for at least two reasons. First, taxes
in particular are often among the largest debts contributing
to a debtor’s insolvency, especially for current and former
small businesspeople. The rationale for this new trend is that
excluding government debts from the scope of discharge
undermines the entire insolvency relief system, because this
deprives debtors, creditors, and society of the many benefits
of relief discussed in Section I.8 above. Increasingly, more

                            122
and more legislatures have accepted that, if the law forces
“ordinary” creditors to forego their legitimate claims against
debtors, then the state, too, should abide by the same rules
in order to support the relief system, at least for non -
punitive debts like taxes and fees. Second, if taxes are not
excluded from discharge, they are probably also entitled to
priorities of payment before other creditors. This has been
criticized as unfair against other creditors, with the
consequence that legislatures have repealed these priorities,
and in turn also repealing their exclusion from discharge, at
least in some cases. Indeed, some countries that retain the
tax priorities and the exclusion from discharge for taxes in
business insolvency have abolished it in relief procedures
designed for natural persons engaged in little or no business
activity.

      (iv) Educational Loans
374. Only a few countries exclude educational loans from
the scope of discharge. This is a hotly debated topic. The
policy underlying such exclusion is that educational debts
represent a current investment that is designed to be paid
off from the future benefits that this investment in education
will bring about. Allowing debtors to keep all of the future
benefits of income growth attributable precisely to that
educational support, while discharging the obligations and
leaving lenders to face the entire burden, is regarded in
some countries as unfair and unjustified. However, a
significant portion of debtors with educational loans do not
obtain a degree –which calls into question the rationale of
this policy. Another factor to be taken into account is that
these debts can be quite large, and it is often the case that
one central state authority is responsible for extending such
loans, with the consequence that allowing such loans to be
discharged would potentially impose a very heavy burden on
the state lending authority. However, few countries have
identified any evidence of newly examined professionals,
such as medical doctors and lawyers, filing for debt
adjustment to discharge their study loans. General “good
faith” tests have been sufficient in most countries to stop
inappropriate behavior related to the discharge of such
loans. On the other hand, some debtors with no prospect of
significant incomes have serious problems repaying their
student loans. Depriving these debtors, their other creditors,
and society of the many benefits of insolvency relief by not
allowing the discharge of these debts is, therefore, not
regarded as a good solution in most systems.

      (v) Reaffirmation Agreements
375. There are basically two opposing views on the
exemption of individual debts from the operation of the

                            123
discharge through agreements between the debtor and
individual creditors entered into during the insolvency
procedure (reaffirmation agreements). In some countries,
such agreements are strictly forbidden as unjustified
violations of the principle of equality of creditors. Courts
generally hold that favoring certain creditors in the event of
insolvency is illegal, and that these contracts are void. In
some cases such favoring of one creditor even constitutes a
criminal act. But in some other countries, reaffirmation
agreements between the debtor and a creditor are allowed
subject to the court’s discretion, so long as such agreements
serve the interests of the debtor, and the debtor voluntarily
affirms such obligations.

      (vi) Post-Commencement Debts
376. The discharge generally covers only the debts that
arose before the commencement of a formal insolvency case
(pre -petition debts). If the debtor incurs new debts during
the court proceedings or pending the duration of the
repayment plan, these debts have to be paid in full. Because
of the stringent conditions of the payment plan, most
debtors must be very careful not to incur new debts before
the plan is completed. It has to be remembered, however,
that a rescheduling loan, which is used to pay off an agreed
part of the debts, is a very useful tool in debt restructuring.
Its legal status, however, depends on the legal system
involved.

C)   Discharge and Guarantees, Co-Debtors and Third
     Party Collateral
377. Insolvency is always a problem for the debtor’s entire
family. Sometimes family members and others close to the
debtor are drawn into the debtor’s economic crisis because
they have personally guaranteed a loan of the debtor or
given their property as collateral for a loan. Since payment
can be quite easily demanded from the guarantor or from
the value of the collateral if the principal debtor does not
pay or becomes insolvent, guarantors often face payment
claims on the eve or after the opening of an insolvency
procedure. The situation of the guarantor has been found to
be quite hard in many countries. Personal guarantees raise
many issues in the context of insolvency: this sub-section
focuses on the most important one, the relationship
between discharge of the insolvent debtor and the personal
guarantees provided by other family members. However, a
comprehensive treatment of personal guarantees may
require the analysis of other procedural and substantive
aspects.


                             124
378. There is very little quantitative or qualitative
information or legal research on such loan guarantees and on
the effect of the filing of personal insolvency procedures on
the obligations of guarantors. A questionnaire distributed to
the member states of the Council of Europe in 2004 collected
information on the rights and obligations of the guarantor in
the context of consumer debt adjustment -insolvency
proceedings involving natural persons -. The approach flowed
in the states surveyed is fairly similar, as summarized in the
following paragraphs.

379. Personal guarantees extended by—as well as collateral
security owned by—family members are commonly accepted
to secure loans in many countries, with few legal restrictions.
Only a few laws on insolvency of natural persons contain
specific provisions on the effect of an insolvency case filed by
the main debtor on the guarantor. Because payments are at
that point usually late, the creditor may collect the debt from
the guarantor or from the value of the collateral that a third
person has given for the loan. After the guarantor has paid
the loan, the guarantor has the same rights against the
debtor as the creditor had before the payment. In practice,
the guarantor will become one more creditor who receives a
partial payment according to the plan. A co -signer of a loan
is treated in the same way as the guarantor. When a third
person has given property as collateral, the same rule
applies, up to the value of the collateral. To summarize, the
insolvency procedure and the discharge have no alleviating
effect on the liability of the guarantor.

380. While specific concerns of co -obligors were raised in
the legislative discussion of one country’s law, the
protections for guarantors and other co -obligors were
ultimately excluded from the effects of the principal debtor’s
insolvency proceeding, because guarantors and other co -
obligors can apply for relief under the personal insolvency
law themselves in case this is necessary. In very few
countries has the plight of guarantors been specifically
addressed in the natural person insolvency legislation. In one
system, natural persons and gratuitous sureties are allowed
to petition for a discharge of a suretyship obligation
implicated in the principal debtor’s pending natural person
insolvency case if the surety’s resulting obligation is
“disproportionate to his revenue and patrimony.” In another
system, guarantors may file for a specific alleviation
procedure in which the guarantee obligation may benefit
from an extended payment period. Such a procedure does
not cover the guarantor’s other debt obligations.

381. In a voluntary debt settlement, the rules may be the
opposite. Under the private law of many countries, a
voluntary agreement on the payment of the debt, including
its partial forgiveness, benefits the guarantor as well.

                             125
382. Many guarantors and co -debtors have been bitter over
their position in the event of insolvency of the principal
debtor. They have felt that it is unfair for the system to
impose upon them an obligation to pay the loan in full when
the debtor is discharged and the guarantor only gets a
meager portion of the payment back according to the
principal debtor’s payment plan.

383. The rationale of personal guarantees or third-party
collateral is to ensure that the creditor gets paid in case the
principal debtor turns out to be insolvent. When debtors file
for insolvency they are obviously insolvent and, thus, the
guarantor’s liability necessarily comes into the picture. If the
guarantor’s liability were adjusted in such a situation, the
creditors would be less protected and less willing to give
credit.
384. The difficult situation of family members as guarantors
has led policymakers to consider the economic rationale for
the treatment of guarantors anew. The problems have often
emerged in the courts when the creditors have claimed
payment from the guarantors who have argued that they
made their promises under duress or without adequate
information or that the guarantee was simply unreasonable.
The courts have, in some cases, had sympathy for the
guarantors, and consequently the duties of the creditors at
the time of signing the contract have been strengthened. In
particular, in many countries, the creditors have a
responsibility to give adequate and detailed information to
the guarantor. In one country, the Constitutional Court has
even imposed some restrictions on what kinds of guarantees
a spouse, a child or other dependent person can validly give.
The persons who are dependent on or have strong emotional
ties with the debtor need some protection against
exploitative contracts.

385. There are persuasive arguments in favor of the
information rights of guarantors and the restrictions on the
use of guarantees by family members. However, if
guarantees are used, the guarantor’s position in the
insolvency of the principal debtor remains a problem for
which there is no good solution. But there are some
possibilities to mitigate the situation:

    a) First, the insolvency procedure might include some
    regulations that give the parties time to adjust and
    negotiate. The guarantors, co-debtors, and those who have
    given collateral on behalf of the debtor could be protected
    by the stay of debt enforcement measures that the opening
    of an insolvency procedure for a natural person imposes on
    the creditors, though this would be an extraordinary
    departure from the approach of the ICR Standard in business
    insolvency cases. If the guarantor hides property, the court
    could grant the creditor the right to enforcement.
                             126
    b) Second, the guarantor’s and the debtor’s liability could
    be divided in the debt adjustment. For example, the
    guarantor could be made liable only for that part of the debt
    that exceeds what the debtor pays to the creditor under the
    plan. This could give the debtor an incentive to pay more.

    c) Third, the guarantor’s payment could also be adjusted in
    the main debtor’s debt adjustment procedure, for example,
    into installment payments.

    d) Fourth, the courts could be given discretion to favor the
    reimbursement claims of individual guarantors in the
    payment plan if the guarantor has made great sacrifices to
    pay the debt. This may sound unfair to other creditors but is
    not necessarily so. If the guarantor has lost his or her home
    to pay the debt and the other creditors are institutions,
    favoring the guarantor in the payment plan would not be
    unjustified.

386. These proposals mean that the guarantor’s liability
would not be equal to that of the debtor. Interestingly, in an
early draft of the 2008 Consumer Credit Directive, the
European Union made proposals that went in the same
direction, though these early proposals were ultimately not
adopted. Under those proposals, the creditor would have
been able to take action against the guarantor only after the
debtor had been in default for three months. In addition, the
proposal was aimed at furthering rescheduling agreements
on the payment of debt. These proposals are in line with a
greater flexibility for the guarantor’s position in the debt
adjustment.



             III. Summary and Conclusions


387. In recent decades, lawmakers have struggled with the
multitude of negative effects caused by a rapidly rising tide
of debt distress among natural persons. These problems
have swept across regions that differ widely in terms not
only of culture, history, and social structures, but also of
economic and financial development. Developed and
developing countries alike have suffered from a broader and
deeper penetration of insolvency among natural persons,
especially as access to finance has expanded to larger
segments of society. As more people enjoy the benefits of
access to finance for both entrepreneurialism and
consumption, the urgency of dealing with the inevitable
economic casualties presses ever harder. Excessive
indebtedness poses serious economic problems, in terms of
loss of productivity of ample segments of the population


                             127
under the burden of debt, which saps the initiative of
individuals and depresses their productive capacity.

388. Traditional insolvency laws have often proven
unsuitable to address these new problems, as these laws
commonly arose under different circumstances and were
passed for different purposes. To be sure, many of the goals
of the two types of insolvency regimes overlap, such as
increasing and more fairly distributing payment to creditors,
streamlining procedures, and enhancing economic
performance for the ultimate benefit of society. However,
traditional insolvency laws gravitate around the protection of
credit and business, and often disregard the personal
element. The desire to relieve individual suffering is more
direct and more central in the context of natural person
insolvency.
389. This report provides guidance on the characteristics
of an effective insolvency regime for natural persons and on
the opportunities and challenges encountered in the
development of an effective regime for the treatment of
the insolvency of natural persons. The report is explicitly
non-prescriptive, leaving readers to arrive at their own
conclusions.

390. Any consideration of a regime for addressing the
insolvency of natural persons should take into account the
surrounding context of laws, policies, and practices with
which such a regime must be necessarily coordinate.
Policymakers should be aware of the social, legal and
economic peculiarities that may affect the functioning of a
regime for the insolvency of natural persons.

391. One of the main objectives of this report is to raise
awareness about the importance of the development of a
regime for the treatment of the insolvency of natural
persons. This report presents a list of issues that policy
makers should analyze in their own legal systems to better
understand the effects and benefits of the various policy
choices involved in designing an effective system for the
treatment of the insolvency of natural persons. The purpose
of the report is not to convince policymakers to follow the
example of the various regimes existing today, but rather to
enrich their own independent development process.

392. This report identifies common challenges as well as
time-tested strategies for overcoming those challenges.
There is a wealth of ideas and practical solutions that have
been implemented with the overarching objective of
achieving a system that provides benefits for debtors and
their families, for creditors, and for society as a whole. No
single answer or best solution that would address all of the
competing considerations for any given community is
possible, but these issues should be on the agenda of
                            128
policymakers in any community in search of sensible
solutions for problems related to excessive personal debt.
Any search for the best way forward needs to be informed
not by conjecture and anecdote, but by a distillation of
actual observations of existing experience. However, it is
premature to identify best practices in this area.



Scope, Goals and Characteristics of an Insolvency Regime for
                     Natural Persons

393. An insolvency regime for natural persons is expected
to meet a wide range of goals in contemporary societies. No
longer a simple creditor -oriented mechanism for the forcible
collection of debts from insolvent commercial entities,
insolvency laws now contemplate benefits that flow to
natural person debtors themselves. Providing relief to
“honest but unfortunate” debtors has long been a primary
purpose of insolvency regimes for natural persons.
Additionally, and more importantly, such a regime provides
benefits to society as a whole. Therefore, a regime for
treating the insolvency of natural persons not only pursues
the objectives of increasing payment to individual creditors
and enhancing a fair distribution of payment among the
collective of creditors, but, just as importantly, such a regime
pursues the objectives of providing relief to debtors and
their families and addressing wider social issues. In achieving
those objectives, a regime for the insolvency of natural
persons should strive for a balance among competing
interests.

394. A well-structured insolvency regime can both avoid
waste and facilitate productivity. Prevention of waste and
enhancement of productivity can be achieved by preventing
creditors from pursuing practically fruitless collection efforts
and by offering debtors an incentive to reveal and even
produce value for creditors and society.
395. The benefits for creditors and debtors have wide
spillover effects on society. These benefits include:

 -Establishing proper account valuation;
 -Reducing wasteful collection costs and destroyed value in
 depressed asset sales;
 -Encouraging responsible lending;
 -Reducing negative externalities produced by inaccurate
 risk assessment;
 -Concentrating losses on more efficient and effective loss
 distributors;

                             129
 -Reducing social costs of illness, crime and unemployment;
 -Increasing production of taxable income;
 -Maximizing economic activity;
 -Encouraging entrepreneurship; and
 -Enhancing the stability and predictability in the financial
 system and the economy.
Indeed, the most powerful concern driving an insolvency
regime is to ameliorate the systemic negative effects of
unregulated distressed debt. Doing so contributes not only to
a healthier and more stable domestic economy, but also to
greater international competitiveness in an increasingly
global market.
396. The specific context of natural person debtors also
calls for fresh consideration of the impediments to
achieving these goals. Fraud, stigma, and moral hazard
operate in markedly different ways on natural person debtors
with complex lives combining emotion, consumption, and
commerce, as opposed to juridical business entities. Cultural
and historical variations among different nations may call for
divergent responses to these issues, but the context of
natural person insolvency demands careful consideration of
their anticipated effects and of the possibility of mitigating
their negative systemic consequences. Moral hazard and
fraud concerns have been overcome in many existing
insolvency systems, and these concerns need not stand in
the way of legislators hoping to reap benefits for creditors,
debtors and society that characterize modern systems for the
regulation of the insolvency of natural persons.

397. A much more intractable challenge relates not to the
problem of keeping undeserving debtors out of the
insolvency system, but of enticing “honest but unfortunate”
debtors into the insolvency system. Even in well -developed
insolvency regimes, significant numbers of debtors continue
to avoid seeking relief or seek relief far later than would be
optimal for themselves and the other beneficiaries of an
insolvency system. While attitudes about debt and cultural
stigma change slowly, and relatively little can be done to
immediately change such attitudes, policymakers can make
and have made choices to minimize stigma. Reduction of the
stigma associated with insolvency requires p ublic campaigns
of education and awareness, which can correct
misimpressions as to new options for relief. The elimination
of judgmental language in legislation and the repeal or
substantial reduction of historically long lists of punitive
measures, civil disabilities and restrictions following an
insolvency case also have a positive effect and contribute to
a decrease in the stigma associated with seeking relief. The

                             130
enactment of discharges from debt and the liberalization of
property exemption have a similar effect. Over time, these
changes may create incentives for natural person debtors to
seek relief.



  Core Legal Attributes of an Insolvency Regime for Natural
                            Persons

398. The development of a legal regime for the insolvency
of natural persons requires careful consideration of many
issues unique to the context of treating the insolvency of
natural persons, whether or not such debtors are or have
been engaged in commercial activity. It is also necessary to
consider that the system of insolvency of natural persons is
intertwined with the basic rules for consumer and
commercial credit.

399. There are a series of core legal attributes of regimes
designed to deal with the insolvency of natural persons.
These include: the relationship of the insolvency regime with
informal settlement processes; the role of courts, agencies,
and intermediaries; the conditions for access to the
insolvency procedure; and the price –if any - that a debtor
must pay for discharge. This report describes those attributes
and analyzes the consequences of the policy choices involved
in shaping such insolvency regimes.

400. In the design and implementation of an insolvency
regime for natural persons, it is most likely the case that
one size does not fit all. However, there are tangible
advantages and disadvantages in the different solutions to
the numerous practical issues that arise in the design of an
insolvency regime for natural persons, and those aspects
have to be considered and addressed by policymakers.

401. The overall objective is achieving a properly
functioning insolvency regime. In the view of most
policymakers, this means providing relief only to those
debtors in need, and delivering such relief in a brief and not
overly cumbersome procedure.


General Regime Design: Procedural Options and the Relation
                with Informal Workouts



402. An essential aspect of the design of a formal regime
for the treatment of the insolvency of natural persons is its
interaction with informal systems for resolving financial
distress amicably. An important function of a formal

                            131
insolvency system is to encourage informal negotiation and
resolution of situations of personal over -indebtedness.

403. In many countries, lawmakers have prioritized the
prevention of formal insolvency proceedings, in part by
favoring negotiated solutions to debt problems. There are
advantages to negotiated solutions: avoidance of stigma; less
adverse impact on debtors’ credit scores; lower costs relative
to formal insolvency proceedings; better outcomes for
creditors; lower costs of preparatory work; greater flexibility
to serve the needs of the debtor and of the creditors; and
more willingness by financial institutions to renegotiate
loans.

404. While voluntary conciliation between creditors and
debtors is even more desirable in the context of the
insolvency of natural persons, it has also proven to be more
elusive, especially as creditors have frequently shown little
interest in engaging actively and constructively in such
processes. In practice, it is not easy for debtors to reach
voluntary settlements with all their creditors: some creditors
demand enforcement of their claims and make negotiations
impossible. Among these, some public creditors, including
the tax authorities, are generally reluctant to accept
negotiated approaches. Financial institutions may have few
incentives to engage in meaningful restructuring
negotiations because of the effect of regulations imposing
requirements for writing off debts and deducting losses. For
other creditors, passivity is an important issue, as is the
treatment of third -party guarantees in informal debt
settlements. Policymakers have observed repeatedly that
creditor passivity must be addressed by making voluntary
settlements binding on minority and non -participating
creditors, while preserving the possibility that minority
creditors defend their rights in court.

405. The experience in the few systems where informal
alternatives to insolvency have been successful suggests the
importance of several elements that promote plan
confirmation. Professional assistance at low or no cost is
essential; advisors need to have experience in negotiations
with creditors. To achieve maximum effectiveness,
negotiations must proceed without an immediate threat of
enforcement of debt.

406. Any system for treating the insolvency of natural
persons implicates fundamental legal issues affecting the
rights and obligations of creditors and debtors, both in
relation to debtors and their creditors and among creditors
generally. The right to a fair trial and the right to the
protection of property are among the fundamental rights
which are at issue in an insolvency regime of natural persons.
The enforcement of these rights generally falls within the
adjudicative authority of courts.
                             132
               The Institutional Framework

407. A well-functioning institutional framework for the
insolvency of natural persons minimizes overall social costs.
These include error costs incurred in determining the validity
of debts and levels of repayment, and costs to creditors,
debtors and third parties. The institutional framework should
provide for timely outcomes and achieve confidence in its
operation by stakeholders and the general public.

408. In constructing a formal, coercive relief system, the
large numbers and relative homogeneity of cases to be
treated prompt a reconsideration of the appropriate legal -
administrative framework to be applied, especially in terms
of financing that framework. Experience suggests that as
the numbers of individual debtors needing insolvency relief
increases, individual insolvency usually becomes a routinized
process.

409. Policymakers seek several goals in choosing a
particular structure for a system of insolvency for natural
persons. These goals include a similar treatment for
individuals similarly situated, the prevention of fraud and
abuse, and the reduction of unnecessary bureaucratic
requirements.

410. Institutional frameworks of personal insolvency
regimes exist on a continuum. These institutional
frameworks include systems in which an administrative
agency is in charge of the insolvency procedures; hybrid
public/private systems where public insolvency procedures
co-exist with private restructuring alternatives; and court -
based systems primarily serviced by publicly -funded or
private intermediaries.



411. The majority of countries have court-based systems
for personal insolvency and restructuring. However, several
high-income countries have adopted administrative
approaches with courts providing a backdrop for disputed
cases. Intermediaries are also very important in many of
these systems. In several countries, public agencies play a
significant role in sorting, processing, and administering the
insolvency of natural persons. Hybrid public/private models
also exist where the primary actors are private insolvency
practitioners who assess, administer and investigate debtors,
but there is close supervision by a public regulator which
licenses practitioners and may also intervene in the process.
The design of an institutional structure must take into
account the context of existing institutions and the
availability of professional intermediaries in any particular
country.

                            133
           Access to the Formal Insolvency Regime


412. Many individuals have difficulties in financing access
to the insolvency procedure. There are five basic approaches
to financing access to insolvency relief: (1) state funding of
the process; (2) cross -subsidization of low value insolvencies
by higher value estates; (3) state subsidies to professionals
involved in the process and write -off of court costs where
there is an inability to repay; (4) levies on creditors, such as
taxation of distressed debt to fund those cases where
individuals have no ability to pay; and (5) no state support
beyond any general public funding of the court system.
Financing issues can be softened by addressing the expense
side of the system, using summary procedures and
harnessing information technology.


413. The standards for access to individual insolvency and
restructuring procedures should be transparent and certain
and should ensure against improper use by either creditors
or debtors. Open access may be defined as the idea that an
individual who meets an insolvency test such as the inability
to pay debts as they fall due may, without more, gain access
to an insolvency procedure that allows an ultimate discharge
of debts. However, many systems include further
requirements, often to address the problems of moral hazard
and debtor fraud. One method of targeting potential moral
hazard is to limit the frequency of access to insolvency relief.

414. Access criteria may be a combination of rules and
standards. Standards generally require a greater degree of
expertise. High access barriers to the formal system of relief
may result in a large number of individuals being in a state of
“informal insolvency,” which may affect individuals’
incentives to participate in society as productive citizens.
These costs should be balanced against the protection from
moral hazard achieved through such barriers. A distinction
may be drawn between those systems that create high initial
barriers to access based on a debtor’s conduct and those
where individuals may be permitted to enter the system but
may be sanctioned for their conduct. An opportunity for a
creditor or agency to challenge a discharge or otherwise
sanction a debtor provides protection against moral hazard
and adds legitimacy to a system of individual insolvency by
increasing participation by creditors.


415. The questions of access are especially important in
those systems in which there is a variety of options in the
selection of insolvency procedures (“multi-track insolvency
                              134
systems”). The decision to sort debtors into a particular track
may be made by an administrator, or a debtor may have
some choice as to the relevant track. The more complex an
insolvency system is, in terms of distinct and overlapping
procedures, the greater the difficulties facing an over -
indebted individual will be, especially if such individual is in a
vulnerable position. Impartial intermediaries can assist
individuals in making effective choices. In some countries,
access may depend on a legal requirement to consult an
intermediary and obtain advice on alternatives to insolvency.
Other systems use initial screening based on income criteria
to determine the debtor’s choice, and some restrict access to
debt relief to individuals with consumer rather than business
debts.


                  Participation of Creditors

416. In the insolvency of natural persons, creditor
participation does not assume the important role it
normally has in business insolvency. Given the fact that in
insolvency procedures for natural persons very little value is
usually available, usually creditors play little or no role in the
procedure. An especially important difference with business
insolvency is that, in the insolvency of natural persons,
creditors may oppose discharge but the discretion over the
discharge and the confirmation of a payment plan falls under
the authority of the courts or other judicial bodies.



417. Some degree of contractual freedom and creditor
participation continues to play a central role in many
insolvency systems. Most insolvency systems suffer from a
problem of creditor passivity and of creditors’ lack of
information of the debtor’s circumstances and situation. On
the other hand, sometimes, important creditors such as tax
authorities, major banks or debt collection agencies that
have brought a large number of claims, make policy decisions
to oppose all or most categories of insolvency filings by
natural persons. Finally, creditors may also find themselves in
a situation where other motives may affect their ability to
make a rational judgment about the consequences of
insolvency proceedings for the debtor.

418. The submission and verification of creditor claims
have been simplified in many personal insolvency systems.
In response to the challenges that creditor participation
presents, and taking into account the small economic value
of most claims, many systems have simplified the procedure
for submission and verification of claims. In many systems,
the lists of claims provided by debtors are accepted for the

                              135
purposes of the insolvency process,           unless creditors
challenge those lists.


Solutions to the Insolvency Process and Payment of Claims
        Payment through Liquidation of the Estate

419. Maximizing returns for creditors continues to be an
important goal of the insolvency process, but in the context
of natural person debtors, experience has revealed
significant complications in the process of extracting
payment not only from current assets but also from future
income. Most modern personal insolvency systems continue
to take the approach of focusing on the debtor’s assets, at
least initially, with a view to maximizing returns for creditors,
but this traditional focus on assets to be liquidated raises
long -standing concerns about leaving natural person debtors
with a sufficient basis from which to resume their productive
lives.

420. In virtually every system, a public administrator or
trustee of some kind is appointed to assess the scope of the
debtor’s estate and to inventory, collect, and sell the
debtor’s assets (where available) to produce value for
creditors. However, the overwhelming majority of debtors in
every existing system of insolvency for natural persons have
few if any assets of any value that are available for
liquidation and distribution to creditors. Consequently,
several systems have practically abandoned the step of
attempting to liquidate the debtor’s available assets unless
the debtor appears to have substantial assets to warrant the
significant administrative expenses of the inventory and
liquidation process.



421. Exemptions represent another important aspect of
the personal insolvency regime. In fact, exemptions are not
only relevant for insolvency, but for debtor -creditor regimes
in general. The notion of exempting some of the debtor’s
property from liquidation and distribution to creditors is
closely tied to the discharge principle and to the notion of
“fresh start”. The idea is that when debtors receive a
discharge, exit from insolvency, and obtain a “fresh start”,
they should own sufficient property to meet post -insolvency
minimum domestic needs for themselves and their families
and, where necessary, minimum business needs. In some
systems, property exemptions function as an imperfect
alternative to an insolvency relief regime. In these systems,
exemptions have historically played the role of alleviating the
condition of the insolvent debtor, especially in the absence
of a discharge. However, the effects of the exemptions

                              136
themselves are insufficient to provide debtors with a real
opportunity for starting anew.



422. There are primarily three different approaches for
deciding what types of property to exempt from liquidation
and distribution to creditors. The first approach is to set
aside a range of assets with a value up to a specified limit
that the debtor may seek to get exempted from the
insolvency estate. A second approach currently adopted by
many systems modernized the first approach and set out
categories of particular assets (and values for these assets)
that the debtor may seek to get exempted. The burden is on
the debtor to establish an exemption for these assets. The
third approach, also adopted in many systems, is based on a
more general standard: most of the assets from the estate
are exempt, and the burden is on the system administrator
to object to the exemption of valuable domestic or
household assets so that such assets are brought back into
the insolvency estate.



423. Exemptions can also be analyzed in terms of the
assets covered by them. The primary examples are the
family home, automobiles, household furnishings, post -
commencement salaries, retirement plans, and professional
equipment. The approaches to specific assets vary according
to the importance that each of these assets has in a
particular society. Historically, debtors remained slightly
above the poverty line with the level of exempt assets. The
modern trend is to enable debtors to have a true “fresh
start”, and the debate revolves around defining the level of
sufficiency. There are also significant differences in the
efficiency and costs of administration of the exemption
regime.

            Payment through a Payment Plan


424. As the available assets of most natural person debtors
have little value, existing insolvency regimes most
commonly require some contribution from debtors’ future
income in exchange for the benefits offered by the system
(usually a discharge of unpaid debt). Whatever the form and
extent of the relief offered, most systems dealing with the
insolvency of natural persons envision an “earned start”,
rather than a simple “fresh start” with no contribution or
exertion expected of debtors.
425. Expanding the scope of distributable value to
encompass future income raises fundamental issues of
                            137
humanitarian treatment of flesh -and-blood debtors who
must maintain sufficient resources to meet their families’
basic needs. The seemingly simple question of how to
determine fair and reasonable payment expectations,
especially with respect to appropriate baseline expenses and
the duration of payment plans, has proven far more complex
and difficult than anticipated.

426. Indeed, some of the most difficult questions in
natural person insolvency policy arise in the context of
formulating a payment plan. The most difficult questions
concern, in particular the twin issues of how long debtors
should be required to toil for the benefit of their creditors,
and how much debtors should be required to pay during that
period, in other words, how much should debtors retain,
with all “excess” applied to paying off debt. Once the
payment plan is established, an effective insolvency regime
needs to consider the allocation responsibility for monitoring
the debtor’s compliance and the possibility of modifications
to the plan for changed circumstances.

427. The answer to the question of the duration of a
payment plan depends on the desired goals of imposing a
payment plan on debtors in exchange for a promise of
insolvency relief. If the goal is simply to maximize payment
to creditors, a longer term can be selected, but experience
suggests that longer terms actually depress returns and
reduce the attractiveness of insolvency for debtors, and
positive effects overall. A shorter term can pursue the
educational goal of inculcating payment responsibility and
avoiding moral hazard.

428. There is a growing trend towards uniformity in the
duration of payment plans, but there are still substantial
differences in the length of those plans. Those differences
can be linked to social and cultural issues. There is no
uniform answer to the question of the optimal length of time
for a payment plan; all the available options have advantages
and disadvantages. It is necessary to strike a balance
between setting high goals and attainable goals. The
experience in many countries indicates that plans that are
longer than three years produce more failure than success.
Expecting debtors to live longer than three years at a
subsistence level may be unrealistic.

429. Several measures can be pursued to mitigate the
negative effects of longer payment plan terms. These
measures include (1) using a sliding -scale approach, or (2)
imposing a longer repayment term for debtors unable to
make significant contributions, but releasing debtors early as
a reward for making more substantial payments, thus
creating a set of incentives for debtors. On the other hand,
imposing longer repayment terms on chronically destitute
debtors seems rather counterproductive.
                            138
430. The other fundamental issue in payment plans refers
to the determination of an amount to be reserved for the
reasonable support of the debtor and those dependent on
the debtor. A payment plan needs to be based on an
assessment of the income that the debtor is going to
generate during the implementation period of the plan. In
this regard, the two main approaches are to base such
calculations on current income or on projected income.

431. Incentives to the productivity of debtors play a major
role in payment plans. Since one of the main goals of an
insolvency system is to encourage natural person debtors to
be economically productive, the challenge is to create
incentives for the productivity of the debtor, and to avoid the
opposite effect, i.e., debtors deciding not to make significant
efforts to generate income. Both incentives and penalties can
be used to create a positive dynamic in payment plans.
432. Basic expenses of the debtor are a relevant factor that
needs to be accounted for in payment plans. In designing
the regulation of payment plans, policymakers must take into
account that debtors need to be able to retain sufficient
funds to cover at least their basic expenses and those of
their dependents. One of the most significant challenges in
defining a proper reserve budget for debtors is deciding how
best to achieve a fair and equal treatment. The appropriate
measure of sacrifice to be demanded of debtors in exchange
for whatever relief an insolvency system offers is an
inherently political decision. In any case, selecting an optimal
approach to payment plan budgeting is not a simple binary
choice between wide open discretion and rigid, bright -line
rules. A combination of rules and discretionary elements is
desirable and probably also unavoidable.

433. The easiest and most widespread approach to
selecting the basic budgetary standard has been to regard
the insolvency system as an extension of the system of debt
collection, and to use the same rationale as applicable to
income exemptions. A choice of one objective and uniform
standard does not necessary entail a choice of one single
figure to be applied to all debtors in all situations. Instead,
existing systems commonly establish bands of uniformity,
categorizing debtors into groups with various vital
characteristics, and calculate different income exemption
amounts for each of these groups, often with a possibility of
increasing these standard amounts for specific, variable
expenses.

434. One of the most pressing problems is the treatment
of debtors who cannot generate significant disposable
income for the duration of the plan. These debtors,
commonly referred to as “NINAs” (No Income, No Assets),
may have sufficient resources to cover their basic needs, but
they have no extra resources to pass on to creditors.
                             139
Significant numbers of debtors in all insolvency systems for
natural persons today fall into this category. Because these
debtors produce no value for creditors, thus failing to
achieve one of the most salient goals of an insolvency
system, a minority of insolvency systems has practically
excluded them from relief. Other systems avoid this kind of
discrimination and provide the same relief to all debtors,
regardless of their financial means. Reducing the formalities
and expenses of insolvency proceedings may be a useful way
of assisting in the resolution of this problem.

435. The challenges of the insolvency of natural persons
do not end with confirmation of a plan. Debtors who
struggled to budget and distribute proper payments to
creditors before an insolvency procedure commences are
likely to struggle afterward, as well. A plan requires
monitoring tools, and may have to be modified if the
circumstances of the debtor change, especially if the
approach taken by the law is to establish a long rehabilitation
period for debtors.

436. There are approaches that combine liquidations and
payment plans . To advance the primary historical goal of
insolvency systems—enhancing efforts to achieve some
return for creditors—most insolvency regimes for natural
persons today combine two approaches to payment: they
require both (1) a turnover and liquidation of debtors’ non -
exempt assets owned at the time of the commencement of
the procedure and (2) a multi -year payment plan to access
the usually much more significant value in the debtors’
future earning capacity. While there are obvious advantages
to combining the two approaches, proceeding through both
stages in every case has arguably significant disadvantages,
and not all systems force all debtors to proceed through both
methods of value extraction.

437. The basic disadvantage of each approach to value
extraction is waste in terms of the cost of time, money, and
of other thinly spread administrative resources. In many
cases, although these systems do achieve many of the goals
of natural person insolvency for debtors and society,
payment plans do not provide a significant financial return to
creditors. The experience of many systems casts doubts on
the effectiveness of allocating administrative resources to a
process that often produces no direct economic returns for
creditors.

438. Even if payment plans are not especially effective
from a financial point of view, there is a perception that
plans serve important moral and educational purposes.
More than exacting a monetary return for creditors, payment
plans are often regarded as inculcating good payment
morality among debtors. Thus, few existing systems allow

                             140
significant numbers of debtors to receive relief without
passing through liquidation and/or through a payment plan.

                   Payment of Mortgages

439. An important issue affecting insolvent debtors is the
treatment of mortgages. The particular concerns of home
finance pose especially difficult challenges that continue to
elude simple resolution.

440. In many systems, the rights of secured creditors are
either unimpeded or not implicated at all. Most debtors
have few valuable assets that have been used or could be
used as collateral for debts. In cases involving secured claims
in general -and mortgages in particular - creditors have
usually already seized the collateral by the time a debtor files
for insolvency relief, or the system allows this to occur even
after a filing.

441. Mortgages are special in that the collateral is usually
the most valuable personal asset, which also plays an
important and broader social role. Because of its economic
importance, an efficient mortgage regime, including an
efficient regime for the enforcement of secured loans and
mortgages in particular, is a fundamental element in the
financial system of a country.

442. Some countries have followed solutions that respect
both the interests of debtors and the rights of secured
creditors in the insolvency procedure. The starting point has
been that the rights of the secured creditors are protected in
their basic contents, but subjected to some modification in
their enforcement or in other aspects. What kind of
modification is allowed depends on a number of difficult
considerations.

443. Several systems have evolved to balance, for example,
the competing fears of destabilizing the mortgage credit
markets and of displacing significant numbers of debtors
from their homes, especially in light of the negative effects
of mass mortgage foreclosure activity on depressing home
values in times of systemic crisis. These systems are to a
greater or lesser degree designed to compel creditors to
accept the reality of the distressed state of debtors and of
the values of the mortgaged property, to accept the debtors’
realistic payment capacity, and avoid taking rash action to
enforce rights in collateral and create further avoidable
losses. Among the policy measures that have been
implemented, those that have been used more frequently
are the following: moratoria, the introduction of alternative
dispute resolution mechanisms, the reduction of interest
rates, the extension of repayment periods and, eventually,
reductions in the principal of the loans.

                             141
                          Discharge

444. Discharge is one of the most salient characteristics of
modern systems for the regulation of the insolvency of
natural persons. One of the principal purposes of an
insolvency system for natural persons is to re -establish the
debtor’s economic capability, in other words, economic
rehabilitation.

445. Rehabilitation can be said to include three elements:
discharge of debts, non -discrimination, and avoidance of
excessive indebtedness. First, debtors are in most cases
freed from excessive debt. The benefits of the discharge have
been extensively discussed from the point of view of
debtors, creditors and society. Second, effective
rehabilitation is facilitated by treating debtors on an equal
basis with non-debtors after receiving relief, according to the
principle of non -discrimination. Finally, to ensure lasting
relief, debtors should be in a position to avoid excessive
indebtedness in the future, which may require measures to
change debtors’ attitudes concerning proper use of credit.

446. The most effective form of relief from debt is a
straight discharge of debt. A straight discharge provides an
immediate and unconditional “fresh start” for the debtor.
However, most systems continue to reject the notion of a
straight discharge, and, especially, the possibility to be freed
from debt without a payment plan.

447. The principle of non -discrimination is an important
consideration in achieving the full benefits of a discharge,
though existing systems have paid little regard to this
important factor. One of the problems of current credit
information systems is that any insolvency filing is reflected
among other “negative” credit entries, at least for a limited
number of years following conclusion of an insolvency case,
which often gives rise to discrimination against former
natural person debtors who have gone through insolvency
procedures.

448. Existing insolvency systems follow a variety of
approaches in an effort to avoid repeat filings in the event
that debtors become excessively indebted in the future.
Many systems attempt to educate debtors on a healthier and
more responsible use of credit. Some systems conceive the
insolvency of natural persons as a “once in a lifetime”
occurrence. Other systems prohibit a discharged debtor from
initiating insolvency proceedings for a defined period of
time. Changes in debtor attitudes as a result of a debt relief
procedure are very difficult to achieve or measure.
449. The principle of good faith is present in almost all
insolvency laws to avoid the abuse of discharge and prevent
moral hazard and fraud. A central idea of an insolvency
                             142
regime for natural persons is to help unfortunate but honest
debtors. Fraudulent behavior can be punished with denial of
the discharge in all insolvency systems.

450. For the purposes of rehabilitation, it is important that
as many debts as possible are included in the discharge.
However, there are debts that may be excluded from the
discharge due to important social or economic
considerations. The most frequent excepted debts are: child
and spousal support, fines and other sanctions, taxes, and
educational loans. Normally, the discharge does not affect
debts arising after the commencement of the insolvency
proceedings.

451. One of the problems that discharge presents is that
the indebtedness situation very frequently affects not only
the debtor, but also other members of the debtor’s family.
Sometimes family members and others close to the debtor
are drawn into the debtor’s economic crisis because they
have personally guaranteed the loan of the debtor or given
their property as collateral for a loan. Since payment can be
quite easily demanded from the guarantor or from the value
of the collateral if the principal debtor does not pay or is
insolvent, guarantors often face payment claims on the eve
or after the opening of an insolvency procedure. In many
countries, guarantors are left in a difficult position, but there
are signs of a trend towards greater flexibility for the
treatment of guarantors affected by the insolvency of the
principal debtor.
