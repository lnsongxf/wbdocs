This qualitative study reviews the Sunaula Hazar Din (SHD), Community Action for
Nutrition Project (2012–2017) of the Government of Nepal, which has been sup-
ported by the World Bank. The study was jointly undertaken by the World Bank’s
Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice (GHNDR) and the Social, Urban,
Rural, and Resilience Global Practice (GSURR). The study team was led by Kaori
Oshima and Manav Bhattarai, and main authors included Monica Biradavolu and
Chhitij Bashyal.

E. Gail Richardson (Practice Manager, GHNDR South Asia); Rekha Menon (Practice
Manager, GHNDR South Asia); Senait Nigiru Assefa (Practice Manager, GSURR
Global Programs Unit); and Takuya Kamata (Country Manager, Nepal) provided
overall guidance to the study team. Sean Bradley (Lead Social Development Specialist
and head of the CDD Community of Practice) also provided valuable advice to the
study team throughout the process. Jean Voss edited the report, and Jaya Karki, Ade-
laide Barra, and Ajay Ram Dass provided timely and helpful administrative support.
The study was financially supported by the South Asia Food and Nutrition Security
Initiative (SAFANSI), and the team benefitted from continued support provided by
Pauline Zwaans and Jamie Greenawalt.

The study team met and held invaluable discussions with the members of the SHD
Project Management Team of the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Develop-
ment, Government of Nepal. The Oxford Policy Management Nepal team and their
field researchers provided excellent data collection work, led by Suresh Tiwari, Hema
Bhatt, and Dhruba Ghimire.

Executive Summary

Malnutrition remains a serious development challenge in Nepal. The country still
has an alarmingly high rate of child malnutrition with 35.8% of children under five
being stunted, 9.7% being wasted and 27.0% being underweight (Nepal Demographic
and Health Survey. Key Indicators. 2016).1 Reduction in malnutrition is important for
curbing disease and mortality and ensuring proper cognitive development to enhance
economic productivity. The increasing body of evidence points to the importance of
intervening within the “golden 1,000 days,” a period between conception and the
age of two that is considered a “critical window of opportunity” to tackle the key risk
factors of malnutrition that hamper a child’s long-term physical and cognitive devel-
opment. A range of individual-level factors (such as chronic energy deficiency, poor
hygienic practices, early marriage/pregnancy, poor infant and child feeding practices,
etc.) and community-level factors (availability of nutritious food, poor access to safe
drinking water, poor sanitation and hygiene, etc.) are associated with an increased risk
for malnutrition.

Launched in 2012, the Sunaula Hazar Din (SHD)—Community Action for Nutrition Project is
the first project in Nepal that employs an innovative community-driven rapid results
approach (RRA) to tackle both individual- and community-level factors and improve
knowledge, attitudes and practices for improving nutritional outcomes. The project’s
social mobilization and subsequent participatory subproject implementation cycle is
called “Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiative (RRNI),” where each ward in a selected
Village Development Committee (VDC) will commit to a series of nutrition relevant
goals, each to be met within a 100-day period. A ‘coach’ (local facilitator) is assigned
to each VDC to facilitate community-level teams created under the project (called
“RRNI teams”) in achieving their respective goals.

Given that the SHD is one of the first initiatives in Nepal and in the world to imple-
ment the RRA to address malnutrition on a large scale, i.e., across 15 districts of
the country, the implementation team and other stakeholders recognized the impor-
tance of conducting a rigorous evaluation of the SHD. In this context, this in-depth

Introduction

Background and Rationale
Nepal has an alarmingly high rate of child malnutrition with 35.8% of children under
five being stunted, 9.7% being wasted and 27.0% being underweight (Nepal Demo-
graphic and Health Survey, Key Indicators Report, 2016).2 Although there is a declining trend
compared to the rates 5 years ago, these rates are still exceedingly high. For example,
the percentage of stunting children under five is the third highest among 11 countries
in the South-East Asia region, estimated in 2015,3 after Timor-Leste and India, and
followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. The economic costs of malnutri-
tion are very high—an estimated 2–3% of GDP (US$250 to 375 million) is lost every
year in Nepal due to vitamin and mineral deficiencies alone. Improving nutrition con-
tributes to productivity, economic development, and poverty reduction by reducing
disease and mortality, improving physical work capacity, cognitive development, and
school performance. However, the window of opportunity for improving nutrition is
small—it is called the “First 1,000 days,” from the first day of pregnancy through
the first two years of life. The damage to physical growth, brain development, and
human capital formation that occurs during this period due to inadequate nutrition
is extensive and largely irreversible. The main focus in Nepal on improving nutrition,
therefore, is to accelerate the reduction of child malnutrition, and interventions must
focus on the risk factors that influence nutritional outcomes during this critical period.

To reduce child malnutrition, policies and programs have focused on addressing indi-
vidual as well as community-level behaviors or characteristics that are known to be
associated with higher risks for malnutrition. Such individual-level factors include, for
example, early marriage and pregnancy, chronic energy deficiency and anemia, exces-
sive physical workloads, indoor air pollution and smoking, poor hygienic practices,
and related frequent episodes of illnesses such as diarrhea. Infant and young child

Sunaula Hazar Din Project Design
and Implementation Challenges

The Sunaula Hazar Din Project
The Community Action for Nutrition Initiative Project—locally known as “Sunaula
Hazar Din (SHD)”—was a five-year program launched by the Government of Nepal
in 2012. It was implemented by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Develop-
ment (MOFALD) across 15 districts (out of 75 districts) which were selected based on
population, stunting levels, poverty levels and absence of overlapping interventions by
other partners. Within the selected districts, SHD targeted 25% of the most disadvan-
taged Village Development Committees (VDCs), in total approximately 1,100 VDCs.
The project sought to improve practices that contribute to reduced undernutrition of
women of reproductive age and children under the age of two. “Sunaula Hazar Din,”
or in English “Golden first 1,000 days,” refers to the period between conception and
24 months of age, when children are most vulnerable to malnutrition. By improving
knowledge, attitude and practices among 1,000-days women, adolescent women, and
children, the project in the long run would address the key risk factors for child malnu-
trition and create demand for nutrition related services and products. The theory of
change of the SHD project is described in Annex 1.



Community-Driven Rapid
Results Approach
To improve knowledge, attitudes and practices critical for nutritional outcomes, the
SHD project employed an innovative community-driven rapid results approach
(RRA).6 “Community-driven,” because in this approach, participating communities

Study Methodology

Site Selection
The study was conducted in 6 out of the 15 SHD project intervention districts, namely
Sunsari, Udayapur, Sindhuli, Dhanusa, Sarlahi and Makawanpur (see Figure 2).
Across each of the six districts, three different RRNI subprojects were selected jointly
with the Government (Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development) SHD proj-
ect implementation team based on the following criteria:
     a.	“Hill” or “Terai”—ecological belts/terrain: The sampled project dis-
         tricts were to be representative of two ecological belts in Nepal (i.e., Hill and
         Terai), where different topographical and other social characteristics exist,
         which could have strong implications on how communities work together on
         a community-driven rapid results approach, and how household and social
         dynamics operate in the process. In general, communities in Terai (flat plains
         of the south) are more densely populated and have easier access to roads and
         markets compared to the hills—which could affect, for example, frequency of
         meetings among key stakeholders or procurement of materials to achieve a
         specific goal.
     b.	 Project implementation clusters (representation of 3 NSPs): Under
         the project, 15 SHD intervention districts were divided into 3 clusters, con-
         sisting of 5 districts each, supported by a separate “national service provider
         (NSP),” namely a partner nongovernmental organization which followed a
         common implementation framework established by the project. To avoid bias
         caused by only analyzing communities facilitated by a specific NSP, the sam-
         pled districts had to be representative of 3 project implementation clusters (i.e.,
         all three NSPs).
     c.	 Selected focus areas: To allow comparison and a more in-depth analysis,
         the sample projects were chosen from the five most popular focus areas selected
         by the beneficiary communities (out of the 15 focus areas eligible under the
         project) across 15 project intervention districts—though the implementation
         modality (RRNI cycle steps) were common across different focus areas. The
         five selected focus areas were: end open defecation, increase animal protein

Key Findings

A. On the Sunaula Hazar
Din Rapid Results Nutrition
Initiative (RRNI) cycle
a. RRNI Team Selection and Representativeness

The first step in the RRNI cycle was the selection of a nine-member RRNI team by
the members of the Ward Citizen Forum, at a meeting organized and moderated by
the SHD coach.12 The composition of the RRNI team was intended to reflect the eth-
nic, gender, caste, class, and occupational diversity of the ward, and the RRNI team
was tasked with implementing the SHD project.

The data show that there are four different ways that the RRNI team selection process
unfolded on the ground, with varying implications for the implementation rollout. The
four pathways are derived after analyzing data on the following questions: What was
the team selection process? Who participated in the team selection meeting? What cri-
teria were used for member selection? If the respondent did not personally participate
during selection, were they aware of the selection process and criteria? Was the team
representative of the caste, class, religion, gender, and occupational composition of
the village? What were the roles and responsibilities of the team members?

The pathways are outlined below, with illustrative examples. To provide a fuller pic-
ture, each pathway follows the data from team selection to implementation rollout.

The first pathway represents the majority of the wards in the sample, where the team
selection process proceeded as planned. The Ward Citizen Forum (WCF) was involved
in the selection of the RRNI team, the RRNI team members were aware of their spe-
cific roles, and an effort was made to include both genders and the various caste, eth-
nicities, and occupational groups in the wards. Even though beneficiaries were unlikely

 Box 1. Pathway 1—RRNI Team Selection Process Community-Led & RRNI Team
 Representative of Ward Population
 Wards A and B are Hill wards. Both wards followed the RRNI team selection process guideline, involving the WCF and forming a
 team representative of the constituents of the ward.

 Ward A, with 307 households and 1,877 residents was almost twice as large as Ward B, with 145 households and 789 residents.
 Ward A first targeted 75 households, later raising this number to 120. Ward B targeted 40 households. Both wards reported sig-
 nificant implementation challenges due to the difficult terrain, including administrative challenges of opening a bank account that
 took one full day to walk to, the problems of transporting materials for building the hen coops and bringing the chickens and feed,
 as well as distribution challenges which required beneficiaries to walk for hours to collect the eggs.

     “We had to go to Hetauda to open a bank account . . . there were other banks that are more accessible, but it was not allowed. To reach Hetauda,
     we first have to walk 6–7 hours to Lother and then another 2 hours to reach Hetauda . . . you have to return the next day . . .” [Coach, Ward A]

     “Even though we built the hen coops in the middle of the ward, the ward is big, and for some people who live uphill, it can take 1.5 hours, or even
     2 hours if you walk slowly, to come to collect the eggs. Then they have to walk for even longer to go back uphill.” [Coach, Ward B]

 Both wards also reported significant implementation delays. However, the two wards diverged in overall project performance.
 Ward A—despite being the larger ward with a greater target population—received positive reviews from beneficiaries, whereas
 Ward B beneficiaries said that after some time, the number of people who collected eggs dwindled considerably.

 There is one key difference that is important for community-based projects to consider, related to how the two wards handled bud-
 get delays. Ward A relied on the RRNI team members taking personal loans and being repaid once project funds were deposited
 into their bank accounts. In Ward B, the beneficiaries were required to pay Rs 10 a week to receive the eggs, later raised to Rs 50,
 which was justified as necessary to help tide over the financial difficulties of maintaining the hen coop while there were delays in
 project disbursement, and a means of ensuring sustainability of the project. Beneficiaries refused to pay.

      “. . . we first decided to distribute the egg without any charge. If we had continued like that, it would have been better . . . the coach said that if we
     collected money, it would be much easier to sustain the program for a longer duration. . . . so we decided to collect ten rupees every week and again
     later it was increased to 50 rupees. The [beneficiaries] didn’t agree with the increment and so we decided to end the program . . .” [RRNI team
     member]

 A female focus group participant from Ward B said, “in the end, only 3 or 4 were left who took the eggs.” This is not to suggest that how
 they dealt with budget delays is the only difference between the two wards. However, the two wards did take different approaches
 to overcome this obstacle, and there are lessons to be learned from this for future project implementation.

 Box 2a. Pathway 2—Elite Capture
 Ward C, in the Terai region, has 52 households and 270 residents. The ward chose “Reduce Indoor Smoke” as their focus area, and
 the goal was to distribute smokeless stoves. However, respondents were unable to articulate a clear work plan on how beneficiaries
 were selected.

 RRNI team members were unaware about why they were selected:

     “I did not even know about my selection. The Team leader selected me and only she knows the reason.”

     “I am unknown about who selected me . . . If we had gathered I would have known, but they selected me secretly . . . I was not present during the
     selection period, I was busy with my own work.”

 Respondents representing various constituencies in the village spoke openly about elite capture:

     “Nobody knew about SHD. . . . Only after a long time we came to know about its purpose. People who were of higher class and of higher power were
     in the team.” [RRNI team member]

     “In the stove distribution project, even though I am the coordinator [of WCF], they did not tell me anything, nor did I participate in any of the pro-
     grams. I am unknown about who the coach selected.” [WCF member]

     “. . . everything was done by 2–4 individuals who formed a group and did the work.” [Male focus group respondent]

 The consequence of elite capture was that a handful of powerful individuals, and their relatives, received a disproportionate share
 of project benefits. These powerful few gave small monetary incentives to entice the non-powerful RRNI team members to work
 on their behalf, promises which were not kept and that resulted in further social disruption. The villagers viewed the distributed
 goods as having little value.

     “. . . the funds and goods that were received from SHD such as for filter, stove . . . was given to the relatives of the coach and some other powerful people
     . . . their relatives were always there. If others had to be given, then they tried to do it in the least expensive way possible . . . they took any remaining
     money.” [Male focus group respondent]

     “At first they said they would give 300 rupees as allowance for a day but they did not give even 200 rupees. We worked very hard for 10 days but
     they did not give us any money . . . We collected bricks and soil for the construction of the stove. The money had come in the committee but they did
     not give us. Instead they divided it among themselves. . . . They gave only 200 rupees after much quarrels and fights . . .” [RRNI team member]

     “They gave stoves to everyone, and they also had said they would give pipe which emits smoke outside. But they never gave us pipes. They just made
     stove of mud, how will the smoke go out? Even now, the smoke does not go out.” [Female focus group respondent]

 There was change in awareness on the adverse effects of smoke on health, although respondents did not articulate this in terms of
 effects specifically of the SHD project. Respondents did not think the project was sustainable because the goods distributed were
 outmoded.

 Box 2b. Pathway 2—Elite Capture
 Ward D, also in the Terai region, was the largest ward (by population) in the sample, with 342 households and 2,238 residents. The
 ward chose Open Defecation Free (ODF). This was a Muslim-majority ward.

 There was no community buy-in when SHD was launched, and the WCF was unaware of the team selection process. Two or three
 RRNI team members were in complete control of the project, while others were “in name only.” Unlike the case of Ward A above,
 the coach, being new, was not part of the powerful. The coach was hired in a rush, was not given training, and had to learn on the
 job.

 The work plan was to construct 20 toilets, but respondents were unsure on what basis the 20 were selected. There were arguments
 and fights about receiving project benefits, including physical fights. In the end, it is unclear whether the stated plan was conducted
 systematically. Beneficiaries felt that those who raised their voices in objection got more benefits, and it was not the neediest who
 ultimately benefitted the most. None of the focus group respondents thought that the desired results were achieved.

     “. . . 15 lakhs were allocated for our whole VDC . . . When we surveyed all 9 wards, in total no more than 7–8 lakhs worth of work has been done,
     that is what we felt. This is because some households only received 4 rings, and those who raised voices got 5 and those who forced more got 6, those who
     didn’t speak at all got 3 . . . there was no differentiation between rich and poor . . . the neediest didn’t get . . .” [Male focus group respondents]


 Box 3. Pathway 3—Benign Capture
 Ward E, in the Terai region, has 135 households and 739 residents. The ward chose ODF as their focus area and built toilets. Like
 Pathway 2, the selection process was done by the coach in a non-transparent manner, there was lack of representation on the team,
 and the implementation was in the hands of a few powerful people.

     “No meeting was called to select the team. . . . Suddenly, the coach arrived in the WCF meeting and told us that she had a program named SHD and she
     needed to select people from different wards. She selected all 9 members . . . There was no rule and regulation for selection. . . .” [RRNI team leader]

     “I was not present during the meeting; I was out of the village. When I returned, they had already written my name. . . . [RRNI team member]

 Furthermore, three respondents—all RRNI members—said they were members “in name only,” and others more powerful than
 them made key decisions.

     We didn’t attend every meeting as we were not called during important ones. I heard that meetings were held only with three or four important people.”

     “They only used to ask me to sign the documents. I rarely attended the meetings. I don’t know much.”

     “I was a member in name only. They never gave me any responsibility.”

 On whether all castes were represented, respondents thought that certain castes had been left out, and named the castes that they
 felt should have been included.

     “. . . some people who should have been on the team were left out. There were people from Bheriyar and Dhanuk caste in the team. We have other castes
     in our ward, however they were not present during the WCF meeting . . . if they had informed us earlier, we would have included Hajam and Sharma.

 However, unlike in Pathway 2, the elite in this case developed a clear work plan, listed targeted households, and convinced ward
 residents about the rationale for the targets when complaints of being left out arose among non-beneficiaries. The RRNI completed
 the work outlined in their work plan. The coach (and the handful involved in the project) were not viewed as only working for theirs,
 and their relatives’, personal benefit.

 The project targeted 23 households that were in a weak financial position, and had pregnant women and/or children under the
 age of two years. They were provided 3 rings and a seat, with the expectation that the households would themselves construct a
 door, walls and a roof. Those not included as beneficiaries protested, but were told that they had the financial capability to build
 on their own.

     “At the individual level as an RRNI member, we were all facing the same problem, so we decided to go in a group and explained to ward residents that
     pregnant women, those families who had children less than two years old, and those who could not afford, are the focus of this program and they will
     be helped. We explained our priorities and suggested to them to build a toilet by themselves as they are financially capable. Villagers were convinced.”
     [RRNI team member]

 While some community members perceived that more toilets could have been constructed with the available funds, there was gen-
 eral agreement across all respondents—both in interviews and focus groups—that the project had brought changes in knowledge
 (about the benefits of not defecating in the open), as well as changes in practice (fewer people are openly defecating and people have
 started to use soap and water as well). There have also been unexpected changes:

     “I did not expect that the non-beneficiaries would also make toilets. I had thought that if the project would make toilets, they would destroy them, but
     instead they began to make their own. They had a conservative thought that toilets were made in the cities, and villages do not need them. But now I
     can see this has changed. People have learned that it is good to build a toilet and it is for their daughters’ and daughters-in-laws’ safety and the health
     of their children. I never expected this would happen.” [RRNI team member]

 Ward F is the smallest ward (by population) in the sample—with 39 households and 159 residents. It is difficult to find enough
 people to participate in development programs.

 RRNI team members in this ward were uninformed about their selection into the teams.

      “I don’t know who was there during the team formation. I stayed at home. My children, i.e., sons and daughter went there in the gathering and wrote

 Ward members who had reluctantly given their names as members found that they had to personally incur financial costs for SHD
 project work, which resulted in reinforcing their belief that such projects were not for the benefit of the villagers, but only meant to
 enrich the more powerful VDC and DDC officials.

 To complete a piece of work for the SHD project, three RRNI members went to the district headquarters, a return trip that took
 several days. They were given 3,000 rupees each from the project for their lodging, transport, food, etc. The work kept getting
 delayed because the DDC administrators were not available, and they were forced to stay for 15 days. They ran out of their allo-
 cated money and had to pay out-of-pocket. Such experiences added to the frustration and anger felt by the villagers.

      “Such projects are only a playground for DDC and VDC officials to make money in the name of development by fooling locals . . .”

Emerging Lessons and Conclusion
While good practices and outcomes were observed in some wards, our data overall
revealed multiple challenges that the SHD participating wards faced. It provides a
good base to understand whether the 100-day rapid results approach was effective
in the given context, and whether the community-driven model was adequately sup-
ported by the project to achieve its development objective. This section summarizes
emerging lessons learned from the data analysis, and offers concluding remarks.


Summary of emerging lessons from the key findings
Selection of community-based team members. When the initial ward citizen’s
forum failed to gather a large number of participants, or provide sufficient orientation
on the project in an inclusive and transparent manner, a small group of individuals
dominated the decision-making step, and the subsequent procedures were also con-
trolled only by them. When such a capture happened at the beginning of the cycle, it
was hard to be reversed, and other community members did not have a sense of own-
ership or being included until the end. For the community’s decision-making process
to be effective, it is critical to have a clear set of rules and requirements, and to widely
and clearly communicate them up front. For example, the minimum number of par-
ticipants, or clear voting procedures that must be followed—and the decision would be
considered invalid unless those conditions were met—would be useful. In some cases,
although not fully “community driven,” resource allocation and results of the RRNI
project were positively received by the community when a small group of members
developed a clear work plan and budget, and implemented the subproject accordingly.

Forming the RRNI team. Requiring nine members to form the project-specific
RRNI team which would be dissolved after each 100-day cycle was a serious chal-
lenge for the ward members, especially in areas with a spread-out population where
ward members were already overstretched due to other such programs and their daily
work. In many sample wards, members were “selected” without even being informed
(hence without agreement), resulting in confusion and inefficiency. It indicates that
in the designing phase, the SHD project did not sufficiently assess the feasibility and
effectiveness of the RRNI team model in the target areas. A mapping exercise of
