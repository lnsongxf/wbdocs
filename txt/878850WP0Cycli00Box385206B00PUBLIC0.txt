Abstract:

The 2008–09 global economic crisis has shown that no country is immune to external challenges.
When policy controls are missing or not used efficiently, crises can reverse progress even in
advanced economies. This unexpected outcome has increased concerns about the ability of
governments in developing countries to manage downturns. The question is whether current and
future crises will reinforce the procyclical responses or whether these governments will be able
to escape the procyclical trap. In the fiscal domain, countercyclical trends in developing
countries are promising. Over the last decade, about a third of the developing world has been
able to escape the procyclicality trap. Yet, little is known about the evidence on the cyclical
patterns of government health spending.

This descriptive analysis, which covers 183 countries between 1995 and 2010, provides
empirical evidence on the cyclicality of government health expenditures, using panel data from a
global macro database, the Fiscal Health Database. The objective is to propose user-friendly
diagnostic approaches in this area that can be easily replicated and updated to inform technical
discussions and policy making. Our findings are as follows:

First, applying various descriptive methods and diagnostic modeling, in health expenditures we
have no robust evidence to claim that developing countries have been escaping the procyclical
trap across the periods 1995–2002 and 2003–10. This is in contrast with the improvement in
countercyclical fiscal responses witnessed in developing countries. While there are developing
countries that engage in countercyclical government health spending, the evidence on increased
countercyclical behavior is only robust in the upper-middle-income group. Further, although
government health expenditure patterns during downturns are more predominantly
countercyclical for high-income countries, the 2008–09 economic crisis has shown that advanced
economies with robust social safety nets can fall back into procyclical responses, especially if the
crisis is deep and protracted. Second, we find that cyclicality patterns are more nuanced in the
by-country descriptive analyses and, hence, event and case study approaches would be valuable
in shedding more light on the drivers of patterns and changes over time. Third, consistent with


                                                iii
earlier findings regarding the asymmetry of cyclicality, at the global and aggregate level we have
weak evidence that cyclical responses during “bad” and “good” times differ. Countercyclical
responses are more likely during deep negative output gaps. Fourth, results from radar plot
analysis imply that there are a number of dimensions that can help in understanding the variation
in country performance in cyclical responses. Fifth, from diagnostic regressions we conclude that
the impact of business cycles is larger in developing countries than in advanced economies, and
that the fiscal pathway is critical in determining government health expenditures. This means that
although economic growth trajectories do matter, fiscal response from governments can
outweigh or at least attenuate income effects. There are three notable macro effects that make
countries more vulnerable in terms of government health expenditures: deterioration in terms of
trade, deterioration of debt-to-GDP ratios for all income groups, and unpredictable official
development assistance in developing countries. Apart from the macrofiscal dimensions,
research should drill deeper into social sensitivity and preferences, political economy, and
governance to understand their effects on cyclical behavior. Finally, we noted the
methodological limitations of descriptive and diagnostic linear modeling approaches and
concluded that advanced multivariate panel data analysis is essential in understanding the role
and weight of the various dimensions in shaping cyclical responses.

 I. INTRODUCTION: GLOBAL PATTERNS OF CYCLICAL RESPONSES
         DURING THE 2008–09 GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
                  1.1. THE EFFECT OF THE CRISIS ON CYCLICAL RESPONSES IN ADVANCED AND
                                                DEVELOPING ECONOMIES

The recent global economic crisis, which started as early as 2007, has shown that no country is
immune to external challenges. When policy controls are missing or not used efficiently, crises
can reverse progress and positive performance even in advanced economies with a AAA rating.
This crisis has been unique. It emanated from advanced economies and led to prolonged
stagnation and, in some cases, contraction. The depth and length of the crisis have led to fiscal
turbulence that affected health sectors across a number of developed countries, requiring
strategic consolidation 1 and efficiency gains to fit the declining health sector budget.

When the crisis hit, it was expected that Europe, a relatively stable and economically robust
region, would have the means and tools to tackle the downturn. However, many countries did not
cope well (Hou et al. 2013). In the hardest hit countries and in countries where preparedness was
low, deteriorating fiscal positions have resulted in reduced fiscal space for health and, hence,
procyclical policy responses (Heller 2013; Hou et al. 2013; WHO 2013). Such fallback into a
procyclical policy-making mode has raised concerns because, in principle, fiscal policy should
avoid sudden and excessive cuts in health budgets, especially at times when population health
needs and demand for health care rapidly increase. When demand for services increases,
population coverage — particularly for essential care and vulnerable groups — should not
decline. Therefore, countercyclical spending during crises is critical to protecting population
health and mitigating ill-health–related household financial risk. Yet, in a number of countries,
obligations to meet short-term fiscal targets have been compromising the government’s ability to
afford countercyclical responses in health.

This unexpected outcome — that advanced economies have been seriously challenged by the
crisis — has increased concerns about the ability of governments and health sectors in low- and
middle-income countries to manage the current crisis and prepare for future economic
downturns. Will crises reinforce the procyclical responses in developing countries or will they be
able to cope better and escape the procyclical trap?

In sharp contrast with the literature that covers cyclical patterns of fiscal policy prior to the
global economic crisis, evidence is now emerging that developing countries can graduate from
procyclicality. For example, the Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa (IMF
2009), which focuses on the risk and opportunities presented by the global economic crisis,
highlights some new perspectives:

          … After nearly a decade of strong economic performance, the GEC [global economic
          crisis] has slashed the exports of many sub-Saharan African countries and disrupted
          capital flows. Oil exporters and middle-income countries have been particularly hard hit;

Notes

1. High overall tax ratios in Europe put pressure for fiscal austerity on the need for spending cutbacks (Heller 2013).


                                                                 1
         low-income countries somewhat less so. Nevertheless, relatively prudent policies during
         the upswing have provided space for domestic economies to absorb some of the shocks,
         supported on occasion by specific countercyclical measures.

However, the report cautions that countercyclical fiscal policy in Sub-Saharan Africa in the past
has achieved mixed results, so increasing its effectiveness will depend on reinforcing automatic
stabilizers, enhancing fiscal institutions, relaxing financing constraints, and improving data and
analytical capacity.

Still in this regional context, Brahmbhatt and Canuto (2012) summarize that in most African
low-income countries (LICs), where automatic fiscal stabilizers are limited, the principal fiscal
impact of the crisis was a drop in government revenue. Governments had a number of fiscal
policy options 2 available: adjustment, accommodation, and stimulus. The bulk of countries
undertook full or partial accommodation of revenue declines, and — defying priors — some
even undertook countercyclical stimulus. Only a small number undertook full adjustment in the
face of revenue declines. The more fiscal space a country had built up before the crisis, the less it
had to undertake full adjustment and the more options it had to accommodate the revenue shock
or even undertake stimulus.

In the global context, Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin (2011) show that over the last decade about a
third of the developing world has been able to escape the procyclicality trap and actually become
countercyclical. They trace this critical shift in social policy to the quality of institutions.

These countercyclical trends in the fiscal domain of developing countries are promising. Little is
known, however, about the evidence on the cyclical patterns of social — and more specifically,
government — health spending.

       1.2. COUNTERCYCLICAL POLICIES ARE GOOD, BUT WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE ON THE
                        CYCLICALITY OF SOCIAL EXPENDITURES?

Countercyclical government spending has been found to be essential in fostering long-term
economic and human development objectives (Brahmbhatt and Canuto 2012; Braun and Di
Gresia 2003; Darby and Melitz 2008; Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2010). Indeed, standard
neoclassical and Keynesian theories suggest that fiscal policy should be countercyclical, with
fiscal deficits declining when the economy is expanding and increasing during downturns
(Akitoby et al. 2004).

One component of countercyclical fiscal policy is countercyclical social policy, which includes
unemployment benefits and other social transfers, as well as public expenditures on health and
education (Darby and Melitz 2008; Del Granado, Gupta, and Hajdenberg 2013; Doytch, Hu, and
Mendoza 2010; Thornton 2008). Because procyclical behavior amplifies economic fluctuations
— with adverse effects on government revenues, poverty levels, long-term growth, and human
capital formation (Thornton 2008) — the issue of undertaking social policies as part of the
countercyclical response to crises has become urgent in the context of the recent global economic
slowdown and food price volatility (Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2010).

2. Adjustment is defined as a cut in spending in response to the revenue drop; accommodation is defined as maintaining
spending unchanged; and stimulus is defined as increasing spending notwithstanding the revenue decline.


                                                          2
Despite these principles, evidence shows that in low- and lower-middle-income countries
protecting and maintaining public investments in health has not necessarily been the norm
(Abbas and Hiemenz 2011; Brahmbhatt and Canuto 2012; Del Granado, Gupta, and Hajdenberg
2013; Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2010; Lewis and Verhoeven 2010). Although Lewis and
Verhoeven (2010) conclude that countercyclical spending has taken root, and countries are
(temporarily) expanding safety nets, this improvement is not uniform within regions or income
groups and, hence, there is space for improvement.

It has been a vexing question for experts and policy makers, especially in developing and
emerging country contexts, to understand what the binding constraints are to attaining
countercyclical policy making and, consequently, what policy options are available to break
procyclical fiscal and social spending reflexes.

Notwithstanding the increased drive to understand the nature and drivers of social sector
responses to economic cycles and the trend of cyclical responses over time, the empirical
evidence on the relationship between business cycles and government expenditures on health is
very thin. There are only a handful of papers that explore the relationship between business
cycles and social spending, and only the most recent ones have global coverage to allow for
comparison across regions and income groups. From this already thin set, only a few specifically
discuss the relationship between business cycles and health spending (Del Granado, Gupta, and
Hajdenberg 2013; Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2010).


                           II. OBJECTIVES OF THE PAPER
In light of the described evidence gap, this paper proposes to contribute to the empirical literature
on business cycles and their effect on the cyclicality of government expenditures on health.

In terms of policy relevance, Lewis and Verhoeven (2010) highlight the importance of research
— echoed by others (WHO 2009) — to inform the design of social programs and sector policies
that aim to reduce vulnerability to crises. For example, at the high-level consultations on “The
Financial Crisis and Global Health” organized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the
Director General suggested three objectives for the development community in this area (WHO
2009): (a) building awareness of the ways in which an economic downturn may affect health
spending, health services, health-seeking behavior, and health outcomes; (b) making the case for
sustaining investments in health; and (c) identifying actions — including monitoring of early
warning signs — that can help mitigate the negative impact of economic downturns. This
research focuses on the financing aspect of the first objective — building awareness of the effect
of downturns on government health expenditures.

The main contribution of this primarily descriptive analysis is the empirical evidence on fiscal
and health sector cyclicality using panel data from the newly constructed “Fiscal Health
Database” (World Bank 2012), which covers 183 countries and 16 consecutive years between
1995 and 2010. Compared to relevant empirical papers (for example, Braun and Di Gresia 2003;
Del Granado, Gupta, and Hajdenberg 2013; Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2010), this analysis adds
recent data points and also expands the analytical sample to provide as global an overview as the
data sources allow.


                                                 3
We explore how business cycles — via the intermediary link of fiscal transmissions — affect
government expenditures on health. The investigation includes (a) country-specific, income-
group-based, and regional trend analyses of macro performance, fiscal responses, and changes in
government health expenditures for the study period 1995–2010; (b) differences in these
indicators and their bivariate correlations between their cyclical components across two time
windows (1995–2002 and 2003–10); and (c) diagnostic analyses to identify control variables for
future econometric modeling, such as testing the role of institutional strength and political and
economic risk on cyclical behavior.

The analysis is designed to provide benchmarks for countries regarding their cyclical
performance over time and in comparison to their regional and income group peers. Given the
macro nature of the data that this analysis draws on, the paper is most useful for assessing
aggregate changes at the global, regional, and income group levels and to draw attention to good
and bad performers relative to their past performance or the defined group benchmarks.

While the paper will provide insights on the relationship between business cycles and general
government and government health sector expenditures, it does not aim to discuss in depth the
observed policy responses and mitigation strategies, or offer options and solutions to how
specifically governments can move from procyclical to more countercyclical policies. Specific
policy formulation and tailored options would require either country-level event analysis or more
disaggregated data at higher frequencies.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. To guide the empirical analysis, section 3 provides
a review of the literature on the intersection of business cycles and the cyclicality of fiscal and
social policies. Given the focus of the empirical analysis, section 4 offers definitions for business
cycle and pro- and countercyclical policies, and discusses crisis typology. Section 5 outlines a
schematic framework that guides the analysis. Sections 6 and 7 provide background for the
empirical work, with a discussion of the data and the empirical methodology to be applied.
Section 8 discusses the empirical results, including descriptive statistics and diagnostic modeling
results from analytical work carried out using panel data from the “Fiscal Health Database.” This
empirical section includes exploration of global, regional, and income-group–based patterns of
cyclical responses, and uses regional and country-specific illustrations to discuss findings and
limitations. Section 9 concludes with, among other things, a discussion on the study’s limitations
and thoughts on the policy and research agendas that lie ahead.

The overarching goal of the paper is to help policy makers and practitioners better understand the
relationship between business cycles and fiscal and health sector policy making, particularly, by
isolating whether the policy intervention should be targeting constraints in general fiscal policy
or whether it is sufficient to enter at the level of health sector policy making to address
population-level health risks. It is hoped that this global-level analysis will trigger more region-
or country-specific investigations that rely on more disaggregated data and, thus, can better
inform policy responses.

                           3.1. WHY IS COUNTERCYCLICAL POLICY IMPORTANT?

As has been established, as economic crises threaten the growth potential, poverty reduction, and
human capital investment efforts of countries, designing effective shock mitigation policies and
ensuring their implementation are critical to equitable growth. In the face of crises,
countercyclical government spending (see definition in section 4) — including on social sectors
(Darby and Melitz 2008; Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2010; Del Granado, Gupta, and Hajdenberg
2013; Thornton 2008) — has been found to be essential in fostering long-term economic and
human development objectives (Braun and Di Gresia 2003; Brahmbhatt and Canuto 2012; Darby
and Melitz 2008; Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2010).

However, evidence shows that, especially in developing countries, 3 several factors might lead to
procyclical responses of fiscal policy to the business cycle (Akitoby et al. 2004; Braun 2001;
Gavin and Perotti 1997). Among these, the most cited drivers of procyclical policy are political
economy and constraints to accessing credit markets (Akitoby et al. 2004; Calderon and
Schmidt-Hebbel 2008; Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2010; Thornton 2008). The consequence of
procyclical behavior is that rather than mitigating economic fluctuations, they amplify them, with
adverse effect on government revenues, poverty levels, long-term growth, and human capital
formation (Thornton 2008).

Because of this vicious circle of procyclical fiscal behavior, procyclical social spending, and the
consequent reduced potential for long-term equitable growth, a growing body of evidence is
emerging on the importance of effective fiscal and social policies, including strategic
documents 4 that focus on risk management to leverage countries’ development potential. For
example, the World Bank’s social sector strategy emphasizes that at a macroeconomic level,
well-functioning social protection programs are central to growth-promoting reforms (World
Bank 2012) and supports this with a quote by the Growth Commission (2008): “…if
governments cannot provide much social protection, they may have to tread more carefully with
their [growth-promoting] economic reforms.” 5

To understand the difference between theory and practice, this section reviews the empirical
evidence on cyclical responses. The remainder of the section discusses the evidence on the
cyclicality of social expenditures, with a focus on the relationship between business cycles and
government spending on health; it broadens the scope of, and summarizes the evidence on, the
cyclicality of fiscal policy.

             3.2. COUNTERCYCLICAL SOCIAL EXPENDITURES – MYTH OR REALITY?

Socially sensitive development voices say that the challenge facing the world now, since the
global crisis, is to prevent an economic crisis from becoming a social and health crisis. The
challenges in some of the crisis countries have become dual: meeting cost containment
objectives while ensuring that commitments to universal health coverage and population health
targets are not falling behind.

A common challenge for development has been that social outlays and fiscal contractions happen
in concert during crises (Alderman and Haque 2006), straining the ability of governments to
operate critical programs, let alone expand them when the number of vulnerable populations
increases.

What is the evidence at the global level to date? Have governments been doing enough to
mitigate crisis effects? To what extent have they been engaging in countercyclical social
policies?

The literature has been thin in the area of business cycles and social policy
responses, especially with respect to public expenditure responses to business cycle fluctuations.
While investigations are far from exhaustive and conclusive, they are consistent on the income
gradient, specifically, on the general procyclical tendencies in low-income countries. There is
also evidence that the political and governance contexts are important determinants of cyclical
dynamics. However, there is conflicting evidence on cyclical responses in the lower- and upper-
middle-income groups. Papers also differ in their broad conclusions as to the policy options that
could help countries break the procyclical patterns.

To offer a few examples, following the crises that hit Latin America in the early 2000s, Braun
and Di Gresia (2003) analyzed the importance of countercyclical fiscal policy to effective social
insurance. They contrast the cyclicality of social expenditures in Latin America and the
Caribbean with that in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
countries. Examining the period prior to 2003, they find that although social spending as a
percentage of total spending tends to increase during crises, the depth of fiscal adjustment in bad
times results in a decline in real social spending. This implies that, during the time under review,
the effectiveness of compensatory social policies designed to protect those vulnerable to crises
was constrained by adjustments during recessions. Given that the binding constraints to prudent
countercyclical social policy were found to be largely fiscal and political in nature, in their
discussion they focus on policy choices including fiscal stabilization, numerical fiscal rules, and
increases in the proportion of automatic stabilizers to total spending. They argue in favor of
integrated policy proposals based on more country-specific analysis.

In a paper on the impact of the 2008–09 financial crisis, Lewis and Verhoeven (2010) find that
crises have a strong effect on government and household spending, but effects are highly
variable depending on the severity of the downturn and the cyclicality of government spending.
Countercyclical spending is positively related to income. As countries become richer, they are
more protective toward social spending. It is the lowest-income countries, however, that are most
likely to curtail spending in a crisis. Comparing sectoral outlays, they find that during crises,
health expenditures suffer more compared to education spending. Although the authors conclude


                                                 6
that countercyclical spending has taken root, and countries are (temporarily) expanding safety
nets (for example, by borrowing to protect social sector spending and redirecting fiscal resources
to retain social services), this improvement is not uniform within regions or income groups, and
hence, there is space for improvement.

Other papers 6 that discuss social policies in the context of cyclical fluctuations fall into the batch
that was catalyzed by the 2008–09 global economic crisis. Among these, two studies apply cross-
country regressions to substantiate their case — an analysis of the relationship among social
spending, fiscal space, and governance across 100 countries by Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza
(2010); and a paper by Del Granado, Gupta, and Hajdenberg (2013) that focuses on the
procyclicality of social spending in developing countries.

Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza (2010) analyze the cyclicality of social spending using data for about
100 industrial and developing countries between 1980 and 2008. They examine the empirical
link between indicators of the business cycle (that is, the output gap and economic growth) and
social spending with a focus on education and health. The empirical results suggest that public
education spending appears acyclical, and health spending procyclical, in middle-income
countries. This pattern appears reversed in low-income countries. High-income countries appear
to have acyclical 7 or countercyclical public education and health spending. The authors conclude
that the challenge for developing-country policy makers is to manage and channel the necessary
spending and investments in the social sectors in a much more effective way over the business
cycle, which will require a combination of policy and institutional innovations at the national
level, and innovative financing mechanisms at the international level.

Del Granado, Gupta, and Hajdenberg (2013) study the cyclical behavior of public spending on
health and education in 145 countries during 1987–2007. They find that spending on education
and health is acyclical in developed countries and procyclical in developing countries, and that
the degree of cyclicality is higher the lower the level of economic development. Their regression
results also show that education and health expenditures follow an asymmetric pattern in
developing countries; they are procyclical during “good” times (periods of positive output gap)
and acyclical during “bad” times (periods of negative output gap). Thus, their results do not
support the view that the growth of real outlays on health and education fall during negative
output gap. They infer that the absence of cyclicality in social spending during bad times could
be the result of discretionary policy to protect these outlays, or could be attributable to formal
institutions and safeguards.

vulnerability to crises by Velenyi, Yazbeck, and Smitz (2013). Among others, this paper provides references to work on crises

studies on the impact of the financial crises on health sector reform in Europe, including impact on some of the most battered
countries of the European Union in terms of fiscal and macro effects, Italy (Ferre, Cuccurullo, and Lega 2012; de Belvis et al.
2012), Portugal (Barros 2012), and Spain (Gené-Badia et al. 2012).

                         3.3. CYCLICALITY OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES

All papers that explore the cyclicality of social expenditures discuss, to different degrees, the role
of underlying fiscal policies. Hence, we cannot ignore this aspect, because some of the findings
are relevant for the analytical framework and policy implications (see example from Latin
America in box 1.1).

 Box 1.1 Fiscal Adjustment Constraints to Countercyclical Social Spending during Downturns in
 Latin America

 In the context of Latin America, Braun and Di Gresia (2003) conclude that, for the period prior to 2003,
 procyclical behavior in health was not necessarily the result of lack of interest and prioritization, but that
 fiscal constraints could have bound health sector responses. Such a finding could lead to policy
 implications in that if health sector spending is to be better preserved during crises, policy makers could
 focus on the indirect channel — that is, on improving fiscal policy, transparency, and governance to
 enable more countercyclical health policy responses.

 A number of authors have investigated why fiscal policy was, and in certain cases still is, procyclical in
 Latin America. The “1997 Economic and Social Progress Report” (IDB 1997) presented evidence that
 fiscal policy was particularly procyclical in Latin America.

 First, responses were more procyclical because Latin American governments had a smaller proportion of
 automatic stabilizers, such as unemployment insurance, in their mix. Second, discretionary responses
 were more procyclical because volatility, political constraints, and weak institutions made saving
 difficult during good times (Gavin et al. 1996; Gavin and Perotti 1997; Talvi and Végh 2000; Lane and
 Tornell 1999). Third, limited creditworthiness made borrowing during recessions close to impossible.
 Consequently, governments that were unable to save during good times were forced to adjust spending.
 In fact, targeted social spending was often the victim of cuts, due to the rigidity of other budget items
 such as public sector wages, pensions, and debt payments.

To better understand the implications of fiscal policy on health sector responses and whether
these underlying forces could be the binding constraints for social policy making, we have
reviewed the literature that focuses on business cycles and fiscal policies with a special interest
in the dynamics between these in developing countries. The evidence so far is inconclusive and
evolving. Papers prior to the current global economic crisis largely conclude that countercyclical
behavior is characteristic of advanced economies. The literature following the global economic
crisis, however, provides evidence on “graduation” from procyclicality in developing countries
and “fallback” by more advanced economies.

Compared to the vast literature on the determinants of economic growth, there has been less
research on the cyclical behavior of macroeconomic aggregates and the cyclicality of fiscal
policies in developing countries (Akitoby et al. 2004). One reason for this is the relatively weak




                                                      8
quality of data and low data frequency in many developing countries. 8 Despite the data
challenges, the evidence base has been slowly growing. This strand is comparatively richer than
the evidence base on the cyclicality of social expenditures.

3.3.1. Evidence on the cyclicality of fiscal policy prior to the global economic crisis

In general, there is a consensus across the papers prior to the global economic crisis that fiscal
policy in developing countries is procyclical, in contrast with high-income countries, where it is
countercyclical. A number of papers emphasize the role of institutions as determinants of
cyclical responses. Some highlights from the literature prior to the global economic crisis, below,
illustrate these statements.

Drawing on a data set of 51 developing countries, Akitoby et al. (2012) examine the short- and
long-term behavior of government spending with respect to output using an error-correction
model. They find that the main components of government spending are procyclical in about half
of the countries, the degree of which varies across spending categories. In another study, to
explore the nature and drivers of procyclical fiscal policy in Africa, Thornton (2008) carries out a
time series regression for 37 low-income African countries during 1960–2004. His results show
that government consumption is highly procyclical, with consumption responding more than
proportionately to fluctuations in output in many cases. Cross-country specifications suggest that
government consumption is more procyclical in countries that are more reliant on foreign aid
inflows, and less procyclical in countries that are more democratic. In an effort to understand
whether procyclical fiscal policy in developing countries is truth or fiction, Ilzetzki and Végh
(2008) set out to settle the issue of causality. They build a quarterly data set for 49 countries
covering 1960–2006, and subject the data to a battery of econometric tests (for example,
instrumental variables, simultaneous equations, and time-series methods). They find
overwhelming evidence to support the conventional wisdom that procyclical fiscal policy in
developing countries is in fact truth and not fiction.

A number of authors exploring this area refer to the importance of political and institutional
context as potential determinants of cyclical responses. Using a global data set that spans 1970 to
2005, Calderon and Schmidt-Hebbel (2008) empirically evaluate whether the ability of countries
to conduct countercyclical fiscal policy is affected by the quality of their institutions, by the
availability of financial resources, or by both. Their evaluation yields a nuanced interpretation to
the existing evidence regarding the (relative) role of institutions and access to financial markets.
Their findings corroborate earlier evidence that countries are unable to conduct countercyclical
fiscal policies if they have poor institutions or lack wide access to credit markets at home and
abroad. In addition, they provide evidence that institutional factors have a larger weight than
financial variables in explaining the differences in cyclical behavior of fiscal policy between
industrial and developing countries.



8. For example, Akitoby et al. (2012) note as limitations that quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) data are available for only
a limited number of countries, and even when they are available, they are usually of significantly lower quality and reliability
than annual estimates. Another constraining factor is that developing countries often experience abrupt economic changes,
making it particularly difficult to separate cyclical influences from structural breaks. A number of papers discussed data
comparability and quality issues as a challenge (for example, Del Granado et al. 2012; Doytch et al. 2010).


                                                               9
3.3.2. Evidence on the cyclicality of fiscal policy following the global economic crisis

As stated in the introduction, in sharp contrast with the literature that covers cyclical patterns of
fiscal policy prior to the global economic crisis, evidence is emerging that developing countries
can graduate from procyclicality.

In Africa, the good news is that “relatively prudent policies during the upswing have provided
space for domestic economies to absorb some of the shocks, supported on occasion by specific
countercyclical measures” (IMF 2009). Brahmbhatt and Canuto (2012) also provide evidence in
an overview paper that in most African low-income countries, where automatic fiscal stabilizers
are limited, the principal fiscal impact of the crisis was a drop in government revenue. They
highlight that the bulk of countries undertook full or partial accommodation of revenue declines,
and — defying priors — some even undertook countercyclical stimulus. Only a small number
undertook full adjustment in the face of revenue declines. However, since the countercyclical
trends are still fragile, special vehicles such as fiscal rules and commodity stabilization funds can
be most effective if they are underpinned by sound institutions and a commitment to good
governance.

Globally, Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin (2011) show that over the last decade about a third of the
developing world has been able to escape the procyclicality trap and actually become
countercyclical. They trace this critical shift in social policy to the quality of institutions. Thus,
now there is evidence that developing countries can graduate and, at the same time, developed
economies can fall back into the procyclical mode.

Across the two waves of evidence discussed above — prior to and after the global economic
crisis — there is a shift that suggests that countercyclical responses may not be the privilege of
the rich. However, the studies also emphasize that institutions and governance are essential
companions to plain fiscal instruments, such as numerical fiscal rules or commodity stabilization
funds. Hence, we conjecture that the success of countercyclical response in the health sector will
also be closely related to institutional strength and governance, in general, and to the dynamics
between the ministries of finance and health.



 IV. BUSINESS CYCLES, CYCLICAL ECONOMIC POLICY, AND CRISIS
                         TYPOLOGY
A number of empirical studies and policy papers that focus on policy responses to business
cycles find that cyclical patterns are asymmetric across “good” and “bad” times (that is,
expansion and contraction), and also emphasize that the magnitude of the economic downturn
matters in terms of its expected effect on the outcome variable of interest.

For any empirical analysis, it is important to propose operational definitions and measures of
what is under investigation. In our context, and before we turn to the empirical work, we will
define what is meant by cyclical, procyclical, and countercyclical economic policy, and offer a
brief overview of crisis typology and measurement.



                                                 10
      4.1. DEFINITION OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE AND PROCYCLICAL AND COUNTERCYCLICAL
                                                  ECONOMIC POLICIES


Business cycle (or economic cycle) refers to the economy-wide fluctuation in production, trade,
and economic activity in general over several months or years (Burns and Mitchell 1946). The
term “cycle” is a misnomer, because business cycle fluctuations are neither regular nor
predictable. Upward and downward movements in the cycle (expansions and contractions) can
be measured by the level of gross domestic product (GDP). 9 These fluctuations are measured
relative to the economy’s long-term growth trend (Madhani 2010). A variable that is positively
correlated with the overall state of the economy is said to be procyclical, and a variable that is
negatively correlated with the overall state of the economy is said to be countercyclical.

In the context of economic policy, procyclical (countercyclical) refers to any aspect of economic
policy that can magnify (attenuate) economic or financial fluctuations. Countercyclical policies
cool the economy when it overheats and stimulate it when there is a downturn. Keynesian
economics advocates the use of automatic and discretionary countercyclical polices to lessen the
impact of the business cycle.

                                  4.2. CRISIS TYPOLOGY AND MEASUREMENT

   Defining Crisis: There is no consensus on the definitions of different types of crises despite
    their frequency in development economics. One of the most important common features of
    crises is an “abrupt” change in economic indicators. Operational definitions require an
    indicator and a threshold.

   Crisis Typology and Indicators: In a crisis typology, Ishihara (2005) identifies seven types of
    crises. 10 Crisis classification matters because different types 11 of crises affect systems and
    population outcomes through different pathways (see figure 1A.1 in annex 1). For example,
    the effect of a deep recession (characterized by continuous negative growth rates over
    consecutive periods), which directly affects revenues and budgets, is different from currency
    deflation, which can exert its effect through changes in relative prices, including food and
    medical inputs. Differences in the pathways, scope, and expected magnitudes have
    implications for the choice of response mechanisms and overall strategy for reform. Crisis
    heterogeneity can be complex and, therefore, in our analysis we will focus on one selected
    measure (GDP growth) and will only tangentially discuss other pathways. The indicator
    selection is based on empirical evidence from the crisis and health literature, which will be
    discussed in greater depth under the section that presents data and methods.



9. In the United States, the National Bureau of Economic Research’s (NBER’s) seven-member Business Cycle Dating Committee
examines monthly economic indicators that provide a good industry-wide economic perspective to date business cycles. They
use monthly economic indicators (such as employment, real personal income, manufacturing sales, and industrial production),
rather than quarterly real GDP. The monthly data allow the NBER to be more precise in setting business cycle turning points;
the monthly data also typically are not subject to the same magnitude of revisions as are the quarterly GDP data (Romer 2008).
10. The seven types of crisis are liquidity, solvency, balance of payment, currency, external debt, growth rate, and financial.
11. For example, Laeven and Valencia (2012) provide an update on systemic banking crises, which also explores the relationship
between banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises and the likelihood and pattern of the co-occurrence of twin
or triple crises.


                                                             11
   Measuring Crisis Depth and Length: With respect to the magnitude of crises, the literature
    discusses two dimensions that are relevant for quantification — depth and length. In
    simplified terms, a country experiences a crisis as soon as the selected crisis indicator
    exceeds an agreed threshold value. 12 The deviation from the defined threshold, or with
    respect to a trend if the measurement is longitudinal, is the depth of the crisis. The start of the
    crisis is when the variable exceeds the threshold value, and the end of the crisis is when the
    indicator returns to the normal zone relative to the defined threshold. The length of the crisis
    is defined by the beginning and the end. In reality, it is difficult to be precise regarding the
    length of the crisis; hence, the need for crisis preparedness. In general, the longer the crisis is
    and the further away it is from the normal zone, the more severe it is. Severity can be
    measured, for example, in deviation from the filtered trend line in terms of standard deviation
    or relative to past or reference group performance in standardized Z scores. These are
    standard metrics in the business cycle and crisis literature and will be discussed in more
    depth under the section on data and methodology.

   Policy Implications of Crisis Typology and Measurement: Regarding policy implications,
    timely and accurate crisis identification is critical in facilitating optimal policy formulation
    efforts, including countercyclical policies. By responding to early warning signals,
    governments can preempt twin or multiple crises and persistent negative output gap, thereby
    reducing the aggregate impact of the shock over the short, medium, and long terms. With
    respect to health system and population vulnerability to shocks, intuitively, shorter crises
    may be easier to absorb, but they leave little time for adjustment, and the political will to
    implement reforms during shorter and shallower crisis spells may be lower. Conversely,
    longer and deeper crises provide ample time and political momentum for policy makers and
    system reform (that is, structural or “transformative” change) (for example, see box 1.7 on
    Europe and Central Asia). The more buffers governments and systems have, the more
    populations can withstand shocks and the less they suffer from the negative implications of
    crises on health- and illness-related financial protection. To mention a few response options,
    better understanding of the dimensions and pathways of a given crisis can lead policy makers
    and system designers to focus on building reserves, increasing system efficiency, devising
    automatic stabilizers, and improving targeting mechanisms.

                                    V. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

As background to the empirical work, we present a schematic analytical framework that
summarizes the focus of this investigation. In addition, we discuss the rationale for focusing on
government expenditures on health to explore the nature of cyclical response in the sector.

           5.1. SCHEMATIC OF ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK AND TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS

Figure 1.1 provides a simplified schematic of a complex line of transmission that underlies the
relationship between the macroeconomic environment (GDP 13); fiscal policy making (measured
by general government expenditure, [GGE] 14); and sectoral allocation of resources, in our case,
government health expenditures [GHE] 15).

From a broad perspective, increased national income is reflected in an expanded government
revenue base and, by extension, increased general government budgets and expenditures. As
countries get richer, total 16 and public health spending increase as a share of the economy. 17
Beyond the clear income gradient observed in expenditure patterns (see public and private health
expenditure trends for our study period in the following section), spending is not independent of
the economic cycle. It tends to increase more during good times than bad times (that is, it is
procyclical). However, cyclical responses by governments in the fiscal domain and the health
sector are not random. They depend on political preferences and social sensitivity, and on
institutional strength to carry out countercyclical policies. For example, government spending on
health may decline more if the political environment is not conducive to conducting
countercyclical policies and if social sensitivity is low.




13. This is a simplified measurement reduced to a single dimension. For our purpose, GDP, and specifically its growth rate, is an
appropriate proxy measure for the overall performance of the economy because it allows us to capture deviations from the
growth trend over time.
14. The variable GGE is in per capita terms to adjust for population size, and is measured in international dollars (i.e.,
purchasing power parity– adjusted, using constant international dollars anchored to 2005 as the reference year).
15. The variable GHE is based on the National Health Accounts (NHA) database maintained by WHO. Public health expenditure
consists of recurrent and capital spending from government (central and local) budgets, external borrowings and grants
(including donations from international agencies and nongovernmental organizations), and social (or compulsory) health
insurance funds.
16. Based on the variable definition from the NHA database, maintained by WHO, total health expenditure is the sum of public
and private health expenditure. It covers the provision of health services (preventive and curative), family planning activities,
nutrition activities, and emergency aid designated for health, but does not include provision of water and sanitation.

Program series produced by the Health, Nutrition, and Population Anchor of the World Bank in the papers by Fleisher, Leive,
and Schieber (2013); Liang and Mirelman (2013); and Tandon et al. (2013). Further literature includes a global overview by Xu,
Skasena, and Holly (2011). A number of studies, including Hartwig (2005), Hartwig (2008), OECD (2006), OECD (2010), and IMF
(2010), aim to disaggregate the drivers of health expenditures.

Figure 1.1, which illustrates the transmission pathway from the economy to health, is greatly
simplified. In reality, numerous pathways materialize the effect of the crisis on fiscal policy and
health spending. Studies of crises have recorded various pathways from macro shock to health.18
Frameworks, such as the one suggested by Musgrove (1987) (see figure 1A.1 in annex 1) and
Waters, Saadah, and Pradhan (2003), capture the complex pathways from crisis through
governments — which affect supply-side constraints, and households — which alter their
behavior and lifestyle and demand for care during downturns. The consequent decline in the
level and quality of care contributes to the decline of population health outcomes.

Today, as a consequence of the financial crisis in OECD countries, the world risks the most
serious economic downturn since the 1930s (WHO 2009). The pathways through which a
recession in rich economies can affect many low- and middle-income countries are becoming
evident. Many high-income and upper middle-income countries experience negative real income
growth and substantial increases in unemployment, with consequent impact on health. In those
countries where the financial crisis has required emergency assistance from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and, the European Central Bank (ECB), or both, the situation is
particularly serious for health service financing because spending restrictions are imposed during
loan repayment. 19 As a result of the contraction in advanced economies, in low- and middle-
income countries private financial flows can fall, foreign direct investment and remittances can
decrease, and exports from developing countries may fall in terms of price and volume,
potentially accompanied by (sudden and dramatic) falls in exchange rates (WHO 2009). The
consequent effects of unemployment and decreasing revenues would affect household income,
government spending, and the capacity of other actors in the private and voluntary sector,
curbing contributions to health care financing. The financial squeeze on the sector during crises,
thus, takes place at a time of greater health need.

What happens in the transmission pipeline during shocks is a critical question, since inefficient
fiscal and sectoral policies may have detrimental impacts on the population. Thus, understanding
the nature of transmission from the macro economy to fiscal policy responses and health sector
allocation decisions is important in improving countries’ long-term growth trajectories, including
the human capital aspect of growth. So the questions are the following: Can the government
protect spending, especially for social expenditures that serve as a safety net (for example,
automatic stabilizers)? Are fiscal and social policies synergistic or antagonistic? We will
explore these relationships through basic statistical analysis that draws on global macro data to
provide an overview of patterns and trends over 16 years, from 1995 through 2010.

               5.2. THE ROLE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EXPENDITURES DURING CRISES

The general concern during crises is the impact of the economic shock on population health
outcomes. However, in this paper we chose to focus on expenditure patterns and not on final
health outcomes. Although the relationship between health spending and health outcomes is
weak, changes in health financing during downturns are known to affect health status. 20 Since we
aim to explore the role of countercyclical policy making, in this study we specifically focus on
government expenditures on health care 21 as an automatic stabilizer-type policy tool that can be
mobilized to absorb the shock on households.

Nevertheless, we recognize that many would argue that private sector health expenditures cannot
be ignored during any analysis, since in the majority of countries with large vulnerable
populations, private payments predominate. Thus, a central question is what is neglected by
focusing solely on government responses during crises. This depends on the public and private
shares of total health expenditures, and the dynamics between public and private expenditures
over time, particularly during economic shocks.

To understand what our analytical focus on government health expenditures means, we take a
cursory look at health care financing patterns 22 between 1995 and 2010 — both public and
private expenditure trends — across income groups.

As one example, in 2009, when the group average of GDP growth for low-income countries was
down to 1.2 percent (see first column in table 1.1; for more details on public-private health
expenditure trends, see annex 2), the average growth rate of real per capita public expenditures
on health was 7.0 percent, and the real per capita private expenditure growth rate was
approximately 3.0 percent. Based on the real expenditure values, the group average of the shares
of public and private expenditures on health in low-income countries is, respectively, 72 and 28
percent. This proportion suggests that — particularly in a global overview study such as this —
exploring the cyclical responses of government health financing is relevant even in the low-
income context, where the public share is the smallest compared to the other income groups.
Nonetheless, given the variation in public expenditure shares within income groups, country-

development assistance for health (DAH), at least its on-budget portion.

financing; hence, such explorations are encouraged in future research.

We now turn to the context for empirical analysis, starting with the description of the data
source, followed by the methodology.


                                             VI. DATA
A number of papers note data limitations as a constraint to research in this area (for example,
Akitoby et al. 2004; Del Granado, Gupta, and Hajdenberg 2013; Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza
2010). Indeed, data constraints are driven by three main factors.

First, while there is an abundant series of macro data released by various organizations; often
definitions and data construction methods across the macro series are not consistent. Second,
data quality has been questioned in some instances, especially for low-income countries where
data availability can be a challenge (for example, data are extrapolated to fill gaps). Third, some
macro series have a shorter time horizon, which is important for time series analysis. In this case,
analysts would prefer higher data frequency, such as quarterly, to obtain sufficient data points for
the analysis of business cycles.

In the context of investigating the cyclicality of health expenditures, a major constraint has been
that variables required for the analysis are scattered across a number of major databases
maintained by various organizations and, hence, analysis across the macrofiscal and health
domains has required the analyst to merge variables across databases and go through consistency
checks for the relevant variables. This is unfortunate, since the process of database construction
is time consuming, and subjective decisions of variable construction affect the comparability of
findings across papers and the time horizon.

To facilitate analysis in this area, we have compiled a new synthetic database, referred to as the
Fiscal Health Database (see table 3A.1 in annex 3), which includes, among other things, data on
health expenditures, health outcomes, government revenue, spending and debt, and other


                                                   16
measures of fiscal and financial sustainability related to the health sector and the overall
macroeconomy. This macro database combines several sources of data produced by different
organizations and authors, including National Health Account (NHA) data from WHO; the
World Development Indicators (WDI), health, nutrition, and population statistics (HNP Stats),
and health equity and financial protection (HEFPro) data from the World Bank; macro data,
including Article IV and other data sets from the IMF; labor statistics from the International
Labour Organization (ILO); data on official development assistance (ODA) and development
assistance for health (DAH) from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME); and
data on political economy from the Polity Project, and the Inter-Country Risk Guide (ICRG) data
published by the Political Risk Group. Expectedly, the Fiscal Health Database (World Bank
2012), which was created not only for this analysis but also to provide open data to enable
analyses that span across the domains of macroeconomy and the health sector, is a valuable
contribution to analytical efforts in this area.

The subsequent analyses use this rich new synthetic data set, which compiles diverse pieces of
information found in multiple databases. From the macro panel, which covers 2,500 variables
and 193 countries, our investigation covers 183 countries over 16 years (between 1995 and
2010), for which period the key variables of interest for the proposed analyses are available. The
primary data sources for the analyses are the WDI (for example, for GDP), the IMF Fiscal
Statistics (for example, for debt-to-GDP ratio), WHO’s NHA series data (for example, for health
expenditures), and the Political Risk Groups series for the ICRG index. A brief overview of the
key variables will be presented in the section that discusses empirical application and results.


                                           VII. METHODOLOGY

To investigate the relationship between business cycles, fiscal policy, and the cyclicality of
government expenditures on health, we perform statistical analyses using the Fiscal Health
Database. As the literature review showed, the evidence base in this area has been thin due to
data limitations. However, with the recent surge in interest in cyclical behavior, the latest papers
have increased geographic coverage and applied more robust methodology in terms of estimating
the relationship between business cycles and social and health policy, trends over time, and
differences across regions and income groups.

The methodology applied here draws on earlier literature in this domain, including standard
macro procedures, to analyze trends, descriptive statistics to obtain cyclical components of the
key variables interest, and diagnostic econometric models to test priors on the drivers of cyclical
responses.

The main contributions of the proposed empirical work to the current literature are (a) inclusion
of recent data points compared to earlier empirical papers, 23 (b) expansion of the analytical
sample to provide as global an overview as the available data sources allow, and (c) shifting the



23. These papers cover 1972 to 1997 for OECD and Latin America and the Caribbean countries (Braun and Di Gresia 2003), 1980
to 2008 for 100 industrial and developing countries (Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2008), and 1897 to 2007 for 145 countries (Del
Granado, Gupta, and Hajdenberg 2013).

primary focus from the relationship between the business cycle and fiscal responses to the
dynamics between the business cycle and government health expenditures.

There are two main approaches applied in this paper, which will be discussed in more depth in
sections 7.1 through 7.5.

   (1) Descriptive Analysis (sections 7.1–7.4): This will (a) provide a global overview of cycle
       trends for the three central variables of interest presented in the analytical framework
       (GDP, GGE, and GHE; see definitions in section 5.1) between 1995 and 2010 by income
       group, region, and across “good” and “bad” times; (b) present the bivariate
       contemporaneous cyclical correlations between these variables (GDP-GGE, GDP-GHE,
       and GGE-GHE) for the study period (1995–2010) and also for two windows (1995–2002
       and 2003–10), which were defined to compare the changes in the correlation coefficients
       over time and to study these changes by income group to test the hypothesis of whether
       developing countries have been escaping the procyclical trap; (c) test priors regarding the
       relationship between correlation coefficients for fiscal responses (GDP-GGE) and
       government health expenditure responses (GDP-GHE) and political and economic risk,
       captured by the ICRG index; and (d) present variables in radar plots, which, based on
       theory and earlier empirical work, are expected to be relevant determinants of cyclical
       responses.

   (2) Diagnostic Modeling (section 7.5.): Although descriptive analysis can be used as a rapid
       diagnostic tool to provide insights on statistical relationships, this approach is limited
       because it can only offer information on a reduced set of dimensions, such as bivariate
       relationships between variables of interest. There are no controls for a number of
       observable and unobservable characteristics, which leave the policy maker blindfolded to
       what explains and drive the observed dynamics, and about the direction of causality.
       Econometric modeling is an approach that enables the use of control variables to go
       beyond the constraints of a bivariate context, and it aims to enable estimating causal
       relations to ascertain that the change in the outcome variable of interest is indeed the
       effect of the independent variables and not some unobserved characteristics. Because of
       the descriptive nature of this paper and the intention to keep the methods easily replicable
       by noneconomists, here we only attempt diagnostic modeling, the primary objective of
       which will be to test our priors regarding the relevance of variables discussed in the
       descriptive part. This diagnostic modeling will be in a static framework. More advanced
       econometric modeling, which involves testing for causality, and dynamic panel data
       methods, will be done in a separate paper.


 7.1. FIVE-STEP DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS FOR CYCLE IDENTIFICATION AND CALCULATING CYCLE
                                         CORRELATIONS


Using standard methods from the empirical macro literature, the first descriptive analysis aims to
identify trends and isolate the cyclical components of the three central variables of interest
(GDP, GGE, and GHE). The isolated cyclical components are used to calculate the cyclical
correlations between the economic cycle and fiscal responses, and the economic cycle and
government health expenditures. These correlations are then applied in subsequent analyses,


                                               18
such as comparison of the correlation coefficients over time, and testing the relationship between
cycle correlations and variables of interest that are expected to be determinants of cyclical
responses.

This descriptive method is chosen since one of the objectives of the paper is to provide user-
friendly and replicable approaches that produce results that can be updated using newer waves of
the publicly available and, at the least, annually updated Fiscal Health Database. The method
should be accessible to noneconomists who are interested in understanding and measuring
cyclical patterns, for example, delving further in a region or country.

Drawing on the methods applied in Braun and Di Gresia (2003), the descriptive analysis of
cyclicality consists of five steps:

    Step 1 — Log Transformation of the Variable: First, we transform the selected outcome
     variables of interest in per capita terms into logarithmic form. This is standard procedure
     with data that have outliers and skewed or exponential distribution, such as income and
     health expenditures, to compact the dispersion of the variable. 24 The convenience of log-
     transformed variables is that their difference can be interpreted in percentage change terms. 25

    Step 2 — Apply a Filter to the Series: Next, using a common practice in the business cycle
     literature, we apply a linear filter to the log-transformed variables of interest to detrend the
     series. This is necessary because, following Lucas (1977), the business cycle component of
     the variable is defined as its deviation from the trend. We apply the Hodrick-Prescott (HP)
     filter to extract the stationary (cyclical) component and the nonstationary (trend) component.
     Practically, the HP filter decomposes the variable, for example, GDP, into an additive
     cyclical and trend component. 26 Extracting the trend component yields a stationary cyclical
     component, which enables the analysis of the cycle, in our case, the business, fiscal response,
     and government health spending cycles and the relationship between these cycle components.
     In the empirical analysis, we use 6.25 as the smoothing parameter (λ), which is in line with
     the proposed value in a technical review by Baum (2006), and is based on a technical paper

24 . On log transformation see, for example, http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/faq/sas_interpret_log.htm. Logarithmic
transformation variable is used to pull outlying data from a positively skewed distribution closer to the bulk of the data in a
quest to have the variable be normally distributed. In regression analysis, the logs of variables are routinely taken, not
necessarily for achieving a normal distribution of the predictors and/or the dependent variable, but for interpretability. The
standard interpretation of coefficients in a regression analysis is that a one-unit change in the independent variable results in
the respective regression coefficient change in the expected value of the dependent variable while all the predictors are held
constant. Interpreting a log-transformed variable can be done in such a manner; however, such coefficients are routinely
interpreted in terms of percent change.
25. In regression analysis, elasticity is calculated by regressing a log-transformed variable on another log-transformed variable.
To illustrate with an example, income elasticity of government spending can be calculated by regressing the log of GGE on the
log of GDP. The obtained coefficient estimate shows the percentage change in government spending as a result of a 1
percentage change in the output.
26. The methodology consists of adjusting a tendency to the evolution of the logarithm of the variable y (for example, GDP,
health expenditure). The difference between the logarithm of the observed value and the estimated tendency (g) yields the
cyclical component (c). The objective is to minimize the variance of y around g (subject to the restrictions of penalization of the
second difference of g). The penalization parameter λ controls the form of tendency. With higher λ, the tendency will be
smoother and result in more recurrent variations. While Braun and Di Gresia (2003) use λ = 100 as the smoothing parameter,
in a methods overview presentation Baum (2006) proposes λ = 6.25, based on a technical paper by Ravn and Uhlig (2002).
Calculating the difference between the original value of the variable’s logarithm and the logarithmic tendency estimated by the
HP Filter, the cyclical component is obtained.


                                                               19
by Ravn and Uhlig (2002), (see more on the choice of filter and robustness tests between HP
and BK filters in box 1.2).

 Box 1.2 Choosing the Linear Filtering Method

 Since the application of a linear filter affects the cyclical component, the results are sensitive to the
 filtering method.a To validate the robustness of our findings, we tested two filters: the Hodrick-
 Prescott (HP)b and the Baxter–King (BK)c ﬁlters. We performed visual checks of the difference
 between the filtered trend line and the observed values for the selected variables of interest (GDP,
 GGE, and GHE to capture, respectively, the business, fiscal, and health financing cycles) using the
 HP or BK filter. Overlaid graphs that depict the filtered trend line and the observed values were
 prepared for all income groups, regions, and the 183 countries in our sample. Based on this
 comparison, we chose the HP filter because the BK filter exaggerates the cycles at the end of the
 series in the breakdowns by income group and region. For some countries, the BK filter follows the
 observed values too closely, and, hence, compared to the smoothed results using the HP filter, it
 does not capture the cycles adequately.

 Our choice of filter is consistent with a number of relevant papers reviewed in this area, including
 the analysis by Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin (2011), which we extend to the area of government
 health expenditures. In general, an overview presentation (Baum 2006) provides testimonies for the
 use of HP filterd and recapitulates the conclusion in this debate that while the use of the ﬁlter has
 been subject to heavy criticism, it “has withstood the test of time and the ﬁre of discussion relatively
 well.” Based on the results from the tests and in line with the arguments above, the results presented
 in this paper, for example, the correlation coefficients between business and government health
 expenditure cycles, will be based on the cyclical components derived using the HP filter.

Note: a. A number of technical papers (for example, Ravn and Uhlig 2002; Baum 2006) that focus on
filtering methodology discuss the pros and cons of the various filter types and how to optimize the
parameter(s) for the applied filter to obtain the cyclical component that best captures the cycles for
the variable of interest.
b. As Male (2010) summarizes, the HP filter is a liner filter designed to optimally extract a
nonstationary trend component, which changes smoothly over time, from an observed nonstationary
time series. For more on the HP filter and other filtering techniques, see, for example, the methods
sections in Braun and Di Gresia (2003), and Male (2010). For more technical discussions, see
Schlicht (2004) and Baum (2006).
c. In contrast with the HP ﬁlter — a highpass ﬁlter — the Baxter-King ﬁlter (Baxter and King 1999)
is a bandpass ﬁlter, which allows suppression of both the low-frequency trend components and the
high-frequency components in an economic series. The approximation in BK improves with a longer
moving average, but a longer moving average will drop additional observations at each end of the
ﬁltered series. Hence, Baxter and King (1999) conclude that three years of data (at either annual or
quarterly frequencies) should be used to construct the ﬁlter.
d. “For better or worse, the ﬁlter best known to most economics is the ‘HP’ ﬁlter” (Hodrick and
Prescott 1997). As Ravn and Uhlig (2002) state, “...the HP ﬁlter has become a standard method for
removing trend movements in the business cycle literature.”

    Step 3 — Calculate the Cyclical Component of the Time Series: From the first two steps, we
     calculate the cyclical component of the time series, which is the difference between the
     observed value (log of the variable in step 1) and the corresponding value on the filtered
     trend line (step 2). The figures obtained this way describe the cyclical behavior of the
     variable of interest. For example, in case of economic output (GDP), if the calculated cyclical
     component is positive, this means that the cycle is above the expected trend line, and if the
     calculated cyclical component is negative, this means that the cycle is below the expected
     trend line (that is, the boom/bust cycle).

    Step 4 — Calculate the Bivariate Contemporaneous Correlations: Drawing on the calculated
     cyclical components for output (GDP), general government expenditures 27 (GGE), and
     government health expenditures (GHE), we calculate the cross-correlations between the
     various cyclical components, specifically between the business and fiscal cycles (GDP and
     GGE), the business and government health spending cycles (GDP and GHE), and between
     the fiscal and government health spending cycles (GGE and GHE). These cross-correlations
     allow us to establish whether the relationship between business cycles, fiscal responses, and
     health sector responses are countercyclical or procyclical, that is, whether the cycles move in
     opposite directions, protecting budgets and health spending during bad times, or in the same
     direction, signaling increasing expenditure pressures during bad times (see definitions in
     section 4.1). A correlation coefficient above zero (+) implies a procyclical relationship. The
     higher the value 28 is between 0 and 1, the more correlated the cycles are. Conversely, a
     correlation coefficient below zero (−) signals a countercyclical relationship. In this fourth
     step, we provide a visual overview of cyclical relationships through graphs of overlaid
     cycles.

    Step 5 — Present Results by Region, Income Group, and Good/Bad Times: Finally, we will
     illustrate through a series of correlation tables and corresponding graphs the findings with
     respect to the cyclicality between business cycles and overall fiscal responses, and behavior
     on health spending, breaking these down by region, income group, and by the state of the
     business cycle — “good” and “bad times” — to explore whether cyclical responses are
     asymmetric (see box 1.3 for more on exploring asymmetry).




27. Ilzetzki and Végh (2008) provide a discussion on the alternative definitions of government spending measures and the
trade-off between them. While the use of a general government measure is more inclusive, including both central and local
governments, the use of central government spending is more in accordance with the principle of looking at social policy
instruments that are directly under the control of a single social agent. Total central government spending includes more
spending categories, such as government consumption, public investment, and transfers, but also interest payments, which
makes this measure noisier. Much of the literature on the cyclicality of social policy has used real central government spending
(for example, Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Végh [2004]; Alesina, Campante, and Tabellini [2008]), while much of the literature on
the effectiveness of social policy in high-income countries has looked at government consumption or a combination of
government consumption and investment (for example, Blanchard and Perotti [2002], and Perotti [2004]).
28. The standard threshold values for correlation coefficients are (a) Weak positive (negative) linear relationship via a shaky
linear rule, values between 0 and 0.3 (0 and -0.3); (b) Moderate positive (negative) linear relationship via a fuzzy-firm linear
rule, values between 0.3 and 0.7 (0.3 and -0.7); and (c) Strong positive (negative) linear relationship via a firm linear rule, values
between 0.7 and 1.0 (-0.7 and -1.0).

 Box 1.3 Cyclicality across “Good” and “Bad” Times

 As discussed earlier, Del Granado, Gupta, and Hajdenberg (2013) find that the cyclicality of spending is
 asymmetric across “good” and “bad” times, defined in terms of output gap relative to potential output.
 To validate this finding, we construct the variable “output gap,” which measures the difference between
 the observed value for the variable of interest and the value on the filtered trend for the given year in
 terms of standard deviation from the trends. Good/bad times are defined as a positive /negative output
 gap relative to the trend line.

 In terms of the measurement approach, output gap is not equivalent to growth crises measures that are
 provided in terms of negative GDP growth.a The difference is that while growth crises are defined in
 terms of negative year-on-year GDP growth rate, a negative output gap does not necessarily mean that
 the country has a negative growth rate. For example, in the case of a slowdown of economic output in
 countries with high growth rates, a negative output gap simply means that relative to the expected trend
 the country’s economic performance is lower but not necessarily negative. Since these are different
 concepts, in the descriptive analyses we compute statistics for cycles both by output gap, which is a
 relative measure of the country’s performance on industrial output, and by GDP growth rate, which is an
 absolute measure of industrial output. In the discussions we focus more on the results based on output
 gap, since this is the common practice in the literature.

least 9 percent.

7.2. EXPLORING CYCLICAL RESPONSES IN GOVERNMENT HEALTH EXPENDITURES OVER TIME BY
                    INCOME GROUP — GRADUATION OR FALLBACK?

The literature review has shown that while countercyclical behavior has been primarily the
privilege of advanced economies, the behavioral patterns are now slowly changing.
Countercyclical responses are possible, and indeed, have been observed in lower-income
countries, both with respect to fiscal (Brahmbhatt and Canuto 2012; Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin
2011) and health policies (Lewis and Verhoeven 2010).

To our knowledge, there has been no descriptive investigation at the global level of how the
cyclical behavior of government health expenditures has been changing by income group, nor
now, studies including the period that covers the global economic crisis. We draw on the paper
by Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin (2011), which examines cyclical patterns of government
expenditures for 94 countries (21 developed and 73 developing) between 1960 and 2009. To
explore changes in the cyclical responses over time, they compare the correlations between the
cyclical components of real government expenditure and real GDP calculated for each country
for two time frames: 1960 to 1999 (window 1) and 2000 to 2009 (window 2). The change in the
correlation coefficients shows how a country’s fiscal policy has transformed between the first
and second period, including the direction and magnitude of the change. Based on the
combination of cyclical responses observed in the first and second period, they classify countries
into four categories of fiscal behavior, which are captured in table 1.2.

The question for us is whether the intriguing results found by Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin (2011)
in the fiscal context — that about a third of the developing world has been able to escape the
procyclical trap — apply to the trend in cyclical responses of government health expenditures to
business cycles.

To answer this question, we apply the described methodology to our sample of 183 countries and
extend the analysis to explore the trends over time in the cyclical pattern of government health
expenditures. Compared to the analysis by Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin (2011), a limitation here
is that the data set spans 16 years (1995 and 2010), and hence, in this shorter panel, the data
points are constrained to eight years (1995 to 2002) and seven years (2003 to 2010) in the two
time frames. 29 The results are illustrated through quadrant charts, which visually capture the
change in the correlation coefficient between the two windows (see more in section 8.2.1.3,
figure 1.13, and annex 7). The quadrants correspond to the four categories presented in table 1.2.

       7.3. EXPLORING THE ROLE OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK IN SHAPING CYCLICAL
                                                       RESPONSES


The correlation coefficients offer some insights into the dynamics between business cycles and
fiscal and government health financing policies. Yet, these simple bivariate relationships have
limitations. They show associations and not causation, and they mask a number of causal
pathways that result in the observed correlation.

In an overview paper, Tandon et al. (2013) discuss the theory and limited empirical evidence
behind prioritizing government spending on health, measured as the health share of aggregate
government expenditure. Among the driving factors, they mention democratization and lower

29. Although the data is for 16 years, since differences are used, the analysis is based on 15 data points. Hence, the choice of
the two windows is somewhat limited. The windows are required to have a comparable number of data points for better
statistical balance. The second window contains the current global economic crisis, and hence we expect to see some effects,
particularly in higher-income countries where the downturn has affected both fiscal and health financing policies and
responses.


                                                              23
levels of corruption. Indeed, the majority of empirical papers that explore the relationship
between business cycles and fiscal or health care financing response argue for controlling for
political economy (Braun and Di Gresia 2003; Calderon and Schmidt-Hebbel 2008; Doytch, Hu,
and Mendoza 2010; IDB 2009), and government quality and social risk (Liang and Mirelman
2013).

Hence, we add the political and economic risk dimension to our analysis to explore the empirical
evidence on the relationship between these risks and cyclical responses, both with respect to
fiscal and government health expenditure responses to the business cycle.

Scatter plots are used to examine the relationship between the correlation coefficients —
calculated for GDP and fiscal response (GDP-GGE) or GDP and health care financing response
(GDP-GHE) — and an index of political, financial, and economic risk, the Inter-Country Risk
Guide (ICRG), published by the Political Risk Group (see more in section 8.3.). High values of
the ICRG 30 indicate low risk, while low values indicate high risk. The scatter plots 31 are run for
two periods (window 1: 1995–2002; window 2: 2003–10) to be able to distinguish performance
over time.

       7.4. RADAR PLOTS — A VISUAL ANALYSIS TO EXPLORE DETERMINANTS OF CYCLICAL
                                                         RESPONSES

The descriptive analyses proposed so far included bivariate correlation analysis to explore the
cyclical patterns during the 16-year study period, and introduce only one control variable, the
ICRG index, to start isolating the effect of factors that are likely important in shaping cyclical
responses.

7.4.1 Increasing the dimensions of the exploration

However, based on theory and earlier empirical results, we know that these complex dynamics
are driven by a number of observable and unobservable factors. As such, it is necessary to
consider other variables that are expected to drive cyclical responses. Hence, we propose
another, although still descriptive, approach, which will help in the review and identification of
control variables, which can later be incorporated in diagnostic modeling and more advanced
econometric analysis.

We construct radar plots to increase the dimensionality of the exploration. Despite the limitations
associated with descriptive approaches, radar plots are useful in comparisons undertaken for a
small group of countries, since they provide a quick visual overview of the statistical features


30. The political risk rating contributes 50 percent of the composite rating, while the financial and economic risk ratings each
contribute 25 percent. The following formula is used to calculate the aggregate political, financial, and economic risk: CPFER
(country X) = 0.5 (PR + FR + ER) where CPFER = composite political, financial, and economic risk ratings; PR = total political risk
indicators; FR = total financial risk indicators; and ER = total economic risk indicators. The highest overall rating (theoretically
100) indicates the lowest risk, and the lowest rating (theoretically 0) indicates the highest risk. The broad categories of
Composite Risk are (a) Very High Risk: 0 to 49.9 points, (b) High Risk: 50 to 59.9 points, (c) Moderate Risk (60 to 69.9 points, (d)
Low       Risk:     70      to      79.9.      points,    and     (e)    Very     Low       Risk:   80      to      100     points.

31. In the scatter plots, the risk ratings are scaled between 0 and 1.


                                                                24
that explain the variability in cyclical responses across countries and over time, as well as across
“good” and “bad” states.

7.4.2 Construction and use of the radar plots

The radar plots are implemented using an adaptation of the method for scoring called range
standardization, 32 which uses a simple formula 33 to standardize numerical values to fall between
the range of 0 and 1 (Kaly et al. 1999). Since range-standardized scoring constrains the data to
fall into a specific band, the scores can be plotted for comparison on a standardized scale.

To construct the radar plots, based on theory and empirical findings, we have selected variables
that fall into three groups: (a) observed cycle patterns (outcomes), (b) macro context and fiscal
space (control variables), and (c) political economy (control variable). The variables (or
dimensions) in these groups contain outlier values that skew the distribution in such a way that
would mislead the interpretation of results. To address this problem, we censored extreme
outliers so that the plots can more representatively capture the statistical characteristics of the
majority of countries. The selected proxy variables are standardized not only in terms of the
range of the variable to constrain it between 0 and 100, 34 but also in terms of the interpretation of
each variable so that the center of the radar plot (0) means that the country’s performance on the
given variable is low; as the value approaches the outside ring (100), 35 its performance improves.
The proposed empirical application of the radar plot for cyclicality analysis is captured through
the schematic graph presented in figure 1.2.




32. In range standardization, the minimum value for the indicator for the range of interest (Min Xi) is subtracted from the
numerical value of the selected indicator for the country under assessment (Xi); then this value (Xi – Min Xi) is divided by the
range of interest of the variable (Max Xi – Min Xi). The term “range of interest” is emphasized since, for a number of variables,
the distributions contain extreme outliers; hence, we chose to censor the range to make the distribution of the value more
meaningful.
33. Vi = (Xi – Min Xi) / (Max Xi – Min Xi). This range is adapted to our needs since we define the range for censored values that
make interpretation meaningful.
34. This range is obtained by multiplying the calculated range standardized variable, which falls between 0 and 1, by 100 to
make the visual illustration easier to discuss.
35. While 0 to 100 standardized scaling is used in the plots, the variable labels for each dimension on the plot indicate the
corresponding original range of the variable. For example, the 0 to 100 scale in the context of the GDP cycle spans the range of
minus 12 to plus 12 percent deviation from the trend line. See more under the empirical section that presents the applied
cases.

The plots are designed to illustrate difference in performance between countries relative to a
common benchmark. For this, to make the radar plots tractable and visually interpretable, we
select a few countries from each region. Further, since the results are more interesting across
“good” and “bad” states, we select target time frames specific to each region with respect to
business cycle volatility. The plots between precrisis and postcrisis years can illustrate whether
and how the shock changes cyclical behavior, whether the fiscal or health spending cycle is more
affected (that is, change in the outcomes), and which of the selected control variables show
significant change over time.

7.4.3. Rationale for variable selection for the radar plot

The number of dimensions in the radar plot is limited to keep the interpretation tractable. A brief
description of the main categories and the selected dimensions that are expected to explain some
of the variation in cyclical behavior is provided below.

    Dimensions in Group 1: Observed Cyclical Components. This first group of variables aims to
     visually capture the cycles for the three key variables of interest for this analysis. The plot
     captures the contemporaneous values of the cyclical components of the three variables. 36
     These dimensions offer an insight into the country’s performance on each of the three cycles
     across time, and on the relative performance among the countries selected for the
     comparative analysis.

          □    Cycle of GDP: This is the cyclical component of log GDP per capita relative to the
               filtered trend line. The interpretation is, as discussed earlier, that a cycle above the
               filtered trend line implies a boom cycle, and a cycle below the filtered trend line
               implies a bust cycle. To censor extreme outliers, this variable is constrained between

36. In other words, the radar plot is not designed to capture lagged effects, for example, the effect of the observed GDP cycle at
the baseline (t0) on the GGE or GHE cycle in the following period (t+1).


                                                               26
               minus 12 and plus 12 percent deviation from the filtered trend line. To construct the
               standardized score, this range is mapped to between 0 and 100 on the standardized
               scale of the radar plot. Reading the GDP cycle variable together with the GGE or
               GHE cycle implies whether, in the same year, the cycles move in the same
               (procyclical) or opposing (countercyclical) direction, or whether there is no
               significant change (acyclical relationship). If the value is above the 50 percent mark
               on the plot, then the country is doing better compared to the trend; if it is below, then
               the country is underperforming.

          □    Cycle of GGE: This is the cyclical component of log GGE per capita relative to the
               filtered trend line of the variable. This variable is similarly constructed to the GDP
               cycle variable, with the exception that the base range before standardization is minus
               25 to plus 25 percent, which is then converted into the 0 to 100 scale. The
               interpretation of the variable and the relationship between this and the other cycle
               variables is as explained above.

          □    Cycle of GHE: This is the cyclical component of log GGE per capita relative to the
               filtered trend line of GHE. The construction, range, and interpretation are the same as
               for the GGE cycle variable discussed above.


    Dimensions in Group 2: Proxy Variables for Macro Context and Fiscal Space. The second
     group of dimensions includes a limited set of variables to capture the macroeconomic context
     of the country, including some measures of fiscal space.

          □    GDP Per Capita: GDP per capita is based on international dollars, with the base year
               of 2005, to be able to compare per capita output across countries and over time. As
               described, the variable is log transformed to constraint outliers. The literature
               suggests that income level is correlated with cyclical behavior, so we propose
               including this variable as a basic control variable to enable the comparison of country
               performance on the selected proxy measures with an understanding of the overall
               level of economic development.

          □    Debt-to-GDP Ratio: 37 Debt-to-GDP ratio is used as a proxy for fiscal space. 38 Unlike
               the other variables, for which interpretation is straightforward — higher values

37. See the theoretical underpinning of fiscal space and government spending on health, as explained by Tandon and Cashin
(2010, p. 15). “Fiscal space can be understood using the algebra of a government’s inter-temporal budget constraint. The left-
hand side of the following represents the uses of budgetary resources whereas the right-hand side reflects sources of
budgetary resources: Gt + rtBt-1 = Tt + Bt + At + Ot; where Gt is government noninterest expenditure in time t; rBt is
nondiscretionary debt interest payments; Tt is taxes, fees, and other government revenues, including those arising from
seigniorage (inflationary finance); Bt is total government borrowing (domestic and foreign net of use of deposits); At is grants;
and Ot is other sources of funds, such as sale of assets. In other terms, the right-hand side represents the aggregate sources of
government revenue, and the left-hand side represents total spending. Fiscal space for health depends not only on the overall
government budget constraint, but also on the priority assigned to health. Government health spending, Ht, is a proportion kt
of the overall government budget, or: Ht = kt Gt. Whether the priority for health (kt) is a constant or variable parameter is a key
policy question. For example, if G increases as a result of increases in overall fiscal space, health spending would increase by a
fixed proportion k if spending priorities remain unchanged.”
38. While there are other possible proxy measures for fiscal space — including net external-debt-to-export ratio, which is less
volatile than debt-to-GDP ratio if the exchange fluctuates, or primary surplus/deficit, tax revenues as share of GDP, net foreign


                                                               27
              correspond to better performance — the debt-to-GDP ratio requires rescaling because
              higher values correspond to worse performance. 39 Consistent with the economic risk
              and crisis literature, the threshold value for bad performance differs by income level;
              we use a cutoff point of 40 percent for developing countries and 60 percent for
              advanced economies.

         □    Official Development Assistance (ODA) as Share of Gross National Income (GNI):
              ODA as a share of GNI is another proxy measure of fiscal space (Doytch, Hu, and
              Mendoza 2010). This dimension is especially relevant for low-income countries,
              which can be highly aid-dependent. This variable is of interest since in some
              instances, where crises are deep and protracted, the inflow of development assistance
              can enable countercyclical responses. While empirical evidence holds that
              countercyclical behavior is a characteristic primarily of advanced economies, we can
              explore the relationship between aid and cyclicality. The ODA/GNI ratio is on a
              positive scale in our radar plot, between the values of 0 and 50 percent. This choice
              can be debated since a higher ODA/GNI ratio means increased risk because the
              country’s fiscal position is more exposed to external fluctuations. Although we agree
              with this, and the discourse regarding the concerns of aid volatility, for these
              snapshots we chose a positive scale; that is, higher values are outside on the radar plot
              and not inverted, unlike for the debt-to-GDP ratio. The rationale behind keeping the
              positive scale is that from the perspective of countercyclical spending, donor aid
              contributes to the financing envelope and thus can facilitate countercyclical behavior
              during downturns.

              However, as a cautionary note, this simple analysis assumes away a number of
              complex issues that are related to the impact of development assistance on
              government expenditures. First, one would need to control for aid volatility to see the
              consistency of these flows and better understand the role of ODA on expenditures.
              Second, the fungibility of ODA — that is, whether it replaces domestic budget, hence
              creating a zero-sum effect — is a much studied and debated topic (see more in box
              1.4). Third, also related to the fungibility debate, international development assistance
              is not a homogenous product; grants and loans have different effects on government
              (health) spending (see, for example, Benedek et al. 2012; Clements et al. 2004). For
              the radar plots, we relax these complications since these issues can only be addressed
              and controlled for using more advanced techniques.

         □    Terms of Trade (ToT): The ratio between the prices of exports and imports is called
              the net barter terms of trade. ToT is said to be favorable when the prices of exports of
              a country are higher relative to the prices of its import. ToT has been found to be
              significant, especially for developing countries with high export shares and a high


transfers, portfolio investment, as discussed by a number of papers (Baldacci, McHugh, and Petrova 2011; Doytch, Hu, and
Mendoza 2010; Ishihara 2005; Schaechter et al. 2012) — we use this proxy primarily because of data availability. However, in
iterations of the radar plot approach, the performance of other variables for fiscal space can be tested. For example, tax base as
share of GDP is interesting because this also captures informality and changes in fiscal constraints during downturns in
advanced economies.
39. To keep the interpretation of all variables in the radar plot consistent, data of the rescaled debt-to-GDP ratio variable that
are closer to the center of the plot represent higher debt-to-GDP ratios, i.e., reduced fiscal space.


                                                               28
              share of revenues from trade (Del Granado, Gupta, and Hajdenberg 2013; Mendoza
              1995). Mendoza (1995) finds that terms of trade are strongly procyclical, suggesting
              that much of the fluctuation in output in developing countries can be explained by
              ToT shocks. Given the definition, ToT improves if the ratio is higher. We use ToT in
              the analysis as difference in ToT relative to the previous year. In terms of the
              interpretation of this proxy measure in our context, improving ToT would increase
              fiscal space; however, if not used wisely, a windfall from a ToT improvement can
              lead to more procyclical behavior.

       Box 1.4 The Impact of Development Assistance on Government Expenditures

       The impact of development assistance on government expenditures is a hot topic, since it is critical
       to understand how international finance and development institutions can get more bang for their
       buck; that is, how their investments or financial support can leverage government efforts to raise
       and spend domestic resources. This question merits a brief discussion since the government health
       expenditure variable used in this paper by definitiona includes elements of official development
       assistance (ODA) — but not its off-budget component. Because of this definition, our aggregate
       numbers on cyclical behavior include effects that are the joint product of external and domestic
       responses. If one would like to better understand the driver of cyclical responses, one ought to pose
       the question: What is the share of government funds relative to donor funds?

       Development assistance for health (DAH) has more than quadrupled since 1990 (Ravishankar et al.
       2009). However, the rate of increase in DAH appears to have slowed in recent years (IHME 2010).
       With respect to vulnerability and sustainability, a common concern is that DAH may crowd out
       public budget allocations. Until recently, the literature has been limited on the crowd-out effect of
       DAH on government health expenditures and to what extent such resources are spent outside the
       health sector (fungibility) (Gottret and Schieber 2006). However, given the 2008–09 economic
       crisis and the consequent increased interest in changes in the pattern of aid flows, a number of
       papers have contributed to better understanding the dynamics of DAH on domestic spending. For
       example, using panel data of low-income countries for 1995–2006, Lu et al. (2010) find that for
       every US$1 of DAH given to the government, health expenditure falls between US$0.43 and
       US$1.14. However, they find that assistance given to nongovernmental organizations increases
       domestic resources for health from US$0.56 to US$1.72. Consistent results are found by IHME
       (2010).

       Variations in methodological rigor may be behind some of the inconsistencies in findings. For
       example, Ooms et al. (2010) advises against relying too heavily on the findings by Lu et al. (2010)
       given its methodological limitations, and concludes that donor policy decisions should not rely on
       cross-country regressions but on case-by-case analysis. A case study by Fairbank (2013) 40 provides
       country-level insights on donor fund fungibility in the context of Liberia, a highly aid-dependent
       country.

       In a macro analysis, Benedek et al. (2012) investigate the broader question of the effect of foreign


40. This study was commissioned by the Health & Economy Program of the HNP Anchor as part of a series of papers that focus
on the relationship between macroeconomic conditions and health care financing.

        aid on government revenues. Their findings confirm that the effect of aid on the domestic budget
        (tax revenues) is heterogeneous, with grants creating a negative effect and loans creating a positive
        effect. The conclusion from these studies is that aid cannot be treated homogenously, and project-
        specific or budget support, grants, or loans should be treated separately.

    Dimension in Group 3: Political Economy. This last dimension aims to capture the role of
     political economy, which is considered to be a significant explanatory variable that often
     drives policy decisions. In fact, the majority of papers in the literature plug in some type of
     variable to control for political economy (Braun and Di Gresia 2003; Calderon and Schmidt-
     Hebbel 2008; Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2010; IDB 2009; see also Tandon et al. 2013).

          □     Polity 2 or ICRG Political Risk Rating Index: To control for political economy and
                the quality of governance, most authors use the revised polity index (Polity 2),
                developed by the Polity Project, or the Inter-Country Risk Guide published by the
                Political Risk Group. We chose ICRG, 41 which is a composite index of political,
                financial, and economic risk, and covers a longer time horizon. In terms of scaling,
                and interpretation, the highest overall rating (theoretically 100) indicates the lowest
                risk, and the lowest rating (theoretically zero) indicates the highest risk.

                                                7.5. DIAGNOSTIC MODELING

Following the above-proposed methods, we reach the limits of descriptive analysis. Both theory
and empirical evidence prompts us to go further and explore multivariate relationships. The
rudimentary modeling laid out here is inspired by the challenges discussed so far, and it builds
on the variable identification efforts conducted in the descriptive part. The modeling is used to
test the relevance of the variables proposed as expected drivers of cyclical responses. The
modeling is done in a static framework; that is, we only explore contemporaneous relations.
Finally, since this is a diagnostic attempt, the interpretation of the estimates will not necessarily
be causal. However, it will enable us to assess multivariate associations, and the sign and
magnitude of effects of the control variables on cyclicality of government health expenditures.

Given its simplicity, we apply an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression for initial model
specification, estimation, diagnostic checks, and model re-specification. We apply a step-wise



41. http://www.prsgroup.com/ICRG_methodology.aspx#PolRiskRating. The political risk rating contributes 50 percent of the
composite rating, while the financial and economic risk ratings each contribute 25 percent. The following formula is used to
calculate the aggregate political, financial, and economic risk: CPFER (country X) = 0.5 (PR + FR + ER), where CPFER = composite
political, financial, and economic risk ratings; PR = total political risk indicators; FR = total financial risk indicators; and ER = total
economic risk indicators. The highest overall rating (theoretically 100) indicates the lowest risk, and the lowest rating
(theoretically 0) indicates the highest risk. The broad categories of Composite Risk are (a) Very High Risk: 0 to 49.9 points, (b)
High Risk: 50 to 59.9 points, (c) Moderate Risk: 60 to 69.9 points, (d) Low Risk: 70 to 79.9 points, and (e) Very Low Risk: 80 to
100 points.

modeling approach, 42 gradually adding covariates to the specification to explore the relationship
between the outcome variable of interest, which is the cyclical component for government health
expenditures, and selected explanatory variables, based on the foregoing discussions.

    Specifying the Dependent and Independent Variables

        Dependent Variable: As discussed earlier, the cyclical component is defined in terms of
         standard deviations from the smoothed trend line. The higher the deviation, the bigger the
         cycle. A positive cycle means increased government health expenditures relative to the
         expected trend, and a negative cycle means decreased government health expenditures
         relative to expected trend. The HP filter was used to de-trend all series for the diagnostic
         modeling.

        Control Variables: The choice of the covariate set partially draws on the rationale for
         selecting the variables for the radar plot, presented under the previous section. Additional
         variables are also considered based on theory and earlier evidence (see more on the
         proposed variables under the empirical section, section 8.5). As discussed, to understand
         the cyclical response during downturns, in the regression we must control for negative
         GDP cycle, which can be done by introducing variables for negative and positive cycles
         in the regression or by running separate regressions for the negative and positive GDP
         cycle scenarios.

    Nonparametric Diagnostic and Linear Modeling

        First, still in a bivariate context, we explore the relationship between the cyclical
         component of government health expenditures and economic growth, measured in terms
         of GDP cycle. Given priors that a linear relationship may not fully capture the dynamics
         between the cyclicality of government health expenditures and growth cycles, we apply a
         nonparametric approach to visually explore the nature of the relationship.

        Second, we turn to multivariate linear modeling, using the pooled data for the full sample
         over 16 years, to test the relevance of the control variables discussed previously and
         estimate the sign and magnitude of the relationship between the covariates and the
         government health expenditure cycle. To test for the cyclical response during downturns,
         in addition to fitting the regressions for the pooled data across bad and good times, we
         also run models separately for economic downturns and boom, using GDP cycle to
         distinguish these periods. The model equation of the multiple linear regression is shown
         below, where β0 is the constant and the B1, B2, … are the coefficient estimates for the
         explanatory variables introduced, and εi is the error term:

                   yi = β0 + β1 x1i + β2 x1i+ … + βK-1 xK-1,i + εi.



42. This is in contrast to the standard general-to-specific modeling approach, where insignificant variables are dropped from the
model in iterations until a parsimonious fit is identified. The modeling ambition is to balance goodness of fit and parsimony.
While adding a variable may increase the explanatory power of the model, overloading regressoor terrors penalizes the model
for loss of parsimony. In overspecified models, the interaction between covariates (collinearity) reduces or cancels out
significant variables.


                                                              31
         Finally, as a subset of the previous point, because earlier empirical evidence has shown
          that cyclical responses systematically vary by income groups, we run separate regressions
          by income level, using the World Bank’s income group classification. These income-
          group–specific models are also run for “good” and “bad” times separately to test for
          responses across states.

 8.1. FIVE-STEP DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS FOR CYCLE IDENTIFICATION AND CALCULATING CYCLE
                                                        CORRELATIONS

This section summarizes the main findings of the proposed five-stage process, including the
overarching patterns, and illustrates the findings through country examples. 43

8.1.1 A five-step process to analyze cyclical patterns

Step 1: Construction of log-transformed values

As described in the methods sections, to compact the distribution of the variables (GDP, GGE,
and GHE), the first step is log transformation. For example, panel A of figure 1.3 shows the
trend for the original variable, government health expenditures per capita in constant 2005
international dollars by region, and panel B shows the log-transformed variable.
                                Figure 1.3 Trend for GGE Per Capita and Log GGE by Region, 1995–2010

                               Panel A                                                                  Panel B

Although the log-transformed variable makes the distribution more compact, the original series
shows that health expenditures have been rising faster in advanced economies, particularly in


43. Given the volume of the data, detailed statistical results (e.g. descriptive results for the key variables of interest, such as log-
transformed variables, their cycles, and correlations between the cycles by country, income group, and region over 1995 and
2010) are not published here. They are available upon request.


                                                                  32
North America (NAC) and the Europe and Central Asia (ECS) region. Demography and
technology have been among the drivers, as shown by a number of empirical papers. Relative to
the trends for GDP and general government spending, government spending on health has been
increasing faster, implying that the health sector’s share in the budget has been increasing over
time.
Step 2: Filtering the time series to extract the cyclical and trend components
In the second step, the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter is applied to the log-transformed variables to
extract the cyclical component and the trend component (see more on filter choice in box 1.2).
We used 6.25 for the smoothing parameter, as suggested in the technical literature for annual
data (Baum 2006; Ravn and Uhlig 2002). Panels A, B, and C of figure 1.4 illustrate the results of
HP filtering GDP, GGE, and GHE in the case of Argentina for 1995 to 2010. This analysis was
performed for all countries to obtain the cyclical component in the next step. The blue line shows
the observed values of the given variable and the red line shows its filtered version. For all three
variables, the applied smoothing parameter seems to perform well since the trend lines follow the
observed values but smooth it out by penalizing extreme values. The gap between the observed
and filtered values (that is, between the blue and red lines) shows higher volatility for GGE than
for GDP and GHE. Figure 1.4 suggests that the fiscal response is more sensitive to changes in
business cycles; that is, it displays relatively more procyclical behavior compared to government
health expenditures.

Step 3: Calculating the cyclical component
Following filtering, the cyclical component of the time series —the difference between the
observed and smoothed values — can be calculated. Panels A, B, and C in figure 1.5 show the
deviation of the observed values from the HP filtered trend line for the three variables — GDP,
GGE, and GHE — by region, using unweighted mean values. Given this, caution must be
practiced with generalizing the findings, since the statistics are irrespective of the population size
of the countries within regions; hence, the presented regional effect may be under- or overvalued.
For a more detailed overview, the values for the cyclical components for the regions can be
found in table 5A.1 in annex 5.

   GDP Cycle: The y axis in panel A of figure 1.5 is scaled between .04 and -.06, that is, a
    range in the cyclical deviation from the trend line between 4 and -6 percent. The highest


                                                           33
    positive deviation from the GDP trend is performed by the Middle East and North Africa
    region, as shown by the yellow line that peaks around 2004. The highest negative deviation
    from the growth trend is observed for the Europe and Central Asia region (dark red line) in
    2009, followed by North America and Latin America and the Caribbean.
   GGE Cycle: The deviation range of the cycle for GGE is wider (between -.1 and .3, that is, -
    10 to 30 percent) compared to the GDP series, which suggests high variability in fiscal
    responses at the global level (panel B of figure 1.5). The fiscal expansion is the most marked
    for the South Asia region (bright red), with a peak around 2007.
   GHE Cycle: The dispersion of the GHE cycle is more compact (between -.1 and .15, that is, -
    10 to 15 percent) relative to GGE, suggesting that, on average for the 16-year time period,
    government health spending cycles are less sensitive to the underlying changes in the
    business cycle than fiscal responses are. However, some regions are more susceptible to
    wider swings in GHE responses. For example, there are large spikes for the South Asia (SAS,
    bright red) and Middle East and North Africa (MEA, yellow) regions, especially in 2003 and
    2009; the direction of these cycles are opposite, showing contraction in the South Asia region
    and expansion in Middle East and North Africa.
These graphs illustrate how GGE and GHE responses to the business cycle vary depending on
the region and time frame. As noted, however, these averages mask wide variations in responses
by countries within the region. As country-specific results are beyond the scope of this paper,
statistical findings are not presented here.

In terms of the volatility of fiscal and government health expenditures by income group, figure
1.6 shows that the cycles are wider in developing countries (low-income countries and lower-
middle-income countries, respectively; the purple and green line in panels A, B, and C), and that
fiscal volatility, on average, is higher, especially, between 2005 and 2009. While government
health expenditure cycles are somewhat more stable on average, there is a clear spike in 2009, at
the peak of the current global economic crisis in all income groups, followed by a plunge in
2010. Although the observed cyclical behavior in high-income countries confirms more stability,
the amplitude of the cycles increases with the onset of the crisis.

Step 4: (Co)movement of cycles — A visual analysis of cross-correlations between cycles

At the center of this five-step process is the calculation of the bivariate correlation coefficient,
which captures the relationship between the cycles. This helps explain how the fiscal and
government health expenditure responses are related to changes in economic output.

In this section, we offer a visual illustration of cycle movements. Figures 1.7 and 1.8 summarize
the cycle movements observed in the Europe and Central Asia (ECS) and the Latin America and
the Caribbean (LCN) regions, and show whether there are procyclical, acyclical, or
countercyclical tendencies, and how these change over time. The choice of the two regions is
purely deductive to illustrate the interpretation of cycle movements. These graphs are produced
for all regions and countries but not presented here.

Because a complex set of relationships guide cyclical dynamics, and the macro trends do not
reveal what specifically drives these, expectations must be tempered. This is an inherent
limitation of simple bivariate analysis, which only shows the association between the two
variables. Hence, to understand the true nature of these relationships, more advanced statistical
methods are required, such as multivariate and causal analyses.

Bearing these limitations in mind, we can interpret the contents of the figures that capture the
relationship between the three pairs of cycles: (a) the GDP and GGE pair sheds some light on the
effect of fluctuations in economic output on government spending; (b) the GDP and GHE cycles
show how government health spending is affected by the business cycle; and (c) the GGE and
GHE cycles help understand whether these two variables move in the same or opposite direction,
and whether government health expenditures are more or less volatile than fiscal cycles; that is,
what is the level of commitment to the health sector within the budget.

Cycle movements between GDP and GGE show more countercyclical behavior for the Europe
and Central Asia (ECS) region compared to Latin America (LCN) between 1995 and 2001 and
also in 2008 and 2009, during the years of the global economic crisis, which has heavily affected
the region (figure 1.7). However, in Latin America, the crisis in 2001 triggered a countercyclical
fiscal response (red line), which later dropped as the continued decline in growth (blue line)
placed downward pressure on government spending between 2001 and 2004. As an example of
countercyclical trends in the region, according to Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin (2011), Chile is
undoubtedly the poster child of the graduation movement. As discussed in Frankel (2010), since
2001 Chile has followed a fiscal rule that has a structural (that is, cyclically-adjusted) fiscal
balance as its target. 44 By design, such a rule ensures that temporarily high fiscal revenues are
saved rather than spent. But Chile is not the only country that seems to have escaped the
procyclicality trap. The author concludes that the quality of institutions seems to be a key
determinant of a country’s ability to graduate.

Cyclical movements for GDP and GHE (figure 1.8) show a countercyclical pattern for ECS
between 2000 and 2007, with government health expenditure (red line) declining — relative to
the expected trend — when growth (blue line) accelerates, and expanding when growth declines.
Toward the start and end points of the data series, the relationship is procyclical, especially
during the global crisis — with the GDP and GHE cycles moving in the same direction. This
implies that the depth and persistence of the crisis have reduced the resilience and stability of
countries to an extent that government health expenditures have declined. These patterns are

44. As pointed out in Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin (2011), the original target was a structural surplus of 1 percent, reflecting the
need to repay Central Bank debt associated with the bailout of private banks in the 1980s. Since this debt was paid off over
time, the targeted structural balance was reduced to 0.5 percent in 2008 and 0 percent in 2009.

empirically supported by a number of papers, including a few with regional coverage (Koettl and
Schneider 2010; WHO 2013), as well as country case studies (Barros 2013; Burke, Barry, and
Thomas 2013; Yfantopoulos 2013; see more in box 1.7). Similarly, GDP and GHE cycles are
procyclical in LCN during the deep and protracted crisis, which started in 2001, and did not
emerge from the negative trends before 2005. However, there are some countercyclical
responses, 45 such as at the peak of the crisis before the next year’s budget allocation, when the
increasingly constrained fiscal position bounded the health spending frontier as well. These
patterns are consistent with some of the observations in Braun and Di Gresia (2003). Their paper
provides more insights into the drivers of differences in cyclical responses across countries and
over time. For example, they highlight prudent fiscal policies and increased fiscal transparency
in Chile as possible contributors to countercyclical behavior.

Finally, the cyclical dynamics between GGE (blue line) and GHE (red line) show closer
correlation and comovement in general, although for these two regions health expenditure cycles
display more volatility since they have larger deviations from the trend relative to the variance of
the fiscal cycle. While health spending tends to increase during milder downturns, it drops in
priority during deep and protracted crises, as in 2001 in LCN and after 2009 in both regions.
Automatic stabilization, hence, is a challenge during austerity. Since these trend lines for the
cycles are aggregates for the region, these rudimentary descriptive statistics do not indicate
which countries drive these changes and whether there are systematic differences by country


45. Besides the cyclical patterns for regions discussed in the text, these statistics are available by country. As an example from
Latin America, figure 5A.1 in annex 5 contrasts the cyclicality tendencies for Argentina, which is largely procyclical, and Mexico,
which shows elements of countercyclicality to offset the negative effect of downward cycles on population health.
Understanding what specific policy responses have been shaping these trend lines would require case and event analyses,
which is not the focus of this paper.

Step 5: Correlation coefficients for the pooled data, disaggregated by income group and region

This last step directly builds on the cycle correlations discussed in step 4, which described the
interpretation of cycle dynamics using graphs that overlay the cyclical trends of the pairs of
variables (GDP-GGE, GDP-GHE, and GGE-GHE). This section presents correlation matrixes
for these three pairs, including for (a) the global pooled data for 16 years; (b) contemporaneous
correlations by “bad” and “good” states defined in terms of output gap (Del Granado, Gupta, and
Hajdenberg 2013), (see more in box 1.5); (c) contemporaneous correlations by GDP growth rate
brackets; (d) contemporaneous correlations by region; and (e) correlation coefficients for a one-
year lag between GDP and fiscal response and GDP and health financing.

Box 1.5 Measuring the Output Gap

As discussed under the methods section (see section 7 and box 1.2), the “good” and “bad” states of
economic performance are defined in terms of standard deviations of the observed GDP from the filtered
trend line. We set the threshold for significant deviation from the trend at or above (below) 1.5 standard
deviations, which is consistent with the choice of threshold in a number of empirical papers. The output
gap is positive if the observed value is above the filtered trend value, and negative if the observed value is
below the filtered trend value. Tables 1.5B.1 and 1.5B.2 offer an overview of the output gap by income
group and region. In the color coding, the green cells correspond to positive output gap, and the red cells
to negative output gap. The shade of green is deeper if the value is 1.5 standard deviations above the trend
value, and the shade of red is deeper if the value is 1.5 standard deviations below the trend value.

For example, the output gap is -1.55 standard deviations from the filtered trend (that is, economic output
potentials) for the high-income group in 2009, at the height of the current global economic crisis. The by-
region breakdown shows that the negative deviation from the trend is the largest for North America, with
a standard deviation value of -2.31. In general, the OECD group performs below the -1.5 benchmark for
significant output gap in 2009. The output gaps are also calculated by country but not presented here.

8.1.2. Cycle correlations for the global sample

The contemporaneous correlations for the cycle pairs (GDP-GGE, GDP-GHE, and GGE-GHE)
presented in table 1.3 suggest that for the global, pooled data for the 16 years, there is mild46
procyclicality across the three pairs, except for the GDP-GHE pair when the output gap is
negative. From the three pairs, the comovement is strongest between the general government
expenditure and government health expenditure cycles (GGE and GHE: average = 0.25). This is
expected, since when fiscal space contracts, government spending on health is also likely to
decline. The correlation coefficients for the GDP-GGE and GDP-GHE pairs suggest that fiscal
responses are more procyclical. In other words, health spending is less related to the economic
cycle, and it is relatively more protected during downturns. This can be seen when comparing the
correlation coefficients for GDP-GHE across “bad” (output gap < 0) and “good” (output gap ≥ 0)
times, which are, respectively, -0.03 and 0.04. Although the negative sign of the correlation
coefficient for GDP-GHE during bad times indicates that there is a countercyclical response
during downturns at the global level for the study period, the magnitude of the coefficient shows
a weak relationship, and its statistical significance is below any standard value. 47

Continuing the exploration at the global level by GDP growth rates, the results in table 1.4
suggest that deep contractions (defined for this analysis as GDP growth between minus 5 and 10)
are associated with weak countercyclical reflexes both in terms of fiscal and health financing
responses. However, the magnitudes and statistical significance levels leave these relationships
tenuous. More advanced statistical analyses are required to understand the effects of crises of
various depth and length on fiscal and health financing policies.

8.1.3. Cyclical patterns by income group

Table 1.5 moves beyond the global-level data and presents the correlation coefficients for the
study period by income group. The negative signs of the correlations in the green cells are
consistent with the earlier wave of the cyclicality literature, which claims that countercyclical
behavior has been primarily the privilege of advanced economies. In fact, while the results
suggest countercyclical fiscal responses for both the upper-middle and high-income groups
during negative output gap (respectively, -0.01 and -0.13), countercyclical response in health
expenditures is only observed in the high-income context (-0.1).

Figure 1.10 illustrates these average behavioral responses by scatter plotting the cyclical
component of government health expenditures (y axis) and the GDP growth rate (x axis) for each
income group (HICs, UMICs, LMICs, and LICs). Panel A shows that countercyclical behavior in
GHE is more likely for HICs in the two extreme cases, during deep crises or high growth rates.
When growth rates are negative (shown on the left side of the x axis), the GHE cycle is above the
trend line, that is, above the zero value on the y axis. At the other end of the income distribution,
for the low-income group (LIC), the trend line in the scatter plot shows that the behavior is
procyclical (panel D). That is, the GHE cycle is below the zero value on the y axis when GDP
growth is negative, and the GHE cycle is above the zero value on the y axis when growth is
positive. However, despite the trend line’s fit, the scatter plots capture a number of observations
in the lower-income context that show the GHE cycle above zero during contractions, that is,
countercyclical responses in developing countries.

Further statistical analysis suggests more within-group variation,, showing a number of country
cases where countercyclical responses have been observed. Among the drivers, we suspect social
sensitivity of the government and governance, both of which would have a positive effect and
signal a greater propensity for countercyclical responses. These priors are to be tested in the
proposed econometric modeling to be implemented in an extended version of this paper, as part
of our future research agenda to improve the robustness and credibility of these findings.

8.1.4. Regional patterns of cyclical responses

The regional breakdown in table 1.6 shows countercyclical fiscal and government expenditure
responses in the North America (NAC) region, with the regional average for countercyclicality in
health spending driven by Canada. As expected, countercyclical responses are more prevalent


                                                        42
during bad times, with a number of regions (EAS, LCN, NAC, and SAS) prioritizing fiscal
stimuli, and Europe and Central Asia (ECS) and the Middle East and North Africa (MEA)
showing weak countercyclical behavior in health spending. Again, these aggregate figures mask
within-group differences. Although the by-country statistics unveil further variation in
responses, it is not clear whether and how that within-group difference changes over time and
what enables or disables countercyclical responses. To further explore the within-group
variation, in the radar plot analysis (see section 8.4) a limited number of countries are selected
from each region and from across income groups to demonstrate that countercyclical behavior is
not only income-related but also influenced by a number of other factors, such as governance,
political risk, and fiscal space, including reliance on foreign aid. These are potential control
variables to be tested in multivariate analysis.

8.1.5 Lagged correlations between the cycles

A number of empirical studies emphasize that contemporaneous relationships are not sufficient
to understand the fiscal and health care financing dynamics in the face of shocks. This is
intuitive, since planning and budgeting processes are not affected by downturns
contemporaneously, but with a lag, at least a one-year transmission from the shock to next year’s
budget. In advanced economies where countercyclical responses are more likely and shock
effects are typically absorbed in the first year thanks to automatic stabilizers, the negative effects
of a downturn may not be apparent for a few years. In this study, we only explored the one-year
lagged effect, broken down by time periods, to see whether the coefficients change over time.
Table 1.7 shows a statistically significant, however weak, negative relationship between GDP
and next year’s health budget for the first time period (1995–2002) (-0.07). In the second period
(2003–10), the sign of correlation reverses, the magnitude of which suggests a weakly positive
procyclical tendency (0.06) compared to the first period. As for the lagged fiscal response, the
magnitudes are small and the results are not statistically significant. While it is not possible to
draw a robust conclusion regarding the change in fiscal response over time, health financing
moved into a slightly more procyclical direction during the second window, which includes the
current global economic crisis. Such results may cause some concern regarding the prioritization
of the health sector in general government expenditures. The empirical literature on the crisis
shows that some of the reduction in health expenditures can be offset, for example, by efficiency



                                                      43
gains or reduced costs due to structural reforms. But not all expenditure reduction is neutral
regarding system and population-level effects.

 8.2. CHANGING GLOBAL PATTERNS OF CYCLICAL RESPONSES — DOES HEALTH FOLLOW THE
                           STORY IN FISCAL RESPONSE?

While countercyclicality has been primarily the privilege of advanced economies, the behavioral
patterns are now slowly changing. Countercyclical responses are possible, and indeed, have been
observed in lower-income countries. The question is whether the results found by Frankel, Végh,
and Vuletin (2011) in the fiscal context — that about a third of the developing world has been
able to escape the procyclical trap — apply to the trend in cyclical responses of government
health expenditures to business cycles. To address this question, we explore the change in the
correlation coefficient for the business cycle and government health expenditures between 1995–
2002 and 2003–10.

8.2.1. Global patterns in cyclical responses between 1995–2002 and 2003–10

8.2.1.1. Advanced economies are standing their ground in countercyclical responses

To compare the cyclical responses between the fiscal and health domains, first we calculate the
correlation of the cyclical components of GDP and GGE for the two time frames defined above,
1995–2002 and 2003–10. Figure 1.11 summarizes the changes in the income group shares of
counter- and procyclical responses between these two windows.




48. This is the correlation coefficient for one-year lagged government health expenditures; i.e., we explore the relationship
between GDP in time 0 and the response variable, GHE in time +1 (i.e., lagged health financing response). Empirically, lagged
relationships are relevant since budget decisions likely have at least a one-year lag. There is evidence that budgets are not
immediately affected during crises, but given the budgeting and planning process, these will affect the following year’s policy
and budget.
49. This is the correlation coefficient for one-year lagged general government expenditures; i.e., we explore the relationship
between GDP in time 0 and the response variable, GGE in time +1 (i.e., lagged fiscal response).

Note: X axis labels: CC = countercyclical; PC = procyclical; IG = income group. Y axis labels: HIC = high-income
country; UMIC = upper-middle income county; LMIC = lower-middle-income country; LIC = low-income country.

For example, the first bar in panel A shows that for 1995–2002, low-income countries had a 24
percent share of countercyclical responses, which is 1 percent below their share among all
income groups. The respective shares of the other income groups in the countercyclical set are 32
percent for LMICs, 17 percent for UMICs, and 27 percent for HICs. During 2003–10, the shares
change to 21 percent for LICs, 23 percent for LMICs, 19 percent for UMICs, and 37 percent for
HICs. In contrast with the findings by Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin (2011), this implies that for the
time frames defined, countercyclical fiscal responses increased in advanced economies (UMICs
and HICs) during the second window, which includes the current global economic crisis. As
discussed, this crisis has had a deeper effect on advanced economies, which triggered automatic
stabilizers in a number of countries. Where the crisis has been protracted and deep, structural
adjustments were required. On the other hand, the shares of developing countries (LICs and
LMICs) in the countercyclical pool have declined compared to the values in the first window.

Table 1.8 provides the calculated difference between window 2 and window 1 in the income
group shares of countercyclical fiscal responses. The table shows that the low-income groups lost
12 percent of its total share of the countercyclical pie, with LICs losing 3 percent and LMICs 9
percent. The biggest change is in the HIC group, the share of which grew by 10 percent.

8.2.1.2. Upper-middle-income countries gain in countercyclical responses in health financing

The story on government health expenditures is different. From window 1 to window 2, HICs
lose 3 percent of their share of countercyclical government expenditures on health (figure 1.12
and table 1.9). This implies that in some high-income countries, automatic stabilizers or reserves
were not sufficient, and the health sector budget had to go through consolidation (see box 1.6).
The UMIC group, however, experienced a gain in its countercyclical share over time, growing
by 6 percent. However, the data do not support the hypothesis that developing countries, in
general as a group, have increased their countercyclical presence in government health
expenditures.

Box 1.6 Managing the Dual Objectives of Meeting Fiscal Targets and Health Sector Objectives

Managing the dynamics or tension between fiscal discipline and consolidation and health sector
objectives during crises has been a central topic for ministries of finance and health. For example, one
concern expressed by Estache and Muñoz (2009) is that IMF conditionalities that aim at fiscal
consolidation could undermine sector objectives if the focus is on short-term fiscal balance and does not
include medium- to long-term growth aspects. Many analysts express concerns regarding the role of
financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, in
determining public health expenditure. In their view, conditionalities from financial institutions could lead
to dismantling health systems (Baker 2010) or to chronically insufficient health budgets (Rowden 2010).
Stuckler, Basu, and McKee (2011) find that DAH is much less likely to lead to an increase in health


                                                        46
spending in IMF-borrowing countries (US$0.01 versus US$0.45 compared to nonborrowing countries). In
addition, the Center for Global Development (CGD) Working Group criticizes the IMF and its programs
for being too conservative by, for example, overusing wage ceilings, which could hamper sector-specific
objectives.

Despite these claims and blames, the jury is still out because insufficient evidence and heterogeneity in
methods precludes an authoritative conclusion on this matter. There is one message that comes through
systematically: governments must be cautious with reform actions and go beyond planning responses for
the short term. Although short-term measures to mitigate negative consequences of the crisis are urgent,
taking a longer-term perspective that will make the health sector more resilient in the future is critical
(Heller 2013; WHO 2009). For example, a two-wave survey of health systems in Europe (Mladovsky et
al. 2013; WHO 2013) finds that while the majority of reforms focused on efficiency enhancement, there
have been cases that lead to a reduction in the depth, breadth, or scope of health coverage, which causes
concerns not only for health outcomes but — through the human capital channel — possibly for growth.
In the context of the current crisis, case studies on Greece, Ireland, and Portugal (Barros 2013; Burke,
Barry, and Thomas 2013; Yfantopoulos 2013) offer a good illustration of the dynamics between fiscal
consolidation and health sector objectives, representing variations in country responses to the Troika’s
(EU–ECB–IMF) conditionalities.

There are some contextual factors worth noting to enhance or qualify the interpretation of these
numbers.
        First, the impact of the global economic crisis has been heterogeneous. It has affected
         advanced economies more, as witnessed in countries of the European Union and the
         United States, requiring substantive responses not only in the short term, but also
         structural changes. Aging and technological-advancement–driven cost pressures are some
         well-known forces behind the structural reforms. The global economic crisis has played a
         catalytic role in undertaking long due reforms in the health sector of many advanced
         economies, which may have been too politically sensitive to tackle. Responses by
         countries have varied with the depth and length of the crisis, and with differences in
         government and sectoral preparedness to manage and mitigate crisis effects (see box 1.7
         on experiences in Europe and Central Asia). Since the correlation coefficients are
         averaged for each country and country group for the defined time periods, these
         aggregate numbers do not tell us specifically how countries responded during and after
         the crisis. Case studies can shed more light on the direct fiscal and health financing policy
         implications of the crisis. 50
        Second, in general, responses to crises have been more successful and efficient in
         countries where social safety nets have been well established and targeting mechanisms
         were clear. Safety nets are not well developed in the lower-income context because of
         structural challenges, such as a large informal sector or inadequate linkages between
         social protection and health safety nets. Thus, in LICs and LMICs, significant investment
         in systems and institutions is required to make the best use of countercyclical efforts. In

        upper-middle-income countries, where systems and institutions are typically more
        advanced, we see a higher increase in countercyclical responses.

Box 1.7 Effects of the Global Economic Crisis on Europe and Central Asia — Fiscal Austerity and
Health Sector Reforms

Prior to the recent global economic crisis, which started in 2007, the Europe and Central Asia (ECA)
region had robust economic performance. When the crisis hit, it was expected that such a fast-growing
region would have the means and tools to tackle the downturn. However, many countries in the ECA did
not cope well (see chapter 5 in Hou et al. 2013). The crisis has shown that no country is immune to
external challenges. When policy controls are missing or not used efficiently, crises can reverse progress
and positive performance even in advanced economies with AAA ratings.

Given the diversity of the ECA region, the global economic crisis did not affect all countries to the same
extent. During 2003–10, subregional breakdowns of average growth rates of economic growth (GDP)
(figure 6A.1 in annex 6), and the consequent fiscal (GGE) and health (GHE) responses (figures 6A.2 and
6A.3 in annex 6) show significant variation across the region. While in all subregions the average GDP
growth rate for this period is positive, there is wide disparity between the high of 8.5 percent in the
ECCU3a group and the low of 0.3 percent in Southern Europe (ECCU10). The story line is similar for the
growth rates in general government expenditures (GGE) and government health expenditures (GHE).
Comparatively, for most subregions — except for Russia and ECCU3 — the rate of growth in GHE is
higher than fiscal growth, implying an increasing share of the health sector in the government budget
during this period.

However, since these statistics are averaged for the 2003–10 time frame, they mask the cyclical responses
during the crisis. By the peak of the crisis in 2009, all but the Central Asia subregion was in a growth
contraction mode, with Central Eastern Europe undergoing the deepest GDP reduction at negative 8.7
percent (figure 6A.4 in annex 6). In 2010, most subregions had procyclical fiscal responses, except for
Turkey and Northern and Western Europe, where — due to automatic stabilizers and/or fiscal stimuli —
countercyclical responses are observed (figure 6A.5 in annex 6).

With respect to government health expenditures, all subregions undergoing growth contraction in 2009
had a procyclical response in 2010, except for Turkey and Western Europe. As a result of the crisis, a
number of countries in Europe stood on the fiscal brink. Rising debt levels, threats to fiscal sustainability,
and pressures from fiscal austerity have reduced fiscal space for health. In many European countries,
spending on health (Heller 2013; WHO 2013) and growth rates of government health expenditures have
fallen significantly (figure 6A.4 in annex 6). Reduced nominal spending occurred as early as 2008–09 in
Estonia, Hungary, and Ireland (Burke, Barry, and Thomas 2013; Habicht 2012; Heller 2013). In 2009–10,
spending fell in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain
(Burke, Barry, and Thomas 2013; Habicht 2012; Heller 2013; Yfantopoulos 2013; Barros 2013).

Concerns about sustainability of health systems in advanced economies are not new. In fact, structural or
system-level aspects — such as aging, rigidities in social security systems, and technological
advancements — have increasingly pressed the fiscal envelope (Heller 2013; Hou et al. 2013). The crisis
has served as a catalyst for change since it has further raised the level of alert and created a more
conducive environment for reforms. Crisis is an opportunity for efficiency gains. But the challenge is that


                                                     48
where system reforms have already squeezed efficiency, essential services can suffer (for example, loss of
breadth, scope, or depth of coverage in a way that jeopardizes vulnerable groups). When system
vulnerability is increasing, coordination between macro stabilization and sectoral needs also becomes
more important because what might be penny-wise may well end up being pound-foolishb by
undermining long-term investments in human capital (see more in Hou et al. 2013).

An overview paper on the impact and policy implications of the crisis in Europe (WHO 2013) presents a
number of illustrative examples of good and bad practices in health sector responses to the crisis and
fiscal pressure. The main policy response options are summarized in table 6A.1 in annex 6 and are
adapted to fit the health systems vulnerability assessment framework proposed in Velenyi, Yazbeck, and
Smitz (2013). Country cases on Greece, Ireland, and Portugal provide details on the triggers, fiscal
impact, and health sector responses by these governments during the recent crisis (see chapter 5 in Hou et
al. 2013). Overall, there have been clear efficiency gains across Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. However,
as with all complex reforms, it is difficult to find cases of absolute success. Conflicting objectives have
led some countries to backtrack on the depth, scope, or breadth of coverage.

Two main conclusions can be drawn from the country cases. First, the political and economic dynamics of
reform processes between the health sector and the ministry of finance, as well as within the sector, are
critical. Political economy is especially important if there is not enough time for evidence-based priority
setting. Second, further developing and applying country-level monitoring tools and early warning
systems could help evidence-based responses (Hou et al. 2013).

8.2.1.3. Group aggregates mask some variations within groups

The global overview above renders a mixed picture. The data suggest some progress in escaping
the procyclical trap, but not at the lowest level of development. However, the data show group-
level aggregates, which cannot capture country-level variation. To overcome this limitation,
quadrant charts were prepared to see the distribution of countries in each income group on these
two-period countercyclical versus procyclical maps.

Our focus is on the relationship between government expenditure on health (GHE) and GDP
growth. 51 The quadrant chart captures the correlations of the cyclical components of GHE and
GDP for each country in the given income group (see figure 1.13, below, for LICs and the graphs
for the other income groups in figures 7A.1–7A.3 in annex 7). The scattered data points are
grouped into four quadrants, depending on the sign of the correlation coefficient in the first and

51. Quadrant graphs were also prepared to visualize the relationship between GGE and GDP. However, since our focus is on the
health aspect, these graphs are not discussed in this paper. To offer a comparison with the quadrants on the cyclicality GGE,
please see figures 7A.4–7A.7 of annex 7 for the results on fiscal cyclicality.

quadrant — as “Back to School,” “Procyclical School,” “Established Graduate,” and “Recent
Graduate”(see also table 1.2). 52

Figure 1.13 shows the classification for low-income countries (LICs). 53 The majority of
countries (n = 22) fall into the procyclical school. The lowest number (n = 7) of countries is in
the “established graduate 54” quadrant. There are an equal number of countries (n = 8) in the
“back to school” and “recent graduate” 55 quadrants.

In general, for all income groups, the question is what distinguishes the countries in the
“established graduate” and “recent graduate” quadrants from the rest of the group.

    What makes, for example, Algeria, Iraq, Paraguay, or Turkmenistan an established
     graduate among lower-middle-income countries (figure 7A.1 in annex 7)? How have
     countries like Djibouti, Ecuador, Honduras, Georgia, Guyana, or the Philippines become
     recent graduates in this group?

    And why are Botswana, Chile, and Libya established graduates in the upper-middle-
     income group (figure 7A.2 in annex 7)? What policies got Dominica, Gabon, Kazakhstan,
     Malaysia, or Panama to graduation in this group?

     countries (figure 7A.3 in annex 7)? And how did Finland, the Netherlands, Norway,

Since the level of income is more or less controlled for, other characteristics such as political
regime type, government preferences and sensitivity to social sectors, institutional strength and
governance, system strength and type, and, for developing countries, the availability of external
resources for health, must play a role in driving such differences in cyclical responses. In a
descriptive analysis it is not possible to control for all these observable factors simultaneously.
Hence, we select one dimension to examine further — the relationship between political and
economic risk and cyclical behavior. This will be discussed in the following section.

    8.3. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT CYCLICAL RESPONSE AND POLITICAL AND
                                         ECONOMIC RISK


Empirical papers argue that political economy and government quality and social risk play an
important role in determining cyclical responses. Hence, we add the political and economic risk
dimension to our analysis to explore the empirical evidence on the relationship between these
risks and cyclical responses, with respect to both fiscal and government health expenditure
responses to the business cycle. Scatter plots are used to examine the relationship between the
correlation coefficients and an index of political, financial, and economic risk, the Inter-Country
Risk Guide (ICRG).

8.3.1. Fiscal response and political and economic risk

This first set of scatter plots (figure 1.14) shows the relationship between the average correlation
coefficient for fiscal response (y axis: GDP-GGE) and the ICRG index (x axis) for the two time
frames:

    Window 1 (1995–2002): The fit line of the scatter plot for window 1 (panel A of figure
     1.14) has a negative slope (-0.325), which means that for the sample of 183 countries
     between 1995 and 2002, there is a negative relationship between political and economic
     risk and countercyclical response. Specifically, we see that countries with higher ICRG
     ratings (that is, closer to 1, which means lower risk) are more likely to have
     countercyclical policies, as shown by the negative sign of the correlation coefficient. On
     the other hand, countries with low ICRG rating (below 0.6, that is, higher risk) are more
     likely to engage in procyclical responses.



                                                51
      Window 2 (2003–10): The fit line of the scatter plot for window 2 (panel B of figure
       1.14) has a steeper negative slope (-1.142), which means that, compared to the results in
       window 1, there is a more pronounced association between higher political and economic
       risk and more procyclical behavior or its inverse, low political and economic risk and
       more countercyclical behavior. Based on these aggregate values across the two time
       frames, the second period is more fiscally responsible. These results imply that during the
       period that includes the recent global economic crisis, which started in 2007,
       countercyclical fiscal policies to stimulate and stabilize economies played an important
       role for many countries that have been affected by the downturn. Since the correlation
       coefficient is averaged for between 2003 and 2010, we are not able to identify changes in

8.3.2. Health financing response and political and economic risk

This second set of scatter plots (panels A and B of figure 1.15) show the relationship between the
average correlation coefficient for health care financing response (y axis: GDP-GHE) and the
ICRG index (x axis) for the same two time periods as defined above:

      Window 1 (1995–2002): The relationship between the cyclicality of health financing
       response (y axis: GDP-GHE) and political and economic risk (x axis: ICRG) is also
       negative. This means that countries with higher ICRG values (that is, lower risk) are
       associated more with countercyclical responses (that is, correlation coefficients below
       zero). However, compared to the fiscal response (where the linear coefficient for the fit
       line is -0.325 56), the lower linear coefficient of -0.502 suggests that at the global level (n

56. The slope line of the linear coefficient can be interpreted as the unit change in the variable on the y axis for a unit change on
the x axis. In this case, the coefficient shows that for a 10-point change in the ICRG rating (using the original scale of 0–100
points), the value for cyclical response changes by -0.325, i.e., becomes more countercyclical.


                                                                52
        = 183) there has been a stronger countercyclical response in health financing by countries
        with relatively lower levels of political risk. That is, countries have been protecting their
        health financing positions relatively more.

     Window 2 (1995–2002): However, in the second period, which includes the global
      economic crisis, the liner coefficient of the fit line is lower (-0.488) relative to window 1,
      and relative to the fiscal response. In fact, in the second period, on average, government
      prioritization changes with fiscal responses becoming more countercyclical (linear
      coefficient -1.142), while health sector financing falls back on the agenda in relative
      terms.

8.3.3 Cyclical response and political and economic risk by income group

The scatter plots in figure 1.15 mask considerable variation in the relationship between cyclical
responses and political and economic risk by income group. These are illustrated in figure 1.16,
which captures the heterogeneity of responses in the second time period (2003–10), and
recapitulates the finding discussed above that countercyclical fiscal responses (figure 1.15) were
more pronounced compared to health financing responses (figure 1.16) during this period, which
includes the recent economic crisis.

   The findings between cyclical responses and political and economic risk, however, are not
   always intuitive in every income group. While the relationship between cyclical responses and
   risk rating is negative (that is, higher ICRG, which means lower risk, is associated with more
   countercyclical responses) for high- and upper-middle-income countries, the relationship for
   low- and lower-middle-income countries is less clear. It varies between negative, positive, and
   neutral. This raises concerns regarding the predictive power of the ICRG rating for cyclical
   responses by governments in the fiscal and health domains. One solution could be to decompose
   the index and find the principal components that explain the most variation in cyclical patterns.
   However, this fine-tuning is beyond the scope of this paper.

   For example, figures 8A.1 and 8A.2 in annex 8 illustrate this unclear relationship in low-income
   countries (LICs) in the fiscal and health financing areas for the two time frames.

                       The fiscal responses have a positive linear coefficient in both time frames (0.599 and
                        0.136) but large standard errors, which makes this relationship fuzzy. Why would
                        politically and economically less stable, high-risk countries engage in more
                        countercyclical responses compared to more accountable and responsible governments?
                        Among the possible explanations are pressures from international financial institutions to
                        better manage reserves, for example, by establishing rainy day funds in resource-rich
                        countries. Official development assistance (ODA) with conditionalities on fiscal behavior
                        and rules could also contribute to this phenomenon.

                       The health financing response changes over time, from a negative relationship (-0.397)
                        for 1995–2002 to a positive one (1.062) in 2003–10. However, since the standard errors
                        are large, in the context of low-income countries, the ICRG rating is less helpful in
                        throwing light on the behavioral responses of governments. The hypothesis for what
                        biases these results are, as discussed above, external factors that can influence
                        government responses, such as conditions by international institutions tied to aid or other
                        forms of support. Consequently, in further analyses and modeling, it is important to


                                                                                                          54
         control for aid effects to isolate this pathway from general policy responses. Indeed, data
         on development assistance for health (DAH) show that a number of countries in the high-
         risk and countercyclical category have been recipients of above-average DAH per capita
         (IHME 2010).

   8.4. DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS USING RADAR PLOTS TO EXPLORE THE DRIVERS OF CYCLICAL
                                                     RESPONSES

The radar plot is a simple visual tool that uses a reduced set of dimensions to enable performance
assessment and tracking regarding the environment for cyclical responses, including macrofiscal
and political variables. The radar plot can offer insights on the performance of a country or
selected countries against a common benchmark (for example, global, income group, regional
peers). Using radar plot pairs or series for selected target years can help track changes for a
country or sets of countries over time. The proposed tool can be applied in country briefs, case
studies, and regional overviews as a comparative or longitudinal context setter. Using the Fiscal
Health Database, radar plots can be easily constructed for customized reports, for a country or
selected countries.

On a cautionary note, “the devil is in the details” idiom applies to this approach for three reasons.
First, this simple tool can only offer insights on associations, and not on causation. Second,
macro data often have missing data points that limit comparability. Third, cross-country or cross-
year comparisons must go beyond assessing the quantitative differences between the
observations. To inform policy making, analysts must drill down on the qualitative aspects, such
as the nature of the underlying policies, changes to policy approaches, institutions, and the
political context. Applying mixed methods — quantitative and qualitative jointly — can shed
more light on what lies behind cyclical dynamics.

The remainder of this section illustrates the use and interpretation of radar plot design for the
assessment and tracking of the environment for cyclical performance. To make the illustration
focused, a sample of 38 countries was selected. Section 8.4.1 discusses the criteria for the sample
selection and describes the sample. Section 8.4.2 illustrates the use and interpretation of radar
plots through a discussion of the results for the selected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Section
8.4.3 applies broad brushstrokes to summarize the main patterns for each income group using
regional examples.

Since the tool can be applied to any country and reference period, the main point here is to
illustrate the tool’s use without going into details. The discussion will touch on (a) the applied
interpretation of the dimensions of the radar plot; and (b) findings regarding cyclical correlations
(table 9A.3 in annex 9). 57




57. By-country cycle patterns for the target time frames, which vary by region, are also calculated but not presented here
because the objective of this paper is to provide a global overview and not country-specific explorations.

8.4.1. Description of the sample selected to illustrate the use of the radar plot approach


To make the radar plot analysis tractable, a sample of 38 countries was selected from a total of
183 countries across the seven regions, using the World Bank’s regional classification. 58 The
selection criteria were specified to illustrate the potential of the tool in this brief overview of
empirical application. The sample selection criteria include the following conditions: (a) the time
frame for each region shall be customized to include both a crisis and a growth period so that
responses across these states can be identified; consequently, the target windows vary by region;
(b) in each region the subset shall include a mix of development levels, as much as possible, to
explore effects across income groups.

To meet the first condition, output gap was used as an objective quantitative measure to identify
the target window that has a crisis spell with significant depth and at least two years of
consecutive negative output gap, as well as a spell of positive output gap. The overview table
(table 9A.1 in annex 9) applies a color scheme 59 of six performance brackets for output gap,
which are based on the distance of the observed value from the trend in terms of standard
deviations and the sign of the output gap. The table lists the selected countries by region and
income group and provides the time frames for the analysis for each region. Since the time frame
varies by region, a general heading is used for time (t, t + 1, t + 2, t + 3), so the values are
relative to the base year (t). The summary statistics for log GDP and output gap for the three
variables of interest (GDP, GGE, and GHE) are presented by country. Table 9A.2 in annex 9
provides the cyclical components for GDP, GHE, and GHE, and table 9A.3 summarizes the
correlation coefficients calculated for the full study period for GDP-GGE, GDP-GHE, and GGE-
GHE.

8.4.2. Illustration of the interpretation of radar plots

In general, the purpose of radar plots is to offer a visual of the relative performance of selected
countries against a common benchmark on defined dimensions that capture some aspects of the
enabling environment for cyclical responses. As discussed under the methods section, the
dimensions proposed for the radar plot were selected on the basis of theory and empirical
evidence. Each dimension is expected to explain some of the variation in the propensity to
engage in countercyclical behavior. Beyond cross-country comparison based on a single year,
constructing radar plots for each year of the target time frame enables tracking changes over
time.

This section explains how to interpret the proposed dimensions of the radar plot in an applied
context, focusing on six countries in Sub-Saharan Africa — including countries from the low-
and lower-middle-income groups — for 2000 to 2002 (figure 1.17).



58. The regions and related region codes are East Asia and Pacific (EAS), Europe and Central Asia (ECS), Latin America and the
Caribbean (LCN), Middle East and North Africa (MEA), North America (NAC), South Asia (SAS), and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSF).
59. The color scheme used in the overview table is Dark Red: -2 > Output Gap. Medium Red: -2 < Output Gap < -1.5. Light Red: -
1.5 < Output Gap < 0. Same thresholds apply for the brackets for positive output gap, with a positive sign. That is Dark Green: 2
< + Output Gap. Medium Green: 2 < + Output Gap > 1.5. Light Green: 1.5 > + Output Gap > 0.

The detailed discussion of the rationale behind each dimension is discussed in the methodology
section (section 7). Here, the focus is on applied interpretation. With respect to the reading of the
radar plot, the standardized scale is between 0 in the center of the radar and 100 on the outside
ring; lower values mean lower performance on the given variable. The 50 mark, which represents
the group average, means average performance. In addition to the standardized scale, for each
dimension, the respective original range is indicated on the variable label. For example, the
cyclical component for GDP ranges between minus and plus 12 percent. These dimension-
specific labels provide a more specific interpretation for each variable.

The dimensions are grouped into three categories (see data availability summary in table 10A.1
in annex 10). The interpretation of these is presented below in the context of the selected African
countries.

Group 1 – Cyclical Patterns:

       GDP Cycle: The GDP cycle shows whether the country’s economy has a growth driver
        or a shock effect to manage. Over the three-year time frame, the economic output is the
        lowest for 2000, with negative cycles for Eritrea, Mali, and Mozambique, as indicated by
        the values below the 50 mark on the radar plot.

       GHE Cycle: The GHE cycle shows whether health expenditures have been in the “green”
        or “red” (above/below the 50 mark grid line on the radar plot). For example, in 2001
        Eritrea (dark blue) puts more emphasis on government health expenditures (above the 75
        percent mark on the grid line for GHE CC) relative to fiscal stimulus (below the 50
        percent mark on GGE CC). This is also the case for 2000, which is the year of the
        downturn, although the patterns are attenuated. In 2003, however, fiscal policy changes,
        slightly surpassing the 50 percent mark, which suggests a slight fiscal stimulus.
        Mozambique (yellow line) shows similar preference patterns in 2000, during a mild
        relative downturn, since its health spending cycle is relatively more countercyclical (GHE
        CC at approximately 70 percent) compared to the neutral fiscal policy (GGE CC at
        approximately 50). Thus, comparing responses between the fiscal and health cycles can




                                                          57
    offer an insight on health sector prioritization. See the discussion in box 1.8 on factors
    that can contribute to countercyclical health sector policies.

   GGE Cycle: The GGE cycle shows whether government expenditures expand or contract.
    However, from a single dimension, one cannot tell whether the economic policy is
    procyclical or countercyclical. That requires an understanding of the relationship between
    GGE and GDP and, hence, joint interpretation. For example, a positive GGE cycle can be
    either a pro- or countercyclical response, depending on whether the GDP cycle is positive
    or negative. Using a country example, we observe expansionary fiscal behavior during a
    positive GDP cycle (that is, procyclical) in Nigeria in 2000, a fiscal stimulus during a
    negative cycle (that is, countercyclical) in 2001, and fiscal adjustment during a negative
    GDP cycle (that is, procyclical) in 2002 (panel C of figure 1.17). The radar plot also
    enables comparison of the GGE and GHE cycle components. Since these cycles are
    affected by the same underlying economic performance, the responses can be interpreted
    in a relative manner. For example, in 2000, both general government spending and
    government health spending increased. However, the increase in health spending was
    proportionately less relative to its trend line (at 65 percent for the GHE dimension on the
    plot compared to 75 percent for GGE). The response is also disproportionate during the
    negative GDP cycle in 2002, which triggered adjustment in both the fiscal and health
    domains but more so in government health spending. Such results could be indicative of
    the status of the sector with respect to overall government priorities.

     Box 1.8 Poor but Socially Sensitive — Possible Drivers of Countercyclical Health Policy in
     Low-Income Context

     Among the selected countries in Sub-Sahara Africa, two countries stand out compared to the
     group mean with respect to their countercyclical health spending behavior — Eritrea and
     Mozambique. Knowing the political and historic context of these countries, one hypothesis is
     that greater social sensitivity could partially drive behavioral responses with respect to health
     spending. One measure of the role of the state in providing the health safety net is the size of
     government funds as a share of total health expenditures. For Eritrea and Mozambique, these
     shares hovered at around 50 and 70 percent between 2008 and 2012 (World Bank 2013). We
     also know from global statistics on aid flows that some of these countries among the selected
     ones in Sub-Saharan Arica have been recipients of significant ODA during the time concerned.
     For example, World Bank statistics (Index Mundi 2013; World Bank 2013) show that aid flows
     in Eritrea in 2000 reached a net ODA to gross capital formation of above 100 percent, and
     similarly in Mozambique in 2001. Consequently, we expect that during econometric analysis it
     is important to control for the share of government expenditures in the health sector, and for the
     share of development assistance for health in total spending to isolate domestic and externally
     driven countercyclical responses.

     Notwithstanding these results, from system performance indicators we can conjecture that
     countercyclical behavior, if short term, is not enough to make a dent in human capital formation,
     especially not in countries where poverty is deep or inequity marked, and systems are in general
     not in good condition. For example, although Mozambique’s GDP growth has been among the
     world’s top 10 since 2001, it has some of the lowest GDP per capita and the lowest life



                                               58
        expectancy, Human Development Index, and inequality ratings. The story line from the
        perspective of cyclical responses is favorable. Yet, we believe that to have an enhanced
        understanding of how countercyclical responses could be harnessed, modeling is essential to
        better control for observable and unobservable characteristics that drive cyclical responses, as is

        down on the qualitative context, which helps in the interpretation of findings.

Group 2 — Macrofiscal Dimensions:

      Log GDP: Log GDP is included to anchor the countries with respect to where they fall in
       the global per capita income distribution. This is informative because cyclical patterns
       display a clear income gradient. All countries in this selection fall into the low-income
       category, except for Nigeria (red line), which, based on the most recent income
       classification used by the World Bank, is in the lower-middle group.

   The next three variables in this group are proxy measures of fiscal space, which are important
   regarding current and future fiscal and health spending responses.

      Debt-to-GDP Ratio: The debt-to-GDP ratio is a measure of the health of the economy.
       Higher debt relative to GDP puts a burden on the economy because of the need to finance
       debt repayments. Such a burden decreases the fiscal leverage of the country. As discussed
       in the methodology section, all variables have been scaled so that the interpretation on the
       radar is consistent. That is, all values toward the outside perimeter of the radar plot
       indicate better performance, and values toward the center show lower performance. The
       dimension-specific range is between 0 and 200 percent. Values above the 50 percent
       mark indicate that the country’s risk exposure is high since this corresponds to a debt-to-
       GDP ratio above unity, which certainly causes concern for long-term fiscal sustainability
       of spending, including for health, unless aid flows are guaranteed, which is hardly the
       case. The graphs show that debt-related sovereign risk increased by 2002, except for
       Eritrea, which limited its financial risk exposure in terms of foreign debt.

      ODA/GNI: The official development assistance (ODA) to gross national income (GNI)
       ratio is another measure of fiscal space, which is most relevant in the developing context.
       Heavy aid dependency means that external factors play an important role in cyclical
       responses and, hence, highly volatile flows can be detrimental for safety nets, including
       for health. The ODA/GNI ratio is on a positive scale in our radar plot, and the dimension-
       specific range is between 0 and 50 percent. The rationale behind keeping the values in
       their original scale is that from the perspective of countercyclical spending, donor aid
       contributes to the financing envelope, and thus, serves as an enabler to engage in
       countercyclical behavior during economic shocks. As discussed under the method
       section, given the data limitations, and since this is not the main focus of the study, for
       the radar plot analysis we assume away complicating factors, such as fungibility or the
       heterogeneity of the effect of ODA on government spending (see more in section 7 and in
       box 1.4). The graphs show that by 2001, development assistance significantly increased
       in Mozambique and Eritrea to, respectively, above 50 and 75 percent. On the dimension-



                                                   59
          specific range, this translates to reaching ODA/GNI ratios of approximately 25.0 and
          37.5 percent.

         Terms of Trade (ToT): Terms of trade captures the difference in the ratio between the
          prices of exports and imports relative to the ratio for the previous year, which shows
          whether there has been deterioration or improvement in the country’s ToT position. The
          dimension-specific range is between minus and plus 25 percent. The rationale behind this
          variable is that if a country is export-dependent and its ToT improves, this would lead to
          increased revenues. From the graphs we see that ToT conditions deteriorated from 2000
          to 2001, which would reduce the revenue base and, hence, lead to downward pressure on
          expenditures, including social and health expenditures.

     Group 3 — Political and Institutional Risk

     Although there is a single dimension for political and institutional risk, this group could be
     expanded by decomposing the index and using specific components that are the most
     relevant for cyclical behavior.

         ICRG: The Inter-Country Risk Guide (ICRG) is a political risk-rating index. The
          dimension-specific range is between 0 and 100. High values of the ICRG 60 indicate low
          risk, while low ratings indicate high risk. The majority of the subset falls at the borderline
          or barely above the 50 percent mark on the plot, which means that these countries are
          very high or high risk. This index does not show big volatility over the time period. There
          is one clear case of rate deterioration for Nigeria by 2002, which already started from a
          lower baseline value compared to the group mean. This variable is relevant because
          complex political economy has been shown to be associated with worse performance on
          fiscal management (Braun and Di Gresia 2003; Calderon and Schmidt-Hebbel 2008;
          Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza 2010; IDB 2009; IMF 2009), specifically, with more
          propensity for fiscal profligacy. Some of the policy options recommended in the literature
          have been, for example, establishment of natural resource funds in resource-rich
          countries (Brahmbhatt and Canuto 2012) and fiscal targets (Braun and Di Gresia 2003).
          Since cyclicality patterns have been claimed to be systematically different for resource-
          rich countries, this is another factor that could be explicitly controlled for in econometric
          modeling.

8.4.3. Broad brushstroke findings from radar plots by income group

Since the previous section used selected countries from Sub-Saharan Africa (which represent
mostly the low-income group) to illustrate the interpretation of the dimensions of the radar plot,
in this section we discuss only examples from the three other income groups. For the low-income
context, we provide only a brief summary of messages.

Risk: 0 to 49.9 points; (b) High Risk: 50 to 59.9 points; (c) Moderate Risk: 60 to 69.9 points; (d) Low Risk: 70 to 79.9. points; and
(e) Very Low Risk: 80 to 100 points.


                                                                60
8.4.3.1. Low-income countries

For the selected countries in the low-income context, the correlation coefficients predominantly
show procyclical responses for both fiscal and government health expenditures during the 16-
year study period (table 9A.3 in annex 9). However, there is evidence that low-income countries
do engage in countercyclical policies during downturns. For example, correlation coefficients in
the fiscal domain show consistent tendencies for fiscal stimulus in Bangladesh, Nepal, and
Eritrea (respectively, the values are -0.34, mild correlation; -.74, strong correlation; and -0.28,
weak correlation, by standard thresholds). Based on our sample, however, fewer low-income
countries engage in countercyclical government health spending, namely, Eritrea and
Mozambique (respectively, with correlation coefficients of -0.58, mild correlation; and -0.23,
weak correlation). We hypothesized social sensitivity and preferences, as well as official
development assistance for health to be among the drivers of countercyclical polices.

8.4.3.2. Lower-middle-income countries

The figures show the radar plots for the Middle East and North Africa (MEA) (figure 11A.1 in
annex 11) and South Asia (SAS) (figure 11A.2 in annex 11) regions. In these plots, we focus on
the lower-middle-income subset. 61 The time frames for the analysis are 2001–04 for the Middle
East and 2000–03 for South Asia.

Comparing the plots for the two regions, the overall impression is that, on average, performance
in the South Asia region is lower in all dimensions. The main message for the countries selected
from South Asia is that, based on the observed cyclical correlations during the 16 years, both
India and Sri Lanka show a higher propensity to practice countercyclical fiscal policy, but health
prioritization has not been similarly demonstrated between 1995 and 2010. This finding is
confirmed for Sri Lanka by the results shown in the radar plot between 2000 and 2004. However,
for India we observe some countercyclical responses. In 2001, there is a positive cycle for health
expenditures, showing a 4 percent expansion. In 2003, there is a positive cycle for general
government spending, showing a 5 percent stimulus. However, during this year of fiscal
stimulus, health prioritization falls behind since the GHE cycle is negative.

As for the Middle East and North Africa region, the results for the correlation coefficients
between 1995 and 2010 show countercyclical tendencies only for Iraq in government health
expenditures (table 9A.3 in annex 9). The results for all other lower-middle-income MEA
countries reported in the table are procyclical.

However, when the statistics are disaggregated — as shown in the table and the radar plots (table
9A.1 in annex 9 and figure 11A.1 in annex 11), which capture the annual responses —
countercyclical spells are observed for other countries, as well. This illustrates that using average
measures, which mask crisis-specific responses, can be misleading.

To offer some examples, during a negative GDP cycle in Egypt (green line) in 2002,
countercyclical responses are observed in both the fiscal and health dimensions. The expansion,
measured in terms of standard deviation of the output gap, is higher for health (table 9A.1 in

61. In the MEA region, the LMICs include Egypt (EGY – green line), Iran (IRN – yellow line), Iraq (IRQ – grey line), and Tunisia
(TUN – red line). In the SAS region, India (IND – green line) and Sri Lanka (LKA – yellow line) fall into the LMIC group.


                                                              61
annex 9). However, while in 2003 the countercyclical behavior continues in fiscal response, the
health response reverses and becomes procyclical. Iran (yellow line) also shows a tendency for
countercyclical responses in health spending in the target period, with a health stimulus in both
2001 and 2002 during negative GDP cycles. For Iraq (grey line), the GDP cycle shows
significant negative deviation in 2003, during which there is fiscal adjustment (-0.87 negative
output gap). However, this does not affect the health sector, where we see a stimulus (1.54). The
contrast between fiscal and health spending could imply a foreign aid effect that was targeted
toward the health sector. Unfortunately, official development assistance (ODA) or development
assistance for health (DAH) observations are missing for Iraq for the time period and, thus, we
must rely on alternative data sources, which may not be fully consistent with our database.

8.4.3.3. Upper-middle-income countries

Within the upper-middle-income group, we focus on selected countries 62 from Latin America
(figure 11A.3 in annex 11). The target window is 2000–02.

Reviewing the average correlation coefficients for the full period of this study (1995–2010)
(table 9A.3 in annex 9), countercyclical behavior is observed in the fiscal domain during a
negative output gap in Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. The health response is also
countercyclical, on average, for Chile, Colombia, and Peru, while the result for Mexico suggests
an overall procyclical pattern.

The annual statistics on cycle trends (table 9A.2 in annex 9) largely support these observed
generalized patterns. However, we see that the 2001 crisis crowded out resources from health;
for example, in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru the government health expenditure cycles are
negative. The 2001 crisis showed the need to channel more of the fiscal stimuli toward the health
sector during downturns; hence, it has been instrumental in catalyzing the improvement of social
safety nets (see more in box 1.9).

Box 1.9 Pioneering Countercyclical Social Policies in Latin America — Lessons for the Health
Sector

While the cycle statistics show mixed results, there have been a number of successful social responses in
this region, as described by Braun and Di Gresia (2003), and also by more recent studies by Quiroga
(2012), Hernandez (2012), and Perez (2012).a

Undoubtedly, the crises during the selected time frame and recently have catalyzed efficiency
enhancements and played a role in simulating more socially sensitive government responses. The
witnessed countercyclical responses in social protection and education have improved social safety and
contributed to human capital formation. The region has been a pioneer in conditional cash transfer
programs, including the first nationwide social safety net in the region, Oportunidades, founded in
Mexico in 2002 based on the earlier program Progresa. Other programs are Familias en Acción,
established in 2002 in Colombia; Jefes de Hogar, launched in Argentina in 2002; Juntos, established in
Peru in 2005; Bolsa Familia in Brazil, which played an important role in the 2006 presidential elections
and which today is the largest nationwide scheme; and Asignacion Universal pro Hijo, a universal child

62. The selected countries are Argentina (ARG), Chile (CHL), Colombia (COL), Mexico (MEX), and Peru (PER).


                                                             62
allowance program for children of workers in the informal sector or unemployed, started in 2009 in
Argentina.

These pioneering efforts and success stories in strengthening social safety nets are welcome and
exemplary. Yet, as noted by Darby and Melitz (2008) and Doytch, Hu, and Mendoza (2010), a sector-
specific countercyclical strategy is not equivalent to the aggregate cyclical patterns of social sectors.
Therefore, understanding which sectors benefit from fiscal stimuli and where the health sector stands in
the overall prioritization are important. As an example, in the Europe and Central Asia region, there have
been claims that the health sector did not harness the upgrades to the general social protection platforms,
so even if targeting and access improved for some programs, the health dimensions may not have
improved proportionately. This suggests that it is important to have health sector–specific countercyclical
strategies, and to improve the synergies and coordination between social protection and health sectors
(see more on this in chapters 1 and 4 of Hou et al. 2013).

the Impact.” Chapter 3 of Hou et al. (2013) presents the mitigation experience for Colombia.


8.4.3.4. High-income countries

The summary statistics on correlation coefficients for the study period paint a flattering
performance for many countries, such as Estonia, Finland, Ireland, and Sweden, showing a
countercyclical relationship between GDP and fiscal spending and GDP and health spending
during negative output gap (table 9A.3 in annex 9). However, examining annual responses
during the target period (2008–10), we observe that, for example, Estonia, Finland, and Greece
engaged in fiscal adjustment in 2010. With respect to health spending, Estonia, 63 Finland,
Greece, 64 Ireland, 65 Sweden, and Canada engaged in health spending adjustment in 2010 (figure
11A.4 in annex 11). Portugal’s 66 performance is countercyclical based both on the aggregate
statistic and the performance during the recent economic crisis. In North America, while the
United States shows more persistence in countercyclical fiscal spending, Canada has
countercyclical responses in both fiscal and health expenditures. But countercyclical responses in
Europe and North America are the product of more than just the recent economic crisis. On the
other hand, despite the common expectations of general propensity for countercyclical responses
during crises, we observe procyclical adjustment responses in 1998, following the 1997 Asian
financial crisis, in Japan and the Republic of Korea.

Overall, these broad brushstroke facts suggest that even the most advanced and some of the most
socially sensitive countries are not immune to crises. The empirical analyses have provided
evidence that countries with good track records can fall back. Vulnerability to shocks is more
likely in high-income countries that face structural and system-level challenges to social and

health financing (for example, aging, rigidities in social security systems, and presence of
technology-induced cost drivers). When these challenges to health financing are coupled with
tightening fiscal space (for example, measured by increased debt-to-GDP ratios and fiscal
deficit), countries are forced into addressing more complex structural issues, which require
longer-term planning and skillful management of politically sensitive reforms. More contextual
interpretation for the effects of the crisis in Europe and its implications for health sector
responses are discussed in box 1.7, above. The final message is that while advanced economies
have relied more on automatic stabilizers and have more developed social safety nets, the global
crisis has shown that even the most advanced economies cannot afford top to be complacent.

                                   8.5. DIAGNOSTIC MODELING

Using multivariate analysis, we aim to explore the relevance of a number of variables that are
expected to be significant drivers of cyclical responses, based on theory, earlier empirical
evidence, and the descriptive results presented so far. As laid out under the methods section, this
diagnostic analysis first includes an exploration of the nonparametric relationship between the
business and government health expenditure cycles and then turns to the multivariate
specification, fitting the models both to the pooled data and to subsets by income to isolate
effects related to the level of economic development.

8.5.1. Bivariate nonparametric relationship between the business and government health
expenditure cycles

Given the focus of the modeling, prior to applying the multivariate approach we explored the
simple bivariate relationship between the business cycle (GDP growth cyclical component) and
the government health expenditure cycle (GHE growth cyclical component) using nonparametric
regression. The results, which are graphically illustrated through fit lines, show the unconditional
relationship between these two cycles.

The key finding is that income-group–based results (panels A–D of figure 12A.2. in annex 12)
differ markedly from the results for the pooled global sample (figure 12A.1 in annex 12). The
patterns are consistent with the findings in the broader literature and the take-away messages
from the discussion of the radar plots presented above.

However, the graphs offer a more granular picture of the nature of the relationship between the
explanatory (GDP cycle) and response (GHE cycle) variables, showing the average country
response in government health spending at a given GDP growth cycle. Briefly, the story line for
the income groups is that countercyclical responses are more marked in the upper-middle and
high-income groups (panels C and D of figure 12A.2 in annex 12). For developed economies,
there is a clear and sharp upward kink that brings the curve above zero on the y axis, which
signals a positive GHE cycle at low levels of the GDP cycle (significant contraction). This kink
is the most pronounced for high-income countries, where around minus 4.5 percent on the x axis
(GDP) the GHE cycle approaches 6 percent on the y axis. In the developing context, for lower-
middle-income countries we can hardly detect a countercyclical response, except for very close
to the point that represents economic stagnation (zero on the x axis), where the GHE cycle is at
approximately 1 percent (y axis). For low-income countries, it takes a large negative cycle to
trigger a very weak countercyclical response, which barely surpasses the zero point on the y axis.


                                                64
This implies that even with official development aid, which is expected to play a role in contexts
with deeply negative GDP cycles, there is little response in GHE. For lower-middle-income
countries, and even more so for upper-middle-income countries, it is during periods of high
growth (5 percent above the trend line) that there are large-scale expansions in the health sector.

8.5.2. Diagnostic multivariate linear modeling

Although the nonparametric results show that the relation between economic performance and
health spending is best fit by a cubic polynomial, we decided, for ease of interpretation, to apply
the linear relationship as the coefficient of interest.

8.5.2.1. Model specification

        Dependent Variable: For the dependent variable, we test the cyclical component of
         government health expenditures (GHE cycle 67) to explore how cycles change, conditional
         on a set of covariates.

        Independent Variables: The covariates include the business cycle (GDP cycle); fiscal
         policy (GGE cycle); the interaction of economic growth and fiscal policy (GDP-GGE);
         political regime (polity 2); political and economic risk and governance (ICRG); changes
         in the terms of trade (TOT); the extent of official development assistance (ODA/GNI per
         capita); debt-to-GDP ratio (debt/GDP); tax revenues as share of GDP (tax/GDP), and the
         indicator variables for income group and region to isolate the effect of development level
         and regional variations. The rationale for selecting these variables was provided under the
         section that discusses the dimensions of the radar plot (see section 8.4).

        Interpretation of Coefficient Estimates: As to the interpretation, for example, when the
         beta coefficient for the business cycle (GDP cycle) is negative, this stands for
         countercyclical government health expenditure responses, while a positive coefficient
         indicates a procyclical relation. The cycles are measured in terms of the deviation from
         the smoothed trend line, and the metric used here is deviation in percentage term —
         specifically, the change in percentage terms in the dependent variable as a result of a one-
         unit change in the independent variable.

8.5.2.2. Modeling approach

Starting with the proposed basic model specification, we apply step-wise modeling; that is, we
systematically expand the model with additional covariates or sets of covariates. The main model
types tested are as follows (see table 1.10 for overview):

     Model 1: Bivariate Base Model: Explores the relationship between the triggering GDP
      cycle and the observed GHE cycle, which is the response variable.



67. We also considered using the cyclical correlation as the dependent variable. However, because there are only 183 data
points, and these are calculated for the 15-year study period, this was not practical given the limitations on degrees of freedom
and adding covariates to test complex multivariate relationships.


                                                              65
      Model 2: Multivariate Model-1: Compared to the Bivariate Base Model above, this adds
       the fiscal cycle as a control variable to explore how the observed effect on the GHE cycle
       is channeled through; whether growth (GDP) or fiscal response (GGE) has a relatively
       bigger role.

      Model 3: Multivariate Model-2: This model specification includes an interaction term
       between the business and fiscal cycles (GDP and GGE cycles). Essentially, this captures
       the extent to which the business cycle and fiscal response are intertwined and reinforce
       each other (comovement) or, for example, in the case of automatic stabilizers, if there is
       some attenuation of the effect of the business cycle (opposite movement).

      Model 4: Multivariate Model-3: Building on the previous model, this specification
       includes a number of additional covariates that were selected as potential explanatory
       factors of cyclical responses, including political regime, political and economic risk,
       debt-to-GDP ratio, tax revenue base as a share of GDP, and terms of trade.

      Model 5: Multivariate Model-4: This variation includes the indicator variables for region
       to isolate any region-specific effect.

      Model 6: Multivariate Model-5: This specification includes the indicator variables for the
       World Bank income groups to isolate any systematic variation in cyclical responses by
       the level of economic development.

In addition to this basic, step-wise expanding model specification for the pooled sample, we also
ran regressions by income groups. The model types applied to the subsets are identical. To
distinguish in the summary tables, the code for the income group is included in the model name
(for example, Model-3_LIC). In this set, there is one additional model, which includes official
development assistance as a covariate. Since this variable is meaningful only for developing
countries, it is included in the regressions for the low-and lower-middle-income groups. For
these models, in addition to the model number and income group code, the model labeling
includes the term “ODA”:

      Model #_IG_ODA: This model includes ODA as an additional control variable, and
       given the relevance, it is only included in the models for the low- and lower-middle-
       income groups (LIC and LMIC).

Finally, as discussed, to explore the cyclical responses during bad and good times, these models
were run for the pooled data and also separately when the GPD cycle is negative (downturn) and
positive (boom).

8.5.2.3. Main findings from the diagnostic models

The model statistics and coefficient estimates for the specifications discussed above are
presented in summary tables in annex 13. Below is an overview of the main findings and
limitations, starting with the results for the pooled data.

First, the results in table 13A.1 in annex 13 for Model 1 suggest that while the coefficient
estimate for the business cycle (GDP cycle) is statistically highly significant and the magnitude
of the effect of the economic cycle on government health expenditures is large (0.427), as the
adjusted R-squared statistics show, the business cycle alone explains only roughly 1 percent of
the variation in government health expenditure behavior. Given this low explanatory power,
multivariate exploration is essential. In Model 2, the addition of the fiscal cycle (GGE cycle)
increases the adjusted R-squared statistics to 7.8 percent, meaning that, in general, the fiscal
cycle is a better predictor for government health expenditure cycles. As observed between the
business and government health expenditure cycles, there is also a positive relationship between
the fiscal and government health expenditure cycles. This means that economic growth is
associated with fiscal expansion, which in turn is associated with increased government health
expenditures.

In Model 2, both beta coefficients are highly statistically significant and their magnitude is
comparable, although the coefficient estimate for the fiscal cycle is slightly higher (0.278),
implying that an improvement in the fiscal cycle has a bigger effect on government health
expenditures than the effect of GDP growth on health expenditures. In fact, Model 3 confirms
this, and the magnitude on the beta coefficient for the interaction term between the economic and
fiscal cycles (GDP-GGE) suggests that when it rains, it pours.

In Model 4 — which includes the control variables for political regimes, political and economic
risk, and fiscal space — we see a small improvement in the explanatory power of the regression,
which now explains approximately 11 percent of the variation in government health expenditure
cycles. However, among the additional covariates, only terms of trade is statistically significant.
Its sign is, as expected, negative, meaning that an improvement in the terms of trade (that is, an
increase in export prices or decline in import prices) puts negative pressure on government health
expenditures. Notably, in this model, which includes more of the expectedly relevant covariates,
although we do not see statistically significant effects, the relative magnitude of the effect of the
business and fiscal cycles changes, economic fluctuation now being more important in
determining the government health expenditure cycle.



                                                 67
In Model 5 and Model 6, which control for regional and income group effects, we see no
statistically significant coefficient for any of these indicator variables, meaning that in this
current specification it is not possible to isolate regional and development-level–specific
response behavior. This is likely because, as discussed during the descriptive analyses, both
regional and income-group–based averages mask significant variation in cyclical responses.

Although the coefficients for income group are not significant in this diagnostic model for the
pooled data, based on the results from the nonparametric regression, we expect that income-
level–specific behavioral responses can be detected if we run separate regressions by income
group. Hence, we test these specifications for the subsamples and present the results for both
“bad” and “good” times (see table 13A.2 in annex 13). Since we concluded that some of the
basic specifications, such as the bivariate case (Model 1), have low explanatory power and,
hence, merit no further discussion, not all models are presented in the overview tables.

From the two sets of model specifications (Models 3 and 4) presented for the negative GDP
cycle scenario, we focus on the variants of Model 4 (table 13A.3 in annex 13), because this set
includes more covariates and, hence, allows for a richer discussion of the findings.

First, the coefficient estimates for the business cycle show significant variation across the
models, comparing the beta estimates for the pooled data (Model 4-P) and the subspecifications
for each income group (Models 4 LIC-HIC). Importantly, the change in the slope of the
coefficient estimate shows a systematic trend, reducing from 1.258 for LICs to -0.355 for HICs.
Although not all of these coefficients are statistically significant, the change in the slope suggests
that economic growth is more important in determining government health expenditure cycles in
developing countries (beta coefficients for LICs and LMICs are, respectively, 1.258 and 0.726).
For the upper-middle-income group we see that the fiscal cycle becomes more important (the
beta estimate for GDP cycle is 0.104 while for the GGE cycle it is 0.259). For the high-income
group, the sign reverses to negative, which indicates a countercyclical response in government
health expenditures.

The magnitude of the coefficient estimates for the interaction term for the business and fiscal
cycles suggests that comoving macrofiscal dynamics puts heavier pressure on government health
expenditures, while relatively more stability at the high-income level helps smooth out health
expenditures. In addition to the terms of trade variable, which we noted earlier to be significant
with the expected sign in the model for low-income countries that includes ODA as a covariate,
we see that ODA is not only statistically significant, but once it is included (beta = 0.364), the
magnitude of the coefficient estimate for the GDP cycles reduces (from 1.258 in Model 4 LIC to
0.549 in Model 4 LIC_ODA), implying that development assistance does enable expenditure
smoothing in health.

There are two further variables that are statistically significant in the models for the lower-
middle-income group (Model 4 LMIC and Model 4 LMIC_ODA). One is the proxy for political
regime, which captures the extent of democratization on a scale of minus 10 to plus 10. The
result is not consistent with our expectation, since the sign is negative, which would imply that a
higher level of democracy score is associated with lower government health expenditures during
negative GDP cycles. Although the magnitude of the estimate is low (-0.003), this result requires
further fine-tuning in the specification and definition of variables that aim to capture political and


                                                 68
economic aspects. The other significant variable is debt-to-GDP ratio, with the expected negative
sign, which means that a higher level of indebtedness is associated with bigger downward
pressures on government health expenditures. Overall, in the developing context, the model
specifications that include ODA seem to perform best, with an explanatory power at 16 percent
for LICs and 14 percent for LMICs. For high-income countries, the business and fiscal cycles
play a less determining role compared to their developing peers, reflecting more stability and
smoothing, thanks to automatic stabilizers and safety nets. However, we see a negative terms of
trade effect, which suggests vulnerability as a result of fluctuations in relative prices.

The results for positive GDP cycle presented in table 13A.5 in annex 13 are less robust and
intuitive, since the relationships are less systematic and there are fewer covariates overall that are
statistically significant. The only pattern worth mentioning is that while during the negative GDP
cycle we only observed positive relationships between the business and fiscal cycles, here the
signs of the coefficient estimates for fiscal cycle are negative for the upper-middle-income and
high-income groups, suggesting countercyclical tendencies.

Overall, these rudimentary diagnostic models support the claim that government health
expenditure cycles are driven by complex underlying dynamics; hence, more advanced
multivariate specifications, including nonlinear and dynamic modeling, are required to isolate
effects and understand the causal pathways. From the diagnostic runs we conclude that the
impact of business cycles is larger in developing countries than in advanced economies, and that
the fiscal pathway is critical in determining government health expenditures. This means that
although economic growth trajectories do matter, fiscal response from governments can
outweigh or at least attenuate income effects. There are three notable macro effects that make
countries more vulnerable in terms of government health expenditures: deterioration in terms of
trade and debt-to-GDP ratios for all income groups, and unpredictable ODA in developing
countries. With respect to political economy, governance, and risk, since neither proxy variables
performed as expected, these variables require improved specification and testing. Besides these
effects, while we expected to isolate income-group–specific and regional variation, in the pooled
models neither of these dimensions was statistically proven.

Given the limitations of linear and static modeling, and since there is evidence that responses are
not necessarily linear and most likely are dynamic, given the policy response lags, in an
extension of this paper we will explore panel data methods using both lagged and fixed effects to
account for effects that are not contemporaneous but spill over to the next year, and to wipe out
country-level characteristics that do not change over time. Causal analysis will require careful
identification of the pathways and application of instruments to solve for endogeneity, namely,
that the same underlying dynamics that move government health expenditure cycles also affect
GDP and GGE cycles.

                  9. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

Based on the foregoing review of literature and empirical analyses, we conclude and offer some
thoughts regarding the limitations of this study, and the macro data and approach in general.




                                                 69
In this paper, we set out to explore the relationship between business cycles and government
health expenditures. The analysis in the paper also considers the intermediating channel, the
cyclical patterns in fiscal responses. The motivation for the study was twofold.

First, with respect to the policy trigger, the recent global economic crisis has resulted in
surprising trends in cyclical responses in health. It has demonstrated that formerly stable and
socially sensitive advanced economies can fall back into the procyclical trap. However, the crisis
had relatively less impact in developing and emerging economies, and in these cases there are
positive examples of graduation from procyclical behavior. Second, with respect to the research
aspect, the recent wave of literature, particularly in the fiscal domain, has provided empirical
evidence on developing countries escaping the procyclical trap, while some advanced economies
have fallen back. Hence, the central question: Do we see the same patterns in the health context?

The objective of the study was to propose a user-friendly diagnostic analysis in this area. This
draws on a now publicly available synthetic macro database, the Fiscal Health Database, which
was constructed to facilitate research in this field. Since this macro database is open, annually
updated, and standardized, it can be used to replicate and update findings. Since the intended
target audience of this paper is project teams and policy units in the health sector, the methods
were chosen to enable replication and update by noneconomists. Beyond the database, the
literature review, the global overview of patterns in cyclical responses in health, and a few
descriptive analytic tools that cut across the macro and health sectors, we hope that the paper
also catalyzes more country-specific analyses to enable the identification of policy options and
responses that help countries cope with crises, specifically in the health domain.

The conclusions draw on a number of methods, including (a) a five-step process to calculate the
cyclical correlations between GDP and the two response variables of interest, general
government expenditures, and government health expenditures; (b) quadrant analysis to explore
how cyclical patterns change over time to gather evidence on graduation from and fall back into
procyclical policy making; (c) testing the role of institutional and political risk with respect to
cyclical responses; (d) a radar plot approach to increase the dimensions in the analysis that can
explain cyclical responses, and apply such radar plots to compare performance for a small set of
countries on the selected explanatory dimensions, and track the changes over time; and (e)
diagnostic multivariate modeling to create the foundations for more advanced econometric
analysis that can provide causal estimates on the drivers of cyclical responses.

                                       9.1 CONCLUSIONS

First, in contrast to the recent wave of the literature on fiscal cyclicality, which shows that an
increasing share of developing countries have now become countercyclical (Brahmbhatt and
Canuto 2012; IMF 2009; Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin 2011), in health expenditures we have no
robust evidence to claim that developing countries have been escaping the procyclical trap across
the periods 1995–2002 and 2003–10. While there are developing countries (LICs and LMICs)
that do engage in countercyclical government health spending, the evidence on increased
countercyclical behavior is robust only in the upper-middle-income group. Although government
health expenditure patterns during downturns are more predominantly countercyclical at the
higher end of the income distribution (HICs), the recent global economic crisis has shown that
even advanced economies that have robust social safety nets can fall back into the procyclical


                                                70
school, especially if the crisis is deep and protracted. Going forward, if slowing growth in HICs
couples with structural challenges (for example, demographic pressures) and rigidities of social
security systems, this would put increasingly more stress on fiscal and health sector policy
makers. With respect to the policy implications of such trends, to avoid negative social
consequences, in many countries beyond efficiency gains, structural reforms are required;
coordination between the fiscal and social policy camps will become even more important to
devise long-term economic development strategies that also take into account sector-specific
needs. 68

Second, we find that cyclicality patterns are more nuanced in the by-country descriptive analyses
and, hence, event and case study approaches would be valuable in shedding more light on the
drivers of patterns and changes over time. For example, comparing the correlation coefficients
for the 16 years of the analysis (1995–2010) with annual statistics on cycles and by countries, we
see that aggregates mask significant variation both within country groups and between years;
hence, generalizations are not particularly useful.

Third, consistent with earlier findings regarding the asymmetry of cyclicality, at the global and
aggregate levels we have weak evidence that cyclical responses during “bad” and “good” times
differ. Countercyclical responses are more likely during deep negative output gaps. In the
income group breakdown, the averages show countercyclical coefficients between GDP and
GGE (general government expenditures) for both high-income countries and middle-income
countries. However, the relationship between GDP and GHE (government health expenditures)
is only countercyclical for higher-income countries. As to regional variation, we obtain
countercyclical correlation coefficients for fiscal policy during negative output gaps in East Asia
and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America, and South Asia. Yet, only two
regions show consistent countercyclical patterns in government health spending during negative
output gaps — Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa. These results
imply that health sector prioritization, on average during this 16-year period, has not been
successful in most regions. However, caution must be exercised when interpreting averages,
since these can mask diverse responses over time. And, as a last advisory note, the regional
means are un-weighted; hence, the true impact of cyclical policies is not captured with respect to
the population-level effects of changes in cyclical policies.

Fourth, results from the radar plot analysis imply that there are a number of dimensions that can
help in understanding the variation in country performance in cyclical responses. Among the
drivers that were expected to explain the variation in cyclicality, apart from the macrofiscal
dimensions, research should drill deeper into social sensitivity, preferences, political economy,
and governance. To control for political and institutional risks, which are proved to be relevant
determinants of cyclical responses in the fiscal context, we tested the performance of the Inter-
Country Risk Guide (ICRG) index. The findings between cyclical responses and political and
economic risk, however, are not always intuitive in every income group. While the relationship
between cyclical responses and risk rating is negative (that is, higher ICRG, which means lower
risk, which is associated with more countercyclical responses) for high- and upper-middle-


68. For example, during the drafting and negotiation of the Memorandum of Understanding for countries that engage in
stabilization talks with the Troika, which consists of the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the
International Momentary Fund.


                                                        71
income countries, the relationship for low- and lower-middle-income countries is less clear. This
raises concerns regarding the predictive power of the ICRG rating for cyclical responses by
governments in the fiscal and health domains. We conclude that decomposing the index and
finding the principal components that explain the most variation in cyclical patterns is superior
and, hence, should be tested and applied in future research.

Fifth, the results from linear modeling support these findings. From diagnostic runs, we conclude
that the impact of business cycles is larger in developing countries than in advanced economies,
and that the fiscal pathway is critical in determining government health expenditures. This means
that although economic growth trajectories do matter, fiscal response from governments can
outweigh or at least attenuate income effects. There are three notable macro effects that make
countries more vulnerable in terms of government health expenditures: deterioration in terms of
trade and debt-to-GDP ratios for all income groups, and unpredictable ODA in developing
countries. With respect to political economy, governance, and risk — since neither proxy
variables performed as expected — these variables require improved specification and testing.

Finally, with respect to applicability and policy implications, we noted the methodological
limitations of descriptive approaches and, thus, conclude that advanced multivariate panel data
analysis is essential to understand the role and weight of the various dimensions in shaping
cyclical responses. We proposed that descriptive diagnostic tools, such as the tools for cyclicality
analysis presented here and the global tool developed for health system vulnerability assessment
(Velenyi, Yazbeck, and Smitz 2013) could be applied so that policy makers and practitioners are
equipped with information on the macrofiscal aspects of the possibility frontier and not only on
system capacity and constraints. This would help in developing resilience to shocks through
sectoral as well as fiscal channels. One important objective of basic diagnostic assessment would
be to inform discussions on the binding constraints to countercyclical health spending during
negative output gaps, to understand whether the main constraints lie within the sector or in fiscal
behavior. This could then inform policy options. For example, if the binding constraint is found
to be procyclical fiscal policy, then the government could improve fiscal accountability and
transparency to benefit the health sector. The application of standardized tools — applied in
country briefs and region overviews — would facilitate comparative efforts by drawing on a
common framework, measures, and definitions.

                            9.2. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

Among the limitations, we discussed concerns regarding data. Specifically, given that the paper
is based on a macro dataset that merges various sources, consistent with the findings by other
empirical researchers in this area, the main problems are consistency of variables across sources,
missing data, and continued availability and management of data to maintain an open database.

Because of data consistency, reliability, and frequency issues, country-specific applied analyses
and country briefs would be a welcome complement and validation to some of the broad
brushstroke–type stylized facts.

Finally, applying descriptive analysis is not sufficiently robust and compelling to convince the
macro camp and economists in general; hence, the health camp must advance its methods in this
area. To start addressing these limitations, in an extended and upgraded version of this paper, we


                                                72
pursue econometric analysis to control for observable and unobservable characteristics that are
expected to explain the variation in cyclical responses, and aim to obtain estimates that can be
interpreted in a causal manner.

For future research, publicly available, annually updated, standardized, and reliable data; cross-
country empirical modeling using such macro data, possibly for longer time frames; and event
analyses that use more qualitative country and policy context and fine-grained data are essential
to the evidence base evolving in this area.

 ANNEX 2: PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EXPENDITURES ON HEALTH BY INCOME GROUP, 1995–2010


To complement the overview in the text (section 5.2), this annex presents more discussion and
graphic illustration 69 of the cursory analysis of public and private health expenditure trends
during 1995–2010 by income group.
(1)    Responses in public and private health expenditures at the peak of the crisis
As text table 1.1 and figures 2A.1–2A.4 (below) show, in 2009, during the peak year of the
current global economic crisis, in all income groups the growth rate of real per capita public
expenditure on health was higher than the growth in real per capita private expenditures. This
signals the presence of automatic stabilization in the health sector at every level of economic
development, although to varying degrees.
As one example, in 2009, when the group average of GDP growth for low-income countries was
down to 1.2 percent (see the first column in table 1 and the blue line in figures 2A.1–2A.4), the
average growth rate of real per capita public expenditures on health was 7 percent, and the real
per capita private expenditure growth rate was approximately 3 percent (red line in the graphs).
Based on the real expenditure values (green line in the graphs), the group averages of the shares
of public and private expenditures on health in low-income countries were, respectively, 72 and
28 percent. This proportion suggests that — particularly in a global overview study such as this
— exploring the cyclical responses of government health financing is relevant even in the low-
income context, where the public share is the smallest compared to other groups. Nonetheless,
given the variation in public expenditure shares within income groups, country-specific event
analyses can shed more light on the specific effects of a crisis on health care financing; hence,
such explorations are encouraged in future research.
(2)    Lagged responses in public and private health expenditures
In contrast with the sharp increases in the growth rates of public and private expenditures in
2009, at the peak of the crisis, in 2010, there was a decline in the growth of health expenditures,
both public and private. In the case of low-income countries, this led to a reduction in real per
capita total expenditures on health between 2009 and 2010, from US$81 to US$78.
There are some well-known forces in play that typically explain the changes in private health
expenditures during shocks, although these are merely speculative in our context given the
aggregate level of the data. The decline in the growth rate of private health expenditures (and in
real terms in all income groups except the higher-income countries) can be due to households
switching to the public sector given that care becomes relatively cheaper 70 there. The price
differential is particularly important during downturns, when many households have reduced
income due to loss of employment or employment with lower wages.


69. The figures are presented by public and private breakdown for each income group. The variables in the graphs on
government expenditures on health include GDP growth rate, government health expenditure growth rate, and per capita
government health expenditure in constant international dollars. For the graphs on private health expenditures the variables
are GDP growth rate, private health expenditure growth rate, and per capita private health expenditure in international dollars.
70. This assumes that there are no under-the-table payments, or at least that these are below what would be paid in the
private sector, and that waiting times do not significantly increase, maintaining the shadow price of opportunity cost constant.
72. The Fiscal Health Database was compiled by Aaka Pande and Marc Smitz with input from Cesar Calderon, John
Langenbrunner, Adam Leive, Ece Ozcelik, and Edit V. Velenyi.


                                                              75
Regarding the pattern of public expenditures on health, growth rates in all income groups are
reduced in 2010. In fact, countries in the high-income group engage in downward adjustment of
health care budgets, on average, leading to a reduction of 2.4 percent. The downward adjustment
of health sector budgets has been a hotly debated topic in the context of Europe. For example,
both policy overview papers (for example, WHO 2013) and case studies on countries hard-hit by
the global economic crisis, such as Greece (Yfantopoulos 2013), Ireland (Burke, Barry, and
Thomas 2013), and Portugal (Barros 2013), discuss the health care financing, system, and
population-level implications of the recent crisis and related mitigation efforts (see more in box
1.7, which draws on chapter 5 in Hou et al. 2013).

The Fiscal Health Database is a macro panel database containing information on 193 countries
for 2,500 variables related to macroeconomics and fiscal space. The data are organized by
country (using the World Bank’s three-letter code nomenclature) and year, and include all data
available on publicly available databases as of November 1, 2012. It was created to assist with
empirical analyses linked to the Health Sector Fiscal Capacity and Sustainability Economic and
Sector Work.

The database combines information from seven publicly available databases that have country-
level data on a broad range of determinants of health spending including revenues, health
outcomes, development outcomes, equity outcomes, political climate, and labor force
participation.

Note: 1. Variables include log GDP per capita and output gap statistics for GDP, GGE, and GHE for t0, t1, t2, and t3 of the selected time frame, which varies by
region (column 5).
2. The color scheme is as follows: Dark Red: -2 > Output Gap. Medium Red: -2 < Output Gap < -1.5. Light Red: -1.5 < Output Gap < 0. Same thresholds
apply for the brackets for positive output gap, with a positive sign. That is, Dark Green: 2 < + Output Gap. Medium Green: 2 < + Output Gap > 1.5. Light
Green: 1.5 > + Output Gap > 0.
