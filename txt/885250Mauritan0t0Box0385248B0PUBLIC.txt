I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Mauritania perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Mauritania regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Mauritania;
            Their perceived overall value of the World Bank in Mauritania;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank as related to programs, poverty reduction,
               personal relationships, effectiveness, knowledge base, collaboration, and its
               day-to-day operation; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s communication and outreach in Mauritania.

       Use data to help inform the Mauritania country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In December 2011—January 2012, 215 stakeholders of the World Bank in Mauritania were
invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a
country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or
Prime Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry or ministerial
department; Project Implementation Units or Project Coordination Units; representatives of
independent government institutions; local government officials or staff; bilateral or multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; trade unions; NGOs (including CBOs); the media; diverse
ethnic and faith-based groups; political parties; academia, research institutes or think tanks; and
the judiciary. A total of 110 stakeholders participated in the country survey (51%).

Respondents received the questionnaire in three ways—in person, in the mail, or via email—and
returned the completed questionnaire similarly. Respondents were asked to indicate: their overall
attitudes toward the Bank; the importance of specific areas of the Bank’s work and the Bank’s
effectiveness in those areas; and their level of agreement with a series of statements about the
way the World Bank does business. Respondents were also asked about general issues facing
Mauritania, the Bank’s future role in Mauritania, and the Bank’s communication and outreach
efforts in Mauritania.

The questionnaire was broken into eight sections:

    1. Background Information: The first section asked respondents for their current position;
       specialization; familiarity and involvement with the Bank; and geographic location.

II. Methodology (continued)
    2. General Issues facing Mauritania: Respondents were asked to indicate what they thought
       were the most important development priorities, and which areas would contribute most
       to poverty reduction and economic growth in Mauritania, as well as rating their
       perspective on the next generation in Mauritania.

    3. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate the Bank’s
       overall effectiveness in Mauritania, the extent to which the Bank meets Mauritania’s
       needs for financial instruments and knowledge services, and their agreement with various
       statements regarding the Bank’s programs, poverty mission, relationships, and
       collaborations in Mauritania. Respondents were also asked to indicate the areas which
       they perceived as the Bank’s top priorities, the areas on which it would be most
       productive for the Bank to focus its resources and research, what the Bank’s level of
       involvement should be, what they felt were the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
       weaknesses in its work, and with which groups the Bank should work more.

    4. The Work of the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of importance
       and the Bank’s level of effectiveness across twenty-five areas in which the Bank was
       involved, such as helping to reduce poverty and bring about economic growth.

    5. The Way the World Bank does Business: Respondents were asked to rate the Bank’s
       level of effectiveness in the way it does business, including the Bank’s knowledge,
       personal relationships, partnerships, and poverty mission.

    6. Project/Program Related Issues: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement
       with a series of statements regarding the Bank’s programs, day-to-day operations, and
       collaborations in Mauritania.

    7. The Future of the World Bank in Mauritania: Respondents were asked to rate how
       significant a role the Bank should play in Mauritania’s development and to indicate what
       the Bank could do to make itself of greater value and to what reasons respondents
       attributed failed or slow reform efforts.

    8. Communication and Outreach: Respondents were asked to indicate where they get
       information about development issues and the Bank’s development activities in
       Mauritania, as well as how they prefer to receive information from the Bank.
       Respondents were also asked to indicate their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
       Information policy, their past experience requesting information, their access to the
       Internet, and their usage of the Bank’s website.

II. Methodology (continued)
Important notes on how data are reported throughout the report

It is common for the Country Survey reports to compare data over time. In the case of
Mauritania, surveys were conducted in FY ‘08 and FY ‘05. However, the respondent
composition this year was extremely different in the following way: In this year’s survey a
majority of respondents was from NGOs (including CBOs) and these respondents had very little
familiarity with the Bank. In nearly every Country Survey we see a correlation between
familiarity and positive views of the Bank; in the case of Mauritania, this is true as well. With
such a significant difference in the composition of the Mauritania samples from year to year, we
found that the standard comparison simply did not work (or was not a fair representation of the
data).

 In FY ‘08 only 17% of respondents were from NGOs and in FY 05, just three percent. As a
result it is not appropriate to compare aggregates over the years because they are relatively
different universes of respondents. Hence, in the report (and the appendices) we report findings
in the following ways:

       In the aggregate;
       Overall year to year;
       FY ‘08 compared to the non-NGO respondents (who correspond better to the other years’
        samples of respondents); and
       FY ‘12 non-NGO respondents compared to FY ‘12 NGO respondents.

The Country Survey report does not note stakeholder differences because the numbers of
respondents from each group other than NGOs was so small. However, these are reported in the
appendices. In addition, only significant differences between the groups described above are
reported in the text of the report.

It is always important to note that a Country Survey is a snapshot of views of key stakeholder
groups in a country. In the case of Mauritania this year, this is an especially interesting snapshot
of voices that might not have been heard in the past (in an objective survey effort). The findings
will be useful as one input into all of the country team's efforts to consult, listen and gather
opinions from critical audiences in the country.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position

        The majority of respondents were from NGOs. Because of the small number of
         respondents from independent government institutions, the office of the President/Prime
         Minister, academic/research institutions and think tanks, the judiciary, the office of a
         Parliamentarian, and political parties, responses from these stakeholder groups were
         combined and included in the “Other” category for all further analyses. Note there were
         no respondents from local government, trade unions, ethnic groups, or faith-based
         organizations.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location

        The majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Nouakchott. Because of

        More than half of all respondents indicated that they have been involved with or a close
         observer of World Bank activities for more than three years.

                                     Percentage of Respondents (N=77)

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank

       Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 4.4 on a
        10-point scale with 1 being not familiar at all and 10 being extremely familiar. This was
        slightly lower than the mean familiarity rating received in the FY '08 survey (4.8) and
        significantly lower than the FY 2005 survey, in which familiarity with the Bank received
        a mean rating of 7.1 across all respondents.
             Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and PIUs/project coordination
              units indicated the highest levels of familiarity with the Bank whereas respondents
              from NGOs had significantly lower levels of familiarity.

IV. The General Environment in Mauritania
Optimism

       When asked about perceptions of the future for the next generation in Mauritania, across
        all respondents, the overall mean rating was 6.2 on a 10-point scale of 1 being extremely
        pessimistic and 10 being extremely optimistic. This was significantly higher compared to
        the FY ’08 survey, in which optimism for the next generation received a mean rating of
        5.3 across all respondents.

             “Helping to strengthen mining and oil resources management”.

       There was only one instance in which there was a significant difference between ratings
        of FY ’12 non-NGO respondents and FY ’08 respondents (including all stakeholder
        groups).
             FY ‘08 respondents had significantly higher ratings of the Bank’s effectiveness in
               “Helping to improve the legal and regulatory systems” than FY ’12 non-NGO
               respondents.

       Overall, effectiveness ratings in this year’s survey were lower than in the FY ’08 and FY
        ‘05 country surveys, significantly so for “Helping to improve the investment climate for
        attracting private sector growth and foreign investment”, “Helping to strengthen the
        public financial management and procurement system”, “Helping to improve the legal
        and regulatory systems”, “Helping to strengthen the fisheries sector”, “Helping to expand
        internet connectivity”, and “Helping Mauritania adapt to/avert risk of climate change”.

VI. Overall Impressions of the World Bank (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in
Mauritania, bivariate correlational analyses were conducted on respondents’ ratings of the
Bank’s overall effectiveness in Mauritania with respondents’ ratings of the twenty-five specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific
area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness.

       Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment correlations were
        determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s overall
        effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness. The areas determined to be key drivers
        from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at helping reduce internal conflicts;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to improve the legal and regulatory systems;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to improve port infrastructure; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to bring about economic growth.

VI. Overall Impressions of the World Bank (continued)
Importance versus Effectiveness – Sector Analysis
By plotting respondents’ ratings of importance versus effectiveness, one can assess where
respondents perceived the Bank to be performing well on priority issues in Mauritania, as well as
areas in which respondents perceived the Bank to not be performing so well on priority issues,
areas in which respondents perceived the Bank was performing well, but on lower priority issues,
and areas in which respondents perceived the Bank to not be performing so well on lower
priority issues.
                            Bank relatively good and issue is a priority: Areas in this quadrant are those that
                             respondents indicated a high level of importance and gave the Bank a relatively high
                             rating of effectiveness (although it should be noted that ratings of effectiveness were
                             more than a point lower than ratings of importance). It is important that the Bank
                             continue to do well in these areas (in order of mean importance):
                                  Helping to reduce poverty;
                                  Helping to increase access and quality of education;
                                  Helping to increase access and quality of health services, including the fight
                                     against HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases;
                                  Helping to bring about economic growth;
                                  Helping to strengthen the public financial management and procurement system;
                                  Helping to strengthen the agricultural sector/food security;
                                  Helping to increase access to clean water;
                                  Helping to improve the investment climate for attracting private sector growth
                                     and foreign investment;
                                  Helping to strengthen mining and oil resources management; and
                                  Helping to improve port infrastructure (although this is on the borderline of being
                                     less of a priority).

             Helping to increase professional skills, employment and income generation,
                specifically for young people; and
             Helping to strengthen environment and natural resources management.

       Bank not so good, but issue not perceived to be a priority: Areas in this quadrant
        were those for which respondents gave the Bank a relatively low rating of effectiveness

       The Bank’s effectiveness at promoting the inclusion of local communities, local project
        experts, and civil society in strategy development all received a mean rating of 4.1 on a
        10-point scale with 1 being not at all effective and 10 being very effective.
            In all these four cases, non-NGO respondents had significantly higher mean
               ratings than respondents from NGOs.
            There was only one instance in which there was a significant difference between
               ratings of FY ’12 non-NGO respondents and FY ’08 respondents (including all
               stakeholder groups). FY ‘08 respondents had significantly higher ratings for
               “Promoting the inclusion of private sector in the development of strategies” than
               FY ’12 non-NGO respondents.

VI. Overall Impressions of the World Bank (continued)
Knowledge

       In terms of the Bank’s effectiveness at being a knowledge base in Mauritania, the Bank’s
        ability to produce “knowledge” (studies, analysis) that is useful received the highest
        mean rating, 5.5, across all respondents, on a 10-point scale with 1 being not at all
        effective and 10 being very effective.
             In all these six areas, non-NGO respondents had significantly higher mean ratings
                 than respondents from NGOs.
             There was only one instance in which there was a significant difference between
                 ratings of FY ’12 non-NGO respondents and FY ’08 respondents (including all
                 stakeholder groups). FY ‘08 respondents had significantly higher ratings for
                 “Making the results of studies and analyses readily available” than FY ’12 non-
                 NGO respondents.

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Mauritania or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The
following survey is meant to give the Bank’s team that works in Mauritania, more in-depth insight into
how the Bank’s work is perceived. This is one tool the Bank uses to assess the views of its critical
stakeholders. With this understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies,
outreach and programs that support development in Mauritania. The World Bank commissioned an
independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort in Mauritania. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey, please circle the number that most
accurately reflects your answer. If you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank.
