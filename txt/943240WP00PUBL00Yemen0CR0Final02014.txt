   1. Establishing an Enabling Environment
   Yemen has enacted several key laws to ensu re young children’s well-being. The
   National Strategy for Early Childhood Development is an important step to expand
   access and quality to preschool and other essential early childhood development
   services. Yemen could benefit from adopting additional policies. Finance systems
   are weak, and funding for the sector is inadequate.

   2. Implementing Widely
   The current scope of nutrition programs does not address the acute need for
   nutrition interventions among young children and pregnant women. Existing health
   and education services do not reach large numbers of families. There is inequity in
   access to services between urban and rural areas, and poorer and wealthier
   citizens.

   3. Monitoring and Assuring Quality
   Some data on early childhood development access and outcomes are available,
   but the types of data and number of children tracked could be expanded. There
   are few established quality standards for early childhood development services,
   although more standards are in development. There are few mechanisms for
   monitoring compliance with standards.

The Government of Yemen (GoY) has developed a
National Strategy for Early Childhood Development (2011-
2015) and is seeking funding to implement it. Among
other goals, the strategy seeks to increase preschool
enrollment from its current very low level. The ECD sector
faces a number of challenges, including inequity in access
to health, nutrition, and education services; lack of quality
standards and monitoring echanisms; and inadequate
funding. Weak institutional and governmental capacity —
particularly in the country’s many rural areas — makes
policy implementation difficult.

                        spending in the health sector, number of children enrolled in preschool by region, and the percentage of
                        children enrolled in preschool by socioeconomic status. Some of this information could be housed on the
                        database on preschools in the MoE.

                        preschool. Healthcare providers could also track individual children’s health outcomes.

 Assuring Quality
                        teacher training modalities. Consider requiring preschool teachers to complete a course on ECD, as long as the
                        course is accessible and affordable.
                    x   Pass regulations for service delivery and infrastructure standards for preschools to ensure children’s learning
                        and safety.
                    x   Set clear procedures and standards for preschool registration and accreditation.
                    x   Establish monitoring and supervisory mechanisms for preschools to ensure compliance with standards as they
                        are developed.

The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all
parties with a stake in educational results—from administrators,
teachers, and parents to policymakers and business people—an
accessible, objective snapshot showing how well the policies of their
country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that all
children and youth learn.

This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Early Childhood
Development.
