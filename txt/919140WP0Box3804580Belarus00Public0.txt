THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

       Obtain an approval of the company name with the Registry Office

       Since September 1, 2011 it is possible for companies situated in Minsk
       to obtain approval of the company's name on-line through the web-
       portal of the State Register at www.egr.gov.by (Electronic registration     1 day            no charge

       Business registration with the State Registry

       According to the point 25 of the Decree No.1 the actual registration
       takes 1 day by law but up to 5 days in practice. After that the
       representative of the state registry during 5 working days (7 calendar
       days) should inform state agencies of the company's registration (tax
       agencies, state insurance agency RUP ""Belgosstrakh"", statistics
       agency, Social Security Fund).

       Private Limited Company is no longer required to have a Memorandum
       of Association and may now register only with Articles of Association.
       The amount of cost depends on the size of base quantity, valid by the
       day of registration, and equals to 3 base quantities. Since October 01,
       2013 the cost of the base unit is BYR 130,000.

      Receive confirmation of registration with the Social Security Fund,
      RUP Belgosstrakh and Tax Inspection

      After the registration of the company a letter needs to be sent to the
      Social Security Fund, RUP Belgosstrakh (professional insurance body)
      and Tax Agencies. Usually Registry Office sends this letter. By law the
      time is 7 days.
      In this letter an entrepreneur needs to indicate information about the
      director, chief accountant, settlement accounts of the company in a
      bank and other relevant information.

      Some of the administrative bodies require copies of constituent
      documents, orders on appointment of director/chief accountant, their
      employment contracts and some other documents.

      An entrepreneur must receive from registering state authority
      certificates approving registration with tax authority and other
      controlling bodies (within 5 working days after state registration).

      Make a company seal

      There are no laws requiring a business to purchase company seal.
      However, the company seal is required for consignment notes and for
      certain bank transactions and power of attorney. Government agencies,
      such as the tax authority, would have no legal grounds for refusing
      documents that do not have a company seal. Nevertheless out of habit,                  BYR 100,000-

      most limited liability companies would purchase a seal. In addition, for                 200,000

        technical requirements must be obtained. The request form must
        contain a brief description of the intended building project and
        company documents.

        On April 26, 2007 the Minsk City Municipality passed Decision # 859
        according to which applicants can choose to obtain technical
        conditions or request the Centre of Engineering Services to obtain
        them on behalf of the applicant. Prior to this reform, the Centre used to
        be under the Department of Technical Conditions of the Committee of
   1    Architecture and City Construction. Now the Centre operates as a semi-      30 days          no charge
        private entity and if the work load increases, it can recruit additional
        human resources. Another significant improvement is that the Centre
        could not receive payments in advance when it was a state entity. This
        led to serious delays and lack of funds for paying the consultants. Now
        applicants can pay the Centre in advance and secure fast service. The
        Centre does not provide a fast track service yet.

        After the documents are submitted to the Reception Desk they are
        forwarded to the respective departments, and if the applicant wishes to
        obtain the technical conditions through the Centre, the documents are
        directed internally to the Centre.

        Changes to the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers N 223 (February
        20, 2008) “On Some Measures to Improving Architectural and
        Construction Activity” have been recorded to have impact on all pre-
        approval procedures. Specifically, the procedure for obtaining the

      the above Resolution used to be 30 calendar days. Now the official
      time-limit is 20 working days which is the same number of days.
      However, often cases as simple as the one in the Doing Business case
      study are cleared in 20 calendar days, before the official time-limit
      expires.

      The City of Minsk and its Committee of Architecture and City
      Construction have obtained sophisticated equipment for scanning
      drawings and plans. Internally, all respective departments have access
      to this network that allows them view updates to the cadastre. Since
      2004 the City of Minsk and its Committee of Architecture and City
      Construction work under a new software system that allows all internal
      documentation to be controlled for time-limit compliance. Time limits
      are strictly followed and enforced by the authority. However, if they are
      not respected, the silence-is-consent rule does not apply. But they can
      resort to writing a formal complaint to the Head of Committee and to
      the State Control Authority. The latter is a special body that is
      responsible for ensuring the compliance of all state authorities with
      existing legislation. Besides an administrative penalty and fine of 300
      minimal base indices, the officials may be charged with criminal
      offense.

      All services that issue technical conditions have a time limit of 7
      working days during which the approvals must be granted. All the
      approvals can be obtained in parallel. The services that are involved
      and would be required for BuildCo’s case are: water/sewage, telephone,
      sanitary epidemiological authority, ecological department and fire
      safety. By law all technical conditions are granted free of charge.
      However, if it is done through the Centre for Engineering Services there
      is an fee -- for BuildCo's case, it would be approximately BYR
      1,000,000.00.

      Obtain the building permit

      BuildCo applies to the Inspection of State Construction Supervision
      Department of Minsk City (from hereon, "the Inspection") to obtain a
      permit for construction and mounting works. The following documents
      must be submitted:

      •        Decision of Minsk City Executive Committee on permission of
      construction;
      •        Positive conclusion of the state examination of the project
      documentation;
      •        Decision on the approval of the project documentation;
      •        Payment order confirming the transfer of the fees payable
      from the cost of construction and installation work.

      The construction permit is granted within 3 working days according to
      the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of Belarus No.156 of February
      17, 2012 "On approval of a single specification of administrative
      procedures carried out by government agencies and other bodies in
      relation to legal entities and individual entrepreneurs".

      According to the Regulations on the financing of the Department of
      Inspection of Control and Supervision of the Construction of the State
8     Committee for Standardization, approved by the Council of Ministers of      3 days     BYR 5,657,853
      the Republic of Belarus of 09.08.2013 № 704, the fee to obtain the
      building permit is 0.35% of the value of the construction and
      engineering works for projects with private sector financing. For
      construction projects with an estimated duration of 12 months or less,
      an advance payment of 50% of the total estimated amount of the
      payment must be paid during the application for construction permit.
      The remaining 50% of the fees is paid before obtaining the occupancy
      permit. The payment is done at the bank, and a receipt is submitted to
      the Inspection. The duration of the construction works for the case
      study warehouse is assumed to be 30 weeks; therefore, 50% of the
      construction and installation costs have to be paid at the time of
      applying for the building permit.

      If no complaints are filed on behalf of neighbors during the 6 months
      of construction BuildCo may never receive inspection from the
      Inspection. The Inspection has only 40 inspectors who issue approval of
      permits and conduct inspections. The average count of sites per
      inspector is 30 per month. If the inspector shows up BuildCo can
      continue its works without interruption. The inspector will look at
      compliance of existing documents and the actual works and records of
      BuildCo’s own inspectors.

      Inspection must submit its findings to other authorities and investors.
      During the inspection the authority looks at the technical passport and
      the architect's records and must issue its conclusion within 15 working
      days.

        Request and obtain an inventory inspection and technical passport

        New buildings cannot be registered without first receiving an
        inspection from a technical inventory specialist who completes a
        technical passport. There are approximately 120 technical inventory
        specialists in the city of Minsk. Previously, the supply of inspectors was
        too low for the large volume of constructions taking place. However,
        with the slowdown of the construction sector, technical inventory
        specialists are more available to complete inspections and register new
        buildings.

        The maximum term of technical inspection prior to the registration of a
        new building was reduced up to 15 working days (21 calendar days)
        according to the Decision of the Committee on Land Resources,

        To register the building upon completing construction, BuildCo must
        apply to the Registrar's Office. The Registrar authenticates the
        documents and issues a decision.

        Resolution No. 1578 of November 21, 2007 sets a maximum time limit
        of 7 working days for buildings that already have a technical passport
        and 30 days for buildings that do not.

        State registration of a title over constructed buildings is a separate
        administrative procedure from the state registration of the new
        building. BuildCo can apply for it whether simultaneously with
        registration of building or after the building has been properly
        registered. In practice, it is common to bring an application for both
        building registration and registration of a title over it.

                    Belarus continued to improve the property registration process
                    by increasing efficiency at the land registry in Minsk, which
DB2010              reduced the time required to verify ownership, and by
                    eliminating the requirement to have incorporation documents
                    notarized during property transfers.
                    Belarus simplified property transfer by doing away with the

                    of most commercial buildings in Minsk.

                    Belarus amended regulations governing the activities of

                    creditor rights in bankruptcy.
                    Belarus enhanced its insolvency process by exempting the

                    and allowing immovable property to be sold without proof of
                    state registration in a bankruptcy auction if there are no funds
                    to pay for the registration.
                    Belarus improved its insolvency process through a new
                    insolvency law that, among other things, changes the
                    appointment process for insolvency administrators and

                    encourages the sale of assets in insolvency. The law also
