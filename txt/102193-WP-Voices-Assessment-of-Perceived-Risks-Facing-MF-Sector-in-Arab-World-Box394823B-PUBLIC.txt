     CGAP    Consultative Group to Assist the Poor      Despite those challenges, the microfinance sector has continued to grow. But it has done so at a much slower rate than in
                                                        many other parts of the developing world, which has deep implications for economic growth. Based on the assumption that
     DFI     Direct Foreign Investment                  knowledge is power, this report aims to understand what is holding back microfinance in the Arab World and explore ways
                                                        that the sector – so essential for job creation – can prosper and grow.

     IFC     International Finance Corporation          cards on the table, it is our hope that we begin a debate about which risks are real and pressing, and which are a product
                                                        of outdated thinking.

                                                        What is clear from this study is that perceptions of risk in the microfinance sector are changing. Stakeholders are becoming
     MFI     Microfinance Institution                   increasingly concerned with challenges like political instability, over-indebtedness, and government regulation. Critically,
                                                        these perceptions affect the choices made by microfinance institutions – choices that have a tremendous impact on the

     NGO     Non-governmental Organization              support from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in the Middle East and North Africa, undertook the task of
                                                        launching a series of leadership papers. The first is this report. It is based on the methodology of the Banana Skins annual

     the sector has been largely stagnating. In 2008, the sector’s outreach (measured in terms of credit) was 2.74 million                                                                                                                                                                               6%

                                                                                      Respondents have flagged the issue that risk perceptions clearly

                                                                                      to be the most equipped (although not fully capable in all cases)
                Well-Prepared         Prepared          Fairly Prepared
                                                                                      to address or mitigate risks and some have successfully done so
                     Unprepared            Very Unprepared
                                                                                      or are in the process of doing so. Second- and third-tier MFIs
     appear to be less equipped to handle the identified risks. At the market level, there is a clear message that risks need to be
     identified and handled accordingly in each market in order to reach the financially excluded with products and services that
     are adapted to their needs and that are delivered in a responsible manner .                      30



     Among those that do not see the sector to be well-prepared to address the identified risks, there is the view that MFIs
     operating in the region fail to see the changes taking place around them and as such they fail to develop adequate strategies
     to address such changes . These changes include developments in the economy, in technology, and in the financial services
                                      31



     business. Perhaps this study will play a role in helping MFIs better understand the myriad risks that surround them and in
     encouraging them to invest in building their risk management capacities.



     3.3 KEY TAKEAWAYS

     Based on the perceptions of the survey respondents, the key takeaway from VOICES is that external risks such as security
     and macroeconomic risks are perceived to be more imminent to the sector than internal ones. Indeed, the top four risks are
     exogenous. When we come to assess the top ten risks facing the sector, we find that HR issues both in terms of staffing and
     management quality have surfaced as prominent risks. This is an important finding for several reasons. With the changing
     regulations in the region that will allow the entry of new players into the market, the demand for qualified management and
     loan officers is likely to increase. MFIs therefore need to ensure that they have effective HR policies that will help them retain
     their staff as opposed to lose them to new competition. In addition, the executives in many MFIs across the region have held
     their positions for substantial periods of time with limited succession planning. This could have negative repercussions on
     the continuity of the sector in the near future. Finally, corporate governance was highlighted as one of the top ten risks facing
     the sector. Again, in light of the changing regulations, MFIs may be allowed to register as non-bank financial institutions,
     which would create a need for investors and as such a need for sound corporate governance.
     While the findings of VOICES suggest that the majority of the risks facing the sector are beyond the sector’s control, one
     must take this opportunity to assess whether external risks are the sole force behind the sector’s stagnation over the last
     decade. After all, instability, lack of security and macroeconomic volatility have been characteristics of our region for quite
     some time now and in a sense have become the ‘new normal’. Perhaps, VOICES can act as a first step in our effort to think
     more critically about the risks facing the sector.
