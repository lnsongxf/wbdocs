Overview | SUMMARY



Private firms are at the forefront of the development process, providing more than
90percent of jobs, supplying goods and services, and representing a significant source of tax
revenues. Their ability to grow, create jobs, and reduce poverty depends critically on a well-
functioning investment climate, defined as the policy, legal, and institutional arrangements
underpinning the functioning of markets and the level of transaction costs and risks associated
with starting, operating, and closing a business. The World Bank Group has been providing
extensive support to investment climate reforms—having supported over the period FY07–13
819 projects with investment climate interventions in 119 countries for a total estimated value
of $3.7 billion. This evaluation is designed to assess the relevance, effectiveness, and social
value as they relate to concerns for inclusion and shared prosperity of World Bank Group
support to investment climate reforms.

In this evaluation, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) finds that the World Bank
Group has supported a comprehensive menu of investment climate reforms. These reforms
were generally supported in the right countries and generally addressed the right areas of
the regulatory environment. In providing its support, the Bank Group relies on a variety of
investment climate diagnostic tools, but their coverage is incomplete.

Intervention and country case analysis shows that, within the limits of the available measures
of investment climate indicators, the Bank Group has been successful in improving investment
climate in client countries, as measured by number of laws enacted, streamlining of processes
and time, or simple cost savings for private firms. However, the impact on investment, jobs,
business formation, and growth is not straightforward, and the social value of regulatory
reforms—that is, their implications for inclusion and shared prosperity as reflected in effects
on a range of stakeholders—has not been properly included in the design of reforms and
assessment of their impact. While regulatory reforms need to be designed and implemented
with both economic and social costs and benefits in mind, in practice, World Bank Group
support focuses predominantly on reducing costs to businesses.

      Simplicity of design and good risk assessment play a special role in achieving satisfactory
      outcomes. Political instability and lack of political commitment remain major problems,
      limiting the effectiveness of investment climate reforms.

      In supporting investment climate reforms, the World Bank and the International Finance
      Corporation (IFC) use two distinct but complementary business models. Coordination within
      the World Bank Group on investment climate reforms is higher than in the rest of the Bank
      Group; but despite the fact that investment climate is the most integrated business unit in the
      World Bank Group, coordination is mostly informal, relying mainly on personal contacts.

      IEG has the following recommendations to the World Bank Group:

      Recommendation 1: Expand the coverage of current diagnostic tools and integrate them
      to produce comparable indicators so that these can capture the areas of the business
      environment not yet covered by existing tools.

      Recommendation 2: Develop a differentiated approach to identify the social effects of
      regulatory reforms on all groups expected to be affected by them beyond the business
      community.

      Recommendation 3: Ensure that the World Bank Group takes advantage of the
      complementarity and strengths of the World Bank and IFC business models when designing
      the new T&C Global Practice. Exploit synergies by ensuring that World Bank and IFC staff
      improve their understanding of each other’s work and business models. Maintain the richness
      of the two delivery models while addressing factors that discourage collaboration.




xii   Investment Climate Reforms
Introduction
World Bank Group support to investment climate reforms is an integral part of Bank
Group efforts to eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. There is a good
understanding that broad-based private investment, which is key for inclusive growth and job
creation, will only occur when the business environment is favorable. If private firms believe
that their investment is not secure, that regulation is too burdensome or unpredictable, or
that infrastructure is poor, they will not invest. A good business environment affects firm
productivity, which is the foundation for sustained improvements in living standards. Many
firm-level studies show that total factor productivity is higher in countries and regions within
countries where the business environment is more hospitable.

This evaluation is part of a programmatic series of assessments by IEG of critical aspects of
the World Bank Group’s support for financial and private sector development (PSD). It aims
to assess the extent to which the Bank Group has achieved the goal of helping its client
countries improve the investment climate in which firms operate. The evaluation coincides
with the establishment of the global practice on trade and competitiveness, which will be
the focal point of World Bank Group work on investment climate reforms. The findings and
conclusions of this evaluation are thus intended to offer insights into this aspect of the Bank
Group change process.


Definition of Investment Climate Interventions
In line with the World Bank Group operations, in this evaluation IEG adopts the definition of
investment climate interventions as support for policy, legal, and institutional reforms intended
to improve the functioning of markets and reduce transaction costs and risks associated with
starting, operating, and closing a business. Within this context, the evaluation covers World
Bank Group efforts aiming to promote regulatory reforms to improve the conditions for
firms to enter, operate, and exit in both domestic and international markets as well as in key
sectors.


Evaluation Design and Methodology
The conceptual framework of the evaluation derives from a combination of theoretical
literature and the World Bank Group’s strategic priorities and objectives. It starts with the
strategic priorities of fostering business creation and growth while taking into account the
broad social interests of all stakeholders in society, beyond just businesses. It connects specific
areas of intervention—entry, operation, and exit—and, within them, specific topics such as
registration, commercial law, and bankruptcy, which represent a good practice standard in


                     An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Overview   xiii
      business regulations. These interventions are then examined in light of specific indicators of
      output and outcomes that are directly attributable to them. Finally, these outcomes should
      be related to a number of economic development goals—including productivity, investment,
      and employment growth, and greater socioeconomic inclusion. However, because of the
      complexity and multiplicity of determinants, some well outside the scope of this study, IEG
      does not quantify this level of impact.

      Regulatory reforms affect a wide set of stakeholders in society, not just businesses.
      Furthermore, not all stakeholders are impacted evenly. Therefore, the framework takes into
      account the social and distributional aspects of investment climate reforms.

      This evaluation includes two units of analysis: interventions (such as regulations for entry,
      bankruptcy law, and so forth) and client countries. Reforms produce results at the country
      level and are not implemented in isolation—rather they are the consequence of a sustained
      and prolonged engagement with the client country. With respect to interventions, this report
      covers the period FY07–13 and includes in the analysis of performance projects that have
      been evaluated by IEG. With respect to countries, the report is based on 25 country cases
      with regulatory reforms within the period FY07–13, as well country visits for a subset of 5 case
      studies.


      World Bank Group Business Models in Investment Climate
      In supporting investment climate reforms, the World Bank Group has adopted two distinct
      business models. IFC’s business model is implemented through stand-alone advisory services.
      They are structured under a set of defined products and tend to form focused, concrete,
      short-term, and rapid interventions. They are mostly funded through internal budget and trust
      funds, with some client contribution.

      In contrast, the World Bank business model is implemented not only through analytic and
      advisory activities, but also through lending and budget support. When not funded through loans,
      advisory services are generally funded through trust funds or reimbursable advisory services.

      The World Bank is involved in upstream policy dialogue on PSD and overall economic
      reforms and supports interventions that tend to have a wider and deeper scope and to be of
      longer tenure, whereas IFC supports interventions that tend to be standardized and narrowly
      focused.

      The Latin America and the Caribbean Region is an example where investment climate work is
      jointly managed by the Bank and IFC. This collaboration fostered better client management
      and more collaborative project development, though at a high administrative cost.


xiv   Investment Climate Reforms
Each business model has its own strengths and weaknesses. A staff survey conducted
for the evaluation shows that a small share of staff (6 percent) perceived the difference
between the IFC model and the World Bank model only as a positive factor in fostering
collaboration. A significant share—30 percent—saw the existence of the two models only
as discouraging collaboration. However, the majority of staff—almost 50 percent—saw
the differences in the two models as a factor both fostering and hampering collaboration.
Hence, if properly understood and taken into account in the change process, these
differences might represent an opportunity for collaboration and impact in investment
climate work.


Investment Climate Good Practice Standard
IEG developed a good practice standard of regulatory areas. A list of regulatory areas was
created based on the top five regulatory environments, according to the World Economic
Forum (2013) and Doing Business (2013). This list is taken as a good practice standard of the
set of regulatory areas a typical country with the best regulatory environment would have. The
list includes 18 regulatory areas.

Further, IEG reviewed evidence of the extent to which the main World Bank Group diagnostic
tools cover the good practice areas. About half of the regulatory areas are covered by these
diagnostic tools. Interestingly, the areas covered by Doing Business and Enterprise Surveys are
those where the Bank Group supports client countries heavily, such as business registration,
taxation, and trade. The evidence implies that these two diagnostic tools are only partially
relevant in helping the Bank Group identify appropriate areas of intervention.


Investment Climate Portfolio
IEG classified the World Bank Group portfolio by various characteristics, with a special
focus on areas identified as priorities in the Bank Group investment climate strategy, such as
gender, fragile and conflict affected situations (FCS), and key industries.


PROJECTS AND INTERVENTIONS

Over the period FY07–13, the Bank Group supported 819 projects with multiple investment
climate interventions (a project may contain several interventions). Of the 819 projects, 476
were from the World Bank and 343 from IFC, for a total estimated value of investment
climate interventions of $3.7 billion. Of this, $350 million was from IFC and $3.35 billion
from the World Bank. Between 2007 and 2013, the World Bank Group has supported
regulatory reforms in 119 countries through nearly 15 types of interventions.


                    An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Overview   xv
      In terms of share of projects, the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network,
      the Sustainable Development Network and Finance and Private Sector Development represent
      the main networks with investment climate projects. In absolute terms, the Poverty Reduction
      and Economic Management Network has the highest number of projects with investment
      climate interventions—often in the context of development policy lending. However, within
      networks, the Finance and Private Sector Development Network has the highest proportion of
      network operations with investment climate interventions.

      IFC investment climate projects are only advisory, whereas the World Bank includes investment
      climate components in both lending and budget support operations in approximately equal
      proportions. In terms of share, one in three development policy operations include investment
      climate components, while only one in ten lending operations does so.

      The Bank Group activities in investment climate can be grouped in three main areas of the
      business environment: entry, operation, and exit. Within each of these areas, the Bank Group
      implements a number of different interventions. These interventions aim to simplify and
      streamline regulatory procedures, remove sector-specific administrative constraints, revise the
      legal framework and institutions, establish effective dialogue systems between private and
      public sectors, and harmonize procedures and systems.

      It is important to note, however, that although both institutions operate in the same space, the
      scope of their investment climate interventions is generally different, with some overlap. The
      World Bank focuses more on higher-level reforms, such as revising and harmonizing laws and
      codes, reforming institutions, developing strategies, and coordinating government agencies
      and ministries. IFC, in contrast, mostly focuses on streamlining and simplifying procedures and
      processes, providing technical assistance, and automating systems.

      In formulating solutions, the Bank Group has focused mostly on business operations and
      business entry, and the solutions varied from specific or limited interventions to comprehensive
      packages and programmatic approaches covering many different aspects of the investment
      climate. For example, in the Republic of Yemen and Vietnam the Bank Group focused on
      business entry and operations and provided a comprehensive solution package. In contrast,
      in Cambodia the investment climate interventions focused on specific areas such as trade
      promotion.

      Across interventions, licensing, permits, and administrative barriers; trade; and investment
      promotion account for almost half. There is a “division of labor” among the two
      institutions. The World Bank does interventions in trade and property rights almost
      exclusively (over 80 percent of all), as well as the majority of interventions on investment
      promotion. IFC, in contrast, undertakes more (60 percent) licensing and registration

xvi   Investment Climate Reforms
efforts. Both institutions operate equally in licensing/permits/administrative barriers and
public-private dialogue.

In terms of value, investment climate interventions are small, particularly for IFC. The average
value of one intervention is less than $1 million for IFC and less than $6 million for the World
Bank.

On average, investment climate interventions are implemented in less than 3 years
(32 months). However, as part of World Bank lending operations, the average length is
substantially higher—more than six years. The distribution of investment climate interventions
across regions and income levels shows that both the World Bank and IFC intervene mostly
in Sub-Saharan Africa (37 percent of all interventions for both institutions) and Europe and
Central Asia (24 percent for the World Bank and 17 percent for IFC), followed by the Latin
America and the Caribbean Region for the World Bank (17 percent) and the East Asia and
Pacific Region for IFC (15 percent).


GENDER AND INCLUSION

Regulations may affect various subgroups differently, and this needs to be taken into account
to achieve a level playing field.

The disadvantageous position of women in entrepreneurship has been widely documented.
Gender-specific obstacles make it harder for women than for men to start and grow
enterprises, and fewer women than men own and manage businesses worldwide.

In the investment climate portfolio, explicit targeting—either based on the entrepreneur or
the firm characteristics—is not common. Only 8 percent of all projects specifically targeted
women, and a similar percentage targeted firms based on their industry and formality status.
Targeting based on proprietor age, geographical area, or export status is even rarer. A review
of the investment climate portfolio shows that in 10 percent of cases, no targeting is done
when there are legal constraints in the countries that would make investment climate reforms
not “gender neutral.”


INVESTMENT CLIMATE IN FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED SITUATIONS

Support to PSD in FCS only started to gain attention from policy makers, donors, and
nongovernmental organizations in the last decade. Despite this, there is general agreement
that building competitive, inclusive markets and businesses is crucial for post-conflict recovery,
just as fragile situations present special challenges and opportunities for PSD. There is no
clear consensus over the most effective starting point to PSD in FCS. The debate is essentially

                    An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Overview   xvii
        about sequencing, whether “doing reforms” to improve the investment climate or “doing
        deals” with targeted enterprises and sectors should come first in a fragile environment.

        Experience with and research on PSD in FCS inside and outside the World Bank Group
        suggest that regulatory and “doing deals” approaches should not be viewed as mutually
        exclusive, but as complementary in encouraging growth in fragile environments. The 2011
        World Development Report also highlights that investment climate reforms and direct
        interventions are equally important for fragile states.

        Overall, 15 percent of investment climate projects are implemented in FCS situations. IFC shows
        a slightly higher share of such projects than the World Bank. Over time, the number of investment
        climate projects in FCS has held steady at around 12 per year, with both institutions having seen
        a fall in the number of projects over the last few years. In terms of intervention, the most common
        interventions in FCS (accounting for over 50 percent of all) are represented by licensing/permits/
        administrative barriers, investment promotion, trade, and public-private dialogue.


        INVESTMENT CLIMATE FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES

        Although some aspects of the investment climate apply to all firms participating in the
        economy, others are far more specific and can create a “micro” investment climate for firms
        with particular characteristics, or those in a particular region or sector.

        Agribusiness and tourism sectors can be engines for inclusive growth in developing countries
        and have been identified as key priority sectors in the World Bank Group investment
        climate strategy (World Bank 2011). In 17 country case studies where sectoral priorities were
        identified, all included agribusiness or the agriculture sector as key, and 10 included tourism.
        In 13 of these countries, agriculture and/or tourism growth are identified as priority or strategic
        objectives, and 9 country strategies connect growth of these sectors with overall economic
        growth and poverty alleviation.

        Investment climate projects with components that focused on agribusiness and/or tourism
        constitute 18 percent of World Bank and 16 percent of IFC investment climate projects.
        Whereas the number and value of investment projects in the World Bank does not show a
        clear trend since the creation of a practice group, the IFC advisory portfolio has expanded in
        recent years.


        Relevance of World Bank Group Operations
        IEG assesses the relevance of World Bank Group operations in investment climate at three
        levels: (i) the strategic level—do corporate and country strategies identify investment climate


xviii   Investment Climate Reforms
reforms as a priority? (ii) the intervention level—is the Bank Group offering the right set of
investment climate reforms in the right countries? and (iii) the analytical level—do diagnostic
tools adequately inform investment climate reforms supported by the World Bank Group?

The World Bank Group strategies related to investment climate reforms intend to
enhance competition, foster enterprise creation and growth, facilitate international trade
and investment, and unlock sustainable investment opportunities in key sectors, such as
agribusiness and tourism.

These strategies aim to reduce time, cost, and procedures and to simplify regulations. In
general, the strategies focus on creating favorable market conditions for enterprises and do
not take into account their impact on stakeholders in society beyond businesses. In other
words, they don’t verify or assure that broader social objectives will be protected or enhanced
through the reform.

RELEVANCE AT THE STRATEGIC LEVEL

At the corporate level, the most recent Bank Group Strategy (World Bank 2013)
acknowledges improving business climate as key to stimulate private sector investment
and jobs and to achieve the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared
prosperity. Similarly, earlier World Bank and IFC corporate strategies made improving the
investment climate a strategic pillar of PSD.

At the network level, a number of sectors have identified improving the regulatory environment
as a key aspect of their strategy. The 2002 World Bank Group PSD Strategy has the most
emphasis on investment climate activities. Other networks’ strategies have devoted attention
to the policy and regulatory environment. For example, one of the priorities of the World Bank
trade strategy is to support regulatory reform and cooperation. The most recent agriculture
strategy envisages the expansion of its role in regulatory reforms. Similarly, the most recent
energy (2013), environment sector (2012–22), and infrastructure sector (FY12–15) strategies
emphasize the importance of strong institutions, legislation, regulation, and enforcement.

In parallel to corporate and sector strategies, regional strategies identify improving the
regulatory environment as an area to support. IEG’s 25 country case studies show that nearly
all Bank Group country partnerships see a lack of competition, barriers to establishing and
operating businesses, the cost of doing business, and regulatory burdens as the main business
environment constraints. In sum, improving and supporting investment climate reforms is
viewed as a priority in Bank Group strategies at various levels. However, it is worth noting that
in very few of the countries’ own development strategies—such as in Cambodia, Georgia,



                    An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Overview   xix
     Kenya, Liberia, Rwanda, and the Republic of Yemen—were regulatory reforms specifically
     identified as an important part of the country development strategy.


     RELEVANCE AT THE LEVEL OF INTERVENTIONS

     The World Bank Group offers a broad menu of interventions. Virtually all regulatory areas for
     a business-friendly regulatory environment are covered by Bank Group interventions.

     But is the Bank Group using the right interventions in the right countries? A comparison between
     the severity of what firms see as obstacles and the intensity of Bank Group interventions shows
     a high and significant correlation, suggesting that priorities perceived by enterprise managers
     are broadly in line with interventions by the Bank Group. Furthermore, for each area of the
     business environment, IEG compared how problematic they were in countries with Bank Group
     interventions and without interventions. The results indicate that the Bank Group targets the right
     countries (those with worse initial conditions) in its support of regulatory reforms.


     RELEVANCE AT THE ANALYTICAL LEVEL

     The World Bank Group identifies the regulatory reforms it supports on the basis of
     stakeholder consultations and diagnostic analysis. IEG’s review of 25 country strategies
     indicates that, at the level of Country Assistance Strategies, the Bank Group generally has a
     sound consultation process. In India, in fact, notwithstanding the multiplicity and geographical
     distribution of the stakeholders, the consultation process included client surveys, online
     consultations, workshops, and targeted meetings. At the diagnostic level, IEG conducted a
     mapping exercise of the areas covered in the two most commonly used diagnostic tools for
     regulatory reforms—Doing Business and Enterprise Survey data.

     This mapping showed that the use of diagnostic tools was more common in World Bank
     projects (68 percent). IFC advisory projects relied on diagnostic tools in 47 percent of
     the projects; IFC relied more on government requests or stakeholder consultations when
     designing investment climate projects. Historically, IFC’s investment climate projects have
     relied on the Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services’ administrative barriers
     diagnostic reports. Over time, Doing Business started to become a de facto diagnostic tool
     for IFC. Among the projects that used a diagnostic tool, the Doing Business report has been
     used 62 percent of the time in IFC and 20 percent of the time in the design of World Bank
     investment climate projects.

     In sum, the World Bank Group has supported a comprehensive menu of investment climate
     reforms. IEG analysis indicates that improving and supporting investment climate reforms is
     viewed as a priority in World Bank Group strategies at various levels. For the interventions

xx   Investment Climate Reforms
with available data, reforms were generally supported in the right countries and generally
addressed the right areas of the regulatory environment. Finally, the Bank Group relies on
a variety of investment climate diagnostic tools, but the coverage of these tools is incomplete.


Effectiveness of World Bank Group Support to Investment
Climate Reforms
Have regulatory reforms supported by the World Bank Group improved the regulatory
environment in which businesses operate?


PROJECT AND INTERVENTION OUTCOMES

With respect to project ratings, both World Bank and IFC investment climate projects are as
successful as the rest of the portfolio. In the World Bank Group the majority of investment
climate projects achieve their development objective (75 percent in the World Bank and
55 percent in IFC). There is a significant degree of variability in the success rate of different
interventions.

Beyond ratings, to determine the impact of investment climate interventions, IEG identified
39 investment climate outcome indicators and utilized three approaches to measure results:
before and after, propensity score matching, and difference in difference. According to the
before and after method, seven of the eight World Bank Group interventions analyzed—
with the only exception of investment promotion—show a positive and statistically significant
outcome. However, the results of the other two methods are significantly different. While with
before and after almost 80 percent of the impact indicators reflected significant and positive
changes, this share drops to 30 percent and 60 percent with propensity score and difference
in difference methods, respectively. Hence the method of analysis used influences the extent
of effectiveness recorded. Simplistic methods such as before and after show a much wider
impact than more sophisticated approaches. Using difference in difference, IEG is able to
find evidence that—within the limits of available data—all but one intervention—investment
promotion—produce positive outcomes.

This conclusion, nevertheless, is qualified by at least four important considerations. First,
the great majority of indicators used in the analysis are from Doing Business and present
methodological problems that might compromise their reliability. Second, the literature on the
impact of regulatory reforms on growth, investment, entry, and jobs is extensive but presents
mixed and qualified results. Third, case studies conducted by IEG confirmed that simply
achieving improvements in outcome indicators of regulatory indicators does not guarantee
an impact on investments. This is the case, for example, of Rwanda compared to Cambodia.

                     An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Overview   xxi
       And fourth, a proper assessment of the impact of investment climate interventions must take
       into account that regulatory reforms should improve outcomes for society as a whole, not only
       for businesses.

       Overall evidence indicates that many regulatory reforms succeeded in simplifying procedures
       and reducing time and cost; however, the overall impact of these solutions on investments,
       jobs, and entry at the country level is not straightforward, as the case of Rwanda suggests.


       Gender
       IEG identified and classified 19 investment climate projects as “gender focused,” that
       is, as having the potential to address constraints that are especially binding for female
       entrepreneurs. Explicit targeting is limited in the portfolio, but even projects targeting specific
       groups do not necessarily report results for the group that was targeted. Only 11 of 19 closed
       projects targeting gender in their design report results by gender.

       Nine of 11 projects that IEG reviewed documented positive results for women. As the
       number of investment climate interventions with gender-relevant targeting (and even more
       the number of “gender-informed” projects) increases over time, it may be desirable for
       these projects to include gender-disaggregated indicators. This will allow a comparison
       of gender results achieved by interventions with explicit gender targeting (and gender-
       relevant actions) and those obtained by gender-neutral interventions, but with the potential
       to disproportionately benefit women. With the data currently available, such a comparison
       cannot be made.


       Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations
       The small number of completed and evaluated investment climate projects in FCS suggests
       that effectiveness in FCS is significantly lower than in non-FCS. Evidence from country cases
       shows mixed results and indicates the importance of political feasibility, institutional capacity
       building, and implementation assistance as determinants of performance. For example, the
       difference in the design and implementation strategy between Sudan and South Sudan led
       to vastly different results. In Lao PDR, the Bank was cognizant of local capacity limitations
       and subsequently increased technical assistance during the progression of its budget support
       operations, leading to positive outcomes.

       As highlighted in a recent IEG evaluation (IEG 2013), investment climate reforms are
       necessary but not sufficient conditions for PSD in FCS.




xxii   Investment Climate Reforms
Industry-Specific Focus
The number of evaluated investment climate industry projects is small; therefore, it is hard
to draw general findings. On average, IFC investment climate advisory projects in the
agribusiness and tourism sectors are more likely to have positive development outcomes than
the general investment climate portfolio (71 percent versus 55 percent). By contrast, World
Bank investment climate investment projects in agribusiness and tourism on average are less
successful than the general investment climate portfolio (71 percent versus 82 percent). The
difference is not statistically significant for either IFC or the World Bank .


Assessing the Social Impacts of Regulatory Reforms
Governments typically implement regulatory reform to correct perceived market failures
and improve market efficiency. Improving the social benefits of regulatory reform requires
consideration of its impact on a range of important social stakeholders, practices, and
institutions—not only businesses. The twin goals of poverty elimination and shared prosperity
guiding the new World Bank Strategy demand that regulatory reform be understood in
the context of broader social values. In practice, though, diagnostics, reform design, and
implementation tend to focus primarily on business costs.


REGULATORY REFORM AND ITS EFFECTS: THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

Regulation is often treated in academic and policy discourses as a burden, cost, or constraint
on business activity. This is principally because assessments of regulatory reform focus on the
real or perceived impact on businesses rather than on the full range of stakeholders whom
regulation affects. But regulation is not just a burden on businesses. It performs a necessary
function in enabling markets to function and in protecting public health and safety. However,
although regulatory reform often generates public goods, not all members of a population
are guaranteed to benefit equally, and some may lose out.


APPROACHES TO ASSESSING THE SOCIAL VALUE OF REGULATORY REFORM

Social value means different things to different people. How societies define social value is
likely to be influenced by a wide range of factors, including national policies, the level and
distribution of wealth, availability of infrastructure, the role of civil society organizations, and
demographic factors. Consequently, the appropriate analytical framework to measure this
value comprises a theory of change connecting regulatory reform, the actions of businesses,
and the wide variety of stakeholders with whom they interact (consumers, suppliers,
employees, investors, and others), and a wide range of social value effects. Measuring the


                     An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Overview   xxiii
       benefits and costs of regulatory reform is a difficult task. Various methodologies are available
       to measure social value, such as the social return on investment, the standard cost model, and
       regulatory impact assessment.


       ANALYSIS OF CROSS-COUNTRY EVIDENCE

       IEG reviewed all projects in the investment climate portfolio and identified 108 projects
       (87 for IFC and 21 for World Bank) with some assessment of social impacts. Some of the
       findings are as follows: (i) Formal impact assessments are conducted in only a minority of
       World Bank Group projects with investment climate interventions—about 15 percent of them;
       (ii) formal assessments do not always refer to all regulatory reforms implemented as part of
       an intervention; (iii) a large number of projects have no data, especially for the World Bank;
       (iv) only four in ten IFC evaluations, and three in ten World Bank evaluations, provided any
       data on the different kinds of social benefit for a variety of stakeholder groups; (v) in only
       13 percent of IFC projects and 1 percent of World Bank projects were specific recipients of
       the social value of regulatory reform identified; and (vi) distributional issues were examined in
       only seven projects, corresponding to 2 percent of the IFC portfolio and none of the World
       Bank projects.

       In general, projects do not define social value explicitly. There are some indications of a
       broader notion of social value making reference to environmental, health and safety, and
       other types of impact, and to nonbusiness stakeholders—but these are generally discussed
       briefly or do not appear to be fully integrated into the design, implementation, or evaluation of
       projects. Procedural indicators such as compliance cost savings do not tell us very much about
       social benefits. Business stakeholders are treated as paramount; nonbusiness stakeholders
       are barely visible. Moreover, compliance cost savings data are presented as though they are
       necessarily benefits for all businesses, yet such benefits are likely to be distributed unevenly,
       because some are better able to exploit regulatory change than others, and this might even
       generate adverse impacts for some businesses.


       Factors Affecting Delivery and Performance
       IEG reviewed World Bank Group investment climate projects to shed light on factors that
       help explain their success or failure. Implementation delays and the onset of a crisis are the
       most commonly encountered implementation problems in Bank Group investment climate
       projects. This is in part because political stability plays such an important part in the success
       of investment climate projects. Because most investment climate work relies on the enactment
       of laws, regulations, and coordination among different ministries and agencies, a committed
       and strong government is key to success.

xxiv   Investment Climate Reforms
In parallel, IEG’s 25 country case studies show that political stability, political commitment,
and reform champions are essential for the success of the regulatory reform process. This was
the case in Kenya, Nepal, and Rwanda, for example. In Rwanda a high level of commitment
enabled it to become one of the top reformers in regulations captured by the Doing Business
indicators. In Kenya post-election violence in 2007–08 derailed the investment climate
reform program. In addition, Bangladesh shows the importance of both political stability and
commitment to sustain the reform process. Similarly, IFC did not have a constant client within
the government of Nepal who could consistently champion the investment climate reforms.

Regression analysis shows that three factors under the Bank’s control—complexity of design,
inadequate risk assessment, and inadequate monitoring and evaluation—and two on the
borrower side—borrower performance and crisis—are significant determinants of project
effectiveness.

IEG’s analysis attempted to identify the complex interactions among the various factors of
performance. The results show that first, there are aspects under the control of the World
Bank Group that can reduce or eliminate the negative effect of external factors. More
specifically, inadequate borrower performance can be alleviated by having a simpler project
design, whereas a crisis can be dealt with better if the project does not have a complex
design, there is good supervision, and there is a good risk assessment. Second, two aspects
of the project implementation—simplicity of design and good risk assessment—can reduce or
eliminate most of the implementation problems. Finally, there is one factor for which no aspect
of implementation can compensate: inadequate technical design.



FACTORS OF PERFORMANCE IN FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED SITUATIONS

Evidence from country case studies points to the fact that the World Bank Group effectiveness
in FCS was contingent on a number of factors. In many FCS, overambitious projects—in
terms of scope or timing—led to less than satisfactory results. Institutional capacity building
and implementation assistance have been instrumental in determining the success of
interventions. Government ownership is also a vital success factor in FCS. And the fragile
political economy has, more than elsewhere, a fundamental bearing on the success of
investment climate interventions.


FACTORS OF PERFORMANCE IN INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC PROJECTS

A review of project evaluations suggests that three factors are associated with success or
failure: counterpart commitment; local capacity and human resource quality; and project
complexity. For IFC, agribusiness and tourism investment climate projects are more likely to

                    An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Overview   xxv
       suffer from technical design issues and less likely to have implementation delays, although this
       is the leading problem identified for IFC investment climate industry projects. For the World
       Bank, projects are more likely to have too many components and are less likely to suffer from
       implementation delays. For Bank projects, monitoring and evaluation is the most common
       problem.


       COLLABORATION ACROSS INSTITUTIONS

       With the recent evolution of strategies for investment climate work, the World Bank Group
       has seen a substantial reorganization in the investment climate space since the mid-2000s.
       Major organizational change of the investment climate space occurred in FY14. Beginning
       in July 2014, all investment climate units will operate under the Trade and Competitiveness
       Global Practice. This global practice will be the most integrated practice in the new World
       Bank Group structure. In the investment climate portfolio, 33 projects with IEG ratings were
       characterized as having some form of coordination. Evidence indicates that the higher the
       degree of collaboration, the higher the probability of achieving the development objectives is.
       It must be recognized, however, that these findings rely on a small number of observations.
       Given this limitation, IEG reviewed projects with examples of collaboration to draw additional
       evidence. This led to the conclusion that successful collaboration rests on complementarity—
       of roles, of perspective, and of instruments.

       IEG’s staff survey results show that lighter collaboration is more frequent than deeper
       collaboration. Overall, half the time collaboration occurs, it refers to simple activities such
       as information sharing and peer reviewing. Only one-third of the collaboration is deep and
       involves design and implementation of projects.

       The factors that play a role in fostering collaboration can be grouped in three categories: the
       role of the unit and its strategy; systems or formal organization; and informal organization.
       IEG’s staff survey results point out to the primary role of informal factors in fostering
       collaboration. In contrast, systems and formal organization are seen as mostly discouraging
       collaboration, although they present a significant opportunity for changing this perception.
       Finally, factors related to roles and strategy can foster collaboration if properly handled.

       IEG interviews and its survey of World Bank Group investment climate management and staff
       provide some insights on how to optimize value to clients with the new Global Practice. Most
       of the staff provided positive feedback, highlighting the complementarity and strengths of the
       World Bank and IFC business models. However, some concerns exist. The interviews indicate
       the concern that the merger cannot be a simple juxtaposition of current systems and programs
       under one roof. From an operational perspective, many staff hope that serious attempts


xxvi   Investment Climate Reforms
will be made to remove impediments to collaboration found in the formal organization, for
example, governance and accountability systems, funding, pricing, human resources policies,
and operational systems.



Recommendations
Improving the investment climate has been and remains a key objective of countries in
their pursuit of economic growth through PSD. In this evaluation IEG assesses the extent to
which the World Bank Group has achieved its goal of helping client countries improve the
investment climate in which firms operate. IEG looked at three main aspects of the World
Bank Group activities: relevance, effectiveness, and social value of regulatory reforms.


RELEVANCE

At the corporate level and in a number of sectors, improving business climate is seen as key
to stimulating private sector investment. At the country level, nearly all World Bank Group
country partnership and assistance strategies identify enhancing the business environment
as a main objective to foster PSD. However, although country strategies put a significant
emphasis on improving the business environment, the client countries’ own strategies put
much less emphasis on it—only a few counties emphasized the role of investment climate in
their vision.

IEG’s mapping exercise provides evidence that, generally, World Bank Group interventions
support relevant areas, that is, cover the full set of potential regulations of a country with a
business-friendly regulatory environment. Using data from the Enterprise Survey, IEG was able
to establish that the World Bank Group supports the reforms most needed by client countries
and supports regulatory interventions in those countries that need them most.

When looking at the analytical relevance of the most common diagnostic tools used to
determine regulatory reforms—Doing Business and Enterprise Surveys—IEG found that these
tools do not cover all areas of the regulatory spectrum as identified in the comprehensive
list of regulations mentioned earlier. Doing Business and Enterprise Surveys cover only
areas—such as business registration, taxation, and trade—where most of the World Bank
Group activities take place. Hence, although these diagnostic tools are often relied on to
inform country strategies, they are less frequently used to design investment climate projects,
especially in IFC.




                    An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Overview   xxvii
         Recommendation—Expand the coverage of current diagnostic tools and integrate them
         to produce comparable indicators so that these can capture the areas of the business
         environment not yet covered by existing tools.


         SOCIAL VALUE

         Improving the social benefits of regulatory reform requires consideration of its impact on a
         range of important social stakeholders, practices, and institutions—not only businesses. In
         practice, though, the discussion focuses only on business costs. Social value is not explicitly
         defined in World Bank Group projects. Procedural indicators such as compliance cost
         savings do not tell very much about social benefits. Reforms can have broader social and
         distributional impacts that go beyond the economic and beyond the effects on business.
         These effects need to be taken into account in the design and implementation of regulatory
         reforms.

         Recommendation—Develop a differentiated approach to identify the social effects of
         regulatory reforms on all groups expected to be affected by them beyond the business
         community. The approach should identify which groups are expected to be affected by
         the regulatory reform(s) within and beyond the business community, in order to ensure
         that reforms “do no harm” to people and the environment. The assessment should be
         differentiated depending on the expected impact of the regulatory reform(s) and may include
         qualitative or quantitative methods. The approach should be employed both ex ante (during
         the design of the project) as well as ex post (to assess the achieved impact of the reform).

         Such an approach should help better estimate the political economy risk associated with
         the reform, to identify potential groups that would sustain or oppose reforms and the extent
         of such support or opposition. The World Bank Group may also consider developing client
         capacity to conduct social value assessment in order to enable sustainability of investment
         climate reforms.


         COORDINATION ACROSS THE WORLD BANK GROUP

         The World Bank and IFC work in the same space and with the same clients through two
         distinct business models. The IFC business model is implemented through stand-alone
         advisory services. Projects are based on standardized, focused, short-term, and rapid
         interventions. They are mostly funded through internal budget and trust funds. The World
         Bank business model is implemented through lending and budget support and to a lesser
         extent through technical assistance. These projects are broader in scope and tend to be more
         long term than IFC projects.


xxviii   Investment Climate Reforms
Each model has unique features and stakeholders appreciate their differences. Stakeholders
interviewed across countries often appreciated IFC’s international technical expertise,
quick response and delivery, and close support. However, according to stakeholders,
IFC’s ability to handle the political economy was not as strong, nor was its ability to move
beyond standardized products. The World Bank’s main strength is its institutional access
to government institutions, its comprehensive services, and its ability to provide substantive
funding. Yet there was a common sense that the World Bank is slow to respond and to
implement projects.

Interviews with World Bank Group management and staff surveys indicated that there is
collaboration among the institutions, to varying degrees. Survey results show that simple
activities such as information sharing are more frequent than formal engagements. Different
systems and organizational structure are perceived as the main bottlenecks to collaboration.

Recommendation—Ensure that the World Bank Group takes advantage of the
complementarity and strengths of World Bank and IFC business models when designing the
new Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice. Exploit synergies by ensuring that World
Bank and IFC staff improve their understanding of each other’s work and business models.
Maintain the richness of the two delivery models while addressing factors that discourage
collaboration.

World Bank Group Management Response



World Bank Group management would like to thank the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) for undertaking a valuable and informative evaluation and welcomes
the opportunity to provide its comments.


Overall Comments
Management acknowledges IEG’s thorough, relevant, and comprehensive work
to evaluate the World Bank Group’s activities in the investment climate space and
appreciates the systematic analysis contained in the report. Management recognizes
the complexity of this task, given the institutional set-up, with multiple units involved in the
World Bank Group work program on investment climate topics, the comprehensiveness of
the issues, and the technical sophistication of different reform areas. The complexity of the
issue presents significant challenges with regard to assessing the success of the different
interventions undertaken during the period covered by IEG’s report.

Management would like to underscore the timeliness of the report, given the
important organizational changes taking place in the World Bank Group. The IEG
report comes at an opportune time and has the potential to inform the future structures
and strategies of the various players involved in investment climate activities, and the
interactions and complementarities between these players, both within the new Trade and
Competitiveness Global Practice as well as between this and other Global Practices and the
five Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas. The report provides relevant analysis and observations on
past investment climate work that can inform the operations of the Trade and Competitiveness
Global Practice.

Management notes that the report is generally positive in its evaluation of the
Bank Group’s intervention on investment climate reforms. Management agrees with
the report that World Bank Group interventions generally support reforms most needed by
client countries and support regulatory interventions in those countries that need them most.
The assessment demonstrates that the activities analyzed are relevant in a strategic and

         An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Management Response   xxxi
        client-oriented context and shows evidence of positive results and the overall effectiveness
        of investment climate activities across the World Bank Group. Management appreciates
        the useful set of lessons and agrees with the recommendations, which it looks forward to
        implementing.


        The World Bank Group Approach to Investment Climate Work
        EVOLVING NATURE OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S INVESTMENT CLIMATE WORK
        Management appreciates the discussion in the report of the evolution of the Bank Group’s
        investment climate work over the years, including considerable innovation and restrategizing.
        As mentioned in the report, these innovations relate to (i) definition and scope of investment
        climate; (ii) strategies; (iii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks (from output to
        outcomes/impact); (iv) institutional set-up/delivery models; and (v) consideration of political
        economy and reform sustainability. As the report mentions, an example is the evolution of
        the Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) strategy over the past three strategy cycles
        (FY05–07, FY08–11, and FY12–16). This shows major shifts in the strategy, focus areas, and
        approaches underlying investment climate work at least in the Investment Climate Department
        and Finance and Private Sector Development space, toward a stronger focus on results and
        impacts. It also shows shift toward more industry-specific investment climate reform activities,
        and importance of cross-cutting topics such as competition, transparency, inclusion, and
        green growth/climate change. The investment climate work will continue to evolve in the
        light of experience on the ground and in response to internal developments, such as the new
        Global Practice agendas.


        COMPREHENSIVENESS AND SELECTIVITY

        Management notes that the relevance of the World Bank Group’s investment climate work is
        not defined solely by the comprehensiveness of the solutions offered. The Bank Group has
        a comparative advantage in offering advice and in aiding reforms and needs to consider
        carefully which types of reforms matter more for the desired outcomes. In many cases, the
        World Bank Group may be far more relevant by being able to effectively help countries enact
        reforms in a very narrow subset of areas than attempting to be comprehensive and ending
        up working on several areas in which it does not have specialized expertise or where there is
        little likelihood of reforms occurring. Management notes the report’s acknowledgement of the
        need to consider the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage in selecting priority areas
        of intervention in countries.




xxxii   Investment Climate Reforms
NEED FOR COMPLEMENTARY REFORMS

Management is pleased to note that, overall, World Bank Group interventions are relatively
successful in reducing time, cost, and number of procedures in relation to setting up,
operating, or exiting a business and that the rate at which reforms are undertaken does seem
to accelerate with Bank Group support. However, practical experience across many areas
shows that while regulatory reforms are indeed critical, they are not sufficient. Decisions to
invest go beyond whether it is “easy to do business” and, particularly in difficult/unknown
markets and markets for the poor, investment decisions are driven by the perceived market
opportunity, the perception of firms about whether poor customers are willing to pay, and
how technically difficult it is to reach them (including infrastructure constraints). This is the
risk-reward trade-off. It is thus necessary to give more attention to reforms that address
the broader operating context, as well as broader market conditions beyond the “enabling
environment.”


SETTING PRIORITIES: THE ROLE OF INDICATORS

Management believes that the combination of the Enterprise Surveys and the Doing
Business indicators provides a powerful, complementary set of tools to help set priorities
for World Bank Group work on the investment climate. The Enterprise Surveys and Doing
Business are very different data sets. Although they do assess related areas, they measure
different aspects of the same reality. These data sets should thus be used as complements,
not as substitutes. The Enterprise Survey produces survey data where many different
types of businesses are interviewed (a variety of business sectors, firm sizes, ownership
types, subnational regions, and so forth), yielding a rich analysis that can be tailored to
address particular sector/locational issues. This detailed, nuanced approach to business
environment data is necessary for the World Bank Group to support investment climate
interventions. The Doing Business indicators are based on expert inputs and provide
granular information on specific regulatory processes that help identify reform actions. The
Bank Group recognizes the limitations of both tools and does not rely solely on the two
surveys’ results. Management notes that, for some work areas, there are other indicators
that are relevant and used in the World Bank Group’s work and appreciates the report’s
recognition of this. Management also notes the move of the Global Indicators and Analysis
Group, responsible for the Enterprise Surveys and Doing Business indicators, to the
Development Economics Vice Presidency in October 2013 as part of the efforts to further
revamp and expand the menu of investment climate indicators available to World Bank
Group staff.

        STRENGTHENED M&E AND IMPACT MEASUREMENT

        Management agrees with the report’s finding that the results framework underpinning
        the World Bank Group’s work on investment climate has evolved over time, with a much
        strengthened emphasis on outcome and impact measurement, particularly in the International
        Finance Corporation (IFC). The focus is on literature reviews, target-setting methodologies,
        and impact evaluations of investment climate projects, as well analysis of value for money
        and sustainability of investment climate reform activities. Management will explore whether
        and how IFC’s systematic approach to result and impact measurement can be replicated
        for the investment climate portfolio managed by the Bank and to the entire Trade and
        Competitiveness Practice.


        POLITICAL ECONOMY AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE DIALOGUE

        Management agrees with the report on the need to better understand and strengthen
        clients’ commitment to reforms. Experience with investment climate work has highlighted the
        importance of proper engagement and it has shown that commitment at a strategy level
        (higher political level) is often not adequate and needs to be complemented by commitment
        at mid- and lower levels of government. The World Bank Group needs to work better to
        strengthen the links between the upstream strategy and downstream commitment at project
        level. Despite the repeated reference to the lack of emphasis or expertise in the area of
        political economy, there is no discussion of public-private dialogue in the report. Public-
        private dialogue plays a critical role as the primary tool by which the investment climate
        projects and programs seek to engage with a broad set of constituencies. The approach
        to public-private dialogue has evolved from being a separate “product” to a cross-cutting
        tool for addressing issues related to social value, including voice, transparency and
        accountability.


        FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED SITUATIONS

        Substantial efforts have been made over the years to increase the advisory services portfolio
        in fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS). The early regulatory reforms in the FCS
        context focus on the simplification of typically overly burdensome or obsolete regulations.
        Many FCS countries have effectively used Doing Business indicators to frame their reform
        programs. According to the World Development Report 2011, an early emphasis on
        simplification of business regulations—rather than expansion or refinement—has proved
        effective in FCS. Management agrees that investment climate reforms alone are not sufficient
        for private sector development in FCS and emphasizes the importance of a complementary,
        and appropriately sequenced, package of interventions. The report identifies complexity of

xxxiv   Investment Climate Reforms
design and wavering political economy environment as factors explaining low performance,
notably in FCS environments. Management also notes that the complexity of project design
in FCS environments is often necessitated by the need to simultaneously intervene on several
fronts and thus emphasizes the need to build in explicit and agile mechanisms to factor in
redesign of the projects or exit in a timely manner if original project assumptions do not hold.


ADDRESSING GENDER IN INVESTMENT CLIMATE WORK

The report’s finding is that projects targeting gender-related reforms do not consistently report
disaggregated indicators. The report questions gender differentiation in several places and
suggests that more attention be given to gender in projects. Many of the regulations under
review do not formally treat women and men differently (with labor regulations being one of
the exceptions), although sometimes there is discrimination in implementation and/or women
find it more burdensome to comply with them. Management will consider whether the scope
of investment climate interventions should also capture cases of gender discrimination, or if
other parts of the World Bank Group are better positioned to address them. This will involve
greater use of the Enterprise Survey data, which contain a wealth of information that can be
disaggregated by ownership or top manager’s gender and thus help World Bank task team
leaders more effectively design and target their regulatory reform work.


DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS AND INDICATORS

Management is already undertaking multiple initiatives to develop new, and refine existing,
diagnostic tools. For instance, in the area of trade, the World Bank Group is developing a series
of tools (trade competitiveness diagnostic, the nontariff measures toolkit, the trade in services
toolkit) to allow a solid assessment of the trade angle of the investment climate reform agenda.
The Development Economics Vice Presidency Global Indicators and Analysis Group team is
piloting new indicators in the areas of procurement and regulatory transparency, as well as
developing suites of indicators for priority sectors such as agribusiness and sustainable energy.
To increase the power of diagnostics, management will develop actionable indicators, along with
undertaking empirical work, to identify binding constraints to growth. The operational priorities
will be further fine-tuned through a dialogue with (and requests by) clients and stakeholders,
in addition to being informed by indicators. In addition to the improvements in the business
environment and quality of regulation, what matters is the actual implementation of regulation.


SOCIAL VALUE

In the currently formulated and implemented investment climate reform interventions, social
effects are taken into consideration in a variety of ways. Investment climate projects mostly

        An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Management Response   xxxv
        aim at increased levels of investments and higher levels of economic exchange. The empirical
        evidence suggests that these goals—if achieved—should generate social benefits, through
        increased employment, entrepreneurial opportunities, and higher levels of economic inclusion.
        Impact evaluations, including a lens on the social dimension of investment climate reform, are
        being carried out under the investment climate business line’s Impact Program, including an
        evaluation looking rigorously at effects on informality in Benin/Malawi.

        Management agrees that there is, nonetheless, scope to do more in-depth social value
        assessments on a selective basis and understands IEG’s recommendation about a
        differentiated approach in that spirit. Social value exercises require specific expertise and
        significant resources and will need to be done selectively. Measuring “social” impact is
        typically associated with household-level data and generally with the economic analysis of
        welfare, while investment climate work is traditionally associated with firm-level data. There is
        a need for a nuanced approach that distinguishes between reforms that attempt to do away
        with laws and regulations that convey very little in way of social benefits and reforms inducing
        trade-offs between business interests and social interests. Therefore, management plans to
        develop a set of criteria to help prioritize interventions for which social value assessments
        would be done and in what form, and to implement a selective approach to assessing the
        social effects of regulatory reforms.


        COMPLEMENTARITY AND STRENGTHS OF WORLD BANK AND IFC BUSINESS MODELS

        The Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice will help stimulate collaboration across
        different business models and approaches pursued within the Group. The Trade and
        Competitiveness Global Practice (together with the Finance and Markets Practice, which is
        also being set up as a fully integrated joint Bank/IFC Global Practice), will lead work in this
        area, especially through outreach, communication, and partnership with other networks/
        Global Practices on approaches, diagnostic tools, and lessons. As the report notes, different
        parts of the World Bank Group have demonstrated their comparative advantages, suggesting
        that a synergistic approach may help to leverage strengths and overcome past weaknesses.
        The complementarity of interventions that are specific to parts of the Group is often grounded
        in the complementarity of their skills mix, and in the differences between short- and long-term
        reforms.


        MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY SUPPORT

        Since the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) subcontracted its technical
        assistance function with respect to foreign direct investment promotion to FIAS in 2005,
        the scope of the IEG evaluation excludes explicit references regarding MIGA support for

xxxvi   Investment Climate Reforms
investment climate reforms. However, FIAS remains a donor-funded mechanism supporting
investment climate operations across the three institutions. Within the ambit of investment
climate interventions discussed in the report for improving the business environment for entry,
operations, and exit, Investment Policy and Promotion interventions (part of Operations)
supported through FIAS is most relevant for MIGA, both in terms of facilitating investments
and reducing political risks.

 Management Action Record



Expand Coverage of Diagnostic Tools and Their Integration
IEG FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the years a number of diagnostic tools have been used to design investment climate
interventions. Recently new tools have been developed for specific areas of the regulatory
environment. Although these tools cover in detail individual areas of the regulatory
environment, there is no comprehensive tool that allows an assessment of all regulatory
aspects in client countries. Such a tool would help determine which area is the most
problematic in client countries.

IEG presented evidence that the Doing Business indicators and Enterprise Survey data—the
most commonly used diagnostic tools—are incomplete; that is, they do not cover all areas
of regulation as identified in the best practice list (Table 1.3). Doing Business and Enterprise
Surveys cover only some aspects—such as business registration, taxation, and trade—where
most of the World Bank Group activities take place.


IEG RECOMMENDATION

Expand the coverage of current diagnostic tools and integrate them to produce comparable
indicators so that these can capture the areas of the business environment not yet covered by
existing tools.


ACCEPTANCE BY MANAGEMENT

Agree


MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

Management agrees that diagnostic tools and indicators should evolve over time in the light of
operational experience, evolving priorities, and advances in the academic literature. Management
is undertaking multiple initiatives to develop new, and refine existing, diagnostic tools.


        An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Management Action Record   xxxix
     Management plans to review how indicators and other benchmarking tools are being utilized
     by the World Bank Group to inform investment climate activities, with a view to expand the
     utilization of indicators as an engagement tool. Management also notes the move of the
     Global Indicators and Analysis Group, responsible for the Enterprise Surveys and Doing
     Business indicators, to the Development Economics Vice Presidency in October 2013 as
     part of the efforts to further revamp and expand the menu of investment climate indicators
     available to World Bank Group staff.


     Develop a Differentiated Approach to the Social Effects
     of Reforms
     IEG FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

     Business regulations govern markets to enhance or protect certain social values, such as
     public health, safety, and the environment. IEG’s review shows that social value is not explicitly
     defined or accounted for in regulatory reforms supported by the World Bank Group in client
     countries. Without that it is difficult to establish whether particular reforms have generated any
     particular benefits (or losses), or to identify distributional effects.

     The Bank Group impact indicators include measures of aggregate compliance cost savings
     for businesses or increases in private sector investment. Separate measures are needed to
     capture a wider range of benefits and costs (social, economic, and environmental) if existing
     regulations are changed. Some groups may benefit from regulatory reform, but other
     (potentially vulnerable) groups may lose out, with regard to incomes; employment; access to
     goods, services, and infrastructure; or other indicators. A social value framework suggests that
     projects should identify relevant stakeholders; an exclusive focus on businesses is too narrow.
     Nonbusiness stakeholders need to be incorporated within any evaluation of regulatory reform.

     Furthermore, a better assessment of political commitment is key in determining the success of
     investment climate projects. In many cases, IEG found that unsuccessful efforts in regulatory
     reforms focused on improving the technical quality of legislation but ignored the importance
     of the political process. Although the World Bank and IFC cannot and should not be engaged
     in these processes, successful regulatory reform requires understanding this part of the policy-
     making process and informing relevant stakeholders. This is especially important in FCS,
     where the political process is even more unstable.


     IEG RECOMMENDATIONS

     Develop a differentiated approach to identify the social effects of regulatory reforms on all
     groups expected to be affected by them beyond the business community. The approach

xl   Investment Climate Reforms
should identify which groups are expected to be affected by the regulatory reform(s) within
and beyond the business community, to ensure that reforms “do no harm” to people and the
environment. The assessment should be differentiated depending on the expected impact of
the regulatory reform(s) and may include qualitative or quantitative methods. The approach
should be employed both ex ante (during the design of the project) as well as ex post (to
assess the achieved impact of the reform).

Such an approach should help better estimate the political economy risk associated with the
reform, to identify potential groups that would sustain or oppose reforms, and the extent of such
support or opposition. The World Bank Group may also consider developing client capacity to
conduct social value assessment to enable sustainability of investment climate reforms.


ACCEPTANCE BY MANAGEMENT

Agree


MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

Management agrees on the importance of considering both the economic and social impact
of regulatory reforms. It concurs with the recommendation for a differentiated approach that
takes into account the expected scale of impact.

In investment climate reform interventions, management takes into consideration social effects
in a variety of ways. Scaling up a social welfare/value assessment requires specific expertise
and significant resources. A nuanced approach is needed and management plans to develop
a selective approach that distinguishes between reforms that attempt to do away with laws
and regulations that convey very little in way of social benefits, and reforms inducing trade-offs
between business interests and social interests. Management plans to develop a set of criteria to
help prioritize interventions for which social value assessments would be done and in what form.


Take Advantage of Complementarity of World Bank and IFC
Business Models in the Trade and Competitiveness Global
Practice
IEG FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The World Bank and IFC work in the same space and with the same clients through two
distinct business models. The IFC business model is implemented through stand-alone advisory
services. Projects are standardized, focused, and short-term and include rapid interventions.
They are mostly funded through internal budget and trust funds. The World Bank business
model is implemented through lending and budget support and to a lesser extent through

        An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Management Action Record   xli
       technical assistance. Projects are comprehensive and tend to be more long term. The client or
       the Bank executes the project. Each model has unique features, and stakeholders appreciate
       their differences. Stakeholders interviewed across countries often appreciated IFC’s international
       technical expertise, quick response and delivery, and close support. However, IFC’s ability to
       handle the political economy was not as strong, nor was its ability to move beyond standardized
       products. The World Bank’s main strength is its institutional access to government institutions, its
       comprehensive services, and its ability to provide substantive funding. Yet there was a common
       sense that the World Bank is slow to respond and to implement projects.

       IEG’s interviews with World Bank Group management and staff surveys indicated that there
       is collaboration among the institutions to varying degrees. Survey results show that simple
       activities such as information sharing are more frequent than formal engagements. Evidence
       shows that different operating environments of IFC and the World Bank make collaboration
       difficult. Systems and organizational structures—such as different pricing policy, accountability
       matrix, results framework, and human resources policies and staff incentives—are perceived
       as the main bottlenecks to collaboration. Also, the interviews with investment climate
       management and staff indicate that staff have a positive perception of complementarity and
       strengths of the institutions with the new Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice; however,
       some concerns exist regarding the dominance of one institution model over the other.


       IEG RECOMMENDATIONS

       Ensure that the World Bank Group takes advantage of the complementarity and strengths of
       World Bank and IFC business models when designing the new Trade and Competitiveness
       Global Practice. Exploit synergies by ensuring that World Bank and IFC staff improve their
       understanding of each other’s work and business models. Maintain the richness of the two
       delivery models while addressing factors that discourage collaboration.


       ACCEPTANCE BY MANAGEMENT

       Agree


       MANAGEMENT RESPONSE
       The Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice (together with the Finance and Markets
       Practice, which is also being set up as a fully integrated joint Bank/IFC Global Practice) will
       lead the World Bank Group engagement in this area and accordingly strengthen its outreach,
       communication, and partnership with other networks/Global Programs on approaches,
       diagnostic tools, and lessons.

Chairperson’s Summary:
Committee on Development Effectiveness


The Committee on Development Effectiveness met to consider the evaluation entitled
Investment Climate Reforms: An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to
Reforms of Business Regulations and the draft Management Response.

Summary
The Committee welcomed the evaluation’s findings and
recommendations and agreed they highlight the main challenges
facing the World Bank Group in investment climate activities. They were
pleased to see that overall the World Bank Group has targeted the right
countries, supported the right reforms, and been effective in improving
the regulatory environment of client countries, particularly in terms of
reducing procedures, time, and costs for business. Members found the
evaluation timely, given the internal changes in the World Bank Group
and the new Global Practices and Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas. As
investment climate moves into the joint Trade and Competitiveness
Global Practice, they saw this as an opportunity to take advantage
of the complementarities and strengths of the Bank and International
Finance Corporation delivery models to provide collaborative solutions
to clients. Members concurred that the current diagnostic tools should be
enhanced and integrated to produce comparable indicators to capture
areas of the business environment not yet covered; they encouraged
management to enhance coordination and collaboration with other
multilateral development banks, donors, and institutions in this respect.

Members agreed with the need to develop a differentiated approach
to identify the environmental and social effects of regulatory reforms.
Members welcomed management’s intent to try to standardize
environmental and social considerations in order to measure the impact



        An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Chairperson’s Summary   xliii
       of investment climate reforms on the bottom 40 percent, women, and
       fragile and conflict-affected countries. They underscored the importance
       of conducting ex ante social impact assessments and building client
       capacity on this front. Members highlighted that gender-focused
       investment climate projects still correspond to a small proportion of all
       investment climate reform-targeted projects. They urged management
       to strengthen the gender focus in the World Bank Group’s investment
       climate activities.

                     819	projects	with	investment	climate	interventions,	of	which	
                     476	were	for	the	World	Bank	and	343	for	the	International	
                     Finance	Corporation	(IFC),	for	a	total	estimated	value	of	
                     $3.7	billion.	Investment	climate	interventions	aim	to	simplify	
                     and	streamline	regulatory	procedures,	remove	sector	specific	
                     administrative	constraints,	revise	the	legal	framework	and	
                     institutions,	establish	effective	dialogue	systems	between	
                     private	and	public	sectors,	and	harmonize	procedures	and

                     scope	of	their	investment	climate	interventions	is	generally	
                     different,	with	some	overlap.	The	World	Bank	focuses	more	
                     on	higher	level	reforms,	such	as	revising	and	harmonizing	
                     laws	and	codes,	reforming	institutions,	developing	strategies,	
                     and	coordinating	government	agencies	and	ministries.	IFC,	
                     in	contrast,	mostly	focuses	on	streamlining	and	simplifying	
                     procedures	and	processes,	providing	technical	assistance,	and	
                     automating	systems.




    An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	1   1
    Motivation
    The	rationale	for	World	Bank	Group	engagement	in	investment	climate	activities	rests	in	
    the	understanding	that	support	to	investment	climate	reforms	is	an	integral	part	of	World	
    Bank	Group	efforts	to	eliminate	extreme	poverty	and	boost	shared	prosperity.	Private	firms	
    are	at	the	forefront	of	the	development	process,	as	they	contribute	to	improving	standards	
    of	living	by	providing	more	than	90	percent	of	the	jobs,	supplying	goods	and	services,	and	
    representing	the	main	source	of	tax	revenues.	In	turn,	the	contribution	that	firms	make	to	
    society	is	determined	by	the	quality	of	the	investment	climate	(World	Bank	2004b).	

    Furthermore,	social	equity	and	inclusion	is	critically	influenced	by	the	investment	climate.	
    The	notion	of	a	“level	playing	field,”	where	economic	players	have	equal	opportunities	to	
    succeed,	is	a	fundamental	focus	of	investment	climate	interventions.	Barriers	to	dynamic	and	
    well-functioning	markets	may	benefit	privileged	economic	participants	at	the	expense	of	
    competitors,	potential	entrants,	and	consumers.

    This	evaluation	is	part	of	a	programmatic	series	of	assessments	by	the	Independent	
    Evaluation	Group	(IEG)	of	critical	aspects	of	the	World	Bank	Group’s	support	for	financial	
    and	private	sector	development.	It	aims	to	assess	the	extent	to	which	the	World	Bank	Group	
    has	achieved	the	goal	of	helping	its	client	countries	improve	the	investment	climate	in	which	
    firms	operate.	The	evaluation	coincides	with	the	establishment	of	the	global	practice	on	trade	
    and	competitiveness,	which	will	be	the	focal	point	of	World	Bank	Group	work	on	investment	
    climate	reforms.	The	findings	and	conclusions	of	this	evaluation	are	thus	intended	to	offer	
    insights	into	this	aspect	of	the	Bank	Group	change	process.

    Theoretical	Foundations
    Private	sector	development	(PSD)	drives	economic	growth.1	Driven	by	the	quest	for	profits,	
    private	firms	invest	in	new	ideas	and	strengthen	the	foundation	of	economic	growth	and	
    prosperity	(World	Bank	2004b).

    There	are	two	main	avenues	through	which	the	private	sector	drives	growth:	private	
    investment	and	productivity	improvements.	In	their	study	of	the	determinants	of	growth,	Levine	
    and	Renelt	(1992)	show	that	investment	is	the	only	robust	determinant	of	economic	growth	
    among	the	50	measures	of	trade	policy,	fiscal	policy,	and	other	economic	variables	that	they	
    consider.2	They	also	find,	along	with	others	(Sala-i-Martin	1997;	Phetsavong	and	IchiHashi	
    2012;	Deverajan,	Easterly,	and	Pack	2003),	that	private—but	not	public—investment	is	
    robustly	correlated	with	growth.3	

    Sustained	and	broad-based	growth	in	private	investment	will	only	occur	when	the	business	
    environment	is	favorable.	If	private	firms	do	not	believe	that	their	investment	is	secure,	that	

2   Investment Climate Reforms
regulation	is	too	burdensome	or	unpredictable,	or	that	infrastructure	is	poor,	they	will	not	
invest	in	new	machinery	and	equipment	(World	Bank	2004b,	figure	1.10).	Sala-i-Martin	and	
Artadi	(2002)	show	that	in	the	Arab	world	high	investment	rates	did	not	translate	into	larger	
growth	rates	because	of	a	hostile	environment.	

Although	private	investment	is	important	for	growth,	it	is	not	the	only	driver	of	long-run	
economic	growth.	Summarizing	the	theoretical	literature	on	economic	growth,	Athreya	argues	
(2013,	p.	251)	that	without	improvements	in	productivity,	diminishing	marginal	returns	to	
capital	will	eventually	result	in	stagnating	living	standards.	The	business	environment	affects	
firm	productivity.	Many	firm-level	studies,	often	using	data	from	the	World	Bank’s	Enterprise	
Surveys,	show	that	total	factor	productivity	is	higher	in	countries	and	regions	within	countries	
where	the	business	environment	is	more	hospitable.4	

Private	sector	investment	is	typically	constrained	by	market	failures	that	are	especially	severe	in	
developing	countries.	Governments	use	regulations	to	correct	perceived	market	failures	and	
improve	market	efficiency	(Veljanovski	2010).	In	doing	so,	policy	makers	need	to	take	broad	
social	interests	into	account,	including	employee	and	consumer	interests	and	concerns	for	the	
environment.	Regulatory	reforms	therefore	require	consideration	of	the	interests	of	a	range	of	
stakeholders—not	only	businesses.	

World	Bank	Group	strategies,	especially	those	of	the	Facility	for	Investment	Climate	Advisory	
Services	(FIAS),	also	emphasize	cross-cutting	themes	such	as	gender,	fragile	and	conflict-
affected	states	(FCS),	and	industry.	These	strategies	recognize	that	certain	obstacles	make	
it	harder	for	women	than	for	men	to	start	and	grow	enterprises.	FCS	are	seen	as	a	priority	
because	of	their	urgent	need	to	attract	local	and	foreign	direct	investment	(FDI).	Tourism	and	
agribusiness	are	prioritized	because	of	their	potential	for	employment	creation.

Whether	investment	climate	interventions	should	explicitly	target	specific	subgroups	of	the	
population	rather	than	promoting	reforms	to	improve	the	general	business	environment	of	a	
country	is	a	question	with	no	immediate	and	obvious	answer.	On	the	one	hand,	reforms	by	
their	own	nature	are	supposed	to	be	general	and	any	specific	provision	could	be	perceived	
as	a	politically	unpalatable	affirmative	action.	On	the	other	hand,	it	is	normally	the	case	
that	the	playing	field	is	not	leveled	for	everybody,	and	certain	entrepreneurs	or	firms,	current	
or	potential,	experience	obstacles	that	are	specific	to	their	group	and,	if	not	addressed,	
not	only	raise	issues	of	fairness	and	equity,	but	can	also	hinder	the	growth	potential	of	the	
whole	economy.	Furthermore,	traditionally	disadvantaged	groups	may	be	less	able	to	take	
advantage	of	a	level	playing	field.	

                   An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	1   3
    The	disadvantageous	position	of	women	in	entrepreneurship	has	been	widely	documented.	
    Fewer	women	than	men	own	and	manage	businesses	worldwide	(Kelley	and	others	2012).	
    Also,	in	all	regions	of	the	world,	including	in	developed	economies,	female-owned	enterprises	
    are	substantially	and	significantly	smaller	than	those	owned	by	men	(Bardasi,	Sabarwal,	
    and	Terrell	2011;	Minniti	2010).	This	is	partly	because	women	are	more	likely	than	men	to	
    operate	in	industries	where	firms	are	smaller	and	less	efficient,	but	also	because	women	
    face	disproportionate	obstacles	in	accessing	finance,	accessing	markets,	obtaining	licenses	
    and	permits	(because	of	limited	mobility,	time	constraints,	and	sometimes	discrimination	and	
    higher	exposure	to	bribes	and	sexual	harassment),	accessing	courts	and	dispute-resolution	
    systems,	accessing	networks,	and	accessing	assets	and	property.	

    The	identification	of	the	obstacles	faced	by	specific	groups—such	as	youth	and	women—or	
    types	of	firms—such	as	exporters,	informal	firms,	or	firms	located	in	specific	industries	or	
    regions—is	essential	at	the	diagnostic	stage.	The	type	of	interventions	that	can	reduce	those	
    obstacles,	however,	may	not	explicitly	target	a	subgroup	and	because	of	their	own	nature,	
    may	be	disproportionately	beneficial	to	women,	youth,	or	a	specific	industry.

    For	example,	as	female	entrepreneurs	are	disproportionately	penalized	by	lengthy	and	
    cumbersome	registration	procedures	(Simavi,	Manuel,	and	Blackden	2010),	reforms	meant	to	
    simplify	business	registration	are	disproportionately	beneficial	to	women,	even	when	women	
    are	not	explicitly	targeted	by	the	reform.	Similarly,	reforms	introducing	one-stop	shops,	setting	
    up	alternative	dispute-resolution	systems,	or	reducing	administrative	barriers	can	be	especially	
    advantageous	to	current	and	potential	women	entrepreneurs.	Access	to	finance	and	
    start-up	financing,	simplification	of	the	administrative	and	regulatory	framework,	and	business	
    assistance	and	support	have	been	identified	as	key	crucial	factors	to	address	in	policies	and	
    programs	to	support	youth	entrepreneurship	(Schoof	2006).	


    FRAGILE	AnD	COnFLICT-AFFECTED	STATES5

    PSD	in	FCS	only	started	to	gain	attention	from	policy	makers,	donors,	and	nongovernmental	
    organizations	in	the	last	decade	(del	Castillo	2008;	Cramer	2009;	Paris	2004).	With	some	
    1.5	billion	people	living	in	fragile	or	conflict-affected	parts	of	the	world,	donors	began	to	
    envision	a	complementary	role	for	the	private	sector	to	meet	the	challenges	of	fragility	in	the	
    21st	century.6	The	private	sector	contributes	not	only	to	jobs,	wealth,	and	a	country’s	tax	base,	
    but	also	to	delivering	public	services	and	rebuilding	social	trust	that	has	been	fractured	by	war.	
    These	activities	promote	economic	growth	and	improved	livelihoods,	which	in	turn	help	cement	
    peace	dividends	and	lasting	recovery	(Bagwitz	and	others	2008,	p.	4;	MacSweeney	2008,	
    p.	10;	Mills	and	Fan	2006,	p.	27;	and	Peschka	2010,	p.	1).	


4   Investment Climate Reforms
The	relatively	recent	attention	to	PSD	in	fragile	situations	means	that	only	a	small	body	of	
literature	exists	on	the	topic.	Within	this	literature,	which	is	dominated	by	practitioner	reports,	
there	is	general	agreement	that	building	competitive,	inclusive	markets	and	businesses	is	crucial	
for	postconflict	recovery,	just	as	fragile	situations	present	special	challenges	and	opportunities	
for	PSD.	Most	studies	are	quick	to	point	out	that	the	private	sector	never	completely	disappears	
in	war,	even	if	it	becomes	disrupted	and	distorted	by	conflict,	functioning	typically	on	an	
informal	level.	This	happens	in	the	context	of	weak	political	and	economic	institutions,	low	
governing	capacity	and	legitimacy,	limited	policy	and	administrative	functions,	displaced	
populations,	damaged	infrastructure,	ongoing	guerrilla	or	irregular	warfare,	and	high	
corruption	and	rent-seeking	behavior—common	features	of	fragile	environments—which	
make	PSD	work	in	FCS	especially	challenging	and	different	than	in	other	developing	countries	
(Bagwitz	and	others	2008).	Still,	most	studies	agree	that	PSD	is	worthwhile	for	countries	coming	
out	of	conflict.	As	fragile	states	rebuild	their	institutions,	PSD-friendly	policies	should	be	a	part	
of	early	interventions,	included	in	the	first	round	of	reforms	to	ensure	future	growth	and	reform	
(Kusago	2005;	Mills	and	Fan	2006,	pp.	27–28;	and	Piffaretti	2010,	p.	19).	

                                                                                             cant	
In	spite	of	the	agreement	on	the	challenges	and	opportunities	of	PSD	in	FCS,	there	is	signifi	
disagreement	over	how	exactly	it	should	be	carried	out.	There	is	no	clear	consensus	over	the	
most	effective	starting	point	in	FCS.	Much	of	the	debate	is	centered	on	whether	investment	
climate	or	early	interventionist	approaches	should	be	prioritized	to	encourage	PSD	in	conflict-
affected	areas.	This	debate	is	essentially	about	sequencing,	whether	“doing	reforms”	to	
improve	the	investment	climate	or	“doing	deals”	with	targeted	enterprises	and	sectors	should	
come	first	in	these	environments.

Proponents	of	the	first	approach—prioritizing	investment	climate	reform—can	be	divided	
into	three	groups.	A	first	group	supports	regulatory	reforms	early	in	the	reform	process.	This	
group	stresses	that	regulatory	reforms	in	FCS7	should	focus	on	simplification	of	typically	overly	
burdensome	or	obsolete	regulations,	as	they	are	best	suited	to	limit	problematic	rent	seeking	
when,	in	particular,	they	aim	to	foster	FDI	and	a	repatriation	of	finance	(Piffaretti	2010;	
MacSweeney	2008,	pp.	14,	19–20,	29;	and	Euser	2011,	pp.	42–43).	Piffaretti	(2010)	puts	a	
clearer	emphasis	on	regulatory	reform	before	institution	building.	

A	second	group	that	supports	this	approach	argues	that	institutional	reforms	should	precede	
regulatory	reforms.	Collier	and	Hoeffler	emphasize	that	institutional	governance	and	social	
policies	should	come	ahead	of	sectoral	and	macrolevel	policies	(Collier	and	Hoeffler	
2000;	2002,	p.	13).	Some	World	Bank	Group	work	sides	with	this	point,	advocating	for	
priority	attention	to	infrastructure	development	and	legal	and	regulatory	reform	in	PSD	
programming	in	FCS	(IFC	2004).8	Others	point	out	that	certain	states	or	government	actors	


                   An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	1   5
    are	not	in	a	position	to	promote	an	early	reform	agenda	when	they	have	been	culpable	in	
    conflict,	because	of	weak	trust	in	the	officials.9	Donors	and	governments	cannot	just	set	up	a	
    regulatory	environment	and	assume	that	foreign	and	local	enterprise	will	sprout.	Reform	of	the	
    justice	and	security	sector	must	also	be	a	priority	above	and	beyond	business	regulations	to	
    enforce	the	regulations	and	contract	rights	in	the	first	place.	

    Finally,	a	third	group	stresses	that	early	simplification	of	regulations	restores	investor	
    confidence	and	attracts	businesses	and	entrepreneurs.	However,	other	reforms	are	equally	
    important,	if	not	more	significant	to	investors,	such	as	rule	of	law,	infrastructure	development	
    (electricity	and	roads),	finance,	and	confronting	corruption	(World	Bank	2010;	Mills	and	Fan	
    2006).	The	only	issue	is	that	both	the	World	Development	Report	and	Mills	and	Fan	remain	
    unclear	on	the	details	of	sequencing	these	institution-building	steps	in	terms	of	investment	
    climate	regulatory	reforms	(see	World	Bank	2010,	pp.	157,	160–61).	

    A	second	approach—prioritizing	early	direct	interventions,	a	so-called	“interventionist”	
    approach10 —has	become	popular	but	has	received	limited	attention	from	the	World	Bank	
    Group.	Although	proponents	of	interventionism	are	clearly	convinced	of	the	case	for	early	
    proactive	PSD	activities	in	fragile	states,	there	is	internal	disagreement	over	which	activities	to	
    prioritize,	and	the	pros	and	cons	of	each.	

    A	leading	Donor	Committee	for	Enterprise	Development	report	cites	a	difference	of	opinion	
    among	practitioners	over	whether	interventions	should	target	particular	industries	or	entire	
    systems	and	value	chains	(MacSweeney	2008,	pp.	51,	73).	Each	donor	or	nongovernmental	
    organization	tends	to	emphasize	its	favored	approaches.	The	German	Organization	for	Technical	
    Cooperation	guidebook	on	PSD	in	(post-)	conflict	situations	heavily	promotes	public-private	
    partnerships	as	a	way	to	assist	fragile	states	in	public	service	delivery	(Bagwitz	and	others	2008,	
    pp.	7,	33,	94–97),	but	others	point	out	that	such	partnerships	can	become	hijacked	by	powerful	
    competing	interest	groups.11	A	study	by	the	Center	for	Strategic	and	International	Studies	on	
    PSD	in	fragile,	conflict-affected,	and	violent	countries	argues	that	promoting	domestic	small	and	
    medium-size	enterprise	(SME)	development	above	and	beyond	FDI	is	more	sustainable	over	the	
    long	run	in	resource-rich	fragile	states	(Hameed	2013,	pp.	7–10;	Kusago	2005).	

    Most	studies	on	PSD	in	FCS	inside	and	outside	of	the	World	Bank	Group	emphasize	a	third,	
    integrated	approach	unfettered	by	concerns	for	sequencing.	These	studies	argue,	directly	and	
    indirectly,	that	regulatory	and	interventionist	approaches	should	not	be	viewed	as	mutually	
    exclusive,	but	as	complementary	in	encouraging	growth	in	fragile	environments.

    The	World	Development	Report	2011	(World	Bank	2010)	leans	in	this	direction	by	
    highlighting	both	investment	climate	reforms	and	direct	interventions	as	important	for	fragile	


6   Investment Climate Reforms
states.	In	particular,	the	report	gives	attention	to	the	positive	role	that	direct	interventions	can	
make	in	stimulating	the	private	sector	through	new	market	and	value	chain	programming	
in	case	study	examples	of	Kosovo	dairy	and	Rwanda	coffee	ventures	(2010,	pp.	157–59).	It	
recognizes	that	creating	the	right	business	climate	is	often	not	enough	to	attract	investment	in	
violent	situations.	This	is	just	as	too	much	focus	on	reforming	political	and	security	institutions	
runs	the	risk	of	ignoring	key	economic	dynamics	behind	conflict	(Collier	and	Hoeffler	2002).	

An	IFC	draft	report	recognizes	that	both	approaches	are	ultimately needed	in	order	not	
to	miss	opportune	moments	to	support	economic	growth	in	FCS	(Masinde	and	Harwit	
2014,	p.	4;	Peschka	2010;	del	Castillo	2001;	Kusago	2005).12	Development	practitioners	
most	frequently	use	a	mix	of	context-specific	approaches	(UnIDO-GTZ	2008,	pp.	53–4;	
MacSweeney	2008;	Peschka	2010,	p.	41).	The	Donor	Committee	for	Enterprise	
Development—which	has	produced	the	most	comprehensive	practitioner	report	on	PSD	in	
FCS	(MacSweeney	2008)—sees	development	moving	toward	this	integrated	approach.

The	guidebook	from	the	German	Organization	for	Technical	Cooperation	(Bagwitz	and	
others	2008)	does	the	best	job	of	steering	practitioners	toward	a	mix	of	investment	climate	
and	direct	interventions,	depending	on	particular	conflict	drivers	and	development	goals	
(see	also	Curtis	and	others	2010).13	The	conclusion	is	that	context	should	dictate	PSD	
programming	and	the	appropriate	balance	and	sequencing	of	investment	climate	and	direct	
interventions	(see	Curtis	and	others	2010,	pp.	46–48).

In	sum,	the	Bank	Group	tends	to	lean	toward	investment	climate	or	integrated	programming	
in	FCS,	but	there	appears	to	be	burgeoning	attention	in	the	Bank	Group	to	targeted	early	
interventions	in	and	of	themselves;	this	is	clear	in	a	new	report	on	value	chain	promotion	in	
fragile	areas	of	Africa	(Dudwick	and	others	2013).	Outside	the	World	Bank	Group,	most	
practitioner	and	scholarly	literature	supports	an	integrative	approach.	

Proponents	of	all	approaches	do	agree	that	there	is	no	one	solution	or	set	of	best	practices	
on	PSD	in	FCS,	but	rather	context	and	conflict-specific	“best	fit”	approaches	that	must	be	
pursued	to	affect	lasting	growth	and	recovery.	The	interventionist	approach	is	the	most	
fractured	and	divergent,	with	each	donor	emphasizing	different	interventions	and	with	
practically	no	concern	for	sequencing	direct	interventions.

Although	some	aspects	of	the	investment	climate	apply	to	all	firms	participating	in	the	
economy,	others	are	far	more	specific	and	can	create	a	“micro”	investment	climate	for	firms	
of	particular	characteristics	in	a	particular	region	or	sector.	Industrial	sectors	may	have	laws

    and	regulations	specific	to	an	industry	or	field	of	economic	activities,	such	as	licensing	and	
    registration	requirements	or	tax	treatment.	For	example,	in	2009,	the	Investment	Climate	
    Advisory	Services	of	the	World	Bank	Group	issued	a	mining	sector	licensing	study	“to	provide	
    guidance	on	best	practices	in	mining	licensing”	by	identifying	“certain	common	features	of	
    successful	mining	licensing	regimes	worldwide”	(World	Bank	2009,	p.	vii).	

    At	the	end	of	2011,	the	Bank’s	Vice-Presidency	of	Financial	and	Private	Sector	Development	
    (FPD)	created	the	Investment	Climate	for	Industry	team,	focusing	on	supporting	investment	
    climate	reform	and	facilitating	investment	in	key	sectors	of	the	economy,	principally	
    agribusiness	and	tourism.	It	aimed	to	“support	industry-specific	interventions	that	help	
    streamline	the	effectiveness	of	industry	regulations,	generate	sustainable	investment,	and	
    create	jobs	in	sectors	critical	to	economic	diversification	and	poverty	reduction”14	(World	Bank	
    2011,	pp.	1–2).	

    Initially	focusing	on	agribusiness	and	tourism,	this	practice	sought	to	deepen	engagement	
    in	strategic	industries	and	improve	the	business	environment	and	growth	prospects	for	light	
    manufacturing.	Interviews	with	members	of	the	practice	suggest	that	it	took	some	time	to	
    find	a	focus	and	that	its	ultimate	scope	extends	beyond	the	legal	and	regulatory	focus	of	the	
    broader	investment	climate	practice.	Instead,	it	also	includes	activities	relating	to	strengthening	
    value	chains,	investment	promotion	(especially	foreign	direct	investment	promotion),	
    strengthening	sectoral	institutions	and	standards,	promoting	specialized	financing	mechanisms	
    (such	as	warehouse	receipts),	and	a	variety	of	other	activities.	In	its	own	words,	the	practice	
    applies	“the	full	range	of	economywide	supported	products	in	the	delivery	of	sector-specific	
    advisory	services.”

    The	remainder	of	this	chapter	discusses	the	definition	of	investment	climate	IEG	adopted	in	
    this	study,	the	World	Bank	Group	engagement	in	investment	climate	and	business	models,	the	
    evaluation	design	and	methodology,	the	good	practice	standard	for	business	regulations,	and	
    a	description	the	Bank	Group	investment	climate	portfolio.	Chapter	2	reviews	the	relevance	of	
    the	World	Bank	Group	from	three	different	perspectives:	strategy,	interventions,	and	diagnostic	
    tools.	Chapter	3	assesses	the	effectiveness	of	the	Bank	Group	investment	climate	portfolio	at	
    two	levels:	the	project	level—in	terms	of	the	achievement	of	the	development	objectives—and	
    the	intervention	level—in	terms	of	the	achievement	of	intermediate	outcomes.	The	chapter	also	
    provides	insights	on	the	effectiveness	of	investment	climate	interventions	focusing	on	gender,	
    FCS,	and	industry.	Chapter	4	reviews	the	methods	used	by	the	Bank	Group	to	assess	the	social	
    benefits	of	regulatory	reform.	Chapter	5	provides	insights	into	factors	affecting	the	performance	
    of	investment	climate	interventions,	collaboration	across	the	Bank	Group	institutions,	and

8   Investment Climate Reforms
Investment	Climate	Definition
Different	definitions	of	investment	climate	have	been	proposed	in	the	literature.	nicholas	
Stern,	who	as	the	World	Bank	Group	Senior	Vice	President	and	Chief	Economist	in	the	
early	2000s	elevated	investment	climate	to	an	important	area	of	focus	for	the	World	Bank	
Group,	defined	it	as	“the	policy,	institutional,	and	behavioral	environment,	both	present	and	
expected,	that	affects	the	returns	and	risks	associated	with	investment”(	Xu	2011,	p.	1).	The	
World	Bank’s	Productivity and Investment Climate Survey Implementation Manual	(World	
Bank	2003)	was	designed	to	give	World	Bank	task	managers	guidance	on	preparing	
investment	climate	surveys	and	completing	Investment	Climate	Assessments.	It	adopted	
a	similarly	broad	definition	by	suggesting	that	studies	of	the	investment	climate	should	
discuss	“factors	constraining	the	effective	functioning	of	product	markets,	financial	and	
nonfinancial	factor	markets,	and	infrastructure	services,	including,	in	particular,	weaknesses	
in	an	economy’s	legal,	regulatory	and	institutional	framework”	(World	Bank	2003).	In	
2005	the	World	Bank’s	flagship	World	Development	Report	focused	on	the	investment	
climate15	and	defined	it	in	a	similar	way	as	“the	set	of	location-specific	factors	shaping	
the	opportunities	and	incentives	for	firms	to	invest	productively,	create	jobs,	and	expand”	
(World	Bank	2004b).	

Although	at	a	diagnostic	level	assessments	of	the	investment	climate	have	been	fairly	inclusive,	
in	practice	“investment	climate”	is	associated	with	a	distinct	and	narrow	set	of	regulatory	
requirements	for	businesses	to	operate,	trade	and	invest	across	borders,	and	function	in	key	
sectors.	In	line	with	this	practice,	IEG	will	refer	to	“investment	climate”	as	the	support	for	
policy,	legal,	and	institutional	reforms	intended	to	improve	the	functioning	of	markets	and	
reduce	transaction	costs	and	risks	associated	with	starting,	operating	and	closing	a	business	
in	the	World	Bank	Group’s	client	countries.	Within	this	context	World	Bank	Group	efforts	
aim	to	promote	reforms	to	improve	the	conditions	for	firms	to	enter,	operate,	and	exit	both	in	
domestic	and	international	markets	as	well	as	in	key	sectors.	Consequently,	all	projects	that	
aim	to	reform	the	regulatory	environments	for	businesses,	irrespective	of	the	sector	and	source	
of	financing,	will	be	part	of	the	scope	of	this	evaluation.


World	Bank	Group	Engagement	in	Investment	Climate
Investment	climate	activities	have	been	part	of	the	World	Bank’s	PSD	strategy	since	the	late	
1980s,	under	various	names,	including	“business	environment”	or	“enabling	environment.”	
In	fact,	improving	the	business	environment	was	one	of	four	strategic	pillars	of	the	1989	
PSD	Action	Plan.	The	1980s	also	witnessed	increased	attention	to	the	promotion	of	foreign	
investments	with	IFC’s	establishment	of	FIAS	in	1985	and,	soon	after	that,	the	creation	of	the	



                  An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	1   9
     Multilateral	Investment	Guarantee	Agency	(MIGA).	This	strategy	also	called	for	an	expansion	
     of	the	FIAS	program.

     In	the	1990s,	the	Bank	Group	realized	that	macroeconomic	reforms	alone	would	not	
     guarantee	long-term	growth.	Hence,	a	second	generation	of	reforms,	focused	on	
     microdeterminants	of	growth,	took	center	stage	in	the	Bank’s	strategies.	Priorities	shifted	
     toward	making	reforms	that	improved	the	“business	environment”	in	which	the	private	sector	
     operated.	Three-quarters	of	the	World	Bank’s	development	policy	operations	at	the	time	
     aimed	to	help	countries	create	a	supportive	business	environment.	The	key	goal	was	to	foster	
     competition.	The	focus	of	the	FIAS	program	expanded	from	its	original	mandate	of	FDI	
     advisory	to	provide	support	for	reforms	needed	to	improve	the	client	country’s	investment	
     climate	for	domestic	and	foreign	investment.

     It	was	not	until	the	early	2000s	that	the	term	“investment	climate”	replaced	what	had	been	
     referred	to	as	“business	environment”	or	“enabling	environment.”	This	change	in	terminology	
     was	accompanied	by	significant	organizational	restructuring	across	the	Bank	Group	within	
     the	PSD	domain.	FIAS	was	merged	into	the	newly	created	joint	IFC/World	Bank	Investment	
     Climate	Department	(CIC).16	CIC	became	an	anchor	unit	connecting	investment	climate	
     activities	of	the	Bank,	IFC,	and	FIAS.	Though	technical	assistance	to	promote	FDI	is	part	
     of	MIGA’s	mandate,	in	2005	the	decision	was	taken	to	subcontract	this	activity	to	FIAS17	
     (World	Bank	2006)	with	full	integration	becoming	effective	in	2007.	

     During	the	review	period,	the	World	Bank	Group	PSD	strategy—which	includes	investment	
     climate	activities—did	not	change,	and	the	FIAS	strategy	evolved	with	three	strategy	cycles	
     (FY05–07,	FY08–11,	and	FY12–16).	Earlier	FIAS	strategies	focused	on	diagnostic	tools,	and	
     more	recent	strategy	put	a	stronger	emphasis	on	clearly	defined	activities;	on	results	and	
     impacts;	on	industry-specific	interventions;	and	on	cross-cutting	topics	such	as	competition,	
     inclusion,	and	green	growth/climate	change.

     At	the	operational	level,	in	July	2011,	the	FPD	network	was	realigned	into	six	global	practices,	
     cutting	across	regions	and	FPD’s	key	thematic	areas.	The	FPD	Investment	Climate	Global	
     Practice,	one	of	the	six	practices,	became	the	only	joint	practice,	covering	IFC	and	Bank	
     investment	climate	activities	and	staff.	CIC	acts	as	a	central	anchor,	providing	knowledge,	
     expertise,	and	analytical	support	for	investment	climate	advisory	work	that	is	implemented	by	
     IFC’s	Investment	Climate	Business	Line	and	FPD’s	Investment	Climate	Global	Practice.	FIAS	
     remains	a	donor-funded	mechanism,	supporting	investment	climate	operations	across	the	
     three	institutions.	It	changed	its	name	from	FIAS	to	Facility	for	Investment	Climate	Advisory	
     Services.	The	FPD	sector	board	is	in	charge	of	the	overall	planning	and	quality	control	of	the	
     investment	climate	program.

10   Investment Climate Reforms
In	addition	to	CIC	and	the	FPD	Investment	Climate	Global	Practice,	two	other	groups	
within	the	World	Bank	Group	are	involved	in	investment	climate	reform	work.	The	IFC	
Investment	Climate	Business	Line	is	IFC’s	operational	arm,	focusing	on	providing	investment	
climate	advisory	work	from	the	field.	In	the	Bank,	other	sector	units,	such	as	the	Poverty	
Reduction	and	Economic	Management	network	(PREM),	the	Human	Development	
network,	and	the	Sustainable	Development	network	(SDn),	also	operate	in	the	investment	
climate	space.	In	fact,	as	shown	in	the	portfolio	review	for	this	evaluation,	the	majority	of	
investment	climate	projects	within	the	World	Bank	investment	climate	portfolio	are	run	
outside	the	FPD	sector.

To	support	investment	climate	reform	work,	the	Bank	Group	uses	a	number	of	indicators	and	
benchmarking	tools	to	help	shed	light	on	the	characteristics	and	quality	of	the	investment	
climate	in	a	country,	identify	areas	for	reform,	and	monitor	progress.	In	recent	years	new	tools	
have	been	developed	for	specific	areas	of	the	regulatory	environment.	These	tools	cover	in	
detail	individual	areas	of	the	regulatory	environment.	The	diagnostic	tools	include	surveys	
(for	example,	Enterprise	Surveys	and	Tax	Compliance	Cost	Surveys),	indicators	and	indices	
(for	example,	Doing	Business;	Women,	Business,	and	the	Law;	Investing	Across	Borders;	and	
Logistics	Performance	Index),	and	assessments	(for	example,	Investment	Climate	Assessments,	
marginal	effective	tax	rate,	and	standard	cost	model).	The	Development	Economics	Vice	
Presidency,	PREM,	and	Global	Indicators	and	Analysis	are	some	of	the	Bank	Group	units	
involved	in	this	type	of	work.

The	Investment	Climate	Department—in	particular,	IFC’s	Investment	Climate	Business	
Line—is	designing	a	new	framework	to	track	the	development	impact	of	investment	climate	
interventions;	IEG	could	not	assess	this	within	the	timeframe	covered	in	this	evaluation.	The	
approach	followed	includes	literature	reviews,	target-setting	methodologies,	analysis	of	
value	for	money	(such	as	standard	cost	model),	and	sustainability	of	reforms.	In	addition,	
the	department	has	initiated	an	impact	evaluation	program	both	at	a	global	level	(Joint	
Bank	Group-Donor	Program	on	Impact,	Sustainability	and	Value	for	Money	of	Investment	
Climate	Reform)	and	a	regional	level	(for	example,	Investment	Climate	Africa	Impact	
Initiative).	Some	impact	evaluations	cover	limited	social	dimensions	such	as	informality	
(in	Benin/Malawi)	and	patient	safety	(in	Kenya).	Finally,	over	the	past	few	years	FIAS	has	
undertaken	a	number	of	external	evaluations	(evaluation	of	the	FIAS	FY08–11	strategy	
cycle,	2011;	the	external	evaluation	of	the	Business	Regulation	Product	under	IFC’s	
Investment	Climate	Business	Line,	2012;	and	the	external	evaluation	of	four	IFC	Africa	
Region	investment	climate	projects,	2013.

There	was	a	major	organizational	change	of	the	investment	climate	space	in	FY14.	In	the	
World	Bank	Group’s	ongoing	reorganization,	all	staff	mapped	to	investment	climate	work	

                  An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	1   11
     (CIC,	FPD/investment	climate	regional	staff,	and	IFC/investment	climate	regional	staff)	are	
     expected	to	join	the	Trade	and	Competitiveness	(T&C)	Global	Practice,	the	most	intensively	
     integrated	practice	in	the	new	World	Bank	Group	structure.

     In	supporting	investment	climate	reforms,	the	Bank	Group	has	adopted	two	distinct	business	
     models.	The	IFC	business	model	is	implemented	only	through	stand-alone	advisory	services.	
     These	are	structured	under	a	set	of	defined	products	within	the	IFC	Investment	Climate	
     Business	Line	and	tend	to	form	focused,	concrete,	short-term,	and	rapid	interventions.	They	
     are	mostly	funded	through	internal	budget	and	trust	funds,	with	some	client	contribution,	and	
     are	executed	by	IFC	or	CIC.

     There	is	also	the	World	Bank	business	model,	which	is	implemented	through	not	only	advisory	
     services,	but	also	through	investment	and	policy-based	lending.	When	not	funded	through	
     the	loans,	advisory	services	are	generally	funded	through	trust	funds	or	reimbursable	advisory	
     services.	The	client	or	the	Bank	executes	the	project	(Table	1.1).	

     Regardless	of	the	differences	between	the	business	models,	the	two	institutions	work	in	the	
     same	space	and	with	the	same	clients.	In	general,	the	services	provided	by	the	institutions	
     complement	each	other.	The	World	Bank	is	generally	involved	in	upstream	policy	dialogue	on	
     PSD	and	overall	economic	reforms	and	supports	interventions	that	tend	to	have	a	wider	and

deeper	scope	and	to	be	of	longer	term;	IFC	supports	interventions	that	tend	to	be	standardized	
and	narrowly	focused.	Each	business	model	has	its	own	strengths	and	weaknesses.


Evaluation	Design	and	Methodology
The	conceptual	framework	for	this	evaluation	is	represented	in	Figure	1.1,	which	shows	
the	logical	connections	of	investment	climate	priorities	and	interventions	with	outputs,	
outcomes,	and	ultimate	goals.	This	framework	is	a	combination	of	theoretical	literature	
and	World	Bank	Group	strategic	priorities	and	objectives.	It	starts	with	the	strategic	
priorities.	The	priories	are	outlined	in	the	World	Bank,	IFC,	and	FIAS	investment	climate	
strategies.	They	enhance	the	regulatory	environment	to	foster	business	creation	and	growth,	
international	trade	and	investment,	investment	in	key	sectors,	and	investment	in	focus	
countries	(for	example,	FCS).

The	strategies	mainly	focus	on	enterprises	and	don’t	include	the	broad	social	interest	of	
different	stakeholders	beyond	businesses,	such	as	consumers,	employees,	investors.	The	
logical	model	identifies	specific	areas	of	intervention—entry,	operation,	and	exit—and,	within	
them,	specific	topics	such	as	registration,	commercial	law,	and	bankruptcy,	which	represent	
a	good	practice	standard	in	business	regulations.	These	topics	are	embodied	in	diagnostic,	
advisory,	and	investment	work.

IEG	then	examines	these	interventions	in	light	of	specific	indicators	of	output	and	outcomes	
that	are	directly	attributable	to	them.	Finally,	IEG	relates	these	outcomes	to	a	number	of	
economic	development	goals—including	productivity,	investment,	employment	growth,	
and	greater	economic	inclusion.	However,	because	of	the	complexity	and	multiplicity	of	
determinants,	some	well	outside	the	scope	of	this	study,	IEG	does	not quantify	this	level	of	
impact	in	this	evaluation.

The	overarching	question	that	IEG	seeks	to	answer	in	the	evaluation	is:	“Has	the	World	
Bank	Group	been	successful	in	helping	client	countries	to	improve	their	business	regulatory	
environment	while	taking	into	account	the	impact	on	different	stakeholders	in	society?”	This	
question	addresses	the	extent	to	which	Bank	Group–supported	regulatory	reforms	have	
achieved	the	policy	objective	of	improving	the	regulatory	environment	in	which	business	
operates,	taking	into	account	that	regulatory	reforms	should	improve	outcomes	for	society	
as	a	whole,	not	only	for	businesses.	As	a	matter	of	fact,	regulatory	reforms	impact	a	wide	
set	of	stakeholders	in	society,	not	just	businesses.	Furthermore,	not	all	stakeholders	are	
impacted	evenly.	Consequently,	both	at	the	design	stage	of	reforms	(ex	ante)	and	when	
estimating	its	impact	(ex	post),	it	is	important	to	estimate	the	increase	or	reduction	in	cost	
and	benefits	of	these	reforms.

The	overarching	question	will	be	answered	by	looking	at	three	different	dimensions:

•	Relevance:	Has	the	World	Bank	Group	support	for	regulatory	reforms	been	relevant	to	
  client	countries?	

•	Effectiveness:	Has	the	World	Bank	Group	support	for	regulatory	reforms	achieved	its	
  intended	objectives?	

•	Social Value:	Has	the	World	Bank	Group	taken	into	account	the	social	impact	in	its	
  regulatory	reform	work?	

The	review	covers	the	FY07–13	period.	It	includes	analysis	at	two	levels:	(i)	interventions	(such	
as	regulations	for	entry,	bankruptcy	law,	and	so	forth)	and	(ii)	client	countries,	as	reforms	
produce	results	at	the	country	level	and	are	not	implemented	in	isolation;	rather,	they	are	the	
consequence	of	a	sustained	and	prolonged	engagement	with	the	client	country.

The	different	sources	and	methods	used	for	this	evaluation	include	(i)	internal	and	external	
literature	reviews	on	regulatory	reforms,	both	broad	and	with	a	gender,	industry,	and	FCS	
focus;	(ii)	a	portfolio	review	of	World	Bank	Group	projects	and	interventions	in	the	area	of	
business	regulatory	environment;	(iii)	a	review	of	policy	and	strategy	documents	at	country	and	
corporate	levels;	(iv)	25	country	case	studies;	(v)	5	field-based	country	cases;	(vi)	interviews	
with	World	Bank	Group	staff	and	management;	(vii)	opinions	and	insights	from	World	Bank	
Group	donors;	and	(vii)	a	World	Bank	Group	staff	survey	to	seek	insights	into	the	factors	that	
foster	or	hinder	collaboration.

The	evaluation	builds	on	IEG	reviews	and	evaluations	of	World	Bank	Group	interventions	
including	Country	Assistance	Strategy	Completion	Report	Reviews	(CASCR	Reviews),	Project	
Performance	Assessment	Reviews,	Implementation	Completion	and	Results	Reports	(ICRs),	
Expanded	Project	Supervision	Reports,	Project	Completion	Reports	(PCRs),	and	Country	
Program	Evaluations.	In	addition,	IEG	uses	World	Bank	Group	databases	including	Enterprise	
Surveys,	Doing	Business	Indicators,	investment	climate	indicator	databases,	and	World	Bank	
Group	entrepreneurship	databases,	as	well	as external	databases	such	as	the	Organisation	
for	Economic	Co-operation	and	Development	regulatory	reform	database	and	the	World	
Economic	Forum	(WEF)	competitiveness	database.


Investment	Climate	Good	Practice	Standard
Given	the	absence	of	a	comprehensive	list	of	regulatory	reforms,	IEG	developed	a	good	
practice	standard	of	regulatory	areas	as	follows:	first,	IEG	identified	the	five	countries	with	the	
best	regulatory	environment,	according	to	the	WEF	and	Doing	Business	(World	Bank	2013).	


                   An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	1   15
     This	generated	a	list	of	eight	economies:	Denmark;	Finland;	Hong	Kong	SAR,	China;	
     new	Zealand;	Qatar;	Rwanda;	Singapore;	and	the	United	States.	

     Second,	for	each	of	these	economies,	IEG	reviewed	the	law	library	compiled	by	the	Doing	
     Business	program	(http://www.doingbusiness.org/law-library)	and	classified	the	key	regulatory	
     areas.18	Finally,	this	list	is	taken	as	a	good	practice	standard	of	the	set	of	regulatory	areas	a	
     typical	country	with	the	best	regulatory	environment	would	have	(Table	1.2).	

     IEG	reviewed	evidence	of	the	extent	to	which	diagnostic	tools	cover	the	good	practice	areas	
     identified	above.	As	noted	earlier,	the	PSD	strategy	update	(2002)	put	particular	emphasis	
     on	the	role	of	diagnostic	tools	in	the	design	of	regulatory	reforms.	In	line	with	this	priority,	
     IEG	reviewed	the	two	most	commonly	used	diagnostic	tools	for	regulatory	reforms,	the	Doing	
     Business	and	the	Enterprise	Surveys	data,	and	conducted	a	mapping	exercise	of	the	areas	
     covered	in	these	tools	with	the	list	of	good	practice	areas	identified	earlier	(Table	1.3	).19

     The	table	shows	in	blue	the	regulatory	areas	that	are	covered	by	these	instruments	and	in	
     grey	the	areas	not	covered	by	either	of	them.	This	evidence	shows	that	only	about	half	of	the	
     regulatory	areas	are	covered	by	these	diagnostic	tools.	Some	neglected	areas	are	contract	
     law,	competition	policy,	consumer	protection,	intellectual	property	rights,	employment	law,	
     and	Alternative	Dispute	Resolution	(ADR).	This	implies	that	these	two	diagnostic	tools	are	only	
     partially	helpful	in	identifying	regulatory	areas	of	intervention.


     World	Bank	Group	Investment	Climate	Portfolio
     PROJECTS

     To	identify	the	relevant	portfolio	of	investment	climate	projects,	IEG	followed	two	separate	
     approaches	for	IFC	and	the	World	Bank.	For	IFC,	the	identification	of	the	investment	climate	
     portfolio	was	straightforward	because	of	the	existence	of	the	Investment	Climate	Business	
     Line	database.	The	IEG	team	obtained	the	universe	of	IFC	Advisory	Services	projects	and	
     filtered	the	projects	within	the	investment	climate	business	line	approved	on	or	after	FY07	
     through	FY13.

     For	the	World	Bank,	in	contrast,	given	the	absence	of	a	classification	for	investment	climate	
     projects,	IEG	followed	two	approaches	for	lending	projects	closed	from	FY07	and	approved	
     not	earlier	than	FY03	through	FY13:	(i)	Operations	Policy	and	Country	Services	theme	
     code	method,	that	is,	projects	that	charged	20	percent	or	more	in	volume	of	commitment	
     to	one	or	more	of	10	of	these	“theme	codes”	relevant	to	investment	climate;	and	
     (ii)	a	keyword	search	method,	that	is,	for	projects	whose	objective	description	matched	one	
     of	approximately	100	investment	climate	key	words.20	Finally,	all	projects	identified	were	
     reviewed	individually.

Over	the	period	FY07–13,21	the	World	Bank	Group	supported	819	projects	with	investment	
climate	interventions	in	119	countries,	of	which	476	were	for	the	World	Bank	and	343	for	
IFC,	for	a	total	estimated	value	of	$3.7	billion,	of	which	$346	million	was	for	IFC	and	$3.325	
billion	for	the	World	Bank22	(Figures	1.2	and	1.3).	

In	terms	of	number	of	projects,	PREM,	SDn,	and	FPD	are	the	main	networks	that	support	
investment	climate	projects.	In	terms	of	value,	PREM	supported	projects	with	investment	
climate	components	for	a	value	of	$1.719	billion,	SDn	$866	million,	and	FPD	$713	million.	
Investment	climate	projects	represent	approximately	20	percent	of	all	IFC	Advisory	Services,	
with	a	total	volume	of $346	million	(29	percent	of	total	volume	of	Advisory	Services)	
(Table	1.4).	In	absolute	terms,	PREM	has	the	highest	number	of	projects	with	investment	climate	
interventions—often	in	the	context	of	development	policy	lending.	However,	within	networks,	
FPD	has	the	highest	proportion	of	network	operations	with	investment	climate	interventions.	
In	fact,	28	percent	of	FPD	network	lending	is	represented	by	investment	climate	interventions,	
compared	to	8	percent	of	PREM	and	14	percent	of	SDn.	Further,	FPD	has	on	average	2.9	
investment	climate	interventions	per	project,	compared	to	2.2	of	PREM	and	1.5	of	SDn.	Finally,	
IEG	estimated	that	FPD	staff	support	the	implementation	of	investment	climate	interventions	in	
the	majority	of	PREM	projects.

Across	the	two	networks	with	the	highest	relative23	share	of	investment	climate	projects—
PREM	and	FPD—IEG	observed	that	in	PREM	approximately	one	in	three	projects	has	an	
investment	climate	component;	in	FPD	this	is	one	in	four.	Similarly,	one	in	three	and	one	in	
four	of	development	policy	projects	led	by	PREM	and	FPD,	respectively,	includes	investment	
climate	components.	Half	of	the	FPD	investment	climate	projects	are	in	Sub-Saharan	
Africa,	and	every	year	FPD	has	five	active	investment	climate	projects.	In	PREM,	every	year

a.	13	projects	are	mapped	to	Access	to	Finance,	PPP,	and	SBA	but	include	investment	climate	products.



approximately	20	projects	have	an	investment	climate	component,	although	in	terms	of	share	
it	is	approximately	the	same	as	for	FPD.	

Finally,	it	is	important	to	note	that	although	IFC	investment	climate	projects	are	only	advisory,	
the	World	Bank	includes	investment	climate	components	in	both	investment	and	development	
policy	operations,	in	approximately	equal	proportions.	However,	in	terms	of	share,	one	in	
three	development	policy	operations	includes	investment	climate	components,	but	only	one	
in	ten	lending	operations	includes	investment	climate	components.	not	surprisingly,	most	
(80	percent)	of	the	adjustments	with	investment	climate	components	are	led	by	PREM,	and	
most	of	the	lending	projects	with	investment	climate	(65	percent)	are	implemented	by	SDn,	
followed	by	FPD	(17	percent).

InTERVEnTIOnS

Interventions	are	specific	investment	climate	issues	or	dimensions	that	projects	intend	to	
address	(such	as	land	registration	or	construction	permits).	The	World	Bank	Group	activities	
in	investment	climate	can	be	grouped	in	three	main	categories:	those	aimed	at	improving	the	
business	environment	for	entry,	operation,	and	exit.	Within	each	of	these	groups,	the	Bank	
Group	implements	a	number	of	different	interventions	(Table	1.5	).24	These	interventions	
aim	to	simplify	and	streamline	regulatory	procedures,	remove	sector-specific	administrative	
constraints,	revise	the	legal	framework	and	institutions,	establish	effective	dialogue	systems	
between	private	and	public	sectors,	and	harmonize	procedures	and	systems	(Table	1.6).

      Intervention                                           Description

      Licensing         This	intervention	aims	to	review,	simplify,	and	streamline	procedures	needed	to	obtain	
                        a	business	license.	This	includes	administrative	reform	programs,	establishment	of	
                        electronic	registries	of	all	valid	licenses,	design	of	screening	mechanisms	for	new	
                        licenses	to	ensure	necessity	and	quality,	implementation	of	one-stop	shops	for	
                        licensing	needs,	and	drafting	and	submission	of	new	laws	and	amendments.	Licenses	
                        addressed	include	those	for	business	operations,	construction,	and	environmental	
                        permits.

      Registration      Registration	includes	procedures	that	are	officially	required,	or	commonly	done	
                        in	practice,	for	an	entrepreneur	to	start	up	and	formally	operate	an	industrial	or	
                        commercial	business,	as	well	as	the	time	and	cost	to	complete	these	procedures	and	
                        the	paid-in	minimum	capital	requirement.

      Competition	 The	interventions	aim	to	remove	sector-specific	constraints	that	affect	market	
      Policy       competition,	enact	the	law	on	competition,	and	work	with	the	competition	council	
                   and	other	line	ministries	on reducing	the	concentration	in	key	sectors.	Interventions	
                   in	this	area	support	regulatory	and	competition	assessments	of	businesses	in	the	
                   services	sector	and	the creation	of	relevant	toolkits	and	manuals.

      Contract	   This	intervention	seeks	to	revise	and	harmonize	commercial	laws	and	codes,	civil	
      Enforcement procedure	laws,	and	laws	regarding	the	functioning	of	the	judiciary	and	court	
                  systems.	Transfer	judicial	services	from	central	courts	and	judges	to	municipal	courts	
                  and	clerks,	establishment	of	new	courts,	automation	of	judicial	procedures,	and	
                  capacity	building	and	training	for	lawyers,	judges,	and	clerks	are	activities	that	help	to	
                  improve	enforcement	mechanisms	for	businesses.

      Doing	            This	intervention	aims	to	prepare	subnational	and	national	indicators	related	to	
      Business	         nine	of	the	Doing	Business	areas.	This	includes	training	with	local	partners	on	the	
      Indicators        Doing	Business	methodology,	report	preparation	and	disseminaition,	and	technical	
                        assistance	to	implement	reform	proposals	and	recommendations.

      Investment	       Under	this	intervention,	laws	and	strategies	to	promote	increased	investment,	both	
      Policy	and	       from	foreign	and	domestic	investors,	and	in	key	sectors	and	locations,	are	adopted.	
      Promotion         Investment	promotion	trainings	and	workshops	are	conducted,	investor	aftercare	
                        programs	developed	and	implemented,	and investment	oversight	committees	and

24   Investment Climate Reforms
Intervention                                               Description

Labor          This	intervention	aims	to	revise	the	legal	framework	governing	the	labor	market	to	
               improve	labor	market	flexibility,	improve	employment	relations	and	compensation	
               schemes,	reform	pension	systems,	and	make	the	hiring	of	foreign	labor	more	
               flexible.	This	is	done	through	new	or	amended	labor	laws,	addressing	wage-setting	
               mechanisms	and	hiring	quotas,	and	revising	residency	permits	for	foreign	skilled	
               workers.

Property	      This	intervention	addresses	access	to	land,	registering	property,	and	protecting	
Rights         intellectual	property	rights.	Review	of	legislation,	digitization	of	property	records	and	
               development	of	cadaster	systems,	and	one-stop	shops	for	property	registration	are	
               among	the	activities	used	to	promote	property	rights.	Cadastres or	surveys,	together	
               with	land	registries,	are	tools	used	around	the	world	to	map,	prove,	and	secure	
               property	and	use	rights.

Public-        Public-Private	Dialogue	interventions	support	programs	that	improve	the	quality	
Private	       and	sustainability	of	policy reforms	by	providing	flexible	and	robust	mechanisms	
Dialogue       that	address	shortfalls	in	representation,	communication,	and	coordination	between	
               relevant	stakeholders.

Special	       Interventions	aim	to	develop	SEZ	regulatory	regimes,	draft	laws	for	the	industrial	
Economic	      zone,	enable	environmental	monitoring,	and	set	up	management	of	PPP	
Zones          arrangements	inside	the	zone.	This	is	done	through	market	demand	analysis	and	
               feasibility	studies,	best	practices	frameworks,	and	identification	of	land,	investors,	and	
               developers	for	the	zone.

Business	      This	intervention	aims	at	streamlining	burdensome tax	payment	and	administration	
Taxation       procedures	for	businesses by	implementing	small	business	tax	regimes,	electronic	
               filing,	and	taxpayer	education	and	services.	Other	activities	and	tax	laws	work	to	
               harmonize	the	tax	system	and	reduce	certain	taxes,	while	at	the	same	time	eliminating	
               exemptions.

Trade	         Trade	logistics	comprises	three	core	areas	of	reforms:	(a)	simplifying	and	harmonizing	
Logistics      trade	procedures	and	documentation,	integrating	risk	management	systems	
               into	border	inspections	and	clearance,	and implementing	electronic	processing,	
               automation,	and	single	window	systems;	(b)	industry-specific	reforms	focus	on	
               agribusiness	supply	chains	and on	improving	national	logistics	and	distribution	
               services;	(c)	regional	integration	reforms	seek	to	improve	trade	logistics	systems	and	
               services	and	border	clearance	at	the	regional	level	and	foster	mutual	recognition	of	
               international	standards,	accreditation,	and	certification.

                                                                                                continued on page 26

      Alternative	      These	interventions	aim	at	establishing	a	system	of	court-annexed	mediation,	
      Dispute	          providing	capacity	building	to	mediators	and	judges,	and	establishing	a	regional
      Resolution        forum	for	consensus	building	and	ADR,	preparing	manuals	on	ADR,	and	enacting	
                        Laws	on	enforcement,	bailiffs,	and	the	execution	of	cash	assets	to	accelerate	
                        enforcement	of	commercial	disputes	resolution.

      Bankruptcy        These	interventions	aim	at	identifying	weaknesses	in	existing	bankruptcy	law	and	
                        the	main	procedural	and	administrative	bottlenecks	in	the	bankruptcy	process	
                        in	order	to	implement	good	practices	to	improve	both	the	efficiency	and	the	
                        outcome	of	insolvency	proceedings.	Activities	include	improvements	in	existing	
                        regulations	on	company	reorganization,	through	amendments	to	national	
                        bankruptcy	acts	and	laws.

      Debt	             This	intervention	aims	to	improve	insolvency	laws,	based	on	global	best	practices,	
      Resolution/	      with	regard	to	provisions	relating	to	assets	of	the	debtor,	avoidance	of	transactions

                        institutional	capacity	for	speedy	resolution	of	disputes	and	technical	assistance	to	
                        improve	court	capacity.

     It	is	important	to	note,	however,	that	although	both	institutions	operate	in	the	same	
     space,	the	scope	of	their	investment	climate	interventions	is	generally	different,	with	
     some	overlap.	The	Bank	focuses	more	on	higher-level	reforms,	such	as	revising	
     and	harmonizing	laws	and	codes,	reforming	institutions,	developing	strategies,	and	
     coordinating	government	agencies	and	ministries.	In	contrast,	IFC	mostly	focuses	on	
     streamlining	and	simplifying	procedures	and	processes,	providing	technical	assistance,	
     and	automating	systems.

     Excluding	sector	reforms,	which	account	for	some	20	percent	of	all	interventions,	both	
     institutions	focus	the	great	majority	of	interventions	(80	percent)	on	firm	operation,	with	
     15	percent	on	entry	and	the	remaining	5	percent	on	exit.	Across	interventions,	regulations,	
     trade,	and	investment	promotion	account	for	almost	half	of	all	interventions.	There	is	an	
     interesting	“division	of	labor”	among	the	two	institutions.	The	World	Bank	conducts	almost	
     exclusively	(over	80	percent	of	all)	interventions	in	trade	and	property	rights,	as	well	as	
     the	majority	of	interventions	on	investment	promotion.	In	IFC	projects,	in	contrast,	the	

26   Investment Climate Reforms
majority	(60	percent)	focus	on	licensing	and	registration.	Both	institutions	operate	equally	in	
regulation	and	public-private	dialogue.	Interestingly,	IFC	is	the	only	institution	that	classifies	
some	interventions	as	Doing	Business	indicators.

In	terms	of	value,	investment	climate	interventions	in	the	World	Bank	are	very	small;	the	value	
is	even	smaller	for	IFC:	less	than	$6	million	for	the	Bank	and	less	than	$1	million	for	IFC.	
Typically	the	amounts	related	to	investment	climate	interventions	under	Bank	(lending)	projects	
are	significantly	higher	than	those	related	to	IFC	advisory	services,	given	the	different	nature	
and	delivery	models	of	the	respective	activities.

The	distribution	of	interventions	over	time	shows	a	remarkably	similar	trend	for	the	two	
institutions.	Over	the	FY07–13	period,	the	World	Bank	and	IFC	both	supported	a	similar	
number	of	investment	climate	interventions	(85	and	78	interventions	per	year,	respectively),	
for	a	total	of	597	for	the	World	Bank	and	547	for	IFC	(Figure	1.4).	In	terms	of	value,	however,	
the	two	institutions	provide	a	significantly	different	amount	of	support.	The	estimated	value	
of	World	Bank	investment	climate	interventions	is	equivalent	to	an	estimated	value	of	$475	
million	per	year	for	the	World	Bank	and	$50	million	for	IFC	(Figure	1.5).	

The	distribution	of	investment	climate	interventions	across	regions	(Figure	1.6)	and	income	
levels	shows	that	both	the	World	Bank	and	IFC	intervene	most	in	Sub-Saharan	Africa	(37	
percent	of	all	interventions	for	both	institutions)	and	Europe	and	Central	Asia	(24	percent	
for	World	Bank	and	17	percent	for	IFC),	followed	by	in	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	
for	the	World	Bank	(17	percent)	and	East	Asia	and	Pacific	for	IFC	(15	percent).	The	Middle	
East	and	north	Africa	and	South	Asia	Regions	have	the	fewest	interventions	(4	percent

       for	World	Bank	and	10	percent	for	IFC,	respectively).	It	is	interesting	to	note	that	although	
       both	institutions	have	the	highest	number	of	active	projects	in	Africa	and	Europe	and	
       Central	Asia,	they	complement	each	other	in	the	distribution	of	new	projects	(active)	in	
       Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	and	the	Middle	East	and	north	Africa,	with	the	World	
       Bank	focusing	more	in	the	former	and	IFC	more	in	the	latter.	Similarly,	both	institutions	

28     Investment Climate Reforms
pay	particular	attention	to	lower-	and	lower-middle-income	countries,	where	8	of	10	
interventions	are	implemented.

All	interventions25	have	active	projects,	with	regulation,	investment	policy,	trade,	and	tax	being	
the	most	common	and	competition	and	labor	the	least.	Bankruptcy	is	the	only	intervention	
for	which	there	are	no	active	projects	as	of	the	end	of	FY13.	On	average,	investment	climate	
interventions	are	implemented	in	less	than	3	years	(32	months).	However,	when	in	the	World	
Bank	these	are	part	of	lending	operations,	the	average	length	is	substantially	higher.	World	
Bank	development	policy	operations	with	investment	climate	components	are	completed	on	
average	in	less	than	two	years;	projects	that	include	mostly	investment	climate	components	
are	implemented	on	average	over	six	years.	

With	very	few	exceptions,	namely	bankruptcy	and	ADR,	the	distribution	of	interventions	
across	regions	shows	that	Africa	is	the	region	where	the	majority	of	interventions	take	place,	
followed	by	Europe	and	Central	Asia	and	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	(Table	1.7).	In	
terms	of	income	the	distribution	of	interventions	shows	that	almost	half	of	interventions	are	
in	low-income	countries,	whereas	entry	and	exit	almost	equally	distributed	between	the	three	
income	groups.	

In	a	few	countries,	for	example,	Cambodia,	interventions	focus	on	specific	areas	such	as	trade	
promotion.	The	World	Bank	Group	did	several	things	to	promote	trade:	developed	a	guide	
to	the	World	Trade	Organization	to	inform	businesses	about	the	implications	of	entry	into	that	
organization;	provided	support	for	the	development	of	an	alternative	dispute	resolution	system	
for	commercial	disputes;	helped	establish	a	legal	and	institutional	framework	for	special	
economic	zones	(SEZs);	and	supported	reductions	in	trade	and	investment-related	processes	
and	procedures	through	a	single	window	system.

Often	the	World	Bank	Group,	particularly	IFC,	also	supports	business	regulations	through	
programmatic	approaches	that	cover	many	different	aspects	of	investment	climate.	
In	Vietnam,	the	World	Bank	supported	investment	climate	reform	through	five	Poverty	
Reduction	Support	Credits.	These	projects	supported	trade	and	economic	integration,	tax	
regulations,	land	regulations,	and	labor	skills.	IFC	projects	supported	licensing,	land,	and	tax	
reforms.

In	Bangladesh,	IFC	had	a	major	programmatic	approach	through	the	Bangladesh	Investment	
Climate	Fund.	One	advantage	of	this	approach	is	that	it	allowed	the	Bangladesh	Investment	
Climate	Fund	(BICF)	to	re-engage	with	the	line	ministries	at	all	levels	to	push	a	program	
forward	after	a	change	in	government.	The	BICF	covered	a	set	of	regulatory	reforms	and	
economic	zones.	The	program	supported	drafting	and	approval	of	an	economic	zoned	
act	and	assisted	the	Bangladesh	Export	Processing	Zones	Authority	in	developing	an

In the investment climate portfolio, explicit targeting—based either on the entrepreneur on
the	firm	characteristics—is	not	common.	IEG	considered	six	“targeting	dimensions,”	three	
regarding	the	entrepreneur’s	characteristics	(gender,	age,	geographical	location)	and	three	
regarding	the	firm’s	characteristics	(formality	status,	exporting	status,	industry).	Projects	were	
coded	based	on	whether	they	included	an	explicit	targeting	criterion	for	the	beneficiaries	of	
the	intervention	and	whether	they	reported	results	for	the	specific	group	that	was	targeted.	
Only	8	percent	of	all	projects	specifically	aimed	to	target	women,	and	a	similar	percentage	
targeted	firms	based	on	their	industry	and	formality	status.

Targeting	based	on	age,	geographical	area,	or	export	status	is	even	rarer	(Table	1.8).	
Moreover,	only	a	minority	of	projects	with	a	specific	target	actually	report	on	results	for	the

     targeted	group;	for	example,	only	22.2	percent	of	those	projects	specifically	targeting	firms	
     based	on	their	formality	status	do.	As	for	gender,	fewer	than	4	of	10	closed	projects	that	had	
     a	gender	target	report	any	gender-disaggregated	result	or	gender-relevant	results.	

     Targeting	by	gender	increased	in	FY12	and	especially	FY13,	with	respect	to	the	previous	
     years	(Figure	1.7).	Significant	changes	over	time	did	not	occur	for	other	targeting	criteria.	
     The	increase	in	gender	targeting	in	the	last	two	fiscal	years	likely	reflects	the	renewed	focus	on	
     gender	mainstreaming	by	the	World	Bank	Group.	Since	FY13,	a	“gender	flag”	was	introduced	
     to	identify	“gender-informed”	operations.	The	gender	flag—self-assigned	by	the	project	
     team—rates	an	operation	as	“gender	informed”	if	the	project	documents	integrate	gender	in	
     either	one	of	three	dimensions:	analysis,	actions,	or	monitoring	and	evaluation	(M&E).	

     The	definition	of	gender	targeting	adopted	by	IEG	for	this	evaluation	is	narrower	than	the	
     definition	of	gender-informed	according	to	the	gender	flag,	although	both	are	based	on	the	
     same	appraisal	documents	and	on	the	identification	of	an	explicit	focus	on	gender	(for	this	
     evaluation,	“gender-targeting”	is	defined	as	an	explicit	aim	to	target	women	with	specific	
     activities).27	An	analysis	of	the	overlap	between	the	gender	flag	and	the	investment	climate	
     gender	targeting	in	design	for	FY13,	after	limiting	the	sample	to	World	Bank	operations,	reveals	
     very	little	overlap.	According	to	the	gender	flag,	66	percent	of	World	Bank	investment	climate	
     operations	are	gender	informed;	based	on	the	targeting	criteria,	however,	only	23	percent	are.

The	prevalence	of	specific	targeting	in	project	design	also	varies	by	networks	and	regions.	
Of	projects	in	all	regions,	those	in	the	Middle	East	and	north	Africa	are	more	likely	to	
include	in	their	design	a	target	by	gender	as	well	as	by	firm	formality	status	There	are	also	
differences	across	networks	in	the	propensity	to	target	specific	groups,	with	IFC	more	
likely	to	target	specific	firms	(by	formality	status	and	industry;	Table	1.9	)	and	the	Human	
Development	network	to	target	youth	(Table	1.10).	Most	of	these	correlations	are	confirmed	
in	the	multivariate	analysis28 —gender	targeting	was	higher	in	FY13	than	in	previous	years	
and	lower	in	the	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	Region.	Targeting	of	firms	based	on	their	
formal/informal	status	is	less	common	in	PREM	and	SDn	than	in	other	networks,	and	most	
common	in	the	Middle	East	and	north	Africa	Region.	Targeting	of	specific	industries	is	also	
less	common	in	PREM	and	SDn.	

A	close	analysis	of	projects	targeting	gender	reveals	that	many	are	small	in	size	and	mostly	
focused	on	capacity-building	activities	or	on	filling	an	information	gap	relative	to	gender-
based	barriers	in	the	business	enabling	environment.	Most	of	those	projects	target	women	
as	participants	of	training	or	consultative	working	groups	rather	than	as	entrepreneurs	
(or	potential	entrepreneurs)	who	may	directly	benefit	from	investment	climate	reforms.	The	
gender	dimension	was	also	more	easily	found	in	activities	aimed	to	produce	diagnostic	and	
baseline	assessments.

Whether	investment	climate	interventions	should	explicitly	target	specific	subgroups	of	the	
population	rather	than	promoting	reforms	aimed	at	improving	the	general	business	environment	
of	a	country	is	a	question	without	a	straightforward	answer.	On	the	one	hand,	by	their	very	
nature	reforms	are	supposed	to	be	general,	and	any	specific	provision	could	be	perceived	as

34   Investment Climate Reforms
The	disadvantageous	position	of	women	in	entrepreneurship	has	been	widely	documented.	
Gender-specific	obstacles	make	it	harder	for	women	than	for	men	to	start	and	grow	
enterprises.	Fewer	women	than	men	own	and	manage	businesses	worldwide	(Kelley	
and	others	2012).	Also,	in	all	regions	of	the	world,	including	in	developed	economies,	
female-owned	enterprises	are	substantially	and	significantly	smaller	(Bardasi,	Sabarwal,	and	
Terrell	2011;	Minniti	2010),	partly	because	women	are	more	likely	to	operate	in	industries	
where	firms	are	smaller	and	less	efficient,	but	also	because	women	face	disproportionate	
obstacles	in	obtaining	licenses	and	permits	(because	of	limited	mobility,	time	constraints,	
and	sometimes	discrimination	and	higher	exposure	to	bribes	and	sexual	harassment)	and	
in	accessing	a	number	of	things:	finance,	markets,	courts	and	dispute	resolution	systems,	
networks,	and	assets	and	property.	

In	addition	to	de	facto	constraints	such	as	those	highlighted	above,	in	some	countries	women	
also	suffer	legal	discrimination,	as	has	been	documented	in	the	World	Bank	Group	report	
Women, Business, and the Law.	In	several	countries	women	have	lower	legal	status	and	fewer	
property	rights	than	men;	they	may	be	subject	to	travel	restrictions;	or	they	may	be	forbidden	
from	pursuing	certain	trades	or	professions	in	the	same	way	as	men	(World	Bank	2014).	
Reforms	that	neglect	to consider	de	facto	or	legal	constraints	that	limit	women’s	opportunities	
could	have	unintended	consequences—the	assumption	may	be	that	the	intervention	is	
“gender	neutral”	although	in	fact	only	some	are	able	to	benefit.	Investment	climate	reforms	
could	address	existing	constraints	that	limit	women’s	business	opportunities,	thus	leveling	the	
playing	field	and	enhancing	the	project	efficacy.	

On	the	basis	of	the	existing	literature	and	Women, Business, and the Law	(World	Bank	2014),	
IEG	identified	four	types	of	constraints	as	directly	impacting	the	ability	of	women	to	operate	
in	the	business	environment:	unequal	ownership	rights	to	property;	inability	to	sign	a	contract	
in	the	same	way	as	a	man;	inability	to	register	a	business	in	the	same	way	as	a	man;	and	
inability	to	open	a	Bank	account	in	the	same	way	as	a	man.	Typically,	these	limitations	apply	
only	to	married	women.	Four	possible	combinations	can	be	observed	(Table	1.11).	Investment	
climate	reforms	may	be	designed	with	knowledge	of	legal	or	de	facto	constraints	and	explicitly	
aim	to	address	those	constraints	to	ensure	inclusion.	Alternatively,	investment	climate	reforms	
may	claim	to	be	gender	neutral,	although	they	might	be	implemented	in	environments	where	
specific	gender	constraints	exist.	

IEG’s	review	of	the	investment	climate	portfolio	shows	that	in	89	percent	of	interventions	
targeting	is,	in	principle,	done	correctly.	More	specifically,	in	81	percent	of	interventions,	
investment	climate	reforms	do	not	include	gender	targeting	when	there	are	no	gender-specific	
legal	constraints	(although	other	relevant	constraints	may	exist),	and	in	8	percent	of	interventions	
investment	climate	reforms	target	businesswomen	because	of	other	nonlegal	constraints.

     unequal	ownership	rights	to	property;	inability	to	sign	a	contract	in	the	same	way	as	a	man;	inability	to	register	a	business	in	
     the	same	way	as	a	man;	and	inability	of	opening	a	Bank	account	in	the	same	way	as	a	man.

     opportunities that men have (activities include support for legal reforms, communication
     along the reform process, and development of evaluation tool for measuring their effective
     impacts). According to the Project Appraisal Document, this will result in an improvement
     of the economic situation of women, measured by the increase in the number of individual
     enterprises owned by women. In general, however, projects that target women deliver training
     and capacity-building activities that, although they may increase women’s awareness of their
     disadvantaged situation, do not directly tackle existing legal constraints.

     INVESTMENT CLIMATE PORTFOLIO: FCS

     Overall, 15 percent of investment climate projects are implemented in FCS countries. IFC
     shows a slightly higher share of investment climate projects in FCS countries than the World
     Bank. However, in absolute terms, both institutions have approximately the same number of
     investment climate projects. Over time, the number of investment climate projects has held
     steady at around 12 per year, with both institutions having seen a drop in the number of
     projects in FCS countries over the last few years (Figure 1.8).

     In terms of interventions, the most common interventions in FCS countries (accounting for over
     50 percent of all) are regulation, investment promotion, trade, and public-private dialogue.

     INVESTMENT CLIMATE PORTFOLIO: INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SECTORS

     Recent FIAS strategies identified two sectors for specific investment climate interventions:
     agribusiness and tourism. The agriculture sector accounts for a substantial share of

developing	countries’	economies,	growing	at	a	rate	of	more	than	5	percent	every	year	
and	providing	income	for	more	than	half	of	the	countries’	workers.	Moreover,	most	of	the	
population	in	developing	countries	lives	in	rural	areas	and	depends	on	agriculture	for	its	
livelihood.	Inefficient	market	for	inputs,	overregulation,	and	costly	trade	logistics	in	turn	make	
domestic	products	uncompetitive.	Given	the	importance	of	the	agribusiness	sector	to	the	
economy,	governments	have	identified	it	as	a	priority,	aligning	World	Bank	interventions	to	
countries’	own	national	strategies	in,	for	example,	Bangladesh,	Ghana,	Honduras,	India,	
Mali,	the	Philippines,	and	Ukraine.

Tourism	represents	approximately	70	percent	of	export	services	for	the	world’s	least	
developed	countries	(compared	to	the	world	average	of	35	percent).30	Tourism	dominates	
the	service	sector	in	most	client	countries,	which	identify	it	as	a	key	economic	sector	in	
the	national	strategies	of,	for	instance,	India,	Peru,	Saint	Lucia,	and	Sierra	Leone.	It	is	
second	to	agriculture	in	terms	of	employment	generation	per	unit	of	investment	and	is	a	
valuable	source	of	foreign	exchange.	However,	a	range	of	impediments	continues	to	inhibit	
investment,	including	complicated	and	nontransparent	approval	processes	for	tourism	
licenses;	ineffective	institutional	structures	of	public	or	private	sector	agencies	responsible	
for	tourism	development;	weak	institutional	capacity	to	develop	appropriate	policy,	plans,	
and	processes	for	tourism	investments;	accessibility;	complex	land	issues/limited	availability	
of	land	for	tourism	development;	ineffective	aviation	policies;	and	lack	of	access	to	
finance.	

The	relevant	portfolio	includes	both	projects	mapped	under	the	Investment	Climate	for	Industry	
practice	and	those	not	mapped	to	it	but	that	cover	sector-specific	sector	reforms	in	agriculture	
and	industry,	including	regulatory	reforms.	To	characterize	and	evaluate	this	portfolio	of	
activities,	IEG	took	two	approaches.	First,	as	part	of	the	broad	review	of	all	investment	climate	
projects,	the	portfolio	analysis	identified	projects	within	the	investment	climate	portfolio	that	
(i)	promoted	sector-specific	reforms	in	agribusiness	or	tourism;	(ii)	identified	agribusiness	
or	tourism	as	industries	of	interest;	and	(iii)	had	components	and/or	project	development	
objectives	that	mentioned	developing	the	agribusiness	and	tourism	sectors.31	

In	addition,	IEG	reviewed	a	list	of	relevant	projects	provided	by	the	Investment	Climate	for	
Industry	practice	and	added	those	projects	not	already	identified	in	the	portfolio	review	
that	were	deemed	to	meet	both	the	general	criteria	for	belonging	in	the	investment	climate	
portfolio	and	the	criteria	for	being	sectorally	relevant	to	agriculture	or	tourism.	Second,	the	
team	reviewed	evidence	from	19	completed	case	studies	to	consider	if	country	strategy	
identified	these	sectors	as	development	priorities	and	if	specific	interventions	promoted	
Investment	Climate	for	Industry	in	these	two	sectors.	IEG	then	further	considered	case	studies	
that	met	both	criteria.

     Investment	climate	projects	with	components	focused	on	agribusiness	and/or	tourism	constitute	
     a	significant	part	of	the	overall	investment	climate	portfolio,	including	about	18	percent	of	
     World	Bank	investment	climate	investment	projects	and	16	percent	of	IFC	investment	climate	
     advisory	projects	(Appendix	Figure	B.1).	By	commitment	value	of	relevant	components,	again	
     18	percent	of	the	World	Bank	investment	climate	portfolio	and	16	percent	of	the	IFC	investment	
     climate	portfolio	involve	investment	climate	for	agribusiness	or	tourism	elements.	Although	the	
     number	and	value	of	investment	projects	on	the	World	Bank	side	do	not	show	a	clear	trend	
     since	the	creation	of	a	practice	group,	the	IFC	advisory	portfolio	has	expanded	in	recent	years.

     Regionally,	more	than	half	of	the	World	Bank’s	projects	are	in	Africa	(Appendix	Figure	B.2)	
     and	a	further	quarter	in	Eastern	Europe	and	Central	Asia;	IFC	has	its	largest	share	(305)	in	
     Africa	but	a	more	even	distribution	across	other	regions.	Thirteen	percent	of	its	investment	
     climate	industry	advisory	projects	are	not	in	any	one	region,	but	are	global	in	focus.	However,	
     in	terms	of	commitment	value	of	components,	the	IFC	and	the	World	Bank	each	has	just	under	
     half	the	portfolio	value	in	Africa.	Further,	the	World	Bank	has	nearly	a	third	of	its	component	
     commitment	value	in	Europe	and	Central	Asia,	whereas	IFC	has	17	percent	of	commitment	
     value	there.	Comparing	the	investment	climate	industry	portfolio	to	the	investment	climate	
     portfolio	in	energy	sector	projects,	the	latter	is	considerably	more	concentrated	in	Europe	and	
     Central	Asia	for	the	World	Bank	and	in	the	Middle	East	and	north	Africa,	Europe	and	Central	
     Asia,	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean,	and	“world”	for	IFC.

     Finally,	by	income	level,	although	it	appears	that	by	number	the	World	Bank	is	more	
     focused	on	lower-income	countries	and	IFC	advisory	on	lower-middle-income	countries,	
     component	commitment	levels	suggest	much	more	of	a	balance	between	the	two	
     institutions	(Appendix	Figure	B.3.B).	The	Bank	and	IFC	each	have	around	half	of	their	
     portfolios	in	lower-income	countries	and	most	of	the	balance	in	lower-middle-income	
     countries,	suggesting	a	serious	focus	on	countries	with	large	numbers	of	poor	people	and	
     development	challenges.

     Many	of	the	activities	supported	under	investment	climate	for	industry	do	not	fit	strictly	within	the	
     confines	of	the	legal	and	regulatory	focus	of	the	investment	climate	portfolio.	Instead,	sectoral	
     studies	often	identify	a	much	broader	variety	of	constraints,	opportunities,	and	challenges	
     and	often	map	out	relevant	value	chains	or	supply	chains.	World	Bank	investments	often	have	
     financing	components,	whereas	IFC	projects	often	incorporate	“stakeholder	engagement	and	
     outreach.”	There	are	elements	of	investment	and	sectoral	promotion,	training,	capacity	building,	
     technological	upgrading,	and	even	physical	infrastructure	improvement	in	some	of	the	projects	
     (Appendix	Table	B.1).	Box	1.1	provides	examples	of	industry-specific	projects.	In	fact,	both	the	
     investment	climate	for	industry	and	the	competitive	industries	practices	often	employ	value	
     chain	approaches	to	promote	sectoral	development	and	increased	sectoral	competitiveness.	

40   Investment Climate Reforms
BOX 1.1	 Examples	of	Agribusiness	and	Tourism	Investment	Climate	Interventions

In	agribusiness,	specific	interventions	either	are	trade	reforms	or	are	aimed	at	
restructuring	the	agricultural	industry	per	se.	When	it	comes	to	agricultural trade,	
specific	interventions	are	aimed	at	reducing	compliance,	transport,	and	transaction	
costs	for	agribusiness	products	and	related	inputs	that	can	result	in	a	more	efficient	
and	competitive	trade	and	transport	environment.	This	is	mainly	done	in	three	ways:	
(i)	simplification	of	regulatory	instruments	and	requirements	for	trade	facilitation	and	
logistics;	(ii)	reforms	in	the	shipping	methods	to	remove	anticompetitive	regulations	
and	promote	competition,	such	as	shipping	association	certification	for	chartering	of	
foreign	vessels	for	deployment	in	domestic	routes;	and	(iii)	a	project	agenda	usually	
being	facilitated	through	a	focused	public-private	dialogue	platform	on	agribusiness	
trade	logistics,	and	transport,	which	is	a	structured	stakeholders’	dialogue	to	improve	
policy	design,	increase	ownership	and	sustainability	of	reforms,	and,	ultimately,	reform	
effectiveness.	The	2011	Philippines	Agribusiness	Trade	Competitiveness	and	the	
Honduras	Agribusiness	Trade	Logistics	Projects	are	examples	of	this.	
When	a	project	is	aimed	at	improving	the	agricultural industry	per	se,	reforms	
address	the	main	regulatory	and	policy	constraints	hindering	priority	commodities	
(national	produces)	that	aim	to	improve	input	market	and	storage	capacity	and	
modernize	food	safety,	roads,	and	agricultural	infrastructures	(such	as	irrigation)	and	
product	certification	system	to	facilitate	investments	in	the	sector.	Another	approach	is	
to	simplify	procedures	related	to	agriwaste	processing	and	production	of	renewable	
energy,	as	in	the	Ukraine	Investment	Climate:	Agribusiness	and	Cleaner	Production	
Project.	The	interventions	also	support	individual	producers,	community	groups,	and	
agricultural	processors;	they	help	test	and	develop	technology	appropriate	to	identified	
market	opportunities	and	facilitate	access	for	individual	small	and	medium-size	farmers	
to	finance	for	small	capital	improvements	and	working	capital	through	existing	eligible	
microcredit	organizations.	An	example	of	this	is	the	Small-Scale	Commercial	Agriculture	
Development	Project	in	Bosnia	and	Herzegovina.	
In	tourism,	interventions	are	typically	less	specific	and	coincide	with	the	creation	of	a	
diagnostic	tool	such	as	a	database,	interpretation	and	presentation	of	findings	and	scores	
on	the	preparedness	for	sustainable	development	of	the	tourism	sector,	or	benchmarking	
of	destinations.	This	is	the	case	of	the	Tourism	Investment	and	Development	Advisory	
Services	Global	Project.	Sometimes,	the	interventions	become	more	explicit	and	entail	
assisting	the	government	in	structuring	hotel	deals,	attracting	foreign	investors,	and	
updating	the	land	legislation.	Other	reforms	deal	with	operation	licenses	and	renewals	
for	hotels	and	other	SMEs	involved	in	tourism,	or	the	upgrading	of	the	public	transport	
system	and	museums.	More	explicit	interventions	are,	for	example,	the	Investment	Climate	
Reform	Project	in	Mali	and	the	Bihar	Investment	Climate	Reform	Phase	II	Project.

       	 This	is	the	only	World	Development	Report	to	specifically	focus	on	the	investment	climate.	The	2002	World	Development	
     Report	(World	Bank	2001)	focused	on	institutions	and	overlapped	with	the	2005	World	Development	Report.	In	particular,	the	
     report	had	chapters	on	courts,	finance,	and	infrastructure.	The	2002	report,	however,	did	not	focus	on	investment	and	did	not	
     rely	primarily	on	firm-level	evidence.	


42   Investment Climate Reforms

  	 In	addition	to	FIAS,	the	CIC	also	included	the	Monitoring	and	Analysis	Group	that	created	the	Doing	Business	report	and	
Investment	Climate	Unit	that	oversaw	Investment	Climate	Assessments	(World	Bank	2004a).	

17
  	 Forty	percent	of	MIGA’s	technical	assistance	interventions	were	overlapping	with	FIAS	technical	assistance	operations,	
because	of		an	explicit	shift	in	MIGA	strategy	in	2003	that	called	for	greater	alignment	with	investment	climate	work	across	the	
institutions	(World	Bank	2006).

18
  	 The	Doing	Business	law	library	is	a	comprehensive	online	collection	of	business	laws	and	regulations.	The	coverage	of	the	
laws	is	not	limited	to	Doing	Business	indicators.	It	links	to	official	government	sources	(that	is	civil	laws,	commercial	laws,	and	
so	forth)	when	possible.

19
  	 Starting	from	1995	till	the	mid-2000s,	FIAS	produced	diagnostic	reports	on	administrative	barriers.	FIAS	conducted	
business	surveys	and	templates	to	provide	more	detail	and	data	to	its	general	diagnostics.	Starting	from	the	2000s,	FIAS	
moved	from	stand-alone	diagnostics	to	projects	that	focus	on	solution	design	and	implementation.	In	FY07,	less	than	20	
percent	of	completed	projects	were	stand-alone	diagnostics.

20
     	 See	Appendix	A	for	a	detailed	description	of	the	portfolio	methodology.

21
     	 The	number	of	projects	includes	World	Bank	projects	that	were	open	in	FY07	even	if	approved	as	early	as	FY03.

 	 All	values	for	the	World	Bank	are	estimated	and	refer	only	to	investment	climate	interventions	(not	to	the	whole	project	
22


value).	Further,	this	estimate	excludes	the	value	of	sector	specific	interventions,	estimated	at	$61	million	for	IFC	and	$2,649	
million	for	the	World	Bank.	See	Appendix	B	for	more	details	on	portfolio	characteristics.

23
     	 Relative	to	the	total	network	portfolio.

24
  	 The	intervention	classification	is	based	on	the	classification	reported	in	the	project	documents.	Consequently	the	
classification	“DB	indicators”	appears	as	reported	in	project	documents.

25
     	 Intervention	is	the	specific	regulatory	reform	being	achieved.

 	 The	design	of	the	project	was	informed	by	the	2011	nepal	Investment	Climate	Assessment	report,	based	on	the	nepal	
26


Enterprise	Survey	of	2009.

27
     	 Women	are	typically	the	targeted	group.

28
  	 Probit	regressions	have	been	estimated	for	the	probability	of	including	a	specific	targeting	in	design,	controlling	
simultaneously	for	fiscal	year,	region,	network,	and	country	income	classification.

29
  	 In	the	remaining	1	percent	of	cases	it	is	not	possible	to	assess	whether	there	was	targeting	because	of	multiplicity	of	
situations	that	can	occur.

  	 This	was	not	always	evident	from	the	coding.	For	example,	several	World	Bank	and	IFC	projects	coded	“trade	facilitation”	
contained	specific	language	about	the	agribusiness	supply	chain.

46   Investment Climate Reforms
2   Relevance	of	World	Bank	Group	
    Investment	Climate	Interventions	


                   HIGHLIGHTS
                   •	At	the	corporate	and	network	level,	strategies	have	identified	
                     improving	the	business	environment	as	one	of	the	strategic	
                     pillars	of	the	institutions’	agenda	under	PSD.

                   •	At	the	country	level,	nearly	all	World	Bank	Group	country	
                     partnership	and	assistance	strategies	identify	enhancing	the	
                     investment	climate	as	a	main	objective.	The	main	constraints	
                     are	lack	of	competition,	barriers	to	establish	and	operate	
                     businesses,	costs	of	doing	business,	and	regulatory	burdens.

                   •	Virtually	all	regulatory	areas	for	a	business-friendly	regulatory	
                     environment	are	covered	by	World	Bank	Group	interventions,	
                     and	interventions	are	properly	prioritized	in	client	countries.

                   •	Two	diagnostic	tools	most	commonly	used	to	identify	
                     regulatory	reforms,	Doing	Business	and	Enterprise	Surveys,	
                     are	only	partially	relevant	in	helping	the	World	Bank	Group	
                     identify	appropriate	areas	of	intervention.

                   •	The	consultation	process	and	diagnostic	analysis	rarely	cover	
                     a	set	of	stakeholders	in	society	beyond	government	and	
                     businesses.




    An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	2   47
     This	chapter	presents	evidence	on	the	extent	to	which	support	for	regulatory	reforms	has	been	a	
     strategic	priority	for	the	World	Bank	Group	and	whether	it	has	been	relevant	to	client	countries.	
     IEG	provides	evidence	at	three	levels:	(i)	Strategic	level—do	corporate	and	country	strategies	
     identify	investment	climate	reforms	as	a	priority?	(ii)	Interventions	level—is	the	World	Bank	Group	
     offering	the	right	set	of	investment	climate	reforms	in	the	right	countries?	and	(iii)	Analytical	level—
     do	diagnostic	tools	adequately	inform	investment	climate	reforms	supported	by	the	Bank	Group?

     Between	2007	and	2013,	the	Bank	Group	supported	regulatory	reforms	in	119	countries	
     through	nearly	15	types	of	interventions.	These	countries	significantly	varied	in	terms	of	their	
     development	levels	and	challenges,	but	they	all	pursued	investment	climate	reforms	with	the	
     goal	of	improving	the	regulatory	environment	for	private	sector	development.

     Overall,	World	Bank	Group	strategies	intend	to	enhance	competition,	foster	enterprise	
     creation	and	growth,	facilitate	international	trade	and	investment,	and	unlock	sustainable	
     investment	opportunities	in	key	sectors,	such	as	agribusiness	and	tourism	(World	Bank	
     2002,	2013).	They	pursue	these	objectives	by	reducing	time,	costs,	and	procedures	and	by	
     simplifying	regulations.	For	example,	the	FIAS	strategy	(2012–16)	indicates	that	more	firms	
     enter	the	market	and	grow	when	start-up	time	and	cost	are	cut,	operating	licenses	and	fees	
     preventing	entry	to	specific	markets	are	removed,	tax	distortions	are	eliminated,	and	tax	
     procedures	are	simplified.	

     In	general,	these	strategies	focus	on	creating	favorable	market	conditions	for	enterprises	and	
     do	not	explicitly	take	into	account	other	stakeholders	in	society;	the	earlier	2002	PSD	strategy	
     indicates	that	consultations	for	reforms	should	fit	with	what	is	achievable	in	a	given	economic,	
     political,	and	social	context.	Basically,	these	reforms	assume	that	what	is	good	for	firms	is	
     also	good	for	society,	although	some	(de)regulations	may	have	significant	consequences	for	
     different	stakeholders	in	society.


     Relevance	of	Investment	Climate	at	the	Corporate	and	Country	
     Strategic	Levels
     At	the	corporate	level,	the	most	recent	World	Bank	Group	Strategy	(2013)	acknowledges	that	
     improving	business	environment	is	a	key	to	stimulating	private	sector	investment	and	jobs	and	
     achieving	the	twin	goals	of	ending	extreme	poverty	and	promoting	shared	prosperity.	Similarly,	
     earlier	World	Bank	and	IFC	corporate	strategies	made	improving	the	investment	climate	one	of	
     the	strategic	pillars	of	the	institutions’	agenda	for	PSD	(World	Bank	2009–10,	IFC	2007–13).

     The	World	Bank	strategy	commits	the	institution	to	promoting	reforms	aimed	at	improving	the	
     environment	for	business,	with	the	objective	of	promoting	a	robust	and	competitive	private	sector.	
     Similarly,	IFC’s	corporate	strategy	commits	the	institution	to	promote	open	and	competitive	

48   Investment Climate Reforms
markets	in	developing	countries	through,	among	other	initiatives,	reforms	of	the	business	
enabling	environment	(IFC	2013).	The	latest	World	Bank	Group	strategy	renews	the	commitment	
of	the	Bank	Group	to	help	countries	improve	their	business	environment	through	institutions	and	
regulations	that	support	PSD,	policy	dialogue,	and	advisory	and	knowledge	work.	

Although	corporate	strategies	do	not	touch	on	the	contextual	factors	in	the	delivery	of	
investment	climate	interventions,	the	most	recent	FIAS	strategy	prioritizes	IDA-eligible	countries,	
Sub-Saharan	Africa,	FCS,	and	sectoral	interventions	(for	example,	agribusiness	and	tourism).	
In	IDA	countries,	investment	climate	reforms	aim	to	provide	a	signaling	effect	for	both	domestic	
and	foreign	investors.	Fostering	employment	and	competitiveness,	reducing	vulnerability,	and	
strengthening	resilience	are	themes	in	the	Bank’s	Africa	regional	strategy,	and	investment	climate	
strategic	priorities	are	aligned	with	these.	In	FCS,	the	World	Bank	Group	aims	to	support	the	
implementation	of	integrated	programs	that	draw	on	products	and	expertise	that	have	been	
particularly	useful	to	them,	such	as	business	entry,	licensing,	tax	reforms,	SEZs,	trade	logistics,	
and	industry-specific	investment	climate	work	with	related	investment	facilitation	activities.

Finally,	the	World	Bank	Group	puts	a	special	focus	on	investment	climate	reform	in	
two	sectors	that	have	broad	relevance	to	development	in	many	low-income	countries:	
agribusiness	and	tourism.	These	two	sectors	are	major	sources	of	employment.	Agriculture	
is	the	most	important	sector	in	most	developing	countries.	Therefore,	identifying	and	
removing	industry-specific	barriers	that	hinder	competition	and	improving	the	regulatory	and	
institutional	framework	for	accessing	finance	in	agriculture	are	important.	Similarly,	tourism	is	
in	some	cases	the	most	significant	service	sector	for	many	IDA	countries,	second	to	agriculture	
only	in	terms	of	employment	generation	per	unit	of	investment	(World	Bank	2011a).	

At	the	network	level,	a	number	of	sectors	have	equally	identified	the	improvement	of	the	
regulatory	environment	as	a	key	aspect	of	their	strategy.	The	most	obvious	is	FPD.	Investment	
climate,	under	different names	(that	is,	business	environment,	enabling	environment),	has	
been	part	of	the	World	Bank’s	PSD	strategies	since	the	late	1980s.	The	1980s	witnessed	
increased	attention	to	the	promotion	of	foreign	investments	with	the	establishment	of	FIAS	by	
IFC	in	1985	and,	soon	after	that,	the	creation	of	MIGA,	with	the	mandate	to	facilitate	foreign	
direct	investment.

The	World	Bank	Group	PSD	strategy	(2002)	remains	the	strategy	with	the	most	emphasis	on	
investment	climate	activities.	It	defines	a	good	investment	climate	as	a	sensible	governance	
system	that	allows	firms	and	farms	to	pursue	productive	activity,	with	contracts	and	property	
rights	respected	and	with	reduced	corruption.	Overall,	enhancing	the	investment	climate	
is	seen	as	a	strong	public	policy	for	the	private	sector,	including	the	required	supporting	
institutions.	The	strategy	identifies	three	main	sets	of	activities	to	improve	investment	climate	

                   An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	2   49
     in client countries: (i) indicators and benchmarking country performance; (ii) responsive
     advisory services that equip governments with the tools to implement reforms and measure
     results; and (iii) policy and investment loans to support requests based on these reforms.
     The strategy promotes systematic Enterprise Surveys and Investment Climate Assessments to
     identify features of the investment climate that matter most for productivity, as well tracking
     changes over time in the investment climate within and across countries. The lending or
     technical assistance of the Bank Group would build on these assessments. The 2009 update
     to the PSD strategy reiterated the importance of enhancing investment climate. Its focus is on
     improving regulatory quality and systemic capacities to develop new regulation.

     Other networks’ strategies have devoted attention to the policy and regulatory environment.
     For example, one of the priorities of the Bank trade strategy is to support regulatory reform
     and cooperation. The Bank Group trade strategy (2011) proposes a continuation of the current
     lending trend, but with a stronger focus on the regulatory dimensions of transport and facilitation
     projects. The strategy emphasizes the need to help countries mainstream trade into statistical
     development strategies at national and regional levels so that barriers to trade (including
     regulatory) can be assessed and benchmark indicators can be developed to assess performance.
     The International Trade Department is developing a toolkit for trade-impact assessment tailored
     to the needs of developing countries based on the principles of Regulatory Impact Assessment.
     The development of the trade barriers database by the Development Economics Vice Presidency
     has been particularly useful in identifying these barriers (World Bank 2011b).

     The most recent Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy plans to expand the Bank’s role
     in the regulatory reform area. For many years the network has been supporting analytical
     work to guide dialogue with client countries on improving the policy and legal environment
     for agriculture including developing methods and country case studies of the rural investment
     climate. With its new agriculture strategy (FY13–15) the World Bank intends to continue
     to support analytical work, whereas IFC focuses on regulatory reform, warehouse system
     regulation, competition policy, and tax and incentive reform in the sector. In addition, the
     World Bank Group is developing the Benchmarking the Business of Agriculture program
     which will identify and monitor policies and regulations that limit market access for small to
     medium-size producers, providing policy makers with a tool that can be used to strengthen
     the investment climate for local and regional agribusiness.1

     Similarly, the most recent energy strategy (2013), environment sector strategy (2012–22),
     and infrastructure sector strategy (FY12–15) emphasize the importance of strong institutions,
     legislation, regulation, and enforcement. They recognize that a clear, predictable regulatory
     framework is needed to facilitate private sector participation. In particular, the Infrastructure
     Strategy (2012) commits the World Bank to support reforms of labor and land regulation,

50   Investment Climate Reforms
as well as to deploy new approaches to improve the business environment, such as the
regulatory “guillotine,” which, combined with regulatory impact assessment, will help reduce
the amount of business regulations.

In parallel to corporate and sector strategies, regional strategies identify improving the
regulatory environment as one of the areas to support. For example, one of the three
strategic pillars of the 2004 Strategic Initiative for Africa is to improve the investment climate.
The recent Africa strategy continues to focus on business environment. It identifies business
environment as the second priority after infrastructure. Building on the Arab Spring, one of the
strategic directions of the World Bank Group in the Middle East and North Africa Region is
to create jobs by providing an enabling environment for opportunity, competition, innovation,
and entrepreneurship (World Bank 2013).

IEG undertook 25 country case studies to assess whether World Bank Group support for
regulatory reforms has been relevant to client countries. The review covered Country Assistance
Strategies (CASs) and CASCR Reviews produced during the evaluation period, as well as client
countries’ development strategies.

At the country level, nearly all World Bank Group country partnership and assistance
strategies identify enhancing the business environment as a main objective (see Box 2.1).
Not surprisingly, the definition of business environment in these strategies is generally broad,
including, along with regulatory reforms, infrastructure, labor skills, access to finance,
corruption, governance, and so forth. For example, the Philippines CAS for FY10–12
focused on enabling the business environment to promote competitiveness, productivity, and
employment, with three intended outcomes: enhanced institutional capacity for investment,
service delivery, and trade; increased investment; and increased employment.

FCS country strategies prepared right after post-conflict periods were an exception. They
did not focus on enhancing business environment (for example, Nepal ISN 2007–09), but
focused instead on postconflict economic programs.2 In line with the literature that links a
good business environment to growth and poverty reduction, most investment climate focus
falls either under the growth pillar or the PSD pillar of country strategies. For example, the
Cambodia CAS points out that a weak business environment resulted in very narrow growth,
high levels of informality, and a drop in FDI.

Although most country strategies that IEG reviewed acknowledge the importance of and
support improvements to the business environment, most of them do not articulate which
specific reform to support. In a few countries, regulatory reforms were specifically identified
as an important part of the country development strategy. Lack of competition, barriers to
establish and operate businesses, costs of doing business, and regulatory burdens are the

         BOX 2.1      Strategic Pillars of Investment Climate Reforms in Client Countries

         The Jordan FY06–11 CAS had as strategic pillar strengthening the investment
         environment and building human resources for a value-added, skill-intensive, and
         knowledge-based economy. During this period, the country initiated an investment
         climate reform process with World Bank Group support. Key reforms included the
         reduction of the minimum capital required to establish a limited liability company,
         lowering property taxes, establishing a single reception service for company registration,
         and improving the resolution of business dispute. World Bank support included lending
         through the Recovery Under a Global Uncertainty Development Policy Loan, which
         focused on taxation and business entry; and analytic and advisory activities in the form of
         an Investment Climate Analysis (2007), Doing Business (various years), Quick Response
         Surveys (November 2008 and April 2009), and programmatic technical assistance.
         In Vietnam, enhancing the business environment was one of the pillars of the CAS for
         FY07–10. Improving the business climate and strengthening competitiveness was a key
         objective. IBRD/IDA assistance supported this objective with credits and analytic and
         advisory activities on World Trade Organization accession, Vietnam Development Results
         2007, competitiveness and innovation, and a report on the observance of standards and
         codes. IFC advisory services supported simplification of business-related procedures.

     main constraints mentioned. Few strategies identify even the specific areas of intervention
     aimed at reducing regulatory burdens for businesses. For example, the Georgia CPS for
     FY06–09 focused on reducing barriers to establishing and operating businesses so aimed
     at supporting inspection processes, permits, and licensing requirements; customs border
     processing; and standardization. Similarly, Rwanda’s FY09–12 CAS identified commercial
     law reform, capacity building of the Rwanda Investment Promotion Agency, public-private
     dialogue, and the government’s Doing Business reform action plan as key intervention areas.
     Analytical work on investment climate also was a priority in a number of countries with the
     expected completion of Investment Climate Assessments.

     In Cambodia, the focus was on the basic regulatory reform elements for trade-related
     business operations, such as the time and cost of administering exports and imports,
     investment promotion, and trade-supporting networks. Finally, in a few countries the World
     Bank Group has had a long-term and programmatic engagement in the investment climate
     area, whereas in most countries the engagement focused on specific areas. Bangladesh is a
     good example, with the Bank Group supporting regulatory reforms since early the 2000s with
     a comprehensive reform agenda.

52   Investment Climate Reforms
Contrary	to	the	evident	emphasis	shown	at	the	network	level,	only	a	few	country	strategies	
emphasized	the	importance	of	sector-specific	regulatory	reforms	(that	is,	Georgia,	Guinea,	
and	so	forth).	For	example,	in	the	Guinea	Interim	Strategy	Note,	the	government	stresses	the	
improvement	of	the	investment	climate,	in	particular	in	agriculture	and	the	mining	sector.

Although	World	Bank	Group	CASs	put	a	significant	emphasis	on	improving	the	business	
environment,	and	at	times	the	regulatory	environment	specifically,	client	countries’	own	
development	strategies	assign	much	less	weight	to	enhancing	the	investment	climate.	Most	of	
the	countries	reviewed	in	the	case	studies	have	their	own	country	development	strategy	(that	
is,	Vision	2030	for	Kenya,	Vision	2021	for	Rwanda).	These	strategies	place	an	important	role	
on	PSD,	but	they	do	not	emphasize	as	much	the	support	to	the	business	environment	or	to	
the	regulatory	environment,	as	is	done	in	Bank	Group	country	strategies.	Such	cases	include	
Georgia	and	Kenya.	The	Georgia	2003	Economic	Development	and	Poverty	Reduction	
Program	prioritized	improving	several	business	environment	areas	with	the	goal	of	economic	
development	and	poverty	reduction.	Kenya’s	Vision	2030	aimed	to	transform	Kenya	into	
a	globally	competitive	middle-income	country	by	2030.	In	2011,	the	government	released	
a	specific	regulatory	reform	strategy	(June	2011–June	2014)	to	ensure	improvement	in	
the	business	regulatory	environment	in	areas	such	as	licensing,	Doing	Business	indicators,	
inspections	and	enforcement,	regulatory	impact	assessment,	and	regulatory	streamlining.

Consistent	with	that,	evidence	shows	that	prioritizing	business	environment	in the	country	
partnership	and	countries’	own	development	strategies	does	not	always	translate	into	strong	
commitment	at	the	project	level.	Table	2.1	presents	six	country-owned	development	strategies	
that	focus	on	improving	business	regulatory	environments.	It	also	presents	the	relevant	World	
Bank	Group	interventions	in	response	to	the	governments’	priorities.	IEGs’	analysis	shows	that,	
notwithstanding	a	government	commitment	at	the	strategic	level,	in	three	of	six	cases	the	projects	
faced	political	commitment	problems	during	implementation.	This	highlights	the	importance	of	
proper	engagement	and	shows	that	having	commitment	at	the	strategy	level	is	not	enough.	


Relevance	of	Interventions
One	condition	for	the	World	Bank	Group	to	be	relevant	in	investment	climate	reforms	is	that	
it	diagnose	and	offer	a	comprehensive	set	of	regulatory	interventions	that	can	be	adjusted	to	
country	needs.	At	the	same	time	comprehensiveness	does	not	automatically	imply	relevance,	
from	the	perspective	of	the	World	Bank	Group,	as	the	Bank	Group	might	deliberately	decide	not	
to	support	all	possible	areas	of	the	regulatory	environment.	However,	from	the	client	perspective,	
comprehensiveness	ensures	that	any	regulatory	reform	supported	by	the	Bank	Group	is	relevant	
to	the	client	countries	priorities.	In	this	section	IEG	presents	evidence	on	whether	the	Bank	
Group	is	offering	a	comprehensive	set	of	regulatory	reforms	to	its	client	countries.

Using	the	good	practice	standards	presented	in	Chapter	1,	IEG	mapped	the	1,499	
interventions	supported	by	the	Bank	Group	over	the	period	2007–13	(as	seen	in	Table	1.4)	to	
this	list.	The	aim	of	this	test	was	to	demonstrate	how	extensive	the	menu	of	interventions	offered	
by	the	World	Bank	Group	is.	The	results,	presented	in	Table	2.2,	show	that	the	Bank	Group	
has	provided	support	in	nearly	all	regulatory	reform	topics,	except	a	few—environmental	
laws	and	consumer	protection.	It	is	important	to	note,	however,	that	this	mapping	exercise	
excludes	sector-specific	reforms.	IEG	characterized	the	industry-specific	regulations	separately,	
as	they	are	specific	to	a	certain industry	or	sectors	and	cover	multiple	areas	of	intervention.	
Consequently,	environmental	regulations	are	not	included	in	the	above	mapping,	as	they	are	
sector	specific.	Furthermore,	recent	CIC	interventions	have	covered	environmental	areas,	such	
as	green	building	regulations.	Thus,	only	consumer	protection	has	not	been	covered,	although	
the	financial	aspect	of	consumer	protection	has	been	covered	by	the	corresponding	sector.	

In	sum,	virtually	all	regulatory	areas	for	a	business-friendly	regulatory	environment	are	covered	by	
World	Bank	Group	interventions.	Two-thirds	of	interventions	are	concentrated	in	one-third	of	reform	
areas.	Interventions	are	mostly	concentrated	in	business	registration,	licensing,	and	inspections,	
followed	by	trade	and	logistics,	investment	policy/promotion,	and	taxation.	At	the	same	time,	some	
areas	have	only	a	handful	of	World	Bank	Group	interventions,	such	as	bankruptcy	(1	percent),	
competition	policy	(2	percent),	ADR	(3	percent),	debt	resolution	and	insolvency	(3	percent),	labor	laws	
(3	percent),	contract	enforcement	(3	percent),	property	(4	percent),	and	land	registration	(5	percent).

The mapping exercise provides evidence that the World Bank Group generally offers
interventions in relevant areas, that is, in the whole set of regulatory areas of a hypothetical
country with a business-friendly environment.

Apart from offering a complete menu of reforms, is the Bank Group supporting the right
regulatory reforms in the right countries? To answer this question, IEG conducted two tests:
one to establish if, across interventions, the Bank Group supports the reforms most needed
by client countries; and another to establish if, among interventions, the Bank Group supports
regulatory interventions in those countries that need those most.

For the first test IEG used Enterprise Survey data on firm obstacles to operations from more than
60,000 firms in 113 countries during the period 2007–13.3 Unfortunately, the survey does not

     cover all regulatory aspects listed in Table 2.2. Nevertheless, five questions are directly relevant
     and refer to tax rates and tax administration, business licensing and permits, access to land, and
     labor regulations. For each survey question, IEG calculated the share of firms that considered it
     a major constraint in each country and took the average across countries.4 The average value
     was then used to establish an order of priority among these five regulatory areas.

     According to this estimate, tax is the most important regulatory constraint, with 28 percent of firms
     on average considering it a major obstacle, followed by land (20 percent), customs (19 percent),
     licensing and permits (15 percent), and labor regulations (13 percent) (Table 2.3). Then IEG
     mapped the share of interventions identified in the portfolio corresponding to these five regulatory
     areas (Table 2.3). To establish if the World Bank Group properly prioritizes interventions,
     IEG estimated the rank correlation among the series of perceived obstacles and the amount
     of interventions. Spearman’s rank correlation is +0.5, indicating that priorities perceived by
     managers are in line with interventions by the Bank Group with a good degree the association.

     Finally, IEG collected 39 regulatory environment indicators from different sources,
     such as the Doing Business, WEF, and Logistics Performance Index, covering almost all
     interventions in entry, operation, and exit. For each indicator IEG estimated the average
     value in countries with and without Bank Group projects. For a regulatory intervention to
     be relevant, the expected average value of an indicator in countries with Bank Group–
     supported reforms would be worse than its value in countries without a Bank Group–
     supported project. Figures 2.1 and 2.2 show some of the results of this test.5

 In all but two areas, the World Bank Group is targeting the right countries, as, prior to
 the	intervention,	at	least	one	of	its	indicators	is	significantly	worse	in	countries	with	Bank	
 Group–supported	projects	compared	to	countries	without.	For	example,	Doing	Business	
 indicators	of	processes	and	cost	were	significantly	higher	in	Bank	Group–supported	countries

     than	the	rest.	The	only	two	interventions	with	nonsignificant	results	are	investment	promotion	
     and	competition.	That	implies	that,	according	to	the	WEF	indicator,	countries	with	Bank	Group	
     investment	promotion	activities	had	a	more	favorable	FDI	environment	before	the	intervention	
     than	countries	without.

     Relevance	at	the	Analytical	Level
     The	World	Bank	Group	identifies	regulatory	reforms	to	support	on	the	basis	of	
     stakeholder	consultations	and	diagnostic	analysis.	IEG’s	review	of	25	country	strategies	
     showed	that,	at	the	CAS	level,	the	Bank	Group	generally	employs	an	extensive	
     consultation	process.	For	example,	in	India,	given	the	multiplicity	and	geographical	
     distribution	of	stakeholders	and	their	wide	range	of	priorities	and	points	of	view,	the	
     consultation	process	included	a	client	survey,	targeted	meetings,	online	consultations,	
     and	consultation	workshops.

     Furthermore,	public	private	dialogue	has	become	an	important	instrument	to	engage	a	
     broad	set	of	constituencies.	In	the	recent	years,	it	has	been	used	as	a	cross-cutting	tool.	
     Almost	all	CASs	in	the	25	countries	used	at	least	one	type	of	diagnostic	tool.	For	example,	
     the	diagnostic	tools	used	in	Jordan	CAS	for	FY06–10	were	the	poverty	assessment	jointly	
     prepared	by	the	government	and	the	World	Bank;	comparative	international	indicators;	
     research	carried	out	for	the	Middle	East	and	North	Africa	Governance	Report,	the	Jordan	
     Public	Expenditure	Review,	and	creditor	rights	report	on	the	Observance	of	Standards	and	
     Codes.	The	recent	Jordan	CAS	(FY12–15)	utilized	the	Investment	Climate	Assessment	that	
     was	prepared	during	the	previous	CAS	period.

     IEG	reviewed	evidence	of	the	extent	to	which	diagnostic	tools	are	relevant	to	identify	World	
     Bank	Group	activities	in	regulatory	reforms.	The	Doing	Business	and	Enterprise	surveys	are	
     the	most	commonly	used	diagnostic	tools	in	the	World	Bank	Group.	As	noted	in	Chapter	
     1,	although	the	most	commonly	used	diagnostic	tools	are	rich	in	terms	of	information	and	
     detail,	they	are	limited	in	scope	and	cover	only	some	of	the	good	practice	regulatory	issues.	
     Interestingly,	the	areas	covered	by	Doing	Business	and	Enterprise	Surveys	are	those	where	the	
     Bank	Group	supports	client	countries	heavily,	such	as	business	registration,	taxation,	trade,	
     and	so	forth.

     This	implies	that	these	two	diagnostic	tools	are	only	partially	relevant	in	helping	the	Bank	
     Group	identify	appropriate	areas	of	intervention.	In	recent	years	the	World	Bank	Group	
     has	developed	new	diagnostic	instruments	for	specific	areas	of	the	investment	climate.	
     For	instance,	PREM	Trade	has	been	investing	on	a	series	of	tools	(trade	competitiveness	
     diagnostic,	the	non-tariff	measures	toolkit,	the	trade	in	services	toolkit,	Tax	Compliance	
     Cost	Survey,	Women	Business	and	the	Law,	Investing	Across	Borders,	and	so	forth).	

62   Investment Climate Reforms
These tools focus on a specific area of regulatory reforms and they are not integrated into a 
broad diagnostic tool such as Doing Business or Enterprise Surveys to allow comparability 
among indicators.

This conclusion is confirmed by data from the portfolio review. Of all the projects in the 
portfolio, 60 percent have used at least one type of diagnostic analysis, such as Investment 
Climate Assessment, memos, Country Economic Memoranda, working papers, or academic 
papers, when deciding on investment climate–related interventions (Table 2.4). At the 
project level, the use of diagnostic tools was more common in the World Bank (68 percent); 
IFC advisory projects relied on diagnostics tools in 47 percent of the projects and more on 
government request or stakeholder consultations.6 Historically, some of IFC’s investment 
climate projects have relied on FIAS’s administrative barriers to invest diagnostic reports. 
Over time, Doing Business became a de facto diagnostic tool for IFC. Doing Business 
does not cover a range of FDI and licensing concerns, but it covers some dimensions

     that	administrative	barriers	did	not	include.	The	Doing	Business	report	has	been	used	as	
     diagnostic	tool	62	percent	of	the	time	in	IFC	and	only	20	percent	of	the	time	in	Bank	projects.	

     Investment	climate	assessment	is	another	analytical	tool	that	interprets	Doing	Business	
     and	Enterprise	Survey	indicators	and,	at	times,	goes	beyond	their	coverage.	During	the	
     2007–13	period,	Investment	Climate	Assessments	were	carried	out	in	about	46	countries	in	
     every	region	of	the	world.	These	assessments	are	comprehensive	and	often	supplemented	
     Enterprise	Surveys	and	Doing	Business	data	with	additional	analysis	of	regulatory	issues.	Libya	
     is	an	example	where	a	legal	expert	went	beyond	standard	indicators	(Libya	was	not	included	
     in	Doing	Business)	to	make	recommendations	about	reform	of	taxation,	property	registration,	
     business	registration	and	licensing,	bankruptcy,	commercial	dispute	resolution,	corporate	
     governance,	land	registration	and	transfer,	collateral	law,	and	even	the	labor	code.

     IEG	also	found	that	the	diagnostic	analysis	focuses	only	on	enterprises	and	generally	seems	to	
     overlook	other	stakeholders.	Even	in	the	consultation	process	it	is	not	clear	whether	all	relevant	
     parties	are	included	in	the	discussion.	A	review	of	25	countries	reveals	that	in	only	four	countries	
     (Cambodia,	Georgia,	Lao	PDR,	and	Liberia)	did	the	World	Bank	Group	conduct	specific	analysis	
     for	SME	and/or	informal	enterprises	and	in	only	three	countries	(Bangladesh,	Cambodia,	and	
     the	Republic	of	Yemen)	were	gender	assessments	conducted.	Nepal	stakeholder	consultations	
     included	government	officials	as	well	as	private	firms,	business	intermediaries,	civil	society	
     representatives,	trade	unions,	technical	experts,	and	donors.	These	discussions	led	the	project	
     team	to	conclude	that	labor	regulations,	trade	facilitation,	tax	policy	and	administration,	licensing	
     and	inspections,	and	barriers	to	exit	are	key	constraints	to	private	investment.	However,	this	is	a	
     rare	example	of	diagnostic	tools	including	the	social	impact	of	investment	climate	reforms.

     In	sum,	the	World	Bank	Group	has	supported	a	comprehensive	menu	of	investment	climate	
     reforms.	IEG’s	analysis	indicates	that	these	reforms	were	generally	supported	in	the	right	
     countries	and	generally	addressed	the	right	areas	of	the	regulatory	environment.	There	is	some	
     evidence	that	the	World	Bank	Group	country	partnership	strategies	assign	a	higher	priority

      	 In	the	subsequent	Interim	Strategy	Notes	and	the	new	CAS,	private	sector	development	and	investment	climate	are	part	of	
     the	growth	pillar	in	the	new	CPS	(2014–17),	as	well	as	the	growth	and	connectivity	pillar	of	the	2011–13	Interim	Strategy	Note.	
     Both	strategies	emphasized	the	importance	of	the	World	Bank	Group	working	on	improving	the	enabling	environment	for	
     private	sector	growth.	Both	strategies	used	the	analytical	work	undertaken	under	the	Nepal	Investment	Climate	Assessment	in

 	 IEG	acknowledges	that	enterprises	respond	to	questions	about	their	constraints	based	on	their	subjective	opinion,	which	
may	or	may	not	be	aligned	with	the	public	interest.	Lower	taxes,	cheaper	credit,	and	less	competition	are	favored	by	almost	all	
firms.	It	should	also	be	noted	that	these	views	expressed	are	those	of	current	entrepreneurs	and	not	of	potential	entrepreneurs	
who	have	not	yet	entered	to	market.	Regardless,	these	survey	questions	are	widely	used	and	provide	strong	insights	on	areas	
where	businesses	perceive	bottlenecks.	For	the	purpose	of	this	test,	these	questions	provide	a	comparable	way	to	establish	an	
order	of	priority	among	different	bottlenecks.

 	 An	alternative	approach	would	be	to	perform	the	same	rank	correlations	at	the	country	level.	Such	a	test,	however,	would	
be	biased	by	a	small	sample	size	because	the	World	Bank	Group	did	not	support	interventions	in	each	of	the	five	regulatory	
areas	in	each	country.

                    Bank	Group	effectiveness	(80	percent	versus	60	percent,	
                    respectively).

                    and	entry	is,	however,	unclear	because	of	methodological	
                    problems	with	available	data,	mixed	results	from	the	relevant	
                    literature,	IEG’s	case	studies	findings,	and	the	absence	of	a	
                    proper	valuation	of	social	benefits	(and	costs).

     A	wide	range	of	interventions	has	been	developed	by	the	World	Bank	Group	to	help	client	
     countries	improve	their	regulatory	environment.	They	range	from	licensing	and	registration	
     procedures,	to	property	rights	and	competition	policy,	to	bankruptcy	law	and	dispute	
     resolution	mechanisms.	They	all	aim	to	enhance	the	regulatory	environment	in	which	
     business	operates	in	order	to	facilitate	entry,	promote	competition,	and	ensure	the	efficient	
     redeployment	of	assets	within	the	economy.	Many	also	aim	to	enhance	fairness	and	expand	
     opportunity	through	a	level	playing	field.	As	shown	in	Table	3.1,	each	intervention	aims	at	
     specific	objectives,	from	reducing	barriers	to	economic	activities,	to	facilitating	access	to	
     markets,	to	reducing	risks.

                             can	restrict	healthy	competition	and	impose	significant	and	unnecessary	entry	
                             barriers	to	particular	economic	activities	and	markets,	while	maintaining	
                             adequate	requirements	to	achieve	important	economic,	social,	safety,	security,	
                             or	environmental	outcomes.

      Registration           These	interventions	aim	to	simplify	and	reduce	the	procedures,	bottlenecks,	
                             and	hurdles	needed	to	register	a	formal	business.	This	is	done	through	capacity	
                             building	for	business	registries;	establishment	and	automation	of	one-stop	shops	
                             for	registration,	review,	and	re-engineering	of	existing	processes;	and	regulation	of	
                             timetables	for	completing	registration	procedures.

      Competition	           Competition	policies	aim	at	increasing	or	sustaining	competition	within	sectors	
      policy                 and	across	economies.	These	reforms	intend	to	open	markets	and	remove	
                             anticompetitive	regulation—such	as	price	controls,	statutory	monopolies,	
                             restrictions	on	the	number	of	firms,	and	discriminatory	treatment	of	certain	firms.

      Contract	              A	country’s	contract	enforcement	and	dispute	resolution	system	(that	is,	contract	
      enforcement            law	and	supporting	legal	institutions)	ensures	that	the	business	commitments	
                             between	transacting	parties	take	place	and	are	enforced	at	a	reasonable	cost.	
                             Reforms	in	this	area	are	designed	to	increase	the	efficiency	of	the	enforcement	
                             system	through	the	introduction	or	expansion	of	specialized	courts	to	deal	with	
                             commercial	cases,	the	overhaul	of	judicial	case	management	that	deals	with	
                             commercial	dispute	resolution, and	the	approval	of	laws	designed	to	increase	the	
                             efficiency	of	enforcement.

Intervention                                                  Objectives

Doing	Business	   Doing	Business	indicator	work	plays	the	role	of	an	entry	point	for	investment	
indicators        climate	programs	by	responding	to	specific	client	requests	generated	by	
                  the	Doing	Business	Report	(global	and	subnational)	and	other	datasets.	
                  Recommended	actions	serve	to	(i)	identify	key	areas	where	the	impact	of	
                  reforms	could	be	substantial	and	where	government	intervention	is	most	likely	
                  to	succeed	in	the	short	to	medium	term;	(ii)	propose	reforms	in	these	areas	and	
                  the	feasibility	of	their	implementation;	and	(iii)	identify	needs	for	further	first	
                  response	technical	assistance	in	areas	related	to	Doing	Business.

Investment	       Investment	policy	reforms	help	developing	economies	better	integrate	their	private	
policy	and	       sectors	with	global	value	chains.	These	reforms	address	the	legal,	regulatory,	
promotion         and	administrative	impediments	to	attracting	and	retaining	FDI.	They	also	
                  promote	steps	to	maximize	the	potential	benefits	of	FDI	and	its	interaction	with	the	
                  domestic	economy	to	foster	sustainable	development.

Labor             This	type	of	intervention	aims	to	revise	the	legal	framework	governing	the	labor	
                  market	to	improve	labor	market	flexibility,	improve	employment	relations	and	
                  compensation	schemes,	reform	pension	systems,	and	make	the	hiring	of	foreign	
                  labor	more	flexible.	This	is	done	through	new	or	amended	labor	laws,	addressing	
                  wage	setting	mechanisms	and	hiring	quotas,	and	revising	residency	permits	for	
                  foreign	skilled	workers.

Property	rights   Interventions	in	this	area	aim	to	make	it	easier	for	businesses	to	register	property	
                  by	reducing	the	time,	procedures,	and	costs	through	combining	procedures,	
                  increasing	administrative	efficiency,	computerizing	registries,	and	lowering	
                  property	transfer	taxes.

Public-private	   These	interventions	aim	to	establish	forums	for	effective	dialogue	between	
dialogue          stakeholders	from	the	public	and	private	sectors	and	civil	society.	This	is	achieved	
                  through	communications	and	outreach,	formation	of	steering	committees,	
                  membership	organization	support,	and	development	of	online	tools	for	sustained	
                  dialogue.

Special	       Policies	that	enable	SEZs	can	be	a	useful	tool	to	enhance	industry	competitiveness	
economic	zones and	attract	FDI.	Interventions	on	SEZs	help	a	country	develop	and	diversity	
               exports,	support	local	industry	and	clusters,	create	jobs,	and	pilot	new	policies	
               and	approaches	in,	for	example,	financial,	legal,	labor,	and	pricing	aspects.	SEZs	
               may	allow	for	more	efficient	government	regulation	of	enterprises,	provision	of	
               off-site	infrastructure,	and	environmental	controls.

      taxation               that	are	equally	applied	to	all;	to	widen	participation	in	the	tax	system	at	all	
                             levels,	with	particular	focus	on	micro,	small,	and	medium-sized	enterprises;	and	
                             to	enhance	the	ability	to	raise	revenues	in	the	long	run	through	more	effective	
                             tax	administration	and	tax	base	expansion.	They	also	promote	good	governance	
                             through	transparent	systems,	procedures,	and	effective	audit,	and	assist	countries	
                             in	adopting	internationally	accepted	norms	and	standards.	Finally,	these	
                             interventions	also	serve	to	foster	investment	through	reviews	of	the	tax	code	and	
                             implementation	of	tax	incentives.

      Trade	logistics        This	type	of	intervention	aims	to	streamline	and	harmonize	procedures	for	trading	
                             across	borders.	This	includes	implementation	of	single	window	systems,	one-stop	
                             border	posts,	and	customs	risk	management	systems	to	rationalize	inspections.	
                             Custom	agencies	receive	training	and	capacity	building	to	enhance	their	ability	to

      Alternative	           ADR	interventions	aim	at	providing	faster	and	cheaper	resolution	of	commercial	
      dispute	               disputes,	reducing	formality	through	simplified	and	accessible	processes,	allowing

     Effectiveness	of	World	Bank	Group–Supported	Investment	
     Climate	Reforms
     In	this	section	IEG	assesses	whether	regulatory	reforms	supported	by	the	World	Bank	Group	
     have	achieved	the	policy	objective	of	improving	the	regulatory	environment	in	which	business	
     operates.	IEG	presents	evidence	on	the	effectiveness	of	the	World	Bank	Group	support	to	
     investment	climate	reforms,	first	in	terms	of	reaching	the	project	development	objectives,	and	
     second	in	terms	of	achieving	specific	outcomes.


70   Investment Climate Reforms
PROjECT	RATInG

In	assessing	effectiveness	in	terms	of	achievement	of	development	objectives,	IEG	includes	
only	ratings	that	have	been	validated	and	that	are	directly	assigned	to	investment	climate	
components.	That	reduces	the	sample	of	projects	to	47	projects	for	IFC	and	147	for	the	
World	Bank.

Within	each	institution,	IEG	observes	that	investment	climate	projects	are	about	as	
successful	as	the	rest	of	the	portfolio.1	In	the	World	Bank	three	of	four	investment	climate	
projects	achieve	their	development	objective,	and	in	IFC	over	half	of	them	(55	percent)	
do	so.2	

The	data	show	different	patterns	of	effectiveness	in	reference	to	income	level	of	client	countries.	
For	the	World	Bank	the	proportion	of	successful	investment	climate	projects	increases	with	
the	level	of	income,	but	for	IFC	the	success	rate	is	significantly	lower	in	lower-middle-income	
countries	(Figure	3.1).

     This	is	explained	by	the	pattern	of	interventions—the	fact	that	in	lower-middle-income	
     countries	IFC	implements	fewer	interventions	on	trade,	licensing,	and	administrative	barriers	
     that	tend	to	have	relatively	higher	ratings	and	more	interventions	on	tax,	property,	and	
     investments	promotions,	which	tend	to	have	lower	rates	of	success.

     Effectiveness in Gender
     As	discussed	in	the	first	chapter,	some	general	(“untargeted”)	reforms	may	be	dispropor	   tionately	
     beneficial	to	female	entrepreneurs—and	needed	in	countries	where	the	obstacles	for	
     businesswomen	are	greater.	According	to	the	literature	(Simavi,	Manuel,	and	Blackden	2010),	
     gender-friendly	reforms	are	those	dealing	with	registering	property,	land	administration,	permits,	
     tax	regulations,	agriculture,	licensing,	access	to	land,	property	rights,	and	regulation	more	
     generally.	Hence,	to	establish	whether	proper	targeting	is	taking	place	in	investment	climate	
     projects,	IEG	identified	and	classified	19	investment	climate	projects	as	disproportionately

“woman	friendly,”	that	is,	as	having	the	potential	to	address	constraints	that	are	especially	
binding	for	female	entrepreneurs,	according	to	the	type	of	interventions	they	promote.	These	
interventions—labeled	“woman	friendly”	in	Table	3.2	—have	been	compared	to	the	rest	of	
the	portfolio—for	example,	projects	regarding	investment	policy	and	promotion,	competition	
policy,	construction	permits,	and	so	forth—which	has	a	less	immediate	relationship	with	gender	
disparities	in	entrepreneurship.	

The	overall	WEF	score	of	the	Gender	Global	Gap	and	the	score	for	the	subindex	on	economic	
participation	have	then	been	used	to	compare	countries	with	no	reforms,	woman-friendly	
interventions,	and	other	types	of	interventions.3	This	evidence,	presented	in	Table	3.2	,	shows	
that	countries	that	implement	interventions	that	may	be	disproportionately	beneficial	to	female	
entrepreneurs	are	not	those	where	the	gender	gaps	are	larger.4	The	low	prevalence	of	gender	
targeting	and	the	lack	of	correlation	between	type	of	intervention	and	the	WEF	Global	Gender	
Gap	score	(as	well	as	the	economic	participation	score)	suggest	that	the	existence	of	gender	
gaps	in	economic	opportunities	(as	captured	by	indices	such	as	the	WEF	Global	Gender	Gap)	
is	not	necessarily	followed	by	investment	climate	interventions	aimed	to	address	those	gaps.	

It	is	important	to	note,	however,	that	the	type	of	reforms	that	could	benefit	women	
entrepreneurs	may	not	be,	strictly	speaking,	investment	climate	reforms	as	defined	in	this	
evaluation.	As	Women, Business, and the Law5	has	well	documented,	in	several	countries	
women	have	lower	legal	status	and	fewer	property	rights	than	men;	they	may	be	subject	to

NOTE:   “woman friendly” interventions have been defined as those relating to access to land, administrative barriers,
agriculture, alternate dispute resolution, business taxation, competition policy, contract enforcement, licensing, mediation,
permits, property rights, registering property, registration, regulation, tax, tax administration, tax reform, as well as three
activities explicitly aimed at women, such as the toolkit to include women in investment climate reform, advocacy and
media skills for women in the private sector, and gender outreach. GGG = Global Gender Gap; S.D. = standard

     travel	restrictions;	or	they	may	be	forbidden	from	pursuing	certain	trades	or	professions	in	the	
     same	way	as	men	(World	Bank	2014).	Moreover,	in	various	countries,	notably	Sub-Saharan	
     Africa,	customary	laws	overlap	and	often	overrule	legal	systems	(Hallward-Driemeier	2013).	
     Family	laws	(governing	marriage,	divorce,	and	inheritance)	also	have	important	consequences	
     for	women’s	access	to	assets	and	therefore	women’s	access	to	start-up	capital	and	their	
     ability	to	use	collateral	to	access	credit.	In	other	words,	the	barriers	that	women	face	as	
     entrepreneurs	and	business	owners	may	be	best	addressed	by	interventions	that	are	outside	
     the	realm	of	investment	climate	reforms.	

     Documenting	results	for	specific	categories	of	beneficiaries	is	challenging,	given	that	not	only	
     is	explicit	targeting	extremely	limited	in	the	portfolio,	but	(as	shown	in	Table	1.7)	even	projects	
     that	target	specific	groups	do	not	necessarily	report	results	for	the	group	that	was	targeted.	Of	
     29	closed	projects	targeting	gender	in	their	design,	only	11	report	results	by	gender,	and	only	
     14	of	42	targeting	specific	industries	report	results	for	those	industries.	The	number	for	the	
     other	categories	is	much	lower,	in	the	low	single	digits.	

     For	gender,	the	previous	section	discussed	how	specific	reforms	may	disproportionately	
     benefit	women	even	in	absence	of	explicit	targeting.	Unfortunately,	projects	that	promote	
     those	interventions	do	not	collect	gender-disaggregated	data.	Because	of	these	limitations,	
     the	following	considerations	have	been	derived	from	the	analysis	of	the	implementation	
     completion	reports	of	the	projects	discussing	gender	issues	in	their	results.

     The	majority	of	projects	reporting	gender	results	intended	to	directly	benefit	women	
     entrepreneurs	and	business	owners.	For	example,	an	IFC	advisory	project	in	the	East	Asia	
     and	Pacific	Region	analyzed	gender-based	barriers	across	the	business	enabling	environment,	
     including	identification	of	legal,	policy,	administrative,	and	institutional	constraints	for	women	to	
     start	a	business,	deal	with	licenses,	access	and	enforce	rights	over	registered	land,	and	access	
     justice	including	ADR;	the	project	identified	18	different	solutions	that	could	be	mainstreamed	
     into	existing	investment	climate	projects,	and	interviews	were	conducted	with	female	
     entrepreneurs	and	documented	in	a	report	“economic	opportunities	for	women.”	A	few	projects	
     focused	uniquely	on	“soft”	activities	(such	as	training,	workshops,	awareness	raising),	that	is,	
     activities	complementing	the	main	goal	of	the	project,	but	not	representing	the	core	interventions	
     meant	to	directly	affect	women-owned	firms	and	female	entrepreneurs	in	the	short	term.

     For	example,	the	Africa	GEM	(Global	Entrepreneurship	Monitor)	regional	training	project	
     supported	advocacy	and	media	skills	for	key	stakeholders	(women’s	business	associations,	
     government,	civil	society	organizations,	lawyers,	and	so	forth)	in	Ghana,	Tanzania,	and	
     Uganda,	where	IFC	GEM,	PEP	Africa,	and	the	World	Bank	Africa	Region	have	conducted	
     Gender	and	Growth	Assessments,	which	identify	legal	and	regulatory	obstacles	facing	


74   Investment Climate Reforms
women	entrepreneurs	and	make	recommendations	for	reforms.	The	training	aimed	to	
equip	the	participants	with	advocacy	tools	and	media	strategies	for	taking	forward	the	
recommendations	of	these	assessments,	to	ensure	long-term	legislative	change	occurs,	
thereby	enabling	women’s	greater	participation	in	PSD.

In	Morocco,	IFC’s	ADR	awareness-raising	campaigns	and	public	outreach	efforts	employed	
a	targeted	approach	to	entice	women	to	ADR.	not	only	was	gender	integrated	in	awareness-
raising	events,	but	commercial	mediation	and	its	implication	on	women	business	owners	was	
the	focal	point	of	several	events,	such	as	a	national	conference.	Also,	IFC	was	able	to	train	
women	mediators	while	at	the	same	time	supporting	a	mediation	center.

nine	of	11	projects	that	IEG	reviewed	documented	positive	results	for	women.	These	
successful	projects	not	only	collected	gender-disaggregated	data,	but	also	incorporated	into	
their	design	activities	specifically	meant	to	support	and	benefit	women	entrepreneurs.	In	other	
words,	none	of	these	projects	simply	reported	gender-disaggregated	results	without	including	
activities	explicitly	directed	at	women.

As	the	number	of	investment	climate	interventions	with	gender-relevant	targeting	(and	even	
more	the	number	of	“gender-informed”	projects)	is	increasing	over	time,	it	may	be	that	future	
projects	will	include	gender-disaggregated	indicators	even	if	they	have	no	gender-relevant	
activities.	This	will	allow	a	comparison	of	gender	results	achieved	by	interventions	with	an	
explicit	gender	target	(and	gender-relevant	actions)	and	those	obtained	by	gender-neutral	
interventions,	but	with	the	potential	to	disproportionately	benefit	women.	With	the	data	
currently	available,	such	a	comparison	cannot	be	carried	out.6	

The	Uganda	Private	Sector	Competitiveness	Project	strengthened	its	gender	component	at	
restructuring	to	reflect	the	increased	World	Bank	Group	attention	to	gender	in	M&E.	Quite	
interestingly,	this	project	was	able	to	document	very	meaningful	results	for	women	that	may	
have	otherwise	remained	unobserved.7	In	terms	of	the	gender	aspect,	no	specific	goals	
were	articulated,	but	the	ex	post	assessment	does	show	that	women	were	able	to	benefit	
significantly	from	many	interventions,	including	40	percent	of	the	beneficiaries	of	the	matching	
grants	scheme.	This	example	indicates	that	the	inclusion	of	gender	in	M&E,	even	at	a	later	
stage,	can	generate	very	interesting	findings	to	inform	future	operations	(this	project	included	
gender	at	the	design	stage	in	a	different	component).	

Four	projects	(in	Ghana,	Honduras,	Lao	PDR,	and	Uganda)	supported	land	reforms8	and	
were	able	to	document	some	positive	results	for	women,	confirming	that	this	is	an	area	of	
great	gender	relevance.	In	all	three	countries,	the	number	of	land	titles	issued	to	women	
increased,	sometimes	substantially,	as	a	result	of	interventions	aimed	to	harmonize	land	
policies	and	regulatory	framework.	For	example,	in	Ghana,	a	gender	strategy	for	land	

                   An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	3   75
     rights	and	land	administration	was	completed.	The	registration	of	land	ownership	by	women	
     increased.	Regarding	effectiveness	of	gender	targeting,	although	the	number	of	deeds	and	
     titles	registered	each	year	increased	during	the	project	span,	the	gap	between	those	registered	
     to	men	and	those	registered	to	women	(or	to	both	partners)	did	not	narrow	substantially.	Case	
     study	evidence	also	shows	no	narrowing	of	the	gap.	

     A	further	example	is	Good	Practice	Gender	Framework	for	SEZs.	The	BICF	promoted	
     a	Good	Practice	Gender	Framework	for	SEZs,	which	will	be	rolled	out	in	all	future	IFC-
     sponsored	SEZ	projects.	The	project	produced	a	publication,	Global Study on Gender in SEZs	
     (World	Bank	2011b)	and	implemented	a	pilot	project	in	Bangladesh	focusing	on	initiatives	
     to	increase	opportunities	for	leadership,	upward	mobility,	and	financial	inclusion	for	female	
     workers.	The	project	succeeded	in	implementing	some	gender-inclusive	practices,	and	as	a	
     result,	the	Facility	implemented	policy	recommendations	to	ensure	that	30	percent	of	seats	in	
     worker	welfare	associations	go to	female	workers.	Female	representation	in	these	associations	
     has	increased	from	10.2	percent	at	baseline	to	18	percent.	

     Further,	to	ensure	awareness	and	proper	implementation	of	this	initiative,	the	Facility	amended	
     the	terms	of	reference	for	social	counselors	to	add	a	responsibility	for	preparing	women	workers	
     for	worker	welfare	associations	and	for	supervisory	positions.	ninety-two	percent	of	the	first	
     batch	of	women	participants	of	the	supervisory	training	have	been	promoted	to	higher	ranks	
     and	are	in	positions	of	leadership,	and	the	second	batch	of	women	trainees	are	currently	
     working	as	probationary	supervisors.	The	project	included	collaboration	with	a	private	
     commercial	bank	that	accepted	IFC’s	recommendation	and	developed	the	first	ever	financial	
     product	for	the	mainly	female	garments	workers.	This	product	was	piloted	in	the	Dhaka	
     Export	Processing	Zone	but	is	planned	for	scale-up	countrywide	across	the	entire	ready-made	
     garments	industry.


     Effectiveness in FCS
     Assessing	effectiveness	in	FCS	is	much	more	challenging	because	of	the	extremely	small	
     number	of	projects	that	meet	IEG’s	inclusion	criteria.	In	fact,	since	FY07	only	six	IFC	
     investment	climate	projects	have	been	completed	and	evaluated,	and	only	one	of	them	has	
     successfully	achieved	its	development	objectives.	IFC’s	success	rate	for	investment	climate	
     projects	stands	at	less	than	20	percent	in	FCS	countries,	compared	to	60	percent	in	non-FCS	
     countries.	For	the	World	Bank	the	only	investment	climate	project	completed	did	not	achieve	
     its	development	objective.

     Furthermore,	as	highlighted	in	a	recent	IEG	evaluation	(IEG	2013),	investment	climate	
     reforms	are	necessary	but	not	sufficient	conditions	for	PSD	in	FCS.	Without	fragility	or	conflict	


76   Investment Climate Reforms
assessment	and	an	understanding	of	the	political	economy,	complementary	investments	are	
not	likely	to	be	forthcoming.	

In	light	of	this,	IEG	conducted	an	assessment	of	effectiveness	based	on	case	studies,9	which	
showed	mixed	results.	Evidence	points	to	the	fact	that	the	World	Bank	Group	effectiveness	
was	contingent	on	a	number	of	factors.	These	included	the	complexity	of	the	interventions	
and	whether	the	reforms	were	politically	feasible,	institutional	capacity	building	and	
implementation	assistance,	government	ownership	of	investment	climate	reform,	and	the	
fragile	political	economy.10	


Effectiveness of Industry-Specific Projects
Similarly,	the	number	of	evaluated	investment	climate	industry	projects	is	very	small	(7	IFC	
advisory	projects	and	41	World	Bank	investment	projects).	Consequently,	it	is	hard	to	draw	
general	lessons.	On	average,	IFC	investment	climate	advisory	projects	in	the	agribusiness	
and	tourism	sectors	are	more	likely	to	have	positive	development	outcomes	than	the	general	
investment	climate	portfolio	(71	percent	versus	55	percent,	although	with	such	a	small	
number	of	rated	projects,	the	differences	are	not	statistically	significant).	By	contrast,	World	
Bank	investment	climate	investment	projects	in	agribusiness	and	tourism	are	on	average	less	
successful	than	the	general	investment	climate	portfolio	(71	percent	versus	82	percent),	but	
again	the	difference	is	not	statistically	significant.


InTERvEnTIOnS	OUTCOME

IEG	looked	at	the	extent	to	which	interventions	achieved	their	development	objectives.	IEG’s	
portfolio	review	collected	information	on	ratings	of	individual	components	in	World	Bank	
investment	climate	projects	and	used	this	information	along	with	the	ratings	of	IFC	investment	
climate	projects.	The	data	presented	in	Figure	3.3	show	first	that	the	World	Bank	has,	on	
average,	a	higher	share	of	interventions	rated	as	successful.	Second,	the	more	successful	
interventions	for	the	World	Bank	appear	to	be	bankruptcy,	contract	enforcement,	and	
competition	policy	(even	though	the	number	of	observations	is	small),	and	for	IFC	registration	
and	trade.	

As	described	in	Chapter	1,	World	Bank	Group	investment	climate	interventions	mostly	aimed	
at	developing	strategies,	enacting	laws,	and	simplifying	procedures.	Consequently,	success	
was	mainly	represented	by	reduction	of	steps,	time,	and	costs	to	complete	bureaucratic	
requirements.	For	example,	in	Lao	PDR	a	World	Bank	project	prior action	included	a	
comprehensive	strategy	for	PSD	and	trade	and	the	revision	of	foreign	and	domestic	
investment	laws.	Further,	a	new	Enterprise	Law,	based	on	international	best	practices	in

     supported	reforms	that	helped	the	government	reduce	the	number	of	steps	(from	12	to	6),	
     costs	(447.3	percent	to	52.9	percent),	and	time	(99	days	to	20	days)	to	register	a	business.

     Along	with	administrative	reforms,	the	Bank	Group	supported	the	design	and	implementation	
     of	a	modern	business	registry.	With	the	completion	of	the	design,	the	time	to	register	business	
     was	fully	automated,	which	allowed	registration	to	be	completed	within	48	hours.	The	project	
     enabled	the	reduction	and	standardization	of	13	key	procedures,	which	eliminated	many	
     signatures,	paperwork,	and	stamps	for	key	procedures.	The	new	national	Investment	Code	
     was	submitted	to	the	Parliament	in	conjunction	with	the	amended	Revenue	Code	in	April	
     2009.	The	reforms	in	the	investment	code,	including	the	elimination	of	the	ad	hoc	incentives,	
     were	enacted	in	April	2010.	They	simplified	and	streamlined	nonfiscal	incentives	for	new

80   Investment Climate Reforms
Global Competitiveness Report.11 These indicators are all independent of project documents.
The advantage of this is that they are collected consistently across countries and years. The
disadvantage is that, not being linked to the projects, they might not measure exactly what
the intervention aims to improve. Hence, although this makes them good outcome indicators,
they are not a perfect proxy for investment climate projects.

In assessing the effectiveness of individual interventions,12 IEG first adopted a before-and-
after approach. IEG estimated the value of each indicator for each country before the project
and after, and then tested if the distribution of the before-and-after values was significantly
different. This analysis showed that investment climate interventions have a significant positive
impact on measures of the business environment such as time, cost, number of procedures,
index scores, and so forth. Of the indicators for which data could be used, 31 (78 percent)
show a significant and positive13 change14 (highlighted in Table 3.4 in grey). Only in a handful
of cases did the results show a negative impact (blue in the table). Consequently, within the
limits of the data used, this method shows that seven of the eight Bank Group interventions
displayed a significant outcome in the direction of improvement, the only exception being
investment promotion.

However, the before-and-after method has significant methodological shortcomings. IEG
therefore verified these results by applying two additional methods of analysis: propensity
score match and difference in differences. The results of these methods are significantly
different from earlier calculations. Whereas with before-and-after almost 80 percent of
the indicators were significant and positive, this share drops noticeably to 30 percent and
60 percent with propensity score and difference in difference, respectively15 (Table 3.4). Thus,
the method of analysis used drives the extent of effectiveness recorded. Simplistic methods
such as before-and-after show a much wider impact than more sophisticated approaches.

IEG used the results of the difference-in-difference method, as it was the method with the
fewest assumptions.16 Although the number of statistically significant tests was lower, the
difference-in-differences method largely confirmed earlier results. IEG found evidence that
all but one intervention—investment promotion17—produced positive outcomes. In fact,
for almost all interventions, at least one indicator showed a significant change in the right
direction, within the limits of the data used. Registration, regulations, and trade showed
the strongest results. Interventions in registration and regulations showed an impact on
procedures, time, cost, and perception of burden; interventions in trade showed an impact
on time, documentation, and perception of custom efficiency; interventions in tax showed
reductions in the number of payments; interventions in property registration showed a
reduction in procedures and costs. Finally, interventions in bankruptcy and construction permit

         Countries	implement	regulatory	reforms	independently	of	the	World	Bank	Group	
         support.	The	figure	on	the	next	page	shows	that,	over	the	period	2007–13,	more	
         regulatory	reforms	were	implemented	in	countries	without	World	Bank	Group	support	
         than	in	countries	with	Bank	Group	projects.a	On	average,	countries	implement	
         approximately	200	regulatory	reforms	each	year,	40	percent	of	which	are	in	countries	
         with	World	Bank	Group	support.	What	is	the	contribution	of	the	World	Bank	Group	
         to	the	regulatory	reform	process	around	the	world?	IEG	answers	this	question	by	
         testing	if	the	support	provided	by	the	Bank	Group	increases	the	chances	of	a	country	
         implementing	regulatory	reforms.	
         IEG	uses	a	survival	model	to	estimate	the	impact	of	lagged	Bank	Group	support	to	
         investment	climate	reforms	on	the	probability	of	a	country	implementing	regulatory	
         reforms.	More	specifically,	IEG	tests	if	lagged	Bank	Group	investment	climate	support	
         (in	the	year	2007	and/or	2008)	increases	the	chances	of	investment	climate	reforms	
         in	a	client	country	in	the	following	2009–13	period,	compared	to	countries	that	do	not	
         receive	such	support.
         The	results	of	this	test	show	that	Bank	Group	investment	climate	projects	do	not	
         increase	the	probability	of	implementing	regulatory	reforms	in	countries	supported	
         compared	to	countries	not	supported.	In	contrast,	countries	that	receive	IFC	support	
         for	regulatory	reforms	increase	their	probability	of	implementing	regulatory	reforms	by	
         40	percent.
         Furthermore,	given	that	about	half	of	the	projects	supported	by	the	World	Bank	Group	
         include	in	their	rationale	a	reference	to	the	Doing	Business	ranking,	IEG	tested	whether	
         such	rationale	increases	the	probability	of	regulatory	reforms.	The	results	show	that	
         projects	with	a	Doing	Business	ranking	in	their	rationale	do	not	increase	the	probability	
         of	regulatory	reforms.	In	other	words,	projects	that	aim	to	raise	the	Doing	Business	
         ranking	do	not	promote	additional	regulatory	reforms.

business	impact	of	rules	on	FDI.	

In	sum,	using	difference-in-difference,	within	the	limited	perspective	of	the	Doing	Business	
data,	IEG	was	able	to	identify	at	least	one	indicator	with	a	significant	impact	in	the	direction	
of	improvement	for	the	majority	of	interventions.	Indicators	of	time,	number	of	procedures,	
and	cost	all	show	improvement	following	a	World	Bank	Group–supported	investment	climate	
reform.	Among	them,	regulations,	registration,	and	trade	appear	the	most	effective.

     Limitations of Outcome Measurements
     The above evidence shows that, within the limits of the available data, investment climate
     reforms improve outcome indicators with almost all interventions. This conclusion,
     nevertheless, ought to be qualified by at least four important considerations.

     First, the great majority of indicators used in the analysis are taken from the Doing Business
     program and present methodological issues that might compromise their reliability.18
     Furthermore, Hallward-Driemeier and Pritchett (2011) have shown that the Doing Business
     indicators report the formal time and costs associated with fully complying with regulations,
     but these indicators are significantly different from what businesses acknowledge happens in
     practice.

     This conclusion is confirmed by a series of correlations conducted by IEG. A comparison
     of the relevant indicators for time to obtain a construction permit, time to export, and time
     to import indicators generated by the Doing Business data and those generated by the
     Enterprise Surveys19 consistently shows very low correlation coefficients of just 0.42, 0.17,
     and 0.09, respectively (Figure 3.4). This was validated by a number of interviews that IEG
     conducted in the field, where respondents—some of whom were very familiar with the
     Doing Business methodology—specifically criticized the rigid structure of the methodology,
     which does not allow country-specific realities to be accounted for; nor does it measure
     the whole bureaucratic process beyond cost, time, and procedures (for example, it did not
     take into account the recourse mechanism in tax disputes). In particular, one respondent
     inquired, “What is the value of rating a country on the basis of, say, 10 percent corporate
     rate on profits if tax authorities have full and unchallenged power to estimate you tax
     liability?”

     Second, the literature on the impact of regulatory reforms is extensive but presents mixed
     and qualified results, suggesting that a good regulatory environment is a necessary but not
     a sufficient condition to achieve growth, investment, entry, and jobs. Several studies suggest
     that there might be a correlation between regulation and growth. Growth in countries where
     the burden of regulation is high appears to have slowed in the period before regulations
     is measured (Djankov, McLeish, and Ramalho 2006; Hanush 2012). Yet causality is much
     harder to prove (Eifert 2009), although some impact can be detected in a smaller subset
     of countries (Dong and Xu 2008, 2009; Ahsan and Pages 2009; Amin 2009) or on small
     firms (Altenburg and van Drachenfels 2006; Clarke 2014; Gelb and others 2006; Pierre
     and Scarpetta 2006; Ahsan and Pages 2009; Abidoye, Orazem and Vodopivec 2009).
     Some studies find a mixed impact of tax regulations on investments (Djankov and others
     2010; Sentance 2013; Lawless 2013), GDP per capita growth (Lee and Gordon 2005),

 Other	studies	concluded	that	reducing	registration	requirements	might	increase	business	
 formation	or	total	factor	productivity	(Bruhn	2013;	Kaplan,	Piedra,	and	Seira	2011	in	Mexico;	
 Cárdenas	and	Rozo	2009	in	Colombia;	Branstetter	and	others	2010	in	Portugal;	Aghion	and	
 Marinescu	2008).	However,	these	increases	in	registration	might	be	temporary	or	even	lead	
 to	a	decrease	in	entry,	depending	on	other	factors	of	the	business	environment	(Bruhn	and	
 McKenzie	2013;	Chari	2011;	Alcázar,	Andrade,	and	jaramillo	2011;	Economisti	Associati	
 2011).	For	example,	Kaplan,	Piedra,	and	Seira	(2011)	showed	that	the	increase	in	registration	
 in	Mexico	was	concentrated	in	the	first	15	months	after	implementation,	with	a	subsequent	
 decline.	Similar	results	were	shown	in	Peru	(IEG	2011),	where	registration	went	up	significantly	
 after	the	reform,	but	by	the	third	year	it	had	tapered	off.	At	the	same	time,	some	studies	point	
 out	that	a	critical	mass	of	reforms	might	be	needed	for	an	impact	on	business	formation	to	be	
 seen	(Klapper	and	Love	2014;	Kaplan,	Piedra,	and	Seira	2011).	

 Furthermore,	empirical	tests	of	the	expectation	that	reducing	the	time	and	cost	of	registration	
 might	affect	formalization	have	found	mixed	results	(Klapper,	Amit,	and	Guillen	2010;	Kaplan,

     Piedra, and Seira 2011). For example, the World Bank (2008, p. 13) notes that “[after]
     Madagascar reduced its minimum capital requirement by more than 80 percent in 2006,
     the rate of new registrations jumped from 13 percent to 26 percent.” However, Bruhn (2008,
     2013) in Mexico and De Giorgi and Rahman (2013) in Bangladesh found limited indications
     that formalization took place. Other evidence shows that reforms of tax registration might
     impact formalization, but only under specific circumstances (McKenzie and Sakho 2010;
     Medvedev and Oveido 2013).

     Third, IEG’s case studies confirmed the observations that improvement in outcome
     indicators of regulatory indicators is not sufficient to guarantee impact on investments,
     employment, and growth. Rwanda has been a champion of Doing Business reforms
     since 2005, has been nominated as top performer, and has sustained the momentum
     of investment climate reforms over time thanks to strong political commitment. Yet
     expectations of FDI inflows have not materialized (Figure 3.5). Even though some increase
     in FDI was recorded after the initial reforms, the actual value has been far short of
     expectations.20

     In contrast, Cambodia has embarked on fewer regulatory reforms, has a more modest
     level of regulations in the country, and has rampant corruption. Yet FDI has been flowing
     in the country over the last few years, growth rate has been exceeding 7 percent per year,
     and poverty has dropped dramatically. Recent research on FDI has identified the size of the
     market and its growth prospects, distance to important markets, relative labor endowments,
     and openness to trade as important drivers of FDI. And Cambodia has almost all of them:
     low labor cost; stable political environment; favorable tax regime for FDI (20 percent
     corporate tax and free repatriation of dividends), integrated regionally and globally (World
     Trade Organization accession in 2004); few barriers to entry and exit for most business
     activities; smaller presence of state-owned enterprises; access to significant markets (for
     example, All but Arms Agreement on free access to the European Union market); and
     praise by the International Labour Organization for raising labor working standards in the
     garment industry.

     Regulatory reforms are not a sufficient condition to attract FDI. Other factors play an
     important role for foreign investors, such as cost of electricity, logistics costs, labor cost, and
     market access. In Cambodia, the All but Arms agreement that provides duty and quota
     free access to the European Union market has been estimated as providing the equivalent
     of 11–16 percent ad valorem reduction on cost for goods in the destination markets. No
     regulatory reform can hope to accomplish such a momentous impact on production costs,
     absent huge initial regulatory distortions (Box 3.2).

Finally,	a	proper	assessment	of	the	impact	of	investment	climate	interventions	must	take	into	
account	that	regulatory	reforms	should	improve	outcomes	for	society	as	a	whole,	not	just	
for	businesses.	Regulations	are	typically	seen	as	a	burden,	cost,	or	constraint	for	businesses	
(Kitching	2006;	Chittenden,	Kauser,	and	Poutziouris	2002;	Djankov	2009;	Crain	and	Crain	
2010);	consequently,	their	assessments	focus	on	the	real	or	alleged	impact	on	businesses	
alone.	Yet,	as	discussed	in	detail	in	the	next	chapter,	regulations	affect	a	much	wider	set	
of	stakeholders,	such	as	consumers,	employees,	and	investors.	Furthermore,	they	produce	
highly	variable	outcomes	that	go	beyond	firms	and	include	unequal	treatment	of	employees	
and	consumers,	unequal	distribution	of	wealth	and	resources,	and	unequal	access	to	
goods	and	services.	Accordingly,	properly	estimating	the	true	impact	of	regulatory	reforms	
on	society	requires	a	consideration	of	its	impact	on	a	range	of	key	social	stakeholders,	
practices,	and	institutions	beyond	the	narrow	aspect	of	business	activity.	This	will	better	
align	regulatory	reform	interventions	to	the	strategic	World	Bank	Group	objective	of	shared	
prosperity.	

In	sum,	IEG	found	evidence	that,	within	the	limits	of	available	data,	the	World	Bank	Group	
support	to	regulatory	reforms	in	client	countries	has	improved	their	business	environments,	as	
measured	by	the	simplification	of	procedures	and	reduction	of	time	and	costs	to	businesses.	
This	notwithstanding,	the	impact	of	regulatory	reforms	on	firm	creation,	jobs,	and	investment	
is	not	clear.

         Rwanda
         In	Rwanda	much	improvement	has	been	achieved	in	the	investment	climate—especially	
         along	the	dimensions	of	Doing	Business	reforms.	But	Rwanda	is	not	an	easy	place	to	
         do	business.	In	enterprise	surveys	and	interviews	IEG	conducted	with	private	enterprises	
         operating	in	Kigali,	IEG	heard	complaints	about	access	to	finance,	availability,	and	
         cost	of	land,	electricity,	transport,	and	skills	as	well	as	uncertainties	related	to	tax	
         administration,	investor	aftercare,	and	competition	with	politically	connected	firms.	The	
         country	remains	risky,	especially	in	view	of	presidential	elections	in	2017.	Still	too	much	
         depends	on	a	charismatic	leadership,	and	formal	processes	are	not	quite	institutionalized.
         The	government-private	sector	relationship	is	somewhat	unbalanced.	The	private	
         sector	is	weak,	and	the	government	is	setting	the	pace	in	everything.	The	government	
         of	Rwanda	is	an	"impatient	government"—it	wants	to	do	business	and	get	things	done	
         quickly.	It	thus	has	little	patience	to	wait	for	the	private	sector	and	it	takes	on	initiatives	
         itself	to	seed	business,	creating	government-related	companies.	This	makes	some	private	
         investors	nervous	and	complicates	public-private	dialogue	on	prioritizing	reforms.
         At	the	same	time,	there	are	clear	signals	that	the	government	does	not	promote	
         economic	and	business	interests	at	the	expense	of	social	and	environmental	values.	
         Environmental	and	social	rules	are	strict	and	well	enforced.	IEG	heard	of	a	case	where,	
         in	trying	to	simplify	the	Doing	Business	“dealing	with	construction	permits”	indicator,	
         the	government	did	not	accept	simplifications	that	could	jeopardize	building	safety	and	
         quality.	IEG	also	heard	cases	where	companies	have	been	relocated	because	they	were	
         encroaching	on	wetlands.	no	plastic	bags	are	allowed	in	Rwanda,	and	street	vendors	
         are	restricted	to	designated	areas.
         The	country	is	one	of	the	fastest	growing	in	Africa,	and	expectations	are	high.	Relative	
         to	the	reform	effort,	however,	the	response	in	terms	of	private	investment	and	FDI	has	
         been	below	expectations.	The	government	is	somewhat	disappointed	that	reforms	are	
         not	producing	better	results,	but	there	are	no	signs	that	it	is	thinking	of	slowing	down	
         reforms.	There	is	finally	a	realization	that	Doing	Business	reforms	are	not	enough	
         and	so	it	is	broadening	the	scope	of	reforms	and	methodically	trying	to	address	other	
         binding	constraints	to	private	businesses.
         Although	Doing	Business	reforms	are	generally	viewed	as	being	not	the	most	pressing	
         or	important,	the	consensus	is	that	they	have	been	useful	and	worthwhile.	They	have	
         generated	a	strong	and	positive	response—in	terms	of	registrations	and	tax	revenues—and	
         have	reduced	costs	for	business.	These	reforms	do	not	appear	to	have	crowded	out	other	
         reform	efforts.	They	have	generated	a	level	of	confidence	among	policy	makers	that	the	
         government	can	get	things	done	and	thus	tackle	more	difficult	reforms.	Rwanda	is	a	country	
         that	needs	a	change	in	image,	and	Doing	Business	reforms	have	helped	in	that	respect.


90   Investment Climate Reforms
CONTINUED             Findings	from	the	Field:	Impact	of	Reforms—Rwanda	and	Cambodia
             BOX 3.2	 	

Cambodia
Like	Rwanda,	Cambodia	had	a	tragic	past	and	has	had	to	rebuild	its	social	and	economic	
institutions	and	physical	infrastructure.	However,	unlike	Rwanda,	the	country	did	not	see	the	
Doing	Business	indicators	as	a	tool	to	improve	the	image	of	the	country	internationally,	and	
not	much	progress	on	investment	climate	reforms	has	been	made.	The	country’s	Doing	
Business	ranking	is	worse	than	all	other	countries	in	the	region,	except	Lao	PDR	(159).
Some	government	representatives	spoke	about	progress	that	had	been	made	(business	
registration,	customs	clearance,	and	so	forth),	but	implementation	takes	time	and	is	
often	slowed	by	individuals	who	impede	reforms	so	they	can	protect	their	personal	
interests.	Corruption	at	all	levels	of	the	economy	remains	rampant	and	imposes	costs,	
delays,	and	uncertainty	on	existing	investors	and	keeps	many	potential	investors	away,	
especially	investors	from	the	United	States	and	Europe.	The	level	of	corruption	in	
Cambodia	has	been	well	documented.	In	2013,	Transparency	International	ranked	
Cambodia	as	the	second	most	corrupt	country	in	East	Asia,	led	only	by	north	Korea.	In	
2011,	IEG	published	a	working	paper	noting	that	corruption	was	consistently	the	main	
constraint	for	most	firms	(Girishankar	and	others	2011).	
Other	impediments	to	PSD	identified	by	respondents	were	cost	of	electricity	and	lack	of	
skilled	workforce.
Despite	the	challenges	of	doing	business	in	Cambodia,	FDI	and	exports	continue	
to	grow.	Cambodia	attracts	mostly	regional	investors	who	wish	to	diversify	their	
production	base,	reduce	production	costs,	or	take	advantage	of	duty-free	access	
to	European	and	north	American	markets.	As	a	consequence,	Cambodia	has	
experienced	strong	economic	growth	and	high	FDI	inflows.	GDP	growth	exceeded	
10	percent	leading	up	to	the	global	financial	crisis	in	2008–09	and	has	exceeded	
7	percent	since	2010.	This	strong	growth	has	contributed	to	a	sharp	decrease	in	
poverty.	In	2011	about	one-fifth	of	the	population	lived	below	the	national	poverty	line,	
compared	to	50.1	percent	in	2007.
Cambodia’s	achievements,	according	to	people	IEG	met,	are	less	attributable	to	
regulatory	reforms	than	they	are	to	other	factors,	including	Cambodia’s	location	in	
East	Asia,	the	country’s	accession	to	the	World	Trade	Organization	in	2004,	and	
extension	of	the	European	Union’s	Everything	but	Arms	to	Cambodia,	which	gave	the	
country	tariff-free	access	to	the	European	Union	and	cut	local	content	requirements	
from	50	percent	to	30	percent.	One	survey	respondent	estimated	the	impact	of	the	
free	access	to	the	European	Union	market	as	equivalent	to	a	reduction	of	import	duties	
of	11–16	percent	ad valorem.	no	regulatory	reforms	can	be	expected	to	have	the	
same	impact.

                     An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	3   91
     Notes
     1
      	 For	the	World	Bank	the	rest	of	portfolio	is	defined	as	all	non-investment	climate	projects	in	the	networks	that	have	investment	
     climate	projects,	such	as	PREM,	FPD,	Human	Development	network,	and	SDn.	For	IFC,	the	rest	of	portfolio	is	defined	as	all	
     the	non-investment	climate	advisory	service.

     2
      	 World	Bank	lending	projects	and	IFC	advisory	projects	are	assessed	by	comparing	the	results	against	the	stated	objectives.	
     However,	investment	climate	projects	implemented	by	the	two	institutions	have	significant	differences.	In	fact,	many	Bank	
     projects	aim	at	institutional	reforms,	whereas	IFC	projects	usually	aim	at	simplifying	regulations	and	procedures.	Furthermore,	
     project	implementation	length	in	both	institutions	varies	considerably	(averaging	three	years	for	IFC	versus	six	years	for	the	
     World	Bank),	which	could	influence	the	likelihood	of	achieving	results	by	project	completion.	Finally,	the	M&E	frameworks	and	
     reporting	rules	of	each	institution	are	different.	Consequently,	a	direct	comparison	of	the	ratings	of	the	two	institutions	must	be	
     done	with	caution.

     3
      	 Correlations	with	other	gender	indices	were	considered	but	presented	limitations	(the	Country	Policy	and	Institutional	
     Assessment	score	is	available	for	a	limited	number	of	countries;	the	Women,	Business,	and	the	Law	indicators	that	more	
     directly	refer	to	entrepreneurship	have	very	little	variation	across	countries).

     4
      	 A	multivariate	analysis	of	the	correlation	between	individual	reforms	and	the	WEF	Global	Gender	Gap	economic	participation	
     score	reveal	a	very	poor	correlation	overall,	with	a	couple	of	exceptions—interventions	focused	on	tax	policy,	mediation,	mining,	
     and	property	rights	are	strongly	associated	with	a	lower	WEF	Global	Gender	Gap	economic	participation	score.

     5
      	 The	World	Bank	Group	started	to	produce	Women, Business and the Law	reports	in	2012.	The	reports	focus	on	setting	out	
     legal	differentiations	on	the	basis	of	gender	in	143	economies	around	the	world,	covering	6	areas—accessing	institutions,	
     using	property,	getting	a	job,	providing	incentives	to	work,	building	credit,	and	going	to	court.	

     6
      	 An	interesting	question	is	whether	positive	outcomes	for	women	can	be	achieved	even	without	explicit	targeting	or	whether,	
     to	maximize	impacts,	the	project	design	needs	to	rest	on	a	clear	understanding	of	gender	issues,	identification	of	gender-
     specific	bottlenecks,	and	specific	gender-targeted	actions.

     7
      	 An	impact	evaluation	conducted	to	evaluate	the	impact	of	the	project	found	that	women	working	in	male-dominated	sectors	
     (like	metal	fabrication	and	foundry)	earn	substantially	more	than	those	working	in	traditional	industries	and	also	work	fewer	
     hours	per	week.	At	the	same	time,	large	informational	gaps	exist	among	women	operating	in	traditional	industries	about	
     the	returns	available	in	male-dominated	sectors.	The	impact	study	conducted	an	analysis	on	the	mechanisms	to	become	a	
     crossover	to	a	male-dominated	industry	and	advocated	that	informational	campaigns	combined	with	mentorship	interventions	
     can	facilitate	the	growth	of	female	entrepreneurship	in	nontraditional	industries.

     8
      	 The	Ghana	Land	Administration	Project;	the	Honduras	Land	Administration	Project;	the	Lao	People’s	Democratic	Republic	
     Second	Land	Titling	projects;	and	the	Uganda	Private	Sector	Competitiveness	II.

     9
      	 All	case	study	countries	classified	by	the	Bank	Group	as	FCS	for	one	or	more	year	between	FY07	and	FY14:	Guinea,	Lao	
     PDR,	Liberia,	Mali,	nepal,	South	Sudan,	Sudan,	and	the	Republic	of	Yemen.

     10
          	 See	chapter	5	for	a	more	detailed	discussion.

      	 Other	data	sets	were	also	used,	such	as	the	Entrepreneurship	Data,	the	Organisation	for	Economic	Co-operation	and	
     11


     Development	regulatory	index	for	FDI	and	its	market	competitiveness	index,	and	the	Enterprise	Surveys.

      	 It	must	be	noted	that	the	analysis	of	impact	does	not	discriminate	impact	of	Bank	Group	interventions	from	impact	of	other	
     12


     donor’s	interventions.	Although	other	donors	might	support	investment	climate	reforms	in	countries	where	the	Bank	Group	is	
     engaged,	the	Bank	Group	is	recognized	by	many	as	a	key	player	in	the	investment	climate	reform	area.

       	 Positive	here	indicates	a	change	in	the	right	direction	(either	positive	or	negative	depending	on	the	specific	indicator).	note	
     that	few	indicators	are	used	for	multiple	tests.



92   Investment Climate Reforms
 	 In	a	small	number	of	instances	(7),	the	indicators	are	significant	but	in	the	wrong	direction.
14



 	 variables	used	for	propensity	score	matching	include	level	of	income,	region,	constant	price	GDP	(as	proxy	for	size	of	the	
15


economy),	and	gross	fixed	capital	formation	(as	proxy	for	size	of	private	sector).	

16
  	 Contrary	to	propensity	score	match,	difference	in	difference	allows	for	unobserved	characteristics	to	influence	program	
participation,	although	they	are	assumed	to	be	time	invariant.	IEG	estimates	difference	in	differences	in	a	parametric	model	
using	indicator	values	at	the	beginning	and	end	of	period	and	including	as	control	variables	the	level	of	income,	the	region,	
the	constant	price	GDP	(as	proxy	for	size	of	the	economy),	and	gross	fixed	capital	formation	(as	proxy	for	size	of	private	sector).	

17
  	 Additional	tests	were	performed	to	estimate	the	impact	of	these	interventions,	including	the	adoption	of	different	
classification	of	interventions	and	the	use	of	one	additional	indicator	from	UnCTAD	(the	“Inward	FDI	Performance	Index”).	
These	additional	tests	were	either	inconclusive	or	confirmed	the	reported	results.

18
  	 Apart	from	methodological	issues	presented	in	earlier	assessments	(IEG	2009),	a	more	recent	IEG	review	(IEG	2013)	
highlighted	that,	notwithstanding	some	improvements,	the	Doing	Business	indicators	still	present	methodological	problems.	
The	first	of	them	relates	to	its	reliance	on	a	limited	number	of	contributors—in	Doing	Business	2013	(World	Bank	2012),	IEG	
found	60	instances	in	which	the	indicators	relied	solely	on	the	input	of	one	contributor,	and	another	22	(across	18	countries)	
in	which	the	indicators	did	not	draw	on	any	contributors	at	all,	yet	still	provided	data.	Second,	the	Doing	Business	shows	a	
high	turnover	of	contributors	(although	details	have	not	been	disclosed).	Since	participating	in	Doing	Business	is	voluntary,	not	
all	firms	choose	to	participate	every	year.	Roughly	one-third	of	the	Doing	Business	2010	firm	cohort	participated	consistently	
across	the	four	years	ending	in	2013,	which	implies	a	66	percent	turnover	rate.	Third,	the	contributors’	qualifications	are	
not	clear.	The	Doing	Business	report	does	not	specify	in	detail	the	process	used	to	verify	that	contributors	have	the	required	
expertise.	Fourth,	the	Doing	Business	process	does	not	provide	any	information	on	the	variability	of	contributor	estimates.	
Doing	Business	estimates	and	reports	the	median	when	several	local	partners	provide	different	values	(World	Bank	2011a).	
However,	the	reports	provide	no	indication	on	the	number	of	instances	in	which	experts	differ	on	their	assessment	of	indicators	
nor	on	the	magnitude	of	these	differences.	Finally,	the	value	of	panel	data	is	limited	because	of	partial	adjustments	to	changes	
in	methodology.	Although,	in	response	to	earlier	criticisms,	the	Doing	Business	team	has	back-calculated	the	data	to	adjust	
for	changes	in	the	methodology	and	any	revisions	in	data	arising	from	corrections,	when	income	per	capita	data	are	revised	
by	the	original	data	sources,	Doing	Business	does	not	update	the	cost	measures	for	previous	years;	thus,	variables	are	
noncomparable	across	time.	

19
  	 The	Enterprise	Survey	values	are	estimated	for	SMEs	and	domestic	firms	and	are	median	values	(as	per	assumptions	
followed	by	the	Doing	Business	report).

     An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	4   97
     Promoting	social	value	lies	at	the	heart	of	the	World	Bank	Group	mission	of	ending	poverty	
     and	promoting	shared	prosperity.	The	twin	goals	of	poverty	elimination	and	shared	prosperity	
     that	guide	the	new	Bank	Group	Strategy	demand	that	regulatory	reform	be	understood	in	the	
     context	of	broader	social	values	and	goals,	to	augment	the	narrower	perspective	of	business	
     compliance	cost	reduction.	This	chapter	conducts	a	review	of	Bank	Group	methods	used	
     to	evaluate	the	social	value	(or	benefits)	of	the	regulatory	reforms	it	supports	with	the	aim	of	
     providing	a	better	understanding	of	the	range	of	impacts	of	reform,	thereby	developing	the	
     capacity	to	implement	better	reforms	in	future.

     Governments	typically	implement	regulatory	reform	to	correct	perceived	market	failures	and	
     improve	market	efficiency	(Veljanovski	2010).	Through	regulation,	however,	policy	makers	
     often	seek	to	promote	market	activity,	but	also	to	safeguard	employee	and	consumer	interests	
     and	protect	the	environment.	Improving	the	social	benefits	of	regulatory	reform	requires	
     consideration	of	its	impact	on	a	range	of	important	social	stakeholders,	practices,	and	
     institutions—not	only	businesses.	Hence,	regulation	should	be	thought	of	in	terms	of	both	
     economic	and	social	costs	and	economic	and	social	benefits.	In	practice,	though,	discussion	
     usually	focuses	only	on	business	costs.	


     Regulatory	Reform	and	Its	Effects:	Theoretical	Foundations
     Regulation	is	often	treated	in	academic	and	policy	discourses	as	a	burden,	cost,	or	
     constraint	on	business	activity	(Kitching	2006).	This	is	principally	because	assessments	of	
     regulatory	reform	focus	on	the	real	or	perceived	impact	on	businesses	rather	than	the	full	
     range	of	stakeholders	affected	by	regulation—consumers,	employees,	investors,	and	others.	
     Regulation	is	customarily	defined	as	generating	negative	impacts	on	firms,	particularly	SMEs	
     (Chittenden,	Kauser,	and	Poutziousis	2002;	Djankov	2009;	Crain and	Crain	2010).	Large	
     national	and	cross-national	surveys	of	business	compliance	typically	claim	that	regulation	
     hampers	success	(BIS	2013),	increases	costs	(de	Jong	and	Kloeze	2013),	and	produces	
     adverse	effects	on	macro-level	indicators	such	as	business	entry	rates,	productivity,	labor	
     mobility,	and	growth	(for	example,	Jalilian,	Kirkpatrick,	and	Parker	2007;	Djankov	and	
     others	2010;	Caballero	and	others	2013).	Although	SMEs	consider	themselves	to	be	well	
     informed	about	regulation,	they	are	more	likely	to	report	positive	effects	of	regulation	
     (Anyadike-Danes	and	others	2008).	

     Such	cross-sectional	surveys	can	be	criticized	on	a	number	of	grounds	(Kitching,	Hart,	
     and	Wilson	2013).	First,	few	studies	attempt	to	specify	the	mechanisms	through	which	
     regulation	produces	effects	(Frontier	Economics	2012)	or	how	effects	are	generated	over	
     time.	Many	studies	simply	correlate	variables	and	assume	causal	connections	on	the	basis	
     of	correlation.	Second,	surveys	tend	to	work	with	rather	crude	proxy	measures	of	the	quality	

98   Investment Climate Reforms
of	national	regulatory	regimes,	compressing	the	complex	influence	of	regulatory	reform	
into	a	straightforward	quantitative	indicator.	Third,	cross-national	surveys	take	the	country	
rather	than	the	firm	as	the	unit	of	analysis,	focusing	on	macro-	rather	than	microlevel	effects.	
Studies	therefore	are	unable	to	specify	the	microlevel	adaptations	to,	and	dynamic	effects	
of,	regulatory	reform.	This	generates	the	unintended	implication	that	all	firms	in	a	particular	
country	are	affected	by	regulatory	reform	in	similar	ways	when	reform	redistributes	the	risks,	
burdens,	and	benefits	of	regulatory	change	between	businesses	and	between	businesses	and	
other	stakeholders.	

Regulation	is	not,	however,	solely	a	burden	on	businesses.	It	performs	a	necessary	function	
in	enabling	markets	to	function;	it	can	be	market	constituting	rather	than	market	distorting	
(Polanyi	1957;	Fligstein	1996;	Elder-Vass	2009).	Without	a	comprehensive	framework	of	
regulation—for	example,	effective	property	rights,	contract	dispute	measures,	and	laws	
forbidding	anticompetitive	practices—market	economies	would	function	poorly.	Regulation	
permits	and	enables	firms	to	trade,	facilitating	a	variety	of	potential	social	benefits,	
including	wealth	creation,	employment,	product	innovation,	increased	consumer	choice,	
and	reduced	prices.	But	regulation	enabling	market	activity	also	produces	outcomes	
that	can	reduce	social	value,	including	pollution,	congestion,	inequitable	treatment	of	
employees	and	consumers,	unequal	distribution	of	wealth,	and	unequal	access	to	goods	
and	services.	

Therefore,	although	regulatory	reform	often	generates	public	goods,	not	all	members	
of	a	population	are	guaranteed	to	benefit	equally,	and	some	may	not	benefit.	Reform	
impacts	stakeholder	groups	unevenly;	some	groups	may	suffer	serious	disadvantages	as	a	
consequence	of	reform.	Reform	enables,	motivates,	and	constrains	stakeholder	groups	to	
adapt	to	a	changed	regulatory	landscape	in	different	ways,	with	variable	consequences.	Both	
increases	and	reductions	in	social	value	are	possible	consequences	of	regulatory	reform,	
impacting	stakeholders	in	various	ways.	Assessment	of	the	impact	of	regulatory	reform	should	
attempt	to	capture	these	diverse	tendencies.


Analytical	Framework:	Assessing	the	Social	Value	
of	Regulatory	Reform
The	concept	of	social	value	resonates	with	the	longstanding	notion	of	economic	welfare	
(Pigou	1920)	and	with	contemporary	ideas	of	human	development,	capabilities,	quality	of	life,	
well-being,	happiness/life	satisfaction,	and	sustainability	(Sen	1979;	Bleys	2012).	Conventional	
measures	of	economic	growth	such	as	GDP	and	the	beliefs,	discourses,	and	policy	stances	
that	support	such	measures	have	been	criticized	for	ignoring	some	of	the	human	and	
environmental	consequences	of	development	(Van	den	Bergh	2009).	Economic	growth	is	not

      an	end	in	itself	but	rather	a	means	to	the	end	of	improved	human	welfare;	broadly	understood,	
      it	is	a	point	increasingly	recognized	by	governments	and	supranational	organizations.1	

      Definitions	of	social	value	are	likely	to	be	contested	within	and	across	societies;	social	value	
      means	different	things	to	different	people.	How	societies	define	social	value	is	likely	to	be	
      influenced	by	a	wide	range	of	factors,	including	the	policies	of	national,	subnational,	and	
      supranational	governments;	the	wealth	of	the	population	and	its	distribution;	availability	of	
      public	services	and	access	to	infrastructure;	the	role	and	influence	of	civil	society	organizations	
      (political	parties,	business	associations,	trade	unions,	and	pressure	groups);	and	demographic	
      factors	such	as	age,	ethnicity,	language,	religion,	and	location.	For	example,	some	might	
      perceive	regulatory	reform	intended	to	provide	a	minimum	income	standard	through	a	
      national	minimum	wage	as	enhancing	social	value	by	raising	employment	incomes	and	
      reducing	poverty.	In	contrast,	others	might	believe	a	national	minimum	wage	reduces	social	
      value	because	of	anticipated	adverse	impacts	on	economic	efficiency,	business	profitability,	
      and	employment.	So	in	proposing	a	set	of	empirical	indicators	of	social	value,	it	is	important	
      to	recognize	the	contested	character	of	the	concept	and	the	indicators	that	attempt	to	
      operationalize	it.	

      Regulatory	reform	is	a	dynamic	force	shaping	the	activities	of	business	and	nonbusiness	
      stakeholders,	enabling	and	motivating	action	as	well	as	constraining	it	(Anyadike-Danes	
      and	others	2008;	Kitching,	Hart,	and	Wilson	2013;	Kitching,	Kašperová,	and	Collis	2013).	
      Consequently,	the	appropriate	analytical	framework	comprises	a	theory	of	change	connecting	
      regulatory	reform,	the	actions	of	businesses,	and	the	wide	variety	of	stakeholders	with	whom	
      they	interact	(consumers,	suppliers,	employees,	investors,	and	others)	to	the	wide	range	of	
      social	value	effects	(Figure	4.1).	By	influencing	business	and	stakeholder	activities,	regulatory	
      reform	generates	(or	fails	to	generate)	diverse	forms	of	social	value.	Some	studies	highlight,	
      for	instance,	the	potential	for	regulation	to	contribute	to	improved	environmental	protection	
      (for	example,	Leiter,	Parolini,	and	Winner	2011;	Testa,	Iraldo,	and	Frey	2011;	Wilson,	Williams,	
      and	Kemp	2012),	whereas	others	question	it	(Kneller	and	Manderson	2012)	or	suggest	that	
      stricter	enforcement	might	make	things	worse	(Cheng	and	Lai	2012).	

      Measuring	the	benefits	and	costs	of	regulatory	reform	is	a	difficult	task.	National	governments	
      and	supranational	bodies	such	as	the	European	Commission	have	adopted	impact	
      assessment	procedures	to	estimate	likely	costs	and	benefits	as	an	aid	to	regulatory	decision	
      making,	including	consideration	of	whether	to	regulate	at	all	(for	example,	Radaelli	and	de	
      Francesco	2010;	Staron ˇová	2010;	Dunlop	and	others	2012).	Wood	and	Leighton	(2010)	
      identify	a	number	of	methods	and	tools	that	have	been	developed	to	quantify	or	monetize	
      such	costs	and	benefits;	others	offer	detailed	prescriptions	of	how	to	measure	the	related	
      concept	of	social	return	on	investment	(SROI	Network	2012).2

The	social	return	on	investment	approach	seeks	to	quantify	and	put	a	monetary	value	on	
social	value	outcomes	(Wood	and	Leighton	2010;	SROI	Network	2012).	Social	return	
on	investment	methodologies	vary,	but	all	take	into	account	the	range	of	stakeholders	
involved	in	the	impact	value	chain,	specify	relevant	indicators	and	quantitative	or	financial	
measures	for	the	indicators,	and	outline	the	types	of	data	required.	And	they	make	
adjustments	for	deadweight	and	displacement.	

Where	regulatory	reforms	are	complex	and	far	reaching,	capturing	social	value	outcomes	
might	be	difficult,	because	identifying	relevant	stakeholders,	mapping	impact	chains	that	link	
reforms	to	indicators,	finding	appropriate	data	sources,	and	quantifying	(and	monetizing)	
social	value	may	be	very	challenging,	particularly	where	outcomes	differ	for	stakeholder	
groups	or	occur	over	long	time	periods.	

The	standard	cost	model	(SCM)	provides	a	methodology	to	estimate	the	administrative	costs	
and	burdens	of	regulation	(SCM	Network	n.d.).	The	model	distinguishes	direct	financial,	
compliance,	and	long-term	structural	costs.	Compliance	costs	are	further	subdivided	
into	substantive	and	administrative	compliance	costs:	the	former	refer	to	those	needed	to	
comply	with	a	regulatory	requirement,	the	latter	to	those	needed	to	document	or	disclose	
compliance.	The	SCM	measures	administrative	costs	from	central	government	regulation	
for	the	normally	efficient	business.	The	SCM	has	been	a	key	instrument	in	the	European	
Union	Programme	for	Reducing	Administrative	Burdens	(see	Rambøll	Management	2007)3	
and	national	governments	have	used	variants	of	the	model	to	conduct	impact	assessments	
to	assess	the	likely	economic,	social,	and	environmental	effects	of	regulatory	proposals	

                        An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	4   101
      (European	Commission	2009;	Radaelli	and	de	Francesco	2010).	Hence	the	scope	of	the	
      SCM	as	a	measure	of	regulatory	obligations	in	focusing	solely	on	administrative	costs	is	rather	
      narrow.	But	it	is	arguably	even	narrower	as	a	measure	of	social	value,	because	it	ignores	
      any	benefits	of	regulation.	Use	of	the	SCM	can	only	treat	regulation	as	a	burden,	cost,	or	
      constraint	on	businesses—but	never	as	something	that	enables	benefits.	

      Regulatory	impact	assessment	(RIA)	is	a	process	of	systematically	identifying	and	assessing	
      the	expected	effects	of	regulatory	reforms,	using	a	consistent	analytical	method,	such	as	
      benefit/cost	analysis	(OECD 2008).	RIA	is	a	comparative	process:	it	is	based	on	determining	
      the	underlying	regulatory	objectives	sought	and	identifying	all	the	policy	interventions	that	
      are	capable	of	achieving	them.	These	“feasible	alternatives”	must	all	be	assessed,	using	the	
      same	method,	to	inform	decision	makers	about	the	effectiveness	and	efficiency	of	different	
      options	and	enable	the	most	effective	and	efficient	options	to	be	systematically	chosen.	RIA	
      should	be	integrated	with	a	public	consultation	process,	as	this	provides	better	information	to	
      underpin	the	analysis	and	gives	affected	parties	the	opportunity	to	identify	and	correct	faulty	
      assumptions	and	reasoning.	


      Application	of	the	Framework:	Analysis	of	
      Cross-Country	Evidence
      To	identify	evidence	of	the	extent	and	depth	of	social	assessment	in	investment	climate	
      projects	across	the	World	Bank	Group,	IEG	follows	the	framework	shown	in	Table	4.1.	

      All	819	projects	in	the	investment	climate	portfolio	were	reviewed	by	keyword	search	and	
      subsequent	closer	examination.	This	review	identified	108	projects	(87	for	IFC	and	21	for	the	
      World	Bank)	with	some	formal	impact	assessment	of	social	value.4	

      Several	key	findings	emerge	from	this	analysis	(Table	4.2).	First,	formal	assessments	are	
      conducted	in	only	a	minority	of	World	Bank	Group	projects—about	15	percent	of	the	total.	
      There	is,	however,	a	significant	difference	between	the	two	institutions,	with	IFC	including	
      some	formal	assessment	in	25	percent	of	its	projects	and	the	World	Bank	only	in	5	percent.	
      Second,	formal	assessments	do	not	always	refer	to	all	regulatory	reforms	implemented	as	
      part	of	an	intervention.	There	were	large	differences	between	IFC	and	World	Bank	projects:	
      approximately	two	in	ten	of	IFC	reports	refer	to	all	regulatory	reforms	(17	percent),	whereas	
      almost	none	of	World	Bank	reports	do	so.	Third,	there	are	a	large	number	of	projects	for	
      which	there	are	no	data;	this	is	especially	true	for	the	World	Bank,	where	nine	in	ten	projects	
      provided	no	information	(16	percent	for	IFC).	

      Fourth,	some	estimate	of	social	value	is	reportedly	made	in	only	16	percent	of	IFC	
      projects	and	1	percent	of	World	Bank	projects.	In	virtually	all	IFC	projects	for	which	data

are	available,	the	estimates	are	quantitative;	80	percent	of	World	Bank	assessments	are	
presented	in	qualitative/discursive	form.	Nearly	all	quantitative	assessments	are	provided	as	
single-point	estimates	of	particular	indices	rather	than	as	a	value	range	(90	percent	of	IFC	
evaluations	and	the	single	World	Bank	evaluations).	Single-point	estimates	might	provide	
useful	indications	of	likely	social	value	in	terms	of	particular	indicators,	but	they	risk	conveying	
a	spurious	precision	and	lack	sensitivity	to	the	changing	circumstances	that	support	higher-	or	
lower-value	outcomes.

Fifth,	as	social	value	is	a	multidimensional	concept,	intended	to	refer	to	different	kinds	of	social	
benefit	for	a	variety	of	stakeholder	groups,	IEG	looked	at	whether	the	assessments	are	based	
on	a	single	category	or	on	multiple	categories.	Only	4	in	10	IFC	evaluations	and	3	in	10	World	
Bank	evaluations	provided	any	data	on	this	issue.	Of	those	that	provided	data,	two-thirds	of	
IFC	evaluations	and	half	of	the	World	Bank	evaluations	considered	only	a	single	type	of	reform	
effect.	This	suggests	a	narrow	rather	than	a	multistranded	conception	of	social	value	and	leaves	
a	large	gap	in	the	understanding	of	how	regulatory	reform	might	contribute	to	social	value.	The	
qualitative	analysis	shows	that	the	vast	majority	of	projects	focus	on	the	impact	of	reform	on	
investment	(reported	in	28	of	the	36	for	IFC,	and	1	of	the	6	for	World	Bank).

Other	indicators	of	economic	value	were	also	reported:	employment,	prices,	productivity,	
infrastructure,	business	creation,	exports,	and	access	to	education	and	training.	In	addition,	
a	number	of	social	indicators	were	also	mentioned—environmental	protection	and	
sustainability,	political	stability	and	participation,	tackling	corruption,	and,	interestingly,	
the	quality	of	interpersonal	interaction	and	social	capital.	Although	it	is	difficult	to	know	
precisely	what	is	meant	by	each	of	these	terms	in	the	context	of	brief	descriptions	in	projects	
documents,	their	inclusion	does	suggest	that	the	World	Bank	Group	emphasizes	the	economic	
effects	of	regulatory	reform	and	assumes	that	changes	in	the	economy	will	necessarily	
bring	about	desirable	changes	in	social	value.	Economic	changes	might	be	associated	with	
improvements	in	one	or	more	aspects	of	social	value,	but	they	do	not	guarantee	them	and	
might	also	lead	to	reductions	in	social	value	where	regulatory	reform	leads	to	a	redistribution	
of	benefits	among	different	social	groups.	

Sixth,	in	only	13	percent	of	IFC	projects	and	1	percent	of	World	Bank	projects	were	specific	
recipients	of	the	social	value	of	regulatory	reform	identified.	In	45	of	the	46	IFC	evaluations	
and	3	of	the	6	World	Bank	evaluations	were	businesses	specified	as	the	major	beneficiaries	of	
regulatory	reform;	SMEs	were	mentioned	specifically	in	five	IFC	projects.	Other	beneficiaries	
identified	included	taxpayers,	consumers,	investors,	and	employees.	Businesses	were	the	
primary	beneficiaries	identified.	Again,	the	logic	appears	to	be	that	where	businesses	benefit	
from	reform,	it	is	assumed	that	this	necessarily	feeds	into	increases	in	social	value,	implicitly	
defined	in	terms	of	benefits	for	nonbusiness	stakeholders.

                    An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	4   105
      Seventh,	distributional	issues	were	examined	in	only	seven	evaluations—corresponding	
      to	2	percent	of	the	IFC	portfolio	and	none	of	the	World	Bank	projects,	the	latter	of	which	
      usually	related	to	the	formalization	of	informal	businesses.	This	suggests	that	important	
      distributional	issues	are	neglected	in	World	Bank	Group	projects;	these	are	essential	
      to	understanding	social	value	outcomes	and	the	extent	to	which	shared	prosperity	is	
      achieved.	Again,	this	could	be	an	unintended	consequence	of	the	underlying	assumption	
      that	regulatory	reform	is	assumed	to	generate	changes	in	economic	behavior	that,	in	turn,	
      necessarily	produce	social	benefits.

      Conversely,	there	is	no	automatic	relationship	between	the	two;	economic	and	social	
      changes	are	connected	in	complex	ways.	Bank	Group	projects	provide	very	limited	
      evidence	of	the	links	between	regulatory	reform	and	economic	and	social	impacts.	It	is	
      not	clear	whether	regulatory	reform	produces	benefits	that	extend	to	entire	populations	
      or	are	confined	to	particular	social	groups—businesses,	investors,	men,	or	urban	
      populations,	for	example.	To	explore	whether,	and	how,	the	social	benefits	of	regulatory	
      reform	reach	social	groups	lacking	economic	assets—with	restricted	access	to	goods,	
      services,	and	infrastructure,	often	located	in	rural	or	remote	areas,	and	suffering	from	
      exclusion	and	discrimination—more	sophisticated	forms	of	evaluation	need	to	be	
      undertaken.

      In	summary,	IEG’s	analysis	offers	some	interesting	lessons	as	to	how	regulatory	
      interventions	and	their	evaluations	might	be	improved	to	provide	more	meaningful	
      evidence	of	the	benefits	and	costs	of	regulatory	reform.	First,	attention	should	be	drawn	to	
      the	limited	and	narrow	scope	of	assessments.	In	line	with	a	declining	Bank-wide	trend	in	
      conducting	cost-benefit	analysis	during	project	design	(IEG	2010),	a	very	small	proportion	
      of	investment	climate	projects	conducts	any	formal	assessment	of	social	value	of	regulatory	
      reforms.	Furthermore,	businesses	are	not	the	only	stakeholders	affected	by	regulatory	
      reform,	and	reducing	costs	and	increasing	investment	are	not	the	only	objectives	of	such	
      reforms.	Other	stakeholder	groups	and	regulatory	reform	effects	should	be	incorporated	
      within	evaluations.	

      Second,	serious	consideration	should	be	given	to	distributional	issues.	Regulatory	reform	
      need	not	necessarily	benefit	all	members	of	the	population	equally.	Indeed,	some	groups	
      may	be	worse	off	after	reform	because	some	stakeholders	are	enabled	to	act	in	ways	that,	
      intentionally	or	inadvertently,	disadvantage	or	exclude	such	groups.	Last,	evaluations	are	not	
      conducted	according	to	a	common	template,	so	there	would	be	gains	from	standardizing	the	
      questions	asked	and	data	obtained.	This	would	at	least	enable	cross-project	compar	    isons	
      that	might	stimulate	new	thinking	about	how	to	implement	initiatives	as	well	as	how	to	
      evaluate	them.

Application	of	the	Framework:	Qualitative	Analysis	of	World	
Bank	Group	Project	Reports
Out	of	the	portfolio	of	819	projects,	IEG	reviewed	a	sample	of	19	projects	in	Africa,	Asia,	
Europe,	and	Central	America;	these	were	selected	from	among	those	that	conducted	a	social	
evaluation	of	regulatory	reform.	The	19	projects	comprised	13	IFC	projects	(Appendix	Table	
D.1),	drawn	from	the	87	identified	as	involving	some	form	of	impact	assessment,	and	all	6	
World	Bank	projects	(Appendix	Table	D.2)	identified	as	doing	so.	The	IFC	reports	include	
seven	that	set	out	the	methods	and	assumptions	underpinning	their	assessments	of	regulatory	
reform	(starred	in	Appendix	Table	D.1).	To	examine	the	social	value	of	reform,	IEG	examined	
the	methods	used	to	draw	conclusions	and	looked	for	evidence	of	procedural	and	impact	
indicators	set	out	in	Table.

Both	IFC	and	World	Bank	clients	are	typically	national	or	subnational	governments;	in	one	
case,	clients	included	financial	intermediaries.	Projects	vary	in	financial	scale.	World	Bank	
projects	tend	to	be	larger,	varying	from	$9	to	84	million.	IFC	planned	project	expenditures	
ranged	from	$100,000	to	$5	million.5	These	IFC	projects	identify	their	intended	beneficiaries.	
Large	companies	were	cited	as	intended	beneficiaries	in	16	projects;	SMEs	in	16	projects;	
national	government	in	14;	subnational	governments	in	8;	other	intermediaries	in	7;	the	
public	in	3;	and	financial	intermediaries	in	2.	This	profile	of	intended	beneficiaries	is	reflected	
in	the	very	business-centered	analyses	presented,	presupposing	that	where	business	benefits,	
then	social	value	is	necessarily	generated.	

World	Bank	projects	refer	to	nonbusiness	stakeholders	more	often.	Intended	beneficiaries	
included	public	service	users	or	consumers,	government	departments,	and	tax	payers	as	
well	as	business	(or	SMEs	specifically).	Although	the	primary	focus	of	IFC	advisory	work	is	on	
businesses,	assessments	of	social	value	outcomes	should	also	seek	to	capture	impacts	on	
nonbusiness	stakeholder	groups.

To	examine	the	effects	of	World	Bank	Group	interventions,	IEG	distinguished	three	types	
of	indicator:	project	output,	procedural	outcome,	and	impact	indicators.6	Project	output	
indicators	refer	to	whether	intended	activities	were	delivered.	Procedural	outcome	indicators	
refer	to	changes	in	regulatory	processes	and	institutions.	Impact	indicators	refer	to	the	social	
value	benefits	of	regulatory	reform.	Impact	indicators	are	the	most	important	for	a	proper	
assessment	of	the	social	value	outcomes	of	regulatory	reform	(Table	4.3).	

The	analysis	leads	to	six	key	points.	First,	and	fundamentally,	none	of	the	projects	explicitly	
defined	social	value	in	relation	to	regulatory	reform	initiatives,	although	some	used	close	
synonyms,	such	as	social	development	outcomes	(in	Thailand).	The	absence	of	social	value	
criteria	and	indicators	means	IEG	had	to	rely	on	external	criteria	such	as	those	sketched	in

Table	4.1,	drawing	out	the	implications	on	the	basis	of	projects’	stated	objectives,	intended	
beneficiaries,	activities,	and	outcomes.	Furthermore,	the	specification	in	IFC	projects	of	
broad	categories	such	as	“other	intermediaries”	and	“public	benefits”	might	disguise	variable	
outcomes	for	different	groups.	“Other	intermediaries”	are	defined	as	business	associations,	
chambers	of	commerce,	nongovernment	organizations,	and	other	business	service	providers.	
This	is	a	broad	group	that	might	include	trade	unions,	professional	bodies,	and	consumer	
groups	(it	is	not	clear	whether	these	are	included).	

Second,	the	assessments	focus	heavily	on	project	output	and	outcome	indicators.	These	
are	useful	to	determine	whether	reforms	have	been	implemented	as	intended	and	to	
detail	changes	in	regulatory	processes	and	institutions,	but	they	provide	limited	insight	into	
substantive	impacts.

Third,	some	projects	present	impact	indicators	of	social	value,	but	only	in	a	very	general	
sense.	These	include	increased	investment	in	the	national	economy,	stakeholder	collaboration,	
social	assessments,	job	creation,	improving	environmental,	and	health	and	safety	standards—
or	maintaining	existing	standards	at	reduced	cost.	IFC	projects	typically	discuss	the	aggregate	
private	sector	compliance	cost	savings	involved	in	discovering	and	interpreting	regulatory	
requirements,	and	in	submitting	applications.	One	project	in	Kenya	showed	how	the	SCM	
methodology	was	applied	using	administrative-level	wage	costs,	although	this	arguably	
might	underestimate	costs	where	business	owners	are	personally	responsible	for	ensuring	
compliance.

It	is	unclear	precisely	how	estimates	of	increased	levels	of	investment	(or	other	indicators)	
have	been	made.	More	important,	it	is	debatable	how	far	procedural	outcome	indicators	

                     An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	4   109
      reflect	changes	in	social	value.	The	assumption	underpinning	regulatory	reform—that	reform	
      necessarily	generates	positive	substantive	impacts	(however	defined)—could	be	challenged.	The	
      relationship	between	regulatory	reform	and	substantive	impact	is	much	more	complex	than	the	
      time	and	monetary	savings	alleged	to	arise	from	the	removal	and	simplification	of	regulations.	

      One	project	in	Sudan	sought	to	improve	the	investment	climate	and	increase	business	
      competitiveness	through	aggregate	cost	savings	for	businesses	of	10	percent,	with	knock-on	
      effects	on	growth	and	employment.	The	means	to	achieve	these	objectives	was	implementing	
      reductions	in	four	Doing	Business	indicators	(paying	taxes,	property	registration,	registering	
      businesses,	and	dealing	with	construction	permits).7	Although	the	Project	Completion	Report	
      claims	that	targets	were	exceeded,	the	IEG	Evaluation	Note	(IEG	2011)	provides	a	more	critical	
      commentary,	stating	that	the	claimed	reductions	in	the	cost	and	time	of	doing	business	and	wider	
      impacts	on	private	sector	investment	cannot	be	substantiated	because	of	a	failure	to	implement	
      reforms,	lack	of	data,	the	limited	timeframe	for	evaluation,	and	problems	of	attribution.8	

      But	even	where	more	clear-cut	criteria	of	social	value	are	adopted,	there	is	evidence	of	
      the	prioritization	of	economic	over	social	value.	One	project	in	Kenya	(World	Bank	2012)	
      identifies	reduced	time	and	cost	of	inspections	together	with	no	decrease	(and	possibly	even	
      an	improvement)	in	health	and	safety.	Such	an	approach	arguably	prioritizes	cost	reductions	
      over	the	social	benefits	of	improved	health	and	safety.	

      The	six	World	Bank	projects	take	into	account	a	wider	range	of	issues	that	are	relevant	
      to	making	assessments	of	social	value.	Several	projects	specify	that	the	environmental,	
      social,	and	cultural	impacts	of	intervention	were	considered.	A	Central	African	States	
      project	discusses	the	benefits	of	greater	regional	integration	for	the	population	as	a	
      whole.	Documents	for	a	Thailand	project	discuss	possible	impacts	on	ethnic	minorities	
      and	indigenous	peoples	in	particular	regions,	particularly	with	regard	to	resettlement;	
      loss	of	business,	income,	or	assets;	processes	of	stakeholder	participation	(including	
      nongovernmental	organizations	and	civic	organizations);	capacity-building	measures	
      to	enable	the	national	government	to	undertake	social	assessments,	promote	public	
      participation,	and	improve	service	performance;	processes	for	monitoring	projects’	social	
      development	performance;	and	policies	safeguarding	environmental,	social,	and	cultural	
      goods.	Each	provides	a	useful	potential	indicator	of	social	value,	although	it	is	often	difficult	
      to	isolate	the	specific	effects	of	regulatory	reform	from	the	broader	program	of	financial	and	
      technical	support.	Regulatory	reform	is	often	only	a	minor	component	of	the	interventions.

      Fourth,	regulatory	reform	may	generate	contradictory	effects	at	the	individual	firm	level	
      (Kitching,	Hart,	and	Wilson	2013;	Kitching,	Kašperová,	and	Collis	2013)	and	unpredictable	
      effects	at	the	macro	level.	Regulation	affects	businesses	directly,	by	mandating	or	prohibiting	


110   Investment Climate Reforms
action	by	them,	for	example,	requiring	registration	and	licensing	to	trade	lawfully.	But	regulation	
also	impacts	businesses	indirectly	by	mandating,	prohibiting,	or	enabling	action	by	actual	
and	prospective	stakeholders	with	whom	businesses	deal.	Licensing	procedures,	for	instance,	
might	restrict	start-up	and	reduce	social	value	in	terms	of	the	benefits	generated	by	market	
competition—product	and	process	innovation,	lower	prices,	and	increased	consumer	choice.	
But	they	might	also	prohibit	poorly	capitalized	and	badly	managed	firms	from	engaging	in	
activities	that	undermine	market	confidence	and	the	social	value	that	arises	from	market	activity.	

For	example,	a	minimum	statutory	capital	requirement	might	deter	poorly	capitalized	
firms	whose	market	entry	might	generate	problems	for	existing	participants	without	
compensating	benefits.	More	sensitive	analyses	of	the	macro-level	impact	of	particular	
licensing	requirements,	and	their	removal,	is	required.	In	Ukraine,	a	law	requiring	mandatory	
certification	of	selected	food	products	was	repealed.	Given	the	absence	of	detailed	
information	on	its	effectiveness,	it	is	difficult	to	determine	the	impact	on	social	value.	
Deregulation	is	not	necessarily	a	remedy	for	market	failure,	particularly	where	it	enables	
market	actors	to	behave	in	ways	that	undermine	market	confidence	and/or	harm	consumers.	

Fifth,	the	use	of	impact	indicators	raises	the	very	difficult	challenge	of	establishing	
additionality—of	attributing	a	causal	connection	between	regulatory	reform	and	its	purported	
social	value	consequences.	Firms	undertake	their	economic	activities	in	open	systems,	
where	the	actions	of	many	agents—domestic	and	international—influence	their	activities	
and	performance.9	Regulation	is	one	influence	among	many	on	business	behavior	and	the	
substantive	social	benefits	alleged	to	flow	from	it	(increased	business	numbers,	reduced	
private	sector	costs,	higher	investment	and	employment);	it	may	or	may	not	be	a	significant	
influence	on	particular	events	or	outcomes.	

Attributing	causality	to	regulatory	reform	is	particularly	problematic	where	regulatory	reform	is	
just	one	component	of	a	wider	reform	program.	Even	if	the	impact	claims	presented	in	PCRs	
are	accepted,	it	is	unclear	whether	such	gains	and	savings	are	additional	to	what	would	have	
occurred	in	the	absence	of	the	intervention.	Some	caution	in	assuming	that	reform	caused	the	
changes	is	recommended.	Regulatory	reform	makes	particular	actions	possible;	agents	must	
interpret	and	act	on	the	basis	of	regulatory	change	for	reforms	to	generate	effects.	

Finally,	the	Doing	Business	data	analysis	is	underpinned	principally	by	the	assumption	that	
regulation	necessarily	burdens	firms,	adding	to	costs	and	constraining	action.	There	is	
some	recognition	that	regulation	might	benefit	businesses	by	enabling	stakeholders	with	
whom	businesses	deal	to	act	in	particular	ways—for	instance,	investor	protection	laws	might	
encourage	the	supply	of	equity—but	similar	arguments	might	be	applied	to	regulation	
imposed	directly	on	firms	themselves.	More	rigorous	and	time-consuming	procedures	for

      starting	a	business,	for	instance,	might	also	contribute	to	higher	levels	of	social	value	by	
      deterring	market	entry	by	unscrupulous	business	owners	unwilling	or	unable	to	comply	with	
      other	regulatory	standards,	thus	leading	to	price	undercutting	and	competitive	threats	to	
      law-abiding	businesses,	with	adverse	consequences	for	existing	businesses,	consumer	choice,	
      and	those	whom	the	regulations	are	intended	to	safeguard.10	

      Regulation	arguably	generates	contradictory	effects	at	the	level	of	the	firm.	How	such	effects	
      aggregate	up	to	the	country	level	is	a	complex	process.	There	are	likely	to	be	important	
      intracountry	distributional	impacts	on	firms,	with	some	managing	to	secure	more	benefits	than	
      others	and	others	suffering	more	burdens.	Intracountry	variations,	for	example,	in	the	time	
      firms	take	to	comply	with	particular	regulatory	requirements	are	obscured	by	the	provision	
      of	average	estimates	(Hallward-Driemeier	and	Pritchett	2011).	Such	differences	are	glossed	
      over	in	country-level	analyses	and	rankings	(Kitching,	Hart,	and	Wilson	2013).	Furthermore,	
      the	assumption	that	business	owners	are	aware	of	and	comply	with	relevant	regulations	is	
      particularly	important	for	social	valuation.	In	fact,	social	value	in	its	various	forms	might	be	
      increased,	or	reduced,	by	noncompliance.	

      In	summary,	although	the	19	interventions	provide	slightly	more	detail	regarding	the	social	
      value	of	regulatory	reform,	they	offer	few	insights	beyond	the	procedural	indicators	set	out	in	
      Table	4.3.	PCRs	do	not	define	social	value	explicitly,	so	IEG	has	to	draw	inferences	from	the	
      data	presented.	There	are	some	indications	of	a	broader	notion	of	social	value	with	World	
      Bank	projects	making	reference	to	environmental,	health,	and	safety,	and	other	types	of	
      impact	and	to	nonbusiness	stakeholders—but	these	are	generally	discussed	briefly	or	do	not	
      appear	to	be	fully	integrated	into	the	assessment	of	impact.	

      Procedural	indicators	such	as	compliance	cost	savings	do	not	tell	very	much	about	social	
      benefits.	Business	stakeholders	are	treated	as	paramount;	nonbusiness	stakeholders	are	barely	
      visible	in	many	IFC	PCRs.	Moreover,	compliance	cost	savings	data	are	presented	as	though	they	
      are	necessarily	benefits	for	all	businesses,	yet	such	benefits	are	likely	to	be	distributed	unevenly,	
      because	some	are	better	able	to	exploit	regulatory	change	than	others,	and	this	might	even	
      generate	adverse	impacts	for	some	businesses.

 	 Nine	keyword	search	terms	were	used:	RIA,	research	impact	assessment,	impact	assessment,	cost	benefit	analysis,	cost	
benefit,	compliance	cost	saving,	private	sector	saving,	social	value,	and	standard	cost	model.	Interestingly,	the	term	“social	
value”	was	identified	in	only	one	publication.

	 Actual	expenditure	may	vary	from	planned	expenditure.

	 These	three	indicator	categories	are	similar	to	the	classification	used	in	IFC	reports.

	 The	program	also	involved	major	changes	to	the	administration	of	the	tax	system,	customs	reform,	trade	logistics,	and	other

measures,	many	of	which	had	a	regulatory	dimension,	despite	not	being	described	in	such	terms.

 	 Since	the	project	was	completed	in	2010,	Sudan	has	become	two	countries.	South	Sudan	became	independent	in	2011	but	
has	been	subject	to	persistent	internal	conflict	since	then.

 	 Mali,	for	example,	suffered	a	military	coup	during	an	IFC	intervention,	leading	to	the	drastic	curtailment	of	the	private	sector	
investment	that	the	intervention	sought	to	stimulate.	Both	Kenya	and	Ukraine	experienced	delays	in	project	implementation	
following	government	elections	with	secondary	effects	on	regulatory	reform.

 	 Any	such	effects	are	in addition to	those	deterring	law-abiding	prospective	business	owners.	Which	effects	predominate	in	
10


particular	country	contexts	has	to	be	determined	by	empirical	research.

5   Factors	Affecting	Performance	



                  HIGHLIGHTS
                  •	Aspects	of	project	design	under	the	control	of	the	World	Bank	
                    Group—such	as	simpler	project	design,	good	supervision,	
                    and	good	risk	assessment—can	reduce	or	eliminate	the	
                    negative	effects	of	factors	not	under	its	control,	such	as	
                    inadequate	borrower	performance	and	the	onset	of	a	crisis.

                  •	Two	aspects	of	project	implementation—simplicity	of	design	
                    and	good	risk	assessment—can	reduce	or	eliminate	the	
                    negative	impact	of	most	implementation	problems.

                  •	Inadequate	technical	design	cannot	be	compensated	by	any	
                    good	aspects	of	project	design	and	hence	is	the	factor	most	
                    likely	leading	to	unsatisfactory	performance.

                  •	Political	instability	remains	one	of	the	main	problems	affecting	
                    the	effectiveness	of	investment	climate	reforms.

                  •	Collaboration	within	the	World	Bank	Group	is	mostly	driven	
                    by	informal	factors.	Systems	and	formal	organization	are	seen	
                    as	mostly	discouraging	collaboration.	Factors	related	to	roles	
                    and	strategy	can	foster	collaboration	if	properly	handled.

                  •	Successful	collaboration	rests	on	complementarity	of	roles,	
                    complementarity	of	perspectives,	and	complementarity	of	
                    instruments.	The	new	T&C	Global	Practice	has	the	opportunity	
                    to	take	advantage	of	two	business	models	provided	that	
                    governance	and	accountability	systems,	funding,	pricing,	
                    human	resources	policies,	and	operational	systems	are	
                    properly	integrated.



     An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	5   117
      In	this	chapter	IEG	presents	evidence	on	factors	that	help	explain	the	success	or	failure	of	
      investment	climate	interventions.	As	discussed	earlier,	although	both	IFC	and	the	World	Bank	
      support	investment	climate	reforms,	they	have	adopted	two	distinct	business	models.	The	World	
      Bank	includes	investment	climate	components	in	larger	lending	or	budget	support	operations;	
      IFC	supports	investment	climate	reforms	only	through	smaller,	technical	assistance	operations.

      In	its	analysis	IEG	first	tries	to	identify	if	and	when	each	institution	is	better	able	to	handle	
      implementation	problems	in	investment	climate	projects,	and	which	implementation	problems	
      more	significantly	affect	the	development	objectives	in	investment	climate	operations.	Then	
      IEG	looks	at	the	lessons	that	can	be	learned	from	investment	climate	interventions	on	FCS	
      and	in	industry-specific	projects.	Finally,	IEG	analyzes	the	factors	that	foster	collaboration	
      between	the	World	Bank	and	IFC	units	working	on	investment	climate.

      For	each	project	in	the	investment	climate	portfolio,	IEG	identified	implementation	problems,	
      distinguishing	problems	related	to	the	World	Bank	Group’s	role	from	those	related	to	the	
      borrower/client’s	role.	In	its	analysis	IEG	included	only	closed	projects	with	a	rating	for	individual	
      investment	climate	components,	that	is,	197	projects:	150	for	the	World	Bank	and	47	for	IFC.

      IEG’s	analysis	identified	330	implementation	problems,	classified	as	shown	in	Table	5.1.	In	
      IFC	the	majority	of	problems	relate	to	factors	beyond	its	control—implementation	delays,	
      crisis,	and	stakeholder	involvement;	these	account	for	70	percent	of	all	problems.	In	contrast,	
      the	corresponding	share	in	the	World	Bank	is	40	percent,	showing	that	the	Bank	is	better	able	
      to	handle	these	issues.

      It	is	interesting	to	note	that	M&E	is	the	most	important	problem	for	the	World	Bank	and	the	
      least	for	IFC;	for	both	institutions,	however,	implementation	delays	and	the	onset	of	a	crisis	
      are	major	implementation	problems	as	well.	This	is	in	part	because	of	the	critical	importance	
      that	political	stability	plays	on	the	success	of	investment	climate	projects.	Because	most	of	the	
      investment	climate	work	relies	on	the	enactment	of	laws,	regulations,	and	coordination	among	
      different	ministries	and	agencies,	a	committed	and	strong	government	is	key	to	success.

      IEG’s	25	country	case	studies	have	clearly	shown	that	political	(in)stability,	strong	or	limited	
      political	commitment,	absence	or	presence	of	a	reform	champion,	and	stakeholder	analysis	
      are	key	factors	that	explain	performance	of	regulatory	reforms	across	countries.

      With	respect	to	political	(in)stability,	a	solid	understanding	of	political	economy	is	essential	
      for	the	success	of	the	regulatory	reform	process.	Kenya	illustrates	the	importance	of	political	
      (in)stability.	The	country	initiated	many	investment	climate	reforms	over	the	last	decade	with	
      some	degree	of	success.	In	2007	it	was	recognized	as	one	of	the	top	10	reformers	in	the	
      world	by	the	Doing	Business	report.	More	recently,	however,	the	reform	process	has	slowed	
      down.	This	was	primarily	a	result	of	the	postelection	violence	in	2007–08.	Following	the

unrest,	a	coalition	government	was	established.	During	this	period,	the	government	did	
not	make	decisions	and	regulatory	reforms	lost	momentum.	The	government	focused	on	
reconciliation	rather	than	challenges	of	regulatory	reforms.

More	recently,	with	the	new	government,	there	seems	to	be	renewed	interest	in	regulatory	
reforms.	For	example,	KenInvest	(Kenya	Investment	Authority)	indicated	that	there	is	a	lot	
of	pressure	from	the	president	to	complete	the	one-stop	shop	for	investors.	Recently	the

      president	himself	opened	the	first	Huduma	center	(one-stop	shop	for	citizens),	and	reform	
      targets,	including	regulatory	reforms,	are	included	in	the	government	staff’s	performance	
      contract.

      Rwanda	exemplifies	the	presence	of	strong	commitment.	The	government	of	Rwanda	has	
      made	significant	progress	in	the	business	regulation	area	at	the	highest	level.	It	paid	a	lot	of	
      attention	to	Doing	Business-type	reforms	and	established	a	dedicated	team	to	coordinate	
      such	reforms.	Reform	efforts	have	been	timed	so	they	enter	into	the	annual	Doing	Business	
      ranking.	As	a	result	of	this	high	level	of	commitment	and	dedication,	Rwanda	is	a	now	top	
      reformer	in	Doing	Business.	For	the	government	of	Rwanda,	Doing	Business	is	an	important	
      tool	to	improve	the	country’s	image	in	general	and	among	investors	in	particular.	Reforms	
      are	not	only	on	paper,	but	are	also	effectively	implemented.	The	government	has	broadened	
      reforms	to	focus	on	SEZs,	trade	logistics	and	regional	integration,	support	to	key	sectors	such	
      as	tourism and	agribusiness,	and	more	long-term	efforts	focused	on	power	generation	and	
      transport.

      An	example	of	lack	of	government	commitment	can	be	found	in	the	experience	with	SEZ	
      reforms	in	general.	IFC	assisted	the	Cambodia	SEZ	Board	in	reforming	the	legal,	regulatory,	
      and	institutional	framework	for	SEZs.	Cambodia	was	mainly	interested	in	getting	a	draft	law	
      but	was	not	prepared	to	begin	the	interministerial	consultation	process	during	the	project.	It	
      would	have	been	useful,	in	the	project	design	if	IFC	had	a	Memorandum	of	Understanding	
      that	detailed	client	commitment	to	the	project,	with	a	clear	timeframe,	so	the	planned	activities	
      could	have	been	implemented	effectively.

      Similarly	in	Nepal,	the	SEZ	law	component	was	deemed	a	failure;	IFC	took	a	risk	by	
      embarking	on	what	it	believed	was	a	useful	tool	to	get	investment	and	job	creation	kick-
      started,	yet	the	tense	and	immature	political	situation	ultimately	undermined	efforts	to	fully	
      achieve	SEZ	objectives.	In	particular,	there	was	strong	resistance	to	SEZs	because	of	a	lack	
      of	understanding	of	a	potentially	new	SEZ	regime	and	politically	motivated	resistance	to	
      SEZs,	which	threatened	entrenched	interests	that	were	supportive	of	the	existing	Industrial	
      Zones	regime.

      Bangladesh	illustrates	the	combination	of	the	importance	of	both	political	stability	and	
      commitment.	In	Bangladesh,	the	2007–08	military-backed	government	created	a	stable	
      political	environment	for	advancing	public	financial	management	and	procurement	
      reform.	The	caretaker	government	worked	to	root	out	corruption	from	all	levels	of	
      government;	the	government	also	pushed	forward	with	regulatory	and	other	reforms.	
      It	granted	legal	independence	to	the	judiciary,	the	election	commission,	and	the	Anti-
      Corruption	Commission	and	established	the	Bangladesh	Better	Business	Forum	and	the	


120   Investment Climate Reforms
Regulatory	Reform	Commission	to	promote	state	responsiveness	through	dialogue	with	the	
private	sector.

The	World	Bank	and	IFC	both	had	access	to	the	caretaker	government.	This	close	relationship	
allowed	them	to	keep	the	momentum	of	regulatory	reform	programs.	The	U.K.	Department	
for	International	Development	and	the	IFC-managed	Bangladesh	Investment	Climate	Fund	
supported	the	latter	two	initiatives,	which	encouraged	public	scrutiny	and	debate	for	draft	laws	
and	identified	key	investment	climate	reforms,	which	the	transitional	government	began	to	
implement.

However,	once	the	elected	government	took	office	in	2009,	the	Better	Business	Forum	
did	not	meet;	it	was	formally	dissolved	in	2010,	although	the	need	for	public-private	
dialogue	continues	to	be	acutely	felt.	The	Regulatory	Reform	Commission	was	set	up	in	
2007	to	prepare	recommendations	to	modernize	government	rules	and	regulations.	Some	
regulations	were	adopted.	The	new	government	rejected	the	Commission	initiative	on	
political	rather	than	substantive	grounds,	because	it	had	been	undertaken	by	the	caretaker	
government,	despite	a	general	recognition	of	the	useful	role	that	the	agency	had	played.	
The	reform	agenda	was	left	to	individual	ministries	to	follow	up,	and	although	there	was	
incremental	progress,	most	of	the	bolder	measures	that	had	been	proposed	were	off	
the	table.

Linked	to	political	instability,	the	presence	or	absence	of	a	reform	champion	is	another	
critical	factor	of	success.	In	Kenya,	there	was	no	government	champion	to	push	the	
regulatory	reform	process	with	the	change	in	the	government.	The	weakness	of	the	RIA	
project	was	a	lack	of	local	participation	and	buy-in	from	the	government.	Similarly,	at	
high	levels	(ministry/prime	minister)	there	was	no	champion	to	support	the	business	
regulatory	bill.

In	Bangladesh,	the	program	was	restructured	after	a	change	in	government	because	it	lacked	
a	champion	at	the	highest	levels.	Nevertheless,	working	with	line	ministries,	despite	being	time	
consuming	and	resource	intensive,	has	improved	the	sustainability	of	the	program.	Overall,	
the	impact	is	measured	through	the	SCM,	which	includes	only	benefits	for	firms	and	assumes	
that	all	firms	benefit	from	the	reforms.	BICF	shows	some	of	the	benefits	of	a	sustained	
program	on	investment	climate	reforms	over	a	scatter-shot	approach	of	individual	projects,	
despite	some	initial	missteps.	Prior	to	2009,	during	the	caretaker	government,	IFC	had	access	
to	the	Chief	Advisor’s	office	as	a	broad	commitment	to	investment	climate	reform	and	pushed	
forward	with	initiatives	that	were	later	reversed	by	the	elected	government	of	2009.	The	
programmatic	approach	allowed	BICF	to	step	back	and	re-engage	with	the	line	ministries	at	
all	levels	to	push	a	program	forward.

      Unsuccessful efforts in regulatory reforms often focus on improving the technical quality
      of legislation but ignore the importance of the process to move a bill through the
      parliamentary process. Although the World Bank and IFC cannot and should not be
      engaged in these processes, successful regulatory reform requires understanding this
      part of the policy-making process and engaging relevant stakeholders. The experience
      in Kenya shows that stakeholder analysis should be a critical part of project design and
      implementation. This is particularly important in investment climate projects, because they
      are implemented in countries with a high level of political instability (and hence, a high risk of
      short-lived commitment) (Figure 5.1).

      Virtually all regulatory reforms include several parties with different interests. Therefore,
      it is critical to perform a systematic stakeholder analysis at the stage of project design.
      Interviews with IFC staff suggest that project teams do this type of analysis informally.
      However, operational teams need to be more aware of the political economy of reform
      and develop strategies for mitigating potential risks posed by vested interests opposing
      reforms.

      Because the distribution of problems is different across institutions, as shown in Table 5.1, IEG
      attempted to understand how each institution is equipped to handle different implementation
      problems. IEG conducted this analysis with a set of Probit regressions, where the dependent
      variable is the achievement of the intervention’s Development Outcome1 plus an interaction
      term between project problems and a dummy for the World Bank. Control variables include
      dummies for region, income level, and being a major investment climate project. The results
      presented in Figure 5.2 show that the IFC business model is better at handling problems
      related to the World Bank Group’s role—technical design, M&E, and supervision, as well as

external	factors,	such	as	borrower	performance,	crisis,	and	implementation	delays,	as	well	as	
problems	related	to	poor	supervision.	

One	finding	from	this	analysis	is	that	all	investment	climate	projects	are	affected,	one	way

achieve	their	development	objectives,	but	also	in	projects	that	successfully	achieve	their	
goals.	Approximately	45	percent	of	problems	identified	in	IEG’s	review	occur	in	projects	
that	achieve	their	developmental	objectives.	This	raises	a	legitimate	question:	among	all	
the	issues	identified,	are	some	more	binding	than	others?	For	instance,	IEG	observed	
that	a	good	proportion	of	projects	with	poor	stakeholder	involvement	still	succeeded	
(see	Box	5.1).	Similarly,	implementation	delays	appear	almost	as	often	in	successful	projects	
as	in	unsuccessful	ones.	

To	answer	this	question,	IEG	adopted	two	strategies.	First	it	ran	a	series	of	multivariate	
regressions	to	control	for	a	number	of	concurrent	factors.	Then	it	estimated	a	series	of

          BOX 5.1      Findings From the Field—Stakeholder Analysis Matters

          In Kenya, IFC supported drafting of the Business Regulatory Act as the foundation to
          legalize the Business Regulatory Reform Unit, a move to a single business registration
          system and a one-stop shop. The bill was seen as best practice by IFC staff.
          However, the bill has been stalled in the Parliament for some time. In the meantime, the
          government recently passed a statutory instrument act that includes some components
          of business regulation bill and made some parts of the business regulatory act
          irrelevant.
          Knowledge of this parallel work was limited among IFC staff. It is interesting to note
          that during the preparation no formal stakeholder analysis was done, although the bill
          affected many different groups with conflicting interests.

      regressions with interaction terms to establish the combined effect of problems occurring
      simultaneously. In all regressions, IEG controlled for a number of fixed factors that have
      been shown to be significant in similar work:2 length of project implementation (as proxy
      of complexity), value of project lending, sector, region, GDP growth of country, level of
      economic development as proxy for institutional development, and a dummy for network
      and project being restructured. Overall, the only variable that is consistently significant
      is GDP growth, with a positive effect on the probability of achieving the development
      objectives.

      In a first set of regressions IEG examined the project problems related to the World Bank
      Group role and those related to borrower behavior separately. The results show that three
      factors under the Bank Group’s control are particularly important: complexity of design,
      which reduces the probability of success by around 50 percent; inadequate risk assessment,
      which reduces the probability of success by almost 50 percent; and inadequate M&E,
      which has the potential to reduce the success rate by a quarter (Table 5.2, regression 1).
      On the borrower/client side, after controlling for other factors, borrower performance and
      crisis are significant correlates of success, indicating that lack of borrower engagement
      reduces the probability of success by 50 percent and the occurrence of a crisis by 25
      percent (Table 5.2, regression 2). These results maintained their significance even when IEG
      ran a Probit model with all projects problems, both Bank and borrower/client (Table 5.2,
      regression 3).

      Can	the	developmental	objectives	be	achieved	when	good	supervision	and	complex	
      design	are	present	in	the	same	project?	As	seen	previously,	many	implementation	
      problems	are	present	in	both	successful	and	unsuccessful	projects.	IEG	observed	that	
      borrower	performance	and	the	occurrence	of	a	crisis	are	factors	with	the	most	(negative)	
      impact	on	the	achievement	of	the	project’s	objectives.	Does	this	result	hold	even	when	
      inadequate	borrower	performance	happens	with,	say,	good	supervision?	To	detangle	these	
      combined	effects,	IEG	estimated	a	number	of	Probit	models	with	interaction	terms.	This	
      helped	identify	which,	if	any,	positive	aspects	of	investment	climate	projects	design	reduce	
      or	eliminate	the	negative	impact	of	implementation	problems	on	achieving	the	development	
      objectives.

      Figure	5.3	presents	the	probabilities	of	achieving	the	development	outcome	when	a	series	
      of	project	problems	is	paired	with	positive	aspects	of	project	implementation.	The	results	
      show	that	a	good	risk	assessment	can	help	reduce	the	negative	outcome	associated	with	
      poor	borrower	performance	and	the	event	of	a	crisis.	Furthermore,	the	negative	impact	of	a	
      crisis	can	be	reduced	with	a	simpler	design	and	good	supervision.	Similarly,	the	chances	of	
      achieving	the	development	outcome	are	higher	if	a	poor	M&E	is	associated	with	a	simpler	
      design,	if	a	complex	design	is	associated	with	a	good	risk	assessment,	and	if	a	poor	risk	
      assessment	is	paired	with	a	simpler	design.	These	results	are	consistent	with	previous	IEG	
      work	on	quality	of	Advisory	Service	projects	and	development	effectiveness	ratings,	showing	a	
      positive	association	between	high	work	quality	in	project	design	and	success	in	Development	
      Outcome	(IEG	2014b).	

      In	summary,	the	findings	of	this	analysis	reveal	three	interesting	patterns.	First,	there	are	
      aspects	under	the	control	of	the	World	Bank	Group	that	can	reduce	or	eliminate	the

Fragile	and	Conflict-Affected	Situations
In	FCS,	evidence	from	success	and	failures	in	case	studies	provides	the	following	lessons.

In	many	FCS,	overambitious	projects—in	terms	of	scope	or	timing—led	to	less	than	
satisfactory	results.	In	the	Republic	of	Yemen,	the	Bank’s	Port	Cities	Development	
Project	ambitiously	aimed	to	strengthen	local	institutions	from	the	bottom	up.	However,	
national	and	local	reforms	are	difficult	to	combine	over	a	short	period	of	time	in	an	FCS	
environment,	and	hence	the	right	sequencing	starting	with	the	national	level	is	required	to	
achieve	results.	The	Bank’s	Private	Sector	Growth	and	Social	Protection	Project	also	had	
overambitious	objectives	and	did	not	perform	well.	The	promotion	of	growth	in	non-oil	
sectors	in	the	Republic	of	Yemen—as	the	project	envisioned—would	necessitate	that	a	
series	of	actions	be	taken	over	time.	In	the	context	of	a	single	tranche	operation,	only	initial	

                          An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	5   127
      measures	in	this	area	could	be	envisioned,	leaving	open	the	question	of	how	these	reforms	
      would	be	sustained	on	completion	of	the	operation.

      In	contrast,	in	Lao	PDR	the	Bank	took	into	account	the	unsatisfactory	outcomes	of	earlier	
      budget	support	operations	and	provided	adequate	technical	assistance	to	support	its	
      program.	In	light	of	the	country’s	limited	technical	capacity,	program	objectives	were	not	
      overambitious,	as	the	programmatic	nature	of	Bank	support	was	expected	to	foster	continuity	
      of	reform	(IEG	2009).	

      The	Republic	of	Yemen’s	Business	Start-Up	Simplification	Project	achieved	its	objectives	thanks	
      to	its	flexible	design	and	ability	to	adjust	to	the	reality	on	the	ground,	discontinuing	activities	
      that	had	minimal	added	value	at	the	time.	For	example,	the	project	did	not	pursue	business	
      simplification	in	the	city	of	Aden	as	planned	because	of	other	activities	by	the	parallel	Bank	
      project.	The	project	also	did	not	work	with	the	General	Investment	Authority	because	of	
      another	IFC	project	working	with	the	Authority.

      Thus,	selectivity	and	flexibility	in	project	design	is	essential	in	contexts	characterized	by	political	
      instability	and	weak	capacity.	Consistent	with	IEG’s	FCS	evaluation,	these	projects	also	
      highlight	the	need	for	phasing	and	sequencing	of	investment	climate	support	based	on	a	
      timely	diagnostic	of	the	most	urgent	needs	and	constraints	(Box	5.2).	

      In	FCS,	institutional	capacity	building	and	implementation	assistance	have	been	instrumental	
      in	determining	the	success	of	interventions.	In	Sudan	and	South	Sudan,	the	Bank	Group’s	
      investment	climate	interventions	immediately	followed	the	signing	of	the	2005	Comprehensive	
      Peace	Agreement.	The	timing	of	the	interventions was	considered	appropriate;	in	South	Sudan,	
      for	example,	the	Bank	Group	saw	the	need	for	a	quick	and	effective	strategy	that	would	
      demonstrate	that	the	country	was	stabilizing	and	that	investors	were	welcome	(IFC	2011).	
      Yet	the	difference	in	the	design	and	implementation	strategy	between	Sudan	and	South	Sudan	
      led	to	vastly	different	results.	

      In	Sudan,	IFC’s	project	design	was	flexible	to	allow	organic	growth	as	traction	was	achieved	
      (IFC	2010).	However,	the	program	lacked	enough	focus	on	implementation	assistance	and	
      was	ill	suited	to	the	country’s	postconflict	condition.	In	light	of	the	weak	institutional	capacity,	
      less	emphasis	on	areas	of	reform	and	more	attention	to	implementation	assistance	might	
      have	been	a	better	strategy.	

      A	similar	approach	was	applied	successfully	in	South	Sudan.	IFC’s	investment	climate	
      project,	rated	successful	by	IEG,	focused	on	the	creation	and	strengthening	of	critical	
      institutions	and	the	establishment	of	a	basic	legal	framework	rather	than	the	streamlining	
      of	existing	procedures.	IFC’s	approach	in	South	Sudan	was	also	incremental—partly

            BOX 5.2	 Timing	of	Impact	of	Investment	Climate	Reforms

            Part	of	the	literature	and	practice	of	investment	climate	reforms	in	FCS	refers	to	the	
            timing	of	regulatory	reforms.	The	argument	is	that,	regulatory	reforms	being	“low	
            hanging	fruits”	that	are	easy	and	fast	to	implement,	they	produce	results	quickly	and	
            help	motivate	additional	reforms	as	well	as	the	peace-building	process.
            IEG	tested	this	hypothesis	by	estimating	a	regression	discontinuity	model	for	each	of	
            the	interventions	most	commonly	implemented	in	FCS	for	which	intermediate	outcome	
            indicators	exist,	that	is,	regulations	and	trade.a Using	the	outcome	indicators	presented	
            in	Chapter	3,	IEG	tested	whether	two	years	after	project	approval—that	is,	most	likely	
            when	such	reforms	have	been	implemented—the	outcome	indicators	show	a	significant	
            improvement.	
            The	results	for	regulations	show	a	significant	impact	only	for	the	number	of	procedures	
            and	time	to	complete	registration.	In	contrast,	no	outcome	indicator	for	trade	shows	any	
            significant	improvement	just	two	years	after	approval.	This	implies	that	trade	reforms	
            take	more	time	(than	the	average	two	years)	to	produce	measurable	results.

driven	by	lack	of	secured	funding.	Unlike	in	Sudan,	IFC’s	role	in	South	Sudan	made	
major	contributions	in	some	areas	(IEG	2013a).	For	example,	the	project	supported	the	
re-established	business	registry	and	helped	enact	the	Investment	Promotion	Act,	among	
other	regulatory	reforms.	Project	activities	not	only	included	support	to	drafting	the	laws	
but	also	involved	intensive	hands-on	support	through	every	step	of	the	enactment	and	
implementation	process.

      Post-conflict	Liberia	also	faced	capacity	deficits.	However,	the	country	stands	out	as	an	
      example	where	several	positive	factors	contributed	to	largely	successful	investment	climate	
      reforms.	Project	design	was	kept	simple,	and	was	thus	appropriate	to	circumstances	in	a	
      postconflict	country	(IEG	2011c).	Although	the	2011	elections	and	local	capacity	limitations	
      were	an	implementation	constraint,	technical	support	by	the	World	Bank	Group	helped	
      overcome	some	of	these	weaknesses.	For	example,	the	Reengagement	and	Reform	Support	
      Program	II	was	accompanied	by	substantial,	intensive	technical	assistance	for	capacity	
      improvement	by	the	World	Bank	and	other	donors	in	the	areas	covered	by	the	operation.	
      Similarly,	in	Lao	PDR,	the	Bank	was	cognizant	of	severe	local	capacity	limitations	and	
      subsequently	increased	technical	assistance	during	the	progression	of	its	budget	support	
      operations.	

      The	Bank	Group’s	success	in	fragile	situations	such	as	South	Sudan	and	Liberia	highlight	that	
      even	in	a	postconflict	country	with	limited	implementation	capacity,	reform	programs	can	be	
      successful	if,	in	addition	to	conservative	targets,	the	program	is	supported	by	a	critical	mass	of	
      technical	assistance	and	institutional	strengthening	to	make	up	for	local	capacity	shortcomings	
      (IEG	2011b).	

      Government	ownership	is	also	a	vital	success	factor	in	FCS.	In	Liberia	the	government	
      exhibited	strong	ownership	of	the	Reengagement	and	Reform	Support	Program	II.	A	good	
      measure	of	the	government’s	commitment	came	because	the	laws	submitted	to	parliament	
      were	all	passed,	despite	the	divided	nature	of	that	body.	According	to	an	external	evaluation,	
      the	relevance	of	investment	climate	reforms	in	Liberia	is	evident	from	the	participatory	
      approach	and	the	demand-driven	nature	of	many	initiatives	undertaken,	with	detailed	
      requests	for	assistance	directly	formulated	by	the	beneficiaries	and	backed	by	preliminary	
      analyses	and	discussions	(Economisti	Associati	2011).	

      One	key	lesson	of	this	program	is	that	even	in	a	post-conflict	country	with	limited	
      implementation	capacity,	a	reform	program	can	be	successful	if	there	is	genuine	and	strong	
      government	commitment.	In	the	Republic	of	Yemen,	government	commitment	was	a	vital	
      condition	for	the	success	of	IFC’s	Mining	Policy	Reform	and	Investment	Climate	Tax	Projects.	
      Both	projects	experienced	continued	government	ownership	manifested	through	extensive	
      engagement	in	follow-up	activities	(IFC	2008).	

      Ensuring	government	commitment	might	require	having	a	champion	of	reforms.	IFC	did	not	
      have	a	constant	client	within	the	government	of	Nepal,	which	could	consistently	champion	
      the	cause	of	investment	climate	reforms	(IEG	2012).	Although	the	investment	climate	
      reform	project	was	successful	in	setting	up	a	public-private	dialogue	that	was	instrumental	
      in	building	trust	between	the	government	and	the	private	sector,	both	this	dialogue	and	


130   Investment Climate Reforms
the	SEZ	components	were	dependent	on	having	a	stable	counterpart	in	government	and	
a	political	consensus.	However,	three	government	reshuffles	in	three	years	led	to	changes	
in	local	counterparts	(IEG	2012).	IFC	nevertheless	built	a	constituency	for	reforms	through	
a	sustained	communication	campaign	and	took	these	topics	to	the	forefront	of	discussions	
on	PSD	and	investment	climate	reforms.	It	also	adopted	other	means,	such	as	building	
solid	partnerships	and	relationships	with	relevant	line	ministries,	and	leveraging	and	utilizing	
relationships	with	senior	and	mid-level	bureaucrats.	In	the	process,	some	political	economy	
concerns	may	have	been	overlooked,	such	as	political	sensitivities	associated	with	land	
allocation	in	the	SEZ	project.	

Both	government	and	stakeholder	engagement,	therefore,	are	keys	to	ensure	the	success	
of	interventions.	Facilitating	government	ownership	of	reforms	involves	a	careful	assessment	
of	the	political	feasibility	of	the	proposed	interventions,	as	well	as	identification	of	measures	
to	reduce	diminishing	client	interest	in	reforms.	Tools	to	accomplish	this	include	a	consistent	
communication	strategy	to	highlight	the	relevance	and	necessity	of	the	reform	process,	having	
“champions”	within	the	government	to	create	stakeholder	engagement,	and	developing	
strategic	alliances	with	other	World	Bank	Group	projects	to	accommodate	different	client	
interests	in	reforms.

The	fragile	political	economy	has	a	fundamental	bearing	on	the	success	of	investment	
climate	interventions.	In	Nepal,	investment	climate	reforms	immediately	followed	the	end	
of	the	conflict	in	2006.	An	investment	climate	minidiagnostic	noted	that	analyzing	and	
recommending	priority	reform	areas	in	the	investment	climate	are	a	key	to	embarking	on	a	
postconflict	reform	program.	With	increasing	stability,	a	good	investment	climate	becomes	
essential	in	realizing	latent	investment.	Nepal’s	fluctuating	political	economy,	however,	
was	a	tremendous	constraint.	Successive	elections,	the	abolishment	of	the	monarchy,	and	
constitutional	changes	led	to	perpetual	political	uncertainty.	Regardless,	IFC	has	been	
supporting	the	country,	for	example,	by	implementing	the	second	phase	of	the	Nepal	
Investment	Climate	Reform	Program	to	enhance	the	transparency	and	accountability	of	
service	delivery	at	the	Office	of	the	Company	Registrar.

In	the	Republic	of	Yemen,	civil	unrest	disrupted	the	progress	of	several	Bank	Group	projects.	
The	Bank’s	Private	Sector	Growth	and	Social	Protection	Project,	for	example,	was	affected	by	
civil	unrest	in	2011.	Although	the	unrest	caused	significant	disruption	in	the	country,	it	was	not	
unforeseeable	and	the	related	risk	was	not	adequately	addressed	in	the	program’s	design—
which	was	too	ambitious	for	such	a	fragile	situation.	To	counter	political	uncertainties,	the	
project	was	designed	as	a	single	tranche	operation	with	the	option	to	offer	a	programmatic	
series	to	the	new	administration.	However,	this	mitigation	measure	was	ineffective	in	the	
face	of	civil	unrest.	Given	the	systemic	risk	of	political	uncertainty,	Bank	engagement

      through	analytical work	rather	than	lending	might	have	been	more	appropriate,	or	prior	
      actions	that	could	be	accomplished	quickly	but	were	of	an	irreversible	nature	might	have	
      been	preferable.

      In	Guinea	the	World	Bank	Group	suspended	all	engagement	following	the	2008	military	
      coup,	and	IFC’s	mining	sector	technical	assistance	was	forced	to	close	before	the	government	
      could	adopt	any	reform.	The	project	was	found	to	have	an	inadequate	evaluation	of	political	
      risks.	The	Guinea	CASCR	Review	also	noted	that	the	Bank	Group	did	not	appear	to	have	
      a	real	strategy	for	dealing	with	FCS	(IEG	2013b).	Following	Bank	Group	re-engagement	in	
      2011,	IFC	immediately	re-engaged	with	a	regulatory	reform	agenda.	

      In	conclusion,	the	Bank	Group’s	mixed	implementation	record	demonstrates	the	complexity	
      of	achieving	regulatory	reform	in	FCS.	Examples	reviewed	by	IEG	illustrate	the	importance	
      of	properly	assessing	the	political	economy	of	the	country;	properly	tailoring	the	scope,	
      complementarity,	and	timing	of	any	reform	program;	and	properly	gauging	and	supporting	
      the	institutional	and	technical	capacity	to	bring	investment	climate	reforms	to	completion	and	
      thus	support	long-lasting	and	sustained	PSD	and	growth.


      Industry-Specific	Intervention
      IFC’s	agribusiness	and	tourism	investment	climate	projects	are	more	likely	to	be	flagged	for	
      technical	design	issues	and	less	likely	to	be	flagged	for	having	implementation	delays	than	
      World	Bank	investment	climate	projects,	although	implementation	delays	are	the	leading	
      problem	identified	for	IFC	investment	climate	interventions.	World	Bank	projects	are	more	
      likely	to	be	flagged	for	having	too	many	components	and	less	likely	to	be	flagged	for	
      implementation	delays.	For	World	Bank	projects,	M&E	is	the	most	common	problem.

      A	review	of	project	evaluations	suggests	that	three	factors	are	associated	with	success	or	
      failure:	counterpart	commitment,	local	capacity	and	human	resource	quality,	and	project	
      complexity.	For	the	first	two	factors,	greater	commitment	and	better	capacity	(or	explicit	
      attention	to	capacity	building)	appear	to	aid	effectiveness.	For	complexity,	a	larger	number	
      of	“moving	parts”	(components	and	subcomponents)	appears	negatively	related	to	
      success	(see	Box	5.3).	


      World	Bank	Group	Collaboration	and	Results
      Collaboration	and	how	it	occurs	are	not	recorded	formally	in	the	World	Bank	Group.	
      This	explains	why	the	extent	of	collaboration	reported	by	the	two	institutions	is	
      substantially	different.	Of	the	819	projects	reviewed	by	IEG,	44	percent	(147)	of	IFC	
      projects	are	flagged	as	having	collaboration	with	the	World	Bank,	but	only	6	percent	of

   BOX 5.3        Inclusive Growth through a Diversified Agricultural Sector

   In India, the Orissa Socio-Economic Development Loan/Credit II sought to promote
   inclusive growth by diversifying the agriculture sector through strengthened property
   rights, improved income-earning opportunities for forest dwellers, privately led
   agro-industrial growth, withdrawal of the state from commercial activities to create
   space for the private sector, and improvements in the reliability and accessibility of
   electric power.
   IEG found the project to be well designed and found that Bank staff had developed
   excellent working relationships with the client. In spite of low capacity on the counterpart
   side and serious data deficiencies on results, the project appears to have produced
   an expansion in irrigated land under water user group management and an improved
   investment climate (including reduced barriers to entry), which may have contributed to
   accelerated growth led by private industrial investments “with effective environmental
   due diligence.”

World Bank projects report collaboration with IFC, a rate seven times lower than IFC’s
(see Table 5.3).3

The main reason coordination within the World Bank Group is important is that it can
enhance the effectiveness of Bank Group support to clients. Unfortunately, presenting
evidence of such links in practice is difficult because the effectiveness discussion in project

      documents	is	not	generally	linked	to	the	presence	or	absence	of	collaboration.	Nevertheless,	
      in	the	investment	climate	portfolio	33	projects	with	IEG	ratings	were	characterized	as	having	
      some	form	of	coordination.	On	the	basis	of	PCRs	and	Evaluation	Notes,	IEG	classified	such	
      collaboration	in	four	categories	that	denote	an	increasing	level	of	collaboration:	strategy/
      broad	collaboration,	project	funding	business	model,	complementarity	of	institutions	(that	
      is,	IFC	Advisory	Services	complements	a	World	Bank	Development	Policy	Loan	[DPL]),	and	
      joint	design	or	implementation.	IEG	estimated	the	share	of	projects	in	each	category	that	
      has	a	successful	outcome.	As	shown	in	Figure	5.4,	the	higher	the	degree	of	collaboration,	
      the	higher	the	share	of	achievement	of	the	Development	Outcome.	It	must	be	recognized,	
      however,	that	these	findings	are	based	on	a	small	number	of	observations.	

      Given	this	limitation,	IEG	reviewed	projects	with	examples	of	collaboration	to	draw	anecdotal	
      evidence.	A	number	of	investment	climate	projects	led	IEG	to	conclude	that	successful	
      collaboration	rests	on	complementarity:	of	roles,	of	perspectives,	and	of	instruments.


      COMPLEMENTARITY	OF	ROLES

      When	the	roles	of	each	institution	are	clear	and	do	not	overlap,	results	can	be	successful.	
      In	Cambodia’s	Alternative	Dispute	Resolution	Project	IFC	played	an	active	role	in	providing	

134   Investment Climate Reforms
global	knowledge	of	international	best	practices	to	both	the	government	and	the	private	
sector	by	bringing	in	a	lead	legal	counsel	from	the	World	Bank	Group.	He	provided	extensive	
comments	on	the	draft	National	Arbitration	Center	of	Cambodia	subdecree,	led	one	
consultation	session	with	the	private	sector	and	government,	and	met	frequently	with	high-level	
officials	in	the	government	to	advise	them	on	the	major	issues	related	to	the	establishment	of	
the	Center.

In	Serbia,	IFC,	the	World	Bank	Europe	and	Central	Asia	Financial	and	Private	Sector	
Development,	and	the	World	Bank	Institute	collaborated	on	the	Regulatory	Impact	Analysis	
Project.	In	2010	a	Regulatory	Reform	Conference	was	organized	jointly	by	the	government	of	
Serbia,	the	World	Bank,	the	World	Bank	Institute,	IFC,	and	the	Balkan	Center	for	Regulatory	
Reform.	All	parties	had	different	modus operandi,	but	there	was	a	clear	division	of	tasks,	
accompanied	by	continuous	communication	between	task	team	leaders,	especially	before	
endorsing	with	the	client	any	action	and	requirement;	this	guaranteed	full	cooperation	of	all	
the	agencies	and	successful	delivery	of	the	project.	


COMPLEMENTARITY	OF	PERSPECTIVES

A	second	requirement	for	fruitful	collaboration	is	complementarity	of	outlook.	
IFC’s	Philippines	Investment	Promotion	Policies	Project	was	inherently	complex	and	
controversial.	Multiple	World	Bank	Group	players	were	involved,	including	IBRD,	CIC/
FIAS,	MIGA,	and	IFC.	IFC	Private	Enterprise	Partnership’s	field	presence	and	existing	
relationships	with	key	stakeholders	placed	it	naturally	in	the	position	to	manage	
client	relationship	in	day-to-day	operations.	It	provided	funding	to	support	FIAS	work.	
Bank	staff	led	work	on	fiscal	incentives,	with	FIAS	support.	IFC	managed	work	on	
institutional	assessment	with	critical	support	from	MIGA.	IFC	also	led	interventions	
at	the	subnational	level.	Yet	many	members	of	the	project	team	were	working	toward	
different	outcomes.	Team	members	did	not	always	share	the	same	perspective.	Although	
this	was	not	main	factor	behind	the	failure	of	the	project,	it	certainly	detracted	from	
performance.

In	Madagascar	an	IFC	project	on	supporting	Doing	Business	reforms	was	designed	
jointly	with	the	World	Bank	PSD	program.	This	joint	approach	allowed	the	Bank	Group	to	
face	the	client	with	just	one	interface	and	add	depth	and	breadth	to	the	scope	of	reforms	
that	were	already	ongoing	when	this	project	was	launched.	The	project	helped	build	the	
first-ever	comprehensive	inventory	of	business	licenses	in	Madagascar.	Additionally,	it	
	
pioneered	the	roll-out	of	“guillotine”-style	licensing	reform	and	the	application	of	the	standard	
cost	model	methodology	to	estimate	the	cost	to	Malagasy	companies	of	complying	with	the	
licensing	regime.

                    An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	5   135
      COMPLEMENTARITY	OF	INSTRUMENTS

      Finally,	collaboration	will	not	succeed	unless	complementarity	of	instruments	exists.	The	
      different	business	models	of	the	World	Bank	and	IFC	provide	opportunities	to	exploit	the	
      complementarity	of	instruments	and	approaches.	Tunisia	had	more	than	one	PREM-led	
      DPL,	with	collaboration	from	FPD.	However,	IFC	supported	the	government	of	Tunisia	in	
      a	good	proportion	of	reforms	that	triggered	the	disbursement	of	the	budget	support	loan.	
      Regulations,	FDI	policy,	tourism,	debt	management,	and	bankruptcy	were	all	areas	of	
      reform.	As	IFC’s	support	opened	the	doors	to	the	implementation	of	the	DPLs,	the	DPLs	in	
      turn	offered	a	policy	umbrella	to	guide	IFC’s	reform	interventions.

      Bosnia-Herzegovina	is	another	example	where	IFC’s	reform	work	encouraged	the	
      government	and	the	Bank	to	consider	a	DPL.	IFC	had	conducted	a	substantial	amount	
      of	investment	climate	advisory	work	in	the	country	and	was	in	close	dialogue	with	the	
      government	there.	In	light	of	the	progress	in	implementing	many	of	the	IFC	investment	climate	
      recommendations,	a	DPL	focusing	on	the	business	environment	was	developed	to	provide	
      additional	support	for	reforms.	The	investment	climate	team	became	an	integral	part	of	the	
      DPL	Bank	team.	Although	formally	the	task	team	leader	was	Bank	staff	(as	the	system	does	
      not	accommodate	a	coleader),	an	IFC	staff	member	did	act	as	co-task	team	leader.	Bank	
      budget	covered	the	costs	of	both	Bank	and	IFC	staff	working	directly	on	the	DPL,	and	IFC	
      funded	its	own	technical	assistance	activities.	The	Bosnian	government	saw	one	World	Bank	
      Group	team.

      In	contrast,	when	complementarity	of	roles	between	the	two	institutions	is	not	recognized	
      and	the	World	Bank	and	IFC	are	seen	as	providing	similar	services	to	the	clients,	
      collaboration	is	not	achieved	and	“turf”	competition	is	generated.	There	have	been	
      instances	where	staff	and	management	have	questioned	the	legitimacy	of	IFC	working	with	
      governments,	even	for	advisory	services.	Some	see	it	as	intruding	into	a	well-established	
      Bank	space.	Some	see	the	technical	assistance	business	as	a	zero-sum	game.	A	few	see	
      the	Advisory	Services	in	IFC	as	not	being	relevant,	as	it	is	of	narrow	scope	compared	to	the	
      Bank’s	work.

      For	example,	in	a	country	in	South	Asia,	staff	in	the	Bank	reacted	strongly	to	a	request	IFC	
      received	from	the	Ministry	of	Commerce	for	technical	assistance	work.	They	questioned	
      whether	IFC	Advisory	Services	should	be	involved	in	tax	and	trade	regulation.	Questions	were	
      even	raised	about	IFC	working	in	licensing	and	regulatory	reform	and	regarding	whether	IFC	
      should	be	expanding	its	investment	climate	program	in	the	country.	Both	IFC	and	the	Bank	
      had	separate	competent	teams	to	conduct	the	work	requested	by	the	Ministry	of	Commerce.	
      A	compromise	was	finally	reached	by	agreeing	that	IFC	would	focus	on	one	subnational	
      region	in	the	country.

136   Investment Climate Reforms
Similarly,	when	collaboration	is	driven	by	other	factors,	such	as	funding,	positive	results	
cannot	be	expected.	About	three	years	ago,	the	government	of	a	Central	Asian	country	
sent	a	request	for	technical	assistance	for	land	reform	to	donors	and	to	units	in	the	World	
Bank	Group,	including	FPD	and	CIC.	A	CIC	mission	went	to	the	country	to	better	define	
the	technical	assistance	and	signed	an	agreement	with	the	government	to	focus	on	the	land	
registry	and	construction	permits.	As	CIC	did	not	have	the	staff	to	meet	the	government	
timetable,	it	entered	into	an	agreement	with	FPD	to	manage	the	technical	assistance.	
The	reports	and	recommendations	were	made	available	to	FPD,	IFC/investment	climate,	
SDN,	and	others,	for	review	and	to	be	used	as	inputs	in	their	respective	work	program	in	
the	country.	The	government	accepted	the	recommendations	and	requested	assistance	to	
implement	them.

As	of	now,	funding	has	not	materialized	through	either	the	government	(Bank	loan)	or	other	
sources.	According	to	SDN,	because	of	resource	constraints,	funds	are	available	only	for	a	
scoping	mission,	but	not	to	implement	the	recommendations.	So	SDN	is	preparing	to	repeat	
the	scoping	mission	it	undertook	more	than	three	years	ago.	Recommendations	addressing	
the	land	registry	and	construction	permits	have	been	accepted	by	the	government	and	were	
praised	by	Bank	staff—but	have	yet	to	be	implemented.

Finally,	it	is	important	to	recognize	that	collaboration	is	not	a	sufficient	condition	for	
success	in	achieving	development	outcomes.	Other	critical	factors,	such	as	political	
stability	or	the	level	of	commitment	from	the	government,	play	a	crucial	role	in	achieving	
the	development	objectives	of	a	project.	There	are	cases	where	the	collaboration	was	
successful	but	the	results	were	not	(or	vice	versa).	For	example,	in	the	Madagascar	
licensing	simplification	project,	a	political	crisis	brought	the	project	to	a	halt	just	before	the	
first	set	of	reform	recommendations	was	delivered	to	the	client.	In	the	Democratic	Republic	
of	the	Congo,	although	the	government	counterparts	were	verbally	supportive	of	an	IFC/
FIAS	project	on	tax	and	Doing	Business	reforms,	there	was	very	little	follow-up	or	local	
ownership.

Regardless	of	the	coordination	efforts	within	the	World	Bank	Group,	a	clear	commitment	
from	the	government	is	critical	to	having	a	successful	project.	Finally,	in	Bihar	state	(India),	
the	World	Bank	and	IFC	conducted	joint	scoping	activities	and	collaborated	on	some	of	the	
same	initiatives	related	to	investment	climate	reforms.	However,	the	scope	and	goals	of	this	
project	were	not	fully	consistent	with	conditions	on	the	ground.	In	spite	of	the	government	
of	Bihar’s	general	reform-mindedness,	the	government	did	not	have	a	strong	level	of	
commitment	to	the	project.	It	seems	that	the	project’s	scope	was	more	ambitious	than	
the	government	was	willing	or	able	to	embrace	and	that	on-the-ground	elements	such	as	
political	will	and	departmental	capacity	should	have	been	considered	during	the	first	project.	

                    An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	5   137
      Strong government buy-in should have been established prior to initiating implementation.
      Yet the business taxation recommendations were fully incorporated into the Bihar budget
      because it received strong support and a public endorsement from the Deputy Chief Minister
      (who was also the Finance Minister).

      In Mali, government commitment outside of Doing Business indicator reforms was limited
      (IEG 2011a). After the completion of the first phase of investment climate reform, IFC
      sensitized the government to the fact that Doing Business reforms are only the start, and not
      the final stopping point, for reforms. Yet IFC initiated a second phase of investment climate
      reforms with minimal government commitment outside of Doing Business reforms. The
      program assisted in drafting laws and regulations, including the laws to set up and regulate
      industrial zone authorities; it also provided advisory services to various government entities
      over the course of the program (IEG 2014a).


      WORLD BANK GROUP STAFF VIEWS ON BUSINESS MODELS

      As shown in Chapter 1, IFC and the World Bank use two different business models in
      supporting investment climate interventions. The institutions have some differences and
      similarities in their activities, execution, and funding (Box 5.4). To find the views of World
      Bank Group staff on the value of each business model, IEG conducted a survey of staff
      involved in investment climate work4 (Appendix E). The survey addressed issues related to
      the collaboration between and within the Bank Group units. It asked staff whether these two
      business models would foster collaboration, discourage collaboration, or both (for example,
      at times foster and at times discourage collaboration). Interestingly, only a very small share of
      staff (6 percent) perceived the difference between the IFC model and the World Bank model
      as a positive factor fostering collaboration. A significant share, 30 percent, saw them as
      discouraging collaboration.

      Almost 50 percent of staff see the difference in the two models as either an opportunity to
      foster collaboration or an obstacle that hampers collaboration. They do not dismiss the value
      of each business model; rather, they show a much more nuanced perception, saying that
      the differences can both foster and discourage collaboration. Hence, if properly understood
      and implemented, these differences in business models might represent an opportunity for
      collaboration, and impact, in investment climate work.

      Some interesting differences could be noted across units and categories of staff. Staff who
      typically manage projects (grades GF and GG) and staff that are closer to the client (staff
      in country offices) have a much more positive attitude toward the two business models
      than senior staff and staff in headquarters (82 percent and 66 percent, respectively).

   BOX 5.4	 Business	Models	Complementarity—The	Case	of	Development	Policy	Loans

   In	recent	years,	some	joint	Bank-IFC	collaboration	took	place	around	DPLs,	exploiting	
   the	complementarities	presented	in	the	Bank’s	and	IFC’s	business	models.	To	obtain	
   budget	support,	clients	have	to	meet	a	set	of	conditions,	which	generally	include	a	
   set	of	reforms.	For	those	investment	climate-related	reforms,	the	Bank	seems	to	be	
   increasingly	calling	on	IFC	investment	climate	staff	to	support	reforms	in	client	countries.	
   The	fit	seems	to	work	well,	as	the	interventions	of	IFC	investment	climate	tend	to	be	
   focused,	limited	in	scope,	and	delivered	in	a	very	short	period	of	time.	In	most	of	IFC’s	
   interventions	in	DPLs,	IFC	adopts	its	own	business	model,	credits	the	projects	to	its	
   portfolio,	and	avails	itself	of	its	own	funding.	This	was	the	case	in	Tunisia	and	Bosnia-
   Herzegovina,	where	IFC	support	opened	the	door	to	World	Bank	budget	support.
   With	the	events	of	the	Arab	Spring,	there	has	been	an	increase	in	demand	for	
   investment	climate	advisory	work	in	the	Middle	East	and	North	Africa,	resulting	in	
   growth	of	the	project	portfolio	of	both	IFC	and	FPD.	Also,	new	topics	are	gaining	
   attention,	such	as	job	creation	and	women	in	business.
   With	a	growing	portfolio,	there	is	less	concern	about	competition	between	IFC	and	the	
   Bank	and	more	concern	about	the	need	for	collaboration.	The	Bank’s	macro	approach	
   to	investment	climate	reform	is	complemented	by	IFC’s	narrow,	practical,	short-term	
   interventions,	such	as	in	regulatory	reform	and	simplification,	the	development	of	
   an	investment	policy,	or	improving	the	investment	climate	for	a	sector,	for	example,	
   agribusiness	or	tourism.
   The	presence	of	a	collaborative	mindset	among	the	management	team	in	IFC/
   investment	climate	and	FPD	in	the	region,	as	well	as	with	CIC	at	headquarters	gave	
   the	impetus	to	act	on	that	complementarity.	Proximity	(Cairo)	or	co-location	(Rabat)	
   of	field	staff	has	helped	significantly.	Finally,	to	make	the	working	relationship	even	
   closer,	CIC	embedded	a	staff	member	in	FPD	in	the	Middle	East	and	North	Africa	
   Region	at	headquarters.	Whether	in	the	Arab	Republic	of	Egypt,	Lebanon,	Morocco,	
   South	Sudan,	Tunisia,	or	the	Republic	of	Yemen,	the	units	are	involved	jointly	in	a	
   number	of	areas,	including	regulatory	reform	and	simplification,	trade	logistics,	tax,	
   debt	management,	sector	development	(such	as	tourism),	and	bankruptcy.

Further,	the	more	distant	staff	are	from	IFC	mapped	staff,	the	more	the	perception	of	
value	of	the	two	business	models	drops	(Figure	5.5).	This	could	be	explained	by	the	fact	
that	the	more	staff	are	familiar	with	the	IFC	model—as	in	the	case	of	FPD	investment	
climate	staff—the	more	they	appreciate	its	value	and	hence	see	it	as	an	opportunity	for	
collaboration.

      NATURE	OF	COLLABORATION

      Collaboration	can	take	different	forms	and	degrees	of	intensity,	from	merely	exchanging	
      information	all	the	way	to	joint	implementation	of	projects.	In	the	World	Bank	Group	
      the	nature	of	collaboration	can	include	sharing	information	about	the	project	with	
      Bank/IFC	colleagues,	peer	reviewing	and/or	providing	comments	on	the	project	
      documents,	going	on	missions	for	the	project,	designing	the	projects	(that	is,	concept,	
      Project	Appraisal	Document,	Project	Data	Sheet—Technical	Assistance	and	Advisory	
      Services,	or	implementing	projects).

      IEG’s	review	of	25	country	case	study	reveals	that	at	the	strategic	level,	collaboration	among	
      the	institutions	seems	to	be	more	common;	it	is	less	so	at	the	operational	level.	Nepal	
      was	selected	(starting	with	the	FY11	Interim	Strategy	Note)	as	a	pilot	country	to	implement	
      an	enhanced	joint	strategy	to	leverage	IDA	and	IFC	resources	and	realize	synergies.	For	
      the	FY11	Interim	Strategy	Note,	private	sector	consultations	led	by	IFC	in	Kathmandu	
      were	coordinated	with	the	Bank	team	and	IFC	advised	on	the	joint	donor	consultation	
      agenda.	The	Bank	and	IFC	had	joint	offices,	and	staff	and	worked	closely	on	issues	such	
      as	e-payments, infrastructure,	hydropower,	and	business	enabling	environment.	On	an

intervention level, IFC and the World Bank were coordinated in implementing an investment
climate strategy.

Similarly, both IFC and the World Bank have demonstrated harmony and integration in their
work on regulatory reforms in Rwanda. One project was designed as a joint project; however,
all other projects have been designed and implemented in close collaboration with existing
projects to maximize the comparative advantage offered by both IFC and the World Bank. In
Colombia, there was a strategic level coordination, but it is hard to say whether the collaboration
among the World Bank Group members was based on respective comparative advantages.

In its survey, IEG also asked Bank Group staff the degree of collaboration they have
experienced. The results are shown in Figure 5.6, with the degree of intensity increasing in a
clockwise direction.5 Survey results show, not surprisingly, that lighter collaboration is more
frequent than deeper collaboration. Overall, half the time collaboration involves simple
activities such as information sharing and peer reviewing. Only one-third of the time is
collaboration deep enough to involve design and implementation of projects.

Headquarters staff are 20 percent more likely to be involved in any type of collaboration than
field staff. This is understandable, as most of them play a formal or informal anchor role. They
also are substantially more involved in deeper forms of collaboration, such as going on joint
missions, joint design of programs and projects, and joint project implementation. In contrast,
field staff report a higher rate of sharing information than headquarters staff, perhaps
because of increased colocation of field offices. These results fit in with the respective roles
and situations of headquarters and field staff.

          BOX 5.5	 Donors’	Support	to	Investment	Climate

          The	investment	climate	program	received	a	significant	amount	of	financial	support	from	
          a	number	of	donors.	Overall,	since	FY07,	60	percent	of	the	financial	cost	of	investment	
          climate	operations	managed	by	FIAS	has	been	sponsored	by	donors.	Only	2	percent	
          of	such	cost	has	been	contributed	by	the	client	countries	and	the	remaining	38	percent	
          has	been	sponsored	by	the	World	Bank.	Main	donors	include	Austria,	the	Netherlands,	
          Norway,	Switzerland,	Sweden,	the	United	States,	and	the	United	Kingdom	(see	figure	
          below).	Another	seven	bilateral	donors	and	a	number	of	multilateral	donors	(for	
          example,	the	European	Union,	Trade	Mark	East	Africa,	and	so	forth)	support	the	FIAS

          IEG	interviewed	seven	donors	to	gather	their	feedback	on	their	relationship	with	FIAS	
          on	investment	climate	projects.
          All	interviewed	donors	expressed	their	satisfaction	in	working	with	FIAS.	They	all	
          appreciated	the	quality	of	work	and	expertise	in	the	field	(a	number	of	donors	pointed	
          out	that	IFC	is	the	only	place	in	the	word	where	so	many	experts	can	be	found	working	
          exclusively	on	the	regulatory	environment),	their	cost	effectiveness	in	implementing	
          reforms,	their	good	access	to	government	officials,	and	their	good	M&E	system.	One	
          donor	also	appreciated	the	integrated	approach	across	the	whole	World	Bank	Group	
          (IFC,	World	Bank,	and	MIGA).
          Donors	also	appreciate	FIAS’s	level	of	commitment,	their	ability	to	participate	in	FIAS’s	
          strategy	design,	the	constant	consultation	process,	and	the	feedback	they	receive	
          regularly.	At	times,	though,	they	have	experienced	long	delays	in	receiving	feedback,	
          especially	when	there	is	difference	of	opinions.
          They	decided	to	sponsor	investment	climate	work	because	they	share	the	strategic	goal	
          of	helping	PSD	through	the	improvement	of	the	regulatory	environment.	When	their	
          contribution	decreased	over	time,	they	attributed	that	to	either	their	own	budgetary	


142   Investment Climate Reforms
CONTINUED      BOX 5.5	 Donors’	Support	to	Investment	Climate

constraints	or	their	own	portfolio	reorganization,	not	to	lack	of	satisfaction	with	the	
collaboration	with	FIAS.
All	donors	appreciate	the	M&E	system	developed	by	FIAS	and	acknowledge	that	
it	has	improved	over	time,	moving	from	measuring	of	number	of	reforms	to	cost	
compliance	savings,	investment,	and	number	of	firms	registered.	In	terms	of	impact,	
though,	they	recognize	that	this	is	hard	to	measure	and	that	the	methods	used	need	to	
be	improved.	Similarly,	they	pointed	out	that	the	impact	on	the	poor	is	not	measured.	
More	specifically,	improvements	should	be	made	in	measuring	who	is	benefitting	from	
the	regulatory	reforms.	This	is	important	for	them,	as	they	will	be	able	to	report	to	their	
Ministers	and	Parliamentarians	answers	on	impact.
In	terms	of	implementation,	some	donors	pointed	out	that	the	World	Bank	Group	
should	focus	more	on	the	political	economy	of	reforms,	as	this	is	key	to	ownership	and	
sustainability	of	investment	climate	reforms.
One	other	aspect	that	should	be	taken	into	account	is	pricing	policy.	Some	donors	pointed	
out	that,	at	times,	finalizing	a	financial	(cash)	contribution	for	advisory	services	can	require	
a	long,	complex	approval	process	including	legislative	action.	Where	these	contributions	
are	relatively	nominal	in	size,	there	is	a	trade-off	between	the	possibility	of	an	extended	
delay	(and	missing	a	potential	reform	window)	and	the	concrete	demonstration	of	buy-in	
for	the	project.	Consequently	some	flexibility	in	the	application	of	the	pricing	policy	should	
be	considered	as	long	as	there	are	other	strong	signals	of	client	commitment	(such	as	in-
kind	contributions,	demonstration	of	acting	on	quick-win	recommendations,	and	so	forth).
Another	problem	raised	by	some	donors	is	the	issue	of	branding,	that	is,	receiving	
enough	credit	for	the	financial	support	provided.	At	times	they	are	not	satisfied	with	the	
acknowledgment	they	receive.
In	terms	of	interventions,	some	donors	pointed	out	that	the	set	of	areas	offered	is	not	
comprehensive.	For	instance,	environmental	regulations	are	not	properly	addressed,	in	
the	health	sector,	demand	is	much	higher	than	supply,	and	agriculture	interventions	are	
few	and	not	focused.	Finally,	some	products	might	be	obsolete	(for	example,	entry)	and	
hence	could	be	discontinued.
Other	donors	mentioned	that	occasionally	the	diagnostic	work	done	to	identify	reforms	
is	driven	more	by	availability	of	IFC	expertise	than	by	the	situation	on	the	ground,	and	
IFC	should	more	often	take	into	account	the	limited	capacity	of	recipients	(as	to	ensure	
sustainability	of	reforms).
One	donor	familiar	with	the	reorganization	process	said	that	FIAS	is	a	good	example	of	
cooperation	and	that	the	key	to	success	is	the	having	exceptional	leadership.

                     An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	5   143
          BOX 5.6	 Findings	from	the	Field:	World	Bank	and	IFC—Strengths	and	Weaknesses

          Interviews	with	different	stakeholders	in	Bangladesh,	Cambodia,	Kenya,	and	
          Rwanda	confirmed	some	unique	qualities	of	the	World	Bank	and	IFC.	Stakeholders	
          highly	appreciated	IFC’s	access	to	international	technical	expertise,	timeliness,	and	
          pragmatism,	as	well	as	flexibility.	Access	to	government	institutions	and	ability	to	provide	
          substantive	funding	were	the	most	common	strengths	identified	of	the	World	Bank.	
          World	Bank	staff	have	a	broader	view	on	investment	climate	reforms,	whereas	IFC	staff	
          are	much	more	focused	on	implementation.
          In	Bangladesh	and	Kenya,	some	stakeholders	indicated	that	IFC’s	ability	to	handle	
          political	economy	was	not	as	strong	as	its	technical	capacity.	One	respondent	pointed	
          out,	“Political	economy	is	out	of	IFC’s	comfort	zone.”	The	World	Bank	is	seen	as	slow	
          to	respond	and	implement	projects.	Some	stakeholders	indicated	that	the	World	Bank	
          requires	too	much	documentation.	One	stakeholder	reported	that	after	two	years,	
          “We	are	still	exchanging	documents	with	the	World	Bank.”

      Compared	to	other	regions,	staff	in	Sub-Saharan	Africa	and	Latin	America	and	the	
      Caribbean	report	a	higher	degree	of	deep	collaboration	than	other	regions,	including	going	
      on	joint	missions	and	collaborative	design	and	implementation	of	programs	and	projects.	In	
      Africa,	there	has	been	a	long	history	of	collaboration	between	the	Bank	and	IFC	because	of	
      the	well-funded	and	large	IFC	Investment	Climate	Business	Line	presence	in	the	region.	The	
      Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	Region	benefits	from	a	“unitary”	Bank/IFC	management	
      (Box	5.7).	


      Factors	Affecting	Collaboration	between	the	World	Bank	and	IFC
      In	identifying	the	factors	that	play	a	role	in	fostering	collaboration,	IEG	compiled	a	list	of	15	
      factors	and	included	them	in	the	staff	survey.	They	are	grouped	in	three	categories:	role	of	the	
      unit	and	its	strategy,	systems	or	formal	organization,	and	informal	organization	(Table	5.4).	
      For	each	factor,	the	survey	asked	the	respondent	whether	a	factor	strictly	discourages	
      or	fosters	collaboration,	or	both	(that	is,	in	some	cases	have	fostered	and	in	others	have	
      discouraged	collaboration).	

      The	survey	results	first	point	out	the	primary	role	of	informal	factors	in	fostering	collaboration	
      (Figure	5.7).	Fifty-eight	respondents	identified	informal	factors	as	playing	a	key	role	
      in	facilitating	collaboration	between	the	two	institutions.	However,	systems	and	formal	
      organization—such	as	different	pricing	policy,	accountability	matrix,	M&E	framework,

              Collaboration—Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	as	a	Recent	Pilot

   As	part	of	the	reorganization	of	FPD	in	FY11,	joint	management	for	investment	climate	
   was	established	in	the	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	Region,	with	one	person	
   covering	the	positions	of	Director	of	FPD	Investment	Climate	Global	Practice	and	FPD	
   for	the	region	and	co-Director	of	CIC.	Since	FY13,	the	IFC	investment	climate	service	
   line	and	FPD	for	the	region	have	established	a	strong	collaborative	working	relationship,	
   with	the	idea	of	using	the	complementarity	of	IFC	and	World	Bank	strengths	for	a	
   greater	impact	to	clients.	The	IFC	investment	climate	service	line	and	FPD	for	the	region	
   have	developed	and	will	implement	the	first-of-a-kind	tripartite	(donors,	IFC,	and	the	
   Bank)	multidonor	program.	The	program	responds	to	priorities	expressed	by	client	
   governments	in	more	than	10	countries	in	the	region	and	follows	a	joint	IFC-World	
   Bank	results	framework.	The	joint	fundraising	effort	attempted	to	leverage	external	and	
   internal	partnerships,	and	to	create	a	platform	for	setting	common	goals	for	the	region.
   For	that,	a	jointly	conceptualized	proposal	on	a	regional	investment	program	for	the	region	
   was	designed	between	IFC	region	staff,	CIC,	FPD	region	staff,	and	PREM	tax	teams	and	
   was	presented	to	the	Canadian	International	Development	Agency	and	the	Swiss	State	
   Secretariat	for	Economic	Affairs.	The	legal	agreement,	work	plans,	and	M&E	framework	
   were	also	jointly	prepared	for	the	donors.	The	teams	worked	extensively	to	make	sure	that	
   work	streams	were	coordinated	and	complimentary.	Such	coordination	helped	improve	
   discussions	and	communications	not	only	with	the	clients,	but	also	with	donors.
   In	support	of	that	joint	management	and	program,	the	region	has	developed	a	set	of	
   joint—Bank	and	IFC—accountability	matrices	for	the	region.	The	matrices—necessary	
   for	that	high	level	of	collaboration—were	not	easy	to	design,	develop,	or	use,	as	they	
   had	to	be	built	on	top	of	two	not	entirely	compatible	systems.
   The	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	Region	is	an	example	where	synergies	between	
   the	Bank	and	IFC	have	enabled	better	client	management,	more	joint	project	
   development,	with	more	readily	available	global	expertise	and	solutions	to	clients,	
   though	at	a	high	administrative	cost.

donor	reporting,	and	human	resources	policies	and	staff	incentives—are	on	average	
seen	as	discouraging	collaboration.	Finally,	factors	related	to	roles	and	strategy	can	foster	
collaboration	if	properly	handled.	

Personal	networks,	previous	experience,	and	physical	proximity	play	a	key	role	in	fostering	
collaboration.	This	is	the	case	across	all	regions	and	networks.	At	the	same	time,	staff	identify

      on fostering collaboration, especially in the Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe
      and Central Asia Regions. IEG’s Bangladesh field study confirms that World Bank Group
      coordination is mostly informal and based on needs. The World Bank and IFC are coming
      together on the Country Assistance Strategy, the Doing Business reports, investment climate
      surveys, and the occasion of visits by senior Bank Group management. No formal process
      brings the staff together regularly.

      In Kenya local staff stated that their country office was an example of where investment
      climate coordination has worked well. Many indicated that collaboration starts at the personal
      level and has been improving over time. However, some suggested that jointness should be

an	integrated	solution	and	will	not	be	achieved	without	adjusting	managerial	structures	and	
staff	incentives.

Among	formal	organizational	factors,	the	different	pricing	policies	and	accountability	matrices	
strictly	discourage	collaboration,	with	little	opportunity	to	exert	a	positive	role.	This	finding	is	
valid	across	all	networks.	At	the	same	time,	presence	in	the	field	is	the	most	important	factor	
fostering	collaboration	across	all	networks,	whereas	project	funding	is	perceived	as	the	factor	
that	most	discourages	collaboration.

Finally,	the	aspects	of	roles	and	strategy	have	shown	mixed	effects,	at	times	fostering	
collaboration	and	at	times	discouraging	it.	Having	the	same	client	is	seen	more	as	fostering	
collaboration	by	IFC	Investment	Climate	and	CIC,	but	much	less	so	by	FPD	Investment	
Climate	(where	it	is	seen	at	best	as	showing	mixed	results).	Similar	results	are	seen	for	
complementarity	of	instruments.	However,	in	the	Africa	and	East	Asia	and	Pacific	Regions,	
strategies	and	priorities	are	perceived	as	much	more	aligned	and	as	fostering	collaboration.


WORLD	BANK	GROUP	STAFF	VIEWS	ON	THE	NEW	TRADE	AND	COMPETITIVENESS	
GLOBAL	PRACTICE

Beginning in July 2014, all the investment climate units are going to operate under the T&C
Global	Practice.	This	practice	will	be	the	most	integrated	practice	in	the	new	World	Bank	
Group	structure.	IEG	interviews	with	Bank	Group	investment	climate	management	and	

                             An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	5   147
      staff	and	surveys	with	staff	provide	some	insights	on	how	to	optimize	value	to	clients	with	
      the	merger.

      Most	staff	provided	positive	feedback,	highlighting	the	complementarity	and	strengths	of	the	
      Bank	and	IFC	business	models,	such	as,	“We	should	learn	from	one	another	on	the	basis	of	
      facts	and	not	rumors”	and	“IFC	has	a	deep	definition	of	products.	[The]	Bank	has	flexibility	
      and	wider	knowledge.	This	should	expand	our	engagement	with	clients.”	

      However,	some	expressions	of	concern	exist.	In	particular,	one	is	the	worry	that	the	T&C	
      Global	Practice	will	be	dominated	by	one	institution	and	its	business	model.	One	staff	
      member	reported,	“My	worry	is	if	investment	climate	advisory,	as	it	is	known	in	IFC,	
      disappears,	the	perception	within	IFC	might	be	that	‘investment	climate	is	going	to	Bank.’”	
      Another	staff	member	pointed	out,	“I	expect	that	T&C	will	be	Bank	based,	with	a	nice	
      touch	of	IFC	style.”

      The	other	fear	is	that	the	Global	Practices	will	become	silos.	“In	T&C,	PREM	Trade	is	macro;	
      IFC-investment	climate	is	micro.	FPD-investment	climate	sits	in	the	middle.	How	can	we	
      reconcile	them?”	asked	one	staff	member.	These	expressions	indicate	the	concern	that	the	
      reorganization	cannot	be	a	simple	juxtaposition	of	current	systems	and	programs	under	
      one	roof.

      From	an	operational	perspective,	many	staff	hope	that	serious	attempts	will	be	made	to	
      remove	impediments	to	collaboration	that	are	found	in	the	formal	organization,	for	example,	
      governance	and	accountability	systems,	funding,	pricing,	and	human	resource	policies	and	
      systems.	The	need	for	such	reforms	has	been	raised	repeatedly	in	interviews	and	confirmed	
      by	the	surveys.	“I	hope	the	final	design	[of	T&C]	will	not	keep	parallel	tracks,	but	will	integrate	
      from	the	staff,	responsibilities	and	systems,	even	if	time	is	needed	to	integrate	systems,”	said	
      one	staff	member.

      Some	staff	provided	concrete	suggestions	to	improve	formal	collaboration,	such	as	
      implementing	a	multipractice	budget	system	to	mitigate	the	silo	syndrome.	“We	need	a	
      multipractice	budget	code	system	on	the	Bank	side,”	one	staff	member	said,	and	the	adoption	
      of	a	dual	sign-off	system	[region-anchor]	in	the	World	Bank.	Today	the	systems	do	not	require	
      it,	making	“region-technical	collaboration	personal,	ad	hoc	in	the	Bank,”	as	another	staff	
      member	noted.

      Some	staff	highlighted	the	importance	of	the	incentive	system:	“It	is	less	important	to	put	
      boundaries	on	perfect	boxes	than	to	provide	incentives	to	collaborate	and	connect.”	Finally,	
      as	the	composition	of	the	portfolio	has	shown,	a	number	of	investment	climate	reforms	will	
      be	undertaken	in	the	future	by	sector	Global	Practices	as	well	as	Cross-Cutting	Solution	Areas.	


148   Investment Climate Reforms
Consequently	staff	and	leadership	should	encourage	cross-institutional	collaboration	
in	this	area.

In	sum,	this	chapter	presents	evidence	that	aspects	of	project	design	such	as	simpler	project	
design,	good	supervision,	and	good	risk	assessment	can	reduce	or	eliminate	the	negative	
effects	of	most	implementation	problems.	However,	inadequate	technical	design	cannot	
be	compensated	by	any	good	aspects	of	project	design	and	hence	most	likely	leads	to	
unsatisfactory	performance.	Furthermore,	political	instability	is	one	of	the	main	problems	
affecting	the	effectiveness	of	investment	climate	reforms.

Collaboration	within	the	World	Bank	Group	is	mostly	driven	by	informal	factors.	Systems	and	
formal	organization	are	seen	as	mostly	discouraging	collaboration	and	can	pose	significant	
challenges	to	the	new	global	practice.	Hence,	although	not	easy	to	achieve,	it	is	important	to	
harmonize	the	back	office	functions	of	the	global	practice	while	maintaining	the	richness	of	
the	two	delivery	models.

150   Investment Climate Reforms
6   Recommendations	



                  HIGHLIGHTS
                  •	The	World	Bank	Group	has	supported	a	comprehensive	menu	
                    of	investment	climate	reforms.	These	reforms	were	generally	
                    supported	in	the	right	countries	and	generally	addressed	the	
                    right	interventions.	Diagnostic	reports	help	design	investment	
                    climate	interventions,	but	their	coverage	is	incomplete.

                  •	Within	the	limits	of	available	indicators,	the	World	Bank	Group	
                    was	successful	in	improving	the	investment	climate.	However,	
                    success	is	mainly	measured	by	number	of	laws	enacted,	
                    streamlining	of	processes	and	time,	or	simplistic	cost	saving	
                    for	private	firms.	Impact	on	investment,	jobs,	formation,	and	
                    growth	is	not	clear.

                  •	Political	instability	remains	one	of	the	main	factors	hampering	
                    the	effectiveness	of	investment	climate	reforms.	Further,	the	
                    social	value	of	regulatory	reform	is	not	properly	identified,	
                    measured,	or	reflected	in	design.

                  •	The	two	institutions	adopt	two	distinct	business	models	with	
                    their	own	characteristics	and	complementarities.	Coordination	
                    among	the	World	Bank	Group	staff	involved	in	investment	
                    climate	reforms	is	higher	than	for	the	rest	of	the	Bank	Group	
                    but	is	mostly	informal,	relying	mainly	on	personal	contacts.




     An	Independent	Evaluation	of	World	Bank	Group	Support	to	Reforms	of	Business	Regulations	 |	 Chapter	6   151
      Investment	climate	reform	as	defined	in	this	evaluation	is	the	support	of	policy,	legal,	and	
      institutional	reforms	intended	to	improve	the	functioning	of	markets	and	reduce	transaction	
      costs	and	risks	associated	with	starting,	operating,	and	closing	a	business	in	the	World	Bank	
      Group’s	client	countries.	Improving	the	investment	climate	has	been	and	remains	a	key	
      objective	of	countries	in	their	pursuit	of	economic	growth	through	PSD.

      This	evaluation	assessed	the	extent	to	which	the	World	Bank	Group	has	achieved	the	goal	of	
      helping	its	client	countries	improve	the	investment	climate	while	taking	into	account	the	impact	
      on	different	stakeholders	in	society.	IEG	looked	at	three	main	aspects	of	the	Bank	Group	
      activities:	relevance,	effectiveness,	and	social	value	of	regulatory	reforms.

      IEG’s	overall	conclusion	is	that,	within	the	limits	of	available	measures	of	outcomes,	the	World	
      Bank	Group	has	been	successful	in	improving	the	investment	climate	as	available	measures	
      capture	it.	However,	success	is	mainly	measured	by	number	of	laws	enacted,	streamlining	
      of	processes	and	time,	or	compliance	cost	savings	of	private	firms.	Broader	impact	on	
      investment,	job	formation,	and	growth	is	still	not	clear.	Neither	is	the	overall	effect	of	these	
      solutions	when	taking	a	holistic	country-level	view.	Further,	the	social	purpose	of	regulation	
      and	therefore	the	social	impact	of	regulatory	reform	is	not	properly	identified	and	measured.

      The	business	models	of	the	World	Bank	and	IFC	each	have	unique	characteristics	and	
      advantages	that	must	be	nurtured.	Coordination	within	the	World	Bank	Group	on	the	
      investment	climate	agenda	is	greater	than	for	the	rest	of	the	Bank	Group	but	is	mostly	
      informal,	relying	mostly	on	personal	contacts.


      Relevance
      Relevance	was	assessed	from	three	different	perspectives:	strategy,	interventions,	and	
      diagnostic	tools.	At	the	corporate	level,	as	well	as	in	a	number	of	sectors,	improving	the	
      business	climate	is	seen	as	a	key	to	stimulating	private	sector	investment.	At	the	country	level,	
      nearly	all	World	Bank	Group	country	partnership	and	assistance	strategies	identify	enhancing	
      the	business	environment	as	a	main	objective	to	foster	PSD.	However,	although	Bank	
      Group	country	strategies	put	a	significant	emphasis	on	improving	the	business	environment,	
      countries’	own	development	strategies	put	much	less	emphasis	on	enhancing	the	investment	
      climate.	Only	a	few	counties	emphasized	its	role	in	their	vision.

      To	establish	whether	the	World	Bank	Group	is	offering	a	comprehensive	set	of	regulatory	
      reforms	to	its	client	countries,	IEG	constructed	a	comprehensive	list	of	business	regulations	
      by	reviewing	the	law	library	compiled	by	the	Doing	Business	program	in	the	eight	countries	
      that	have	the	best	regulatory	environment.	IEG	classified	the	key	regulatory	areas	covered.	
      By	matching	the	Bank	Group	intervention	to	this	comprehensive	compendium,	IEG	was	

152   Investment Climate Reforms
able to establish that the Bank Group is indeed offering a comprehensive list of regulatory
reforms to its clients. The mapping exercise provides evidence that, generally, World Bank
Group interventions support relevant areas; that is, they cover the full set of regulations of
a hypothetical country with a business-friendly regulatory environment. Using data from the
Bank’s Enterprise Survey, IEG was able to establish that the World Bank Group generally
supports the reforms most needed by client countries and generally supports regulatory
interventions in those countries that need them most.

Over the years a number of diagnostic tools have been used to design investment climate
interventions. Recently new tools have been developed for specific areas of the regulatory
environment. These tools cover in detail individual areas of the regulatory environment,
but there is no comprehensive tool that allows an assessment of all regulatory aspects in
client countries. Even for the analytical relevance of the most common diagnostic tools
used to determine regulatory reforms—the Doing Business indicators and Enterprise Survey
data—IEG presented evidence that they are incomplete; that is, they do not cover all areas
of regulation as identified in the best practice list of regulations referred to earlier. Doing
Business and the Enterprise Surveys cover only some areas—such as business registration,
taxation, and trade—where most of the World Bank Group activities take place. Hence,
although these diagnostic tools are often relied on to inform country strategies, they are used
less frequently to design investment climate projects, even less so in IFC.

Recommendation—Expand the coverage of current diagnostic tools and integrate them
to produce comparable indicators to capture the areas of the business environment not yet
covered by existing tools.


Social Value
Regulatory reform should consider its impact on society as a whole, not just on businesses.
The World Bank's focus on poverty elimination and shared prosperity implies that regulatory
reform must be understood in the context of broader social values, including protection of the
poor and vulnerable. Yet social value is not explicitly defined in any of the World Bank Group
projects IEG has looked at. Without some definition of social value it is difficult to establish
whether particular reforms have generated any particular benefits (or losses), or to identify
the specific social groups that have benefitted or suffered as a result of reform. Furthermore,
the absence of an explicit definition of social value encourages a reliance on customary
approaches.

The Bank Group impact indicators include measures of aggregate cost savings for
businesses or increases in private sector investment. Separate measures are needed to
capture a wider range of sought-after benefits and potentially foregone benefits if existing

                    An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Chapter 6   153
      regulations	are	changed.	Some	groups	may	benefit	from	regulatory	reform,	but	other	groups	
      may	become	further	marginalized	or	impoverished	with	regard	to	incomes;	employment;	
      access	to	goods,	services,	and	infrastructure;	or	other	indicators.	An	adequate	set	of	social	
      value	indicators	must	attempt	to	capture	this	variety	of	experience.	Social	return	frameworks	
      suggest	that	projects	should	identify	relevant	stakeholders;	an	exclusive	focus	on	businesses	
      is	too	narrow.	Nonbusiness	stakeholders	need	to	be	incorporated	within	any evaluation	of	
      regulatory	reform.

       Recommendation— Develop	a	differentiated	approach	to	identify	the	social	effects	of	
      regulatory	reforms	on	all	groups	expected	to	be	affected	beyond	the	business	community.	
      The	approach	should	identify	which	groups	are	expected	to	be	affected	by	the	regulatory	
      reform(s)	within	and	beyond	the	business	community,	in	order	to	ensure	that	reforms	“do	no	
      harm”	to	people	and	the	environment.	The	assessment	should	be	differentiated	depending	
      on	the	expected	impact	of	the	regulatory	reform(s)	and	may	include	qualitative	or	quantitative	
      methods.	The	approach	should	be	employed	both	ex	ante	(during	the	design	of	the	project)	
      as	well	as	ex	post	(to	assess	the	achieved	impact	of	the	reform).	Such	an	approach	should	
      help	better	estimate	the	political	economy	risk	associated	with	the	reform,	to	identify	potential	
      groups	that	would	sustain	or	oppose	reforms	and	the	extent	of	such	support	or	opposition.	
      The	World	Bank	Group	may	also	consider	developing	client	capacity	to	conduct	social	value	
      assessment	to	enable	sustainability	of	investment	climate	reforms.	


      Coordination	across the	World	Bank	Group
      The	World	Bank	and	IFC	work	in	the	same	space	and	with	the	same	clients	through	two	
      distinct	business	models.	The	IFC	business	model	is	implemented	through	stand-alone	
      advisory	services.	Projects	are	standardized,	focused,	and	short	term	and	include	rapid	
      interventions.	They	are	mostly	funded	through	internal	budget	and	trust	funds.	The	World	
      Bank	business	model	is	implemented	through	lending	and	budget	support	and	to	a	lesser	
      extent	through	technical	assistance.	Projects	are	broader	in	scope	and	tend	to	be	more	long	
      term.	The	client	or	the	Bank	executes	the	project.

      Each	model	has	unique	features,	and	stakeholders	appreciate	their	differences.	
      Stakeholders	interviewed	across	countries	often	appreciated	IFC’s	international	technical	
      expertise,	quick	response	and	delivery,	and	close	support.	However,	IFC’s	ability	to	handle	
      the	political	economy	was	not	as	strong,	nor	was	its	ability	to	move	beyond	standardized	
      products.	The	World	Bank’s	main	strength	is	the	institutional	access	to	government	
      institutions,	its	comprehensive	services,	and	its	ability	to	provide	substantive	funding.	Yet	
      there	was	a	common	sense	that	the	World	Bank	is	slow	to	respond	and	to	implement	
      projects.

154   Investment Climate Reforms
IEG’s	interviews	with	World	Bank	Group	management	and	staff	surveys	indicated	that	there	
is	collaboration	among	the	institutions	to	varying	degrees.	Survey	results	show	that	simple	
activities	such	as	information	sharing	are	more	frequent	than	formal	engagements.	Different	
systems	and	organizational	structures	are	perceived	as	the	main	bottlenecks	to	collaboration.	
The	interviews	with	investment	climate	management	and	staff	indicate	that	staff	have	a	
positive	perception	of	complementarity	and	strengths	of	the	institutions	with	the	new	T&C	
Global	Practice;	however,	some	concerns	exist	regarding	the	dominance	of	one	institution	
model	over	the	other	one.

Recommendation—Ensure	that	the	Bank	Group	takes	advantage	of	the	complementarity

Appendix A
Methodology


The appendix includes the project portfolio selection and country case methodologies.

To identify potential projects, the IEG evaluation team adopted two approaches: (i) using
Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) theme codes and (ii) using a keyword search.


OPCS Theme Code Approach
The OPCS theme code approach identified projects having “theme codes” relevant to
Investment Climate. A list of these codes, made in consultation with the Finance and Private
Sector Development (FPD) portfolio team, is as follows (from the OPCS website):

28 Tax Policy and Administration

31 Access to Law and Justice

34 Legal Institutions for a Market Economy

36 Personal and Property Rights

40 Regulation and Competition Policy

47 Regional Integration

49 Trade Facilitation and Market Access

66 Education for the Knowledge Economy

75 Rural Markets

77 Rural Policies and Institutions

The team identified projects that charged 20 percent or more volume of commitment to one or
more of these ten theme codes. This approach identified 1,098 projects (647 closed, 451 active)
out of the universe of 4,714 Bank projects approved since FY07. IEG reviewed Project Appraisal
Documents for these projects to identify any components related to investment climate.1

      Keyword Search Approach
      World Bank projects do not have a flag for investment climate projects. Therefore, as a
      first step, the team created a comprehensive list of investment climate–relevant keywords
      to encompass the portion of the investment climate universe where the Bank had projects.
      Then, as a second step, the team identified potential projects by searching project approval
      and completion documents with the aforementioned keywords. In this second step, the team
      reviewed projects individually for their investment climate context, and interventions were
      characterized for the investment climate content.

      The comprehensive list of investment climate–relevant keywords started with looking for
      “investment climate” in available World Bank analytical documents. This led to a set of 2,031
      documents, which were sorted by date and filtered to capture World Bank activity over the last
      12 years,2 the most relevant period for the purpose of the research. This reduced the number
      of documents to 1,924. Documents outside the scope of this exercise were then dropped,
      bringing the number of documents to 733 reports comprising 108 Investment Climate
      Assessments, 433 working papers, 138 policy research working papers, and 54 Country
      Economic Memoranda.

      Within each document, concepts associated with investment climate were listed and
      categorized. This conceptualization effort ultimately led to the engineering of a group of
      categories linked to the broad concept of investment climate. Initially, 91 categories were
      identified; this number was later aggregated into 29 broad categories (see Table A.1).

      These identified keywords were matched to project objectives and components text by running
      a search queries on all available Project Appraisal Documents3 using AtlasTi software and
      also by scanning Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Implementation Completion and
      Results Report Review databases. Adding these two queries resulted in a portfolio of 1,374
      closed and 1,196 active projects.

      The evaluation team reviewed the combined lists of closed and active projects derived
      from the approaches described above project by project, keeping in mind the scope of
      the evaluation. The final portfolio of World Bank projects with investment climate activities
      relevant to this evaluation stood at 327 closed and 149 active project (Table A.2).


      Methodology for IFC Projects
      For the International Finance Corporation (IFC), identification of the investment climate
      portfolio was straightforward because of the existence of an Investment Climate Business Line.
      The IEG team obtained a list of all IFC Advisory Services projects from MIS (management
      information system) and filtered for projects within the investment climate business line that
      were approved during or after FY07. Projects that were classified as non-client-facing were
      then filtered out. This resulted in a list of 343 projects in the IFC portfolio (Table A.3).


      Methodology for Country Cases
      The selection of 25 country case studies is based on the in-depth portfolio analysis and based
      on the following criteria: (i) stratified purposeful sampling by region, income and fragility;
      (ii) volume of operations; and (iii) types of instruments. The sample include 4 field based
      country cases among the 25 countries identified for the in-depth assessment (see Table A.4).

162   Investment Climate Reforms
Appendix B
Portfolio Description of World Bank Group Support
to Investment Climate Reforms


IEG’s portfolio review identified 819 investment climate reform projects, of which 343 are IFC
Advisory Services approved between FY07 and FY13 and 476 are World Bank lending.

For projects approved between FY07 and FY13, World Bank Group support to investment
climate reforms has been an average of approximately $50 million for IFC and $475 million
for the World Bank, excluding sector-specific interventions (sector-specific regulations increase
World Bank lending commitments by $2.6 billion over this period).

Overall, although the number of approved projects declined between 2007 and 2013 from
144 to 81 projects, there was a year over year increase of 6 percent in 2011–12 and 21 percent
in 2012–13. However, though project commitments averaged $1.1 billion for projects approved
between FY07 and FY10, they dropped to an average of $664 million between FY11 and FY13
(an approximately 50 percent difference between 2007 and 2013). See Figure B.1.

The investment climate portfolio showed an almost equal distribution by number of projects and
intervention amounts across income level and fragile and conflict situation (FCS) classifications.

Geographic Distribution of the Investment Climate Portfolio
Investment climate reform interventions were identified in 119 countries across all regions. Of
these countries, two-thirds (74 countries) received support from both the World Bank and IFC,
and the remaining 45 received support from just one of the two institutions.

Investment Climate World Bank Lending Figures
Overall, the number of investment climate projects as a proportion of all World Bank lending
projects decreased from 18 percent in 2007 to 12 percent in 2013 at an average rate of
5 percent a year. The trend is more stable, however, when comparing investment climate-
Finance and Private Sector Development network (FPD) projects against the rest of the FPD
portfolio. This portfolio declined at an average 3 percent a year between 2007 and 2013,
though excluding the drop between 2007 and 2008 reveals an increase of investment
climate-FPD as a proportion of all FPD of 9 percent a year.

Appendix C
Statistical Tests for Regulatory Reform Indicators


IEG collected 39 regulatory environment indicators from different sources, such as the Doing
Business, World Economic Forum, and Logistics Performance Index. For each indicator
IEG estimated the average value in countries with and without Bank Group projects. For a
regulatory intervention to be relevant, the expected average value of an indicator in countries
with Bank Group–supported reforms would be worse than its value in countries without a
Bank Group–supported project.

Literature Review on the Impact of
Regulatory Reforms


Several studies have linked economic growth with various measures of institutional
development (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001; Keefer and Knack 1997; Knack
and Keefer 1995; Mauro 1995).1 Many of these studies include measures of the burden of
regulation among their measures of institutional development (Knack and Keefer 1995).
However, some components of institutional development, such as corruption, the rule of
law, the risk of expropriation, and contract enforceability, have only an indirect link with
regulation (Knack and Keefer 1995; Keefer and Knack 1997; Langbein and Knack 2010).2
Moreover, several important sector- and firm-level studies have found a strong link between
property rights and investment using firm-level data. Claessens and Laeven (2003) find that
firms allocated resources grow faster in countries where the protection of property rights is
stronger. The effect of strengthening property rights is as large as the effect of improving
access to finance. Using data from Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine,
Johnson, McMillan, and Woodruff (2002) find that insecure property rights discouraged
firms from reinvesting profits in these countries. Cull and Xu (2005) find similar results for
China, noting that secure property rights are a significant predictor of firm reinvestment in
China as well.

Other studies suggest that there might be a correlation between regulation and growth.
Countries with a high burden of regulation appear to have grown more slowly in the period
before regulation is measured (Djankov, McLeish, and Ramalho 2006; Hanush 2012).
Yet causality is much harder to prove. Eifert (2009) finds that improvements in the Doing
Business indicators do not appear to affect subsequent investment and only one—enforcing
contracts—affects growth across countries.

At the same time some impact can be detected in a smaller subset of countries. In particular,
business registration and contract enforcement appear to affect investment in poor countries
and countries with relatively good institutions. Labor regulations might also affect economic
and employment growth (Besley and Burgess 2004). Some studies have attributed China’s
rapid growth in part to its relatively flexible labor regulations (Dong and Xu 2008, 2009).
Similarly, Ahsan and Pages (2009) find that firms grow more slowly in Indian states with

                  An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Appendix D   181
      stricter employment protection laws than they do in other states. Labor regulation was
      especially harmful in states with strict dispute resolution legislation. Labor regulations have
      also been seen to increase labor cost relative to capital. As a result, firms are likely to adopt
      labor-saving technologies when labor regulation is burdensome. Consistent with this, Amin
      (2009) shows that retail firms in India adopted computers more quickly in Indian states where
      labor regulation was less flexible.

      Some observers have suggested that regulation tends to be a greater burden on small
      firms (Altenburg and van Drachenfels 2006). The empirical evidence for labor regulation,
      however, does not support this assertion. Several studies have found that large firms appear
      to be more concerned about labor regulation than small firms (Clarke 2014; Gelb and
      others 2006; Pierre and Scarpetta 2006; Ahsan and Pages 2009; Abidoye, Orazem,
      and Vodopivec 2009). This could further affect firm growth by discouraging firms from
      expanding.

      Finally, Djankov and others (2010) and Sentance (2013) find that administrative burdens
      related to paying taxes did not have impact on investments, whereas the tax rate did. Lawless
      (2013) finds that burdensome tax administration reduces the likelihood of foreign direct
      investment (FDI), although he noted that if FDI does occur, tax complexity does not appear
      to affect its level. Other studies find that higher corporate taxes are associated with lower
      GDP per capita growth across countries (Lee and Gordon 2005), as well labor productivity
      in Europe (Dall’Olio and others 2013) and total factor productivity, except in small and young
      firms with low levels of profitability (Arnold and Schwellnus 2008).

      Many studies have suggested that regulation and corruption are intimately linked,
      although the direction of causality is not clear. Some studies suggested that firms
      might see regulation as less problematic when they can pay bribes to get around them
      (Leff 1964; Meon and Sekkat 2005; Meon and Weill 2009; Kaufmann and Wei 1999).
      This, however, is not the case with other studies that show a positive correlation between
      the burden of regulation and corruption at the country level (Langbein and Knack 2010;
      Djankov and others 2002), leading some authors to argue that corrupt regimes might
      create burdensome regulations on purpose so they can collect bribes (Shleifer and
      Vishny 1993).

      Some papers have used instrumental variables to argue that corruption encourages excessive
      regulation (Faria and others 2013). Although the burden of regulation might be correlated
      with corruption, it is not the only aspect of regulation that is important. The predictability of
      regulation might also be important. Hallward-Driemeier, Khun-Josh, and Pritchett (2010)
      show that firms are more likely to say that policy implementation is more predictable in
      countries where corruption is lower.

182   Investment Climate Reforms
Some studies concluded that reducing registration requirements might increase business
formation. Two studies, in particular, used Mexico’s System of Fast Opening of Firms program,
which reduced the time to register a business from 30 to 2 days, to assess how it affected
business registration (Bruhn 2013; Kaplan, Piedra, and Seira 2011).3 Because the program
was introduced at different times in different provinces, the two studies exploited this in a
quasi-experimental setting. That is, they compared changes in registration rates in provinces
that did and did not adopt the program and between firms that did and did not qualify for the
program. Both studies found that the program affected registration rates significantly. Bruhn
(2013) estimated that the reform increased the number of registered businesses by 5 percent.
Kaplan, Piedra, and Seira (2011) estimated that new start-ups increased by about 5 percent
per month in eligible industries. Similar results were obtained in other studies in Colombia
(Cárdenas and Rozo 2009) and Portugal (Branstetter and others 2010), which found that new
registration increased by 5.2 percent and 21.7 percent, respectively. Aghion and Marinescu
(2008) estimated that licensing reforms in India encouraged formation by increasing the
number of factories by 6 percent, and Chari (2011) showed that total factor productivity
improved by around 15 percent.

However, these increases in registration might be temporary, depending on other factors of the
business environment. For example, Kaplan, Piedra, and Seira (2011) showed that the increase
in registration in Mexico was concentrated in the first 15 months after implementation, with a
subsequent decline. Similar results were shown in Peru (IEG 2011), where registration went up
significantly after the reform but by the third year tapered off. In other cases, a simplification of
registration procedures might lead to a decreased entry. Bruhn and McKenzie (2013) showed
that a business start-up simplification program in Brazil led to a reduction in the number of
firms registering during the first two months of implementation,, followed by no impact in
subsequent months. This was probably a result of the reform consolidating registration at the
municipal, state, and federal level, something that firms might have not liked.

Chari (2011) showed that different effects on formation depended on labor regulations.
Output increased more in states where labor regulations were more pro-employer. In contrast,
limited effect was detected by Alcazar, Andrade, and Jaramillo (2011) in Peru, where by using
a randomized control trial the authors showed that licensing reform had little effect on sales,
profit, investment, or employment. This result is consistent with Economisti Associati (2011) in
Burkina Faso, Liberia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone.

At the same time, some studies point out that a critical mass of reforms might be needed to
be able to see an impact on business formation. The increase in entry is associated with a
significant drop in time to register, suggesting that more modest improvements (for example,
in countries with procedures that are already relatively streamlined) might have a more

                   An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Appendix D   183
      modest effect. Consistent with this, using cross-country data from the Doing Business report
      and World Bank Entrepreneurship snapshots, Klapper and Love (2014) found that reductions
      of less than 40 percent in the cost and time required to start a business did not have a
      significant impact on new firm creation. Kaplan, Piedra, and Seira (2011) reached a similar
      conclusion: that bigger programs of reform could have a greater impact.

      Empirical tests of the expectation that reducing the time and cost of registration might affect
      formalization have found mixed results. The Doing Business report provides anecdotal
      evidence that relaxing entry restrictions might encourage registration. For example, the World
      Bank (2008, p. 13) notes that “[after] Madagascar reduced it minimum capital requirement
      by more than 80 percent in 2006, the rate of new registrations jumped from 13 percent
      to 26 percent.” The report also notes that after it introduced a one-stop shop to help firms
      register, “Croatia saw company formation in Zagreb and Split increase by more than
      300 percent over 3 years.”

      Klapper, Amit, and Guillen (2010) note that the ratio of corporations to population
      increased by more than 30 percent, after electronic registries were introduced in Azerbaijan,
      Guatemala, Jordan, Oman, Slovenia, and Sri Lanka. Finally, Kaplan, Piedra, and Seira (2011)
      also showed that entry after reforms was mainly done by informal enterprises. However, Bruhn
      (2008, 2013) showed that in Mexico there was limited indication that formalization took
      place. Moreover, Bruhn found that the effect was not a result of existing informal enterprises
      becoming formal but of employed persons at formal firms starting their own businesses. De
      Giorgi and Rahman (2013) conducted a randomized control trial in Bangladesh and were
      unable to show significant registration by informal firms. Cost of registration and information
      on the process were not the main issues for informal firms.

      Formalization might also be favored by tax registration. McKenzie and Sakho (2010) showed
      that officials in Bolivia were able to expand the tax base, thanks to the issuance of tax receipts,
      which enabled firms to increase their profitability after formalization. This was the case for very
      small firms (two to five employees). Similar results were obtained by Medvedev and Oveido
      (2013) in Ecuador. In Vietnam, firms that formalized though tax registration were shown
      to increase investment and performance, in part because they replaced causal labor with
      formal employment (Rand and Torm 2012). Finally, in Sri Lanka only a small share of firms
      that formalized showed an increase in profitability, and formalization had no effect on access
      to finance (de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2012). Additional evidence points to the fact
      that large informal firms have limited incentives to formalize their tax status, since this did not
      have any benefit in terms of access to finance and firms have learned how to benefit from
      formalization without registering (McKenzie and Sakho 2010). Increased enforcement might



184   Investment Climate Reforms
have a larger impact than tax reform for particular types of firms. Large firms are visited more
often by tax inspectors if formal than informal (77 percent of times compared to 25 percent,
respectively).

In three African countries firms did not register for tax because they knew they would not be
inspected (Economisti Association 2011). Similarly, a randomized control trial in Brazil showed
that having an inspector visit a neighboring firm had little impact on formalization. At the
same time, having an inspector visit the firm had a significant impact on the probability of
registration.



Notes

  Indeed, Sala-i-Martin (1997) concludes that one measure of institutional development, the rule of law, is one of 22 variables
out of the 62 that he tested that appeared to be robust according to his definition and variety of extreme-bound-analysis.
Levine and Renelt (1992) did not include any measures of institutional development in their extreme-bound analysis.

  Consistent with this, Klapper, Laeven, and Rajan (2006) find that entry regulations affect firm formation in Europe and
that the effect is particularly large in sectors such as retail that generally have high entry rates. For a comprehensive review,
see also IFC (2013).

                       An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations | Bibliography   205
Investment Climate Reforms
Private firms are at the forefront of the development process, providing more than 90 percent
of jobs, supplying goods and services, and representing a significant source of tax revenues.
Their ability to grow, create jobs, and reduce poverty depends critically on a well-functioning
investment climate—defined as the policy, legal, and institutional arrangements underpinning
the functioning of markets and the level of transaction costs and risks associated with starting,
operating, and closing a business.
The World Bank Group has provided extensive support to investment climate reforms. This
evaluation by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assesses the relevance, effectiveness,
and social value of World Bank Group support to investment climate reforms as it relates to
concerns for inclusion and shared prosperity.
 IEG finds that the World Bank Group has supported a comprehensive menu of investment
climate reforms and has improved investment climate in countries, as measured by
number of laws enacted, streamlining of processes and time, or simple cost savings for
private firms. However, the impact on investment, jobs, business formation, and growth is
not straightforward. Regulatory reforms need to be designed and implemented with both
economic and social costs and benefits in mind; IEG found that, in practice, World Bank
Group support focuses predominantly on reducing costs to businesses.
In supporting investment climate reforms, the World Bank and the International Finance
Corporation use two distinct but complementary business models. Despite the fact that
investment climate is the most integrated business unit in the World Bank Group, coordination
is mostly informal, relying mainly on personal contacts.
IEG recommends that the World Bank Group expand its range of diagnostic tools and integrate
them in the areas of the business environment not yet covered by existing tools; develop an
approach to identify the social effects of regulatory reforms on all groups expected to be affected
by them beyond the business community; and exploit synergies by ensuring that World Bank and
IFC staff improve their understanding of each other’s work and business models.
