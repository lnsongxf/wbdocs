THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

      BuildCo must file a request for the construction permit at the Ufficio
      Urbanistica under the Segreteria di Stato per il Territorio, l’Ambiente e
      l’Agricoltura. The following documentation needs to be attached to the
      request:

      - Map (allibramento)
      - Proof of ownership (partite)
      - Relazione sulla fattibilita’ strutturale
      - Attestato di conformità del progetto alle norme energetiche vigenti

      When the request is processed, the Ufficio Urbanistica will notify
      BuildCo about the total cost for obtaining the permit. Once notified by
      the Ufficio Urbanistica of the amount due, BuildCo has to pay the Tassa     90 days     EUR 105,148

      As per the Piano Regolatore Generale of 1992 the amount due equals
      8% of the construction cost. This construction cost estimates are
      updated by Decrees of the Commission for Territorial Policies
      (Commissione per le Politiche Territoriali). The estimates depend on the
      intended use of the construction (destinazione d’uso). The category
      that applies to the Doing Business case-study is category D5
      (Wholesale activities - Commercio all’ingrosso). As per the latest Decree
      the estimated construction cost is EUR 1,010.5683086 per square meter.
      U1 and U2 (oneri di urbanizzazione primaria e secondaria) are not due

        • Variable amount: Contributto di allacciamento a preventivo, which
        depends on the amount of works that need to be made. This amount
        comprises both the material costs as well as the labor costs of the works
        as well as general expenses. Of this amount, only 70% is born by the

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:

        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
