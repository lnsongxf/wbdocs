THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

Kenya is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new              Legal form: Private Corporation
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through
collaboration with relevant local professionals and          Paid in minimum capital requirement: KES 0

Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,         Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company

“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Under the Stamp Duty Act (Cap. 480), the stamp duty on the nominal
       capital of the company is KES 20 for every KES 2,000 or part thereof.

        Submit architectural plan for approval and obtain provisional
        building permit

        BuildCo would approach the City Development Department of City
        Council of Nairobi (CCN) to get its architectural plans approved first.
        Before submitting the application, BuildCo must pay the relevant fees.
        Once the payment is made, BuildCo submits the receipt to the City
        Development Department. The application must contain the
        architectural drawings and plans, land title, copy of main architect’s
        license.

        The application then gets forwarded to various departments: Physical
        Planning, Road Department, Public Health, Fire Department, Water
        Authority, and Electricity Authority. Each department takes at least one
        week to clear the respective section of the plans and grants separate
        permits for the plumbing, sewerage, and electrical activities that
        BuildCo will be involved in during the construction of the warehouse.

        Thereafter, the application is forwarded for approval to the Technical
        Committee that convenes twice a week and issues the approvals. As a
        result of the approval of architectural drawings BuildCo will receive the
        building permit. The building permit is granted only provisionally, until
        the structural segment is approved.

        After the building permit is obtained, BuildCo must submit its structural
        project separately. Since 2006, CCN has been reforming under Rapid
        Results Initiative (RRI), trying to reduce the number of days and
        eliminate the bottlenecks. Since 2008 the architectural project approval
        is done by the Technical Committee that convenes twice a week and
        issues the approvals. Previously, the approving body was the City
        Council itself. However, due to its busy schedule and backlog, it was
        decided to transfer the responsibility from the City Council to the
        Technical Committee. Because of various reforms it takes on average 30
        days to obtain this part of the approval, as opposed to 50 days before.
        However, approval time can vary depending on the diligence of the

      On June 27, 2013 the Nairobi City County adopted the new Financial
      Act 2013 which became effective as of October 1, 2013. The Act
      modified the method of assessing the building permit fees and
      consolidated several costs into one. The building permit fee is now
      based on the size of the building. The Joint Building Council Rates
      provide the estimated cost per square meter which varies depending
      on the type of building (e.g. office block, residential, industrial complex,
      etc.). For the Doing Business case study, the estimated cost is KES
      21,000 / sq. m. The fees are as follows:

      (i) Building plan approval fee: 1.1% of the estimated cost of
      construction
      (ii) Construction sign board fee: KES 25,000
      (iii) Application fee: KES 5,000
      (iv) Inspection of building file: KES 5,000

      Submit and obtain structural plan approval and final building
      permit

      Once the architectural plans and drawings are approved and comments
      and changes are made, BuildCo must incorporate them into the
      structural plans and re-submit the application to CCN for approval. This
      is done as common practice, as submitting both plans together is
      impossible. One other reason why these two steps happen separately is
      because the architectural drawings and plans are checked by the
      Structural Department at the stage when the structural plans are
      approved. Construction work begins only after this approval.

      Due to the RRI program and the internal process of simplification in the
      CCN, it now takes 10 days to obtain the structural approval compared
      to previous 25 days.

      BuildCo must have the following items approved: project plans,
      architectural drawings, location survey of property documents and
      others.

      Obtain approval of the environmental impact study

      Following the enactment of new Environmental Management and Co-
      ordination Act on February 27, 2009, companies now have to obtain
      approval of projects from the National Environment Management
      Authority. Projects of all risk categories are subject to approval and an
      environmental impact assessment (EIA), including the BuildCo
      warehouse. It takes 30 days on average. The cost is set at 0.05% of
      warehouse value (0.05% * KES 32,500,000.00). Prior to February 11,
      2009, the fee rate was 0.1% of warehouse value.

      The regulation regarding environmental impact assessment approval
4     for Kenya has been in place since 1999. However, in recent years NEMA       30 days       KES 2,126
      started enforcing the rules more vigorously. NEMA conducts periodic
      inspections during the construction. If new projects at the moment of
      inspection do not have an environmental impact assessment they may
      order the project be closed and erected objects demolished. Therefore,
      construction companies are now obtaining the environmental approval
      before the building is completed. However, the legislation is not clear
      on what categories of building this regulation applies to.

      Request and receive final inspection by the Municipal Authority
      after construction

      Once the construction is completed alongside statutory inspections,
      BuildCo applies for an occupancy certificate. The occupancy certificate
      is given when the City Council deems the building is in compliance with
      the approved architectural drawings.

5     The application is then forwarded to the Assistant Director Enforcement      5 days       no charge
      so that an inspector is assigned for the final inspection of the
      construction. Normally it should be a combined visit from several other

      to lack of transport, in practice, the inspector often has to be picked up
      in person and driven to the site. Previously, such inspections were
      conducted on a random basis, but now every transaction requires such

      report is compiled after which the value is endorsed on the transfer and
      then it is submitted for assessment of the Stamp duty.
