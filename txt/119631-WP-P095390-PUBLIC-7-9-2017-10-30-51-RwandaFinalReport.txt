The implementation of the Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) in Rwanda is the work
of many. The LGAF was coordinated by Thierry Hoza Ngoga who also produced this synthesis report.
RNRA Management especially Dr Emmanuel Nkurunziza, Director General and Eng Didier Giscard
Sagashya, Deputy Director General (now Director General of Rwanda Housing Authority) have
supported and facilitated LGAF implementation, and provided administrative data and support
needed. The expert investigators: Francois Ntaganda, Karim Tushabe, David Niyonsenga, Nadia
Ingabire and Pothin Muvara prepared the thematic background reports with context analysis and
land indicator assessment for discussion in the panels. The African experts that composed the
Technical Advisory Group (Dr Marguerit Rugadya, Dr Emmanuel Nkurunziza, Dr Liz Alden Wily,
Professor Vinodh Jaichand, Ms Amie N. D. Bensouda, Professor Mandi Rukuni, Riel Franzsen and
Professor Wilbard Kombe) provided technical guidance and critical review of the background
reports. Panel members included in annex 2. We are most grateful for their invaluable contributions
that have enriched the analysis and helped to further fine-tune the assessment and
recommendations. This report also acknowledges LGAF Global coordination Klaus Deininger and
Thea Hilhorst, and Sue Mbaya from the LGAF Africa Secretariat for their technical guidance and
support.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Rwanda has initiated a major land tenure reform programme over the last two decades to
clarify land rights, underpinned by far-reaching legal and institutional reforms (2004
National Land Policy (NLP); 2005 Organic Land Law (OLL)), which culminated in a nationwide
programme of systematic land tenure regularization (LTR) that was completed in 2012. This
process, and the issues emerging, especially following the demarcation and adjudication
phases, resulted in the amendment of the land law and expropriation law in 2013 and 2014
respectively. Related implementing legislation and process reviews are also underway which
seek to address current and future land issues, and are also in line with current socio-
economic development of the country.

Although some of the objectives of the NLP have been achieved, new objectives need to be
set to deal with changes that have taken place since the NLP’s adoption, as well as reforms
to the policy as a result of lessons learnt. It is therefore timely that the NLP review has
already started, as anticipated by Government when it suggested a mid-term review in
order to make any necessary adjustments. Moreover, policy focus is now shifting from
registration to maintaining an effective use of land information to support development
objectives and accountability, building and decentralizing sustainable land administration
services, guiding urbanization and effective land use. Land policy reform is influenced also
by broader public sector reforms.

The implementation of the Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) in Rwanda is
timely and will help the country to take stock in a comprehensive way, benchmark and
assess priorities as input into ongoing policy, legal and institutional reforms. LGAF was
undertaken between September 2014 and May 2015, and validated in January 2016. The
framework analysis is organised into nine modules: (i) land tenure recognition; (ii) rights to
forest and common lands & rural land use regulations; (iii) urban land use, planning, and
development; (iv) public land management; (v) process and economic benefit of transfer of
public land to private use; (vi) public provision of land information; (vii) land valuation and
taxation, (viii) dispute resolution and (ix) review of institutional arrangements and policies.

1.1 Land tenure recognition
Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa and high pressure on
agricultural land resulted in a trend towards individualisation of land tenure and property
rights. Tenure rights were affected by conflict and violence producing waves of
displacement and refugees since 1959, cumulating in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.
The 2005 OLL clarified land rights which were formalised in the LTR process, for which clear
procedures were developed and tested to ensure a transparent and public process and
community engagement, coupled with an effective awareness campaign to inform people of
their land rights. Rwanda used aerial photography for land demarcation, digitalised all land
data collected created and centralised these in a national land cadastre and register.
                                              1
The LTR program resulted in the demarcation and adjudication of 11.4 million parcels over a
surface area of 20,666 km2 and the issuance of eight million leasehold titles. This process led
to formalisation of all land in Rwanda (converted from customary tenure to formal legal
rights). All public land (forests, protected areas, wetlands and swamp lands) was also
mapped and recorded.

Although this process recognises individual land rights, rights of women in informal
marriages are not yet recognised. Another issue is the rights of women in polygamous
marriages, since the Rwandan Constitution recognizes only one legally married wife.
Nevertheless, gender bias has diminished, with joint titling comprising 5,278,513 (46%)
parcels (8,647 km2 or 41% by size) and women as sole owners of land amounting to
2,068,137 (18%) parcels (over 3,438 km2 or 16% by size). Rwanda has a high percentage of
female-headed households as a result of the socio unrest and the 1994 genocide against the
Tutsi. Joint titling was not accepted by all men, either out of ignorance over women’s rights
to land or in opposition to equal rights.

1.2 Forest and Common Lands & Rural Land Use Regulations
Rwanda has a clear national forest policy and forest law that govern forest land and rural
land use. Reserve and protected areas such as wetlands are well protected with a buffer
zone around them. A national land use development master plan was developed in 2011 to
guide the use and management of land and forest across the country, but implementation is
hampered by capacity constraints. A number of forests are managed through public-private
partnerships. Rewards schemes and tree planting schemes were introduced to ensure
effective community participation in forest management and ownership by local
community. However, this is not the case for protected areas and communities should be
incentivised to engage in its management to improve conservation.

A forest cadastre and register have also been put in place, and once completed, they will
facilitate forest management. A mining cadastre has also been developed. Land tenure
rights are linked to land use, which is registered for each parcel in the land cadastre and
their change is regularly monitored. During the LTR process, however, some private
individuals claimed ownership of State-owned forests and subsequently registered them in
their names. Such ownership disputes (either between individuals or between the State and
individuals) over forests should be resolved fairly and expeditiously.

The national land use plan sets out how public land should be managed and this will be
further clarified in the district detailed land use plans currently under development. Most
districts have not yet got detailed land use plans in place. The plans’ preparation process,
however, lacked adequate consultation process or public input was not considered in the
plan. The lack of community buy-in is therefore likely to affect implementation. Where
consultations are done with local authorities, the latter often lack the skills to challenge the

                                               2
plans proposed for their areas or they provide inadequate input. Public participation in
determining zoning regulations should be done at cell level for wide community outreach.

Implementation of land use regulations are also hampered by insufficient resources and
capacity at institutional level, as well as a blurred delineation between urban and rural
areas. The presidential order determining urban delineation should be adopted as a matter
of urgency so that implementation of rural and urban regulations can be applied more
clearly.

1.3 Urban land use planning and development
Urban centres are expected to play an important role in economic development and there is
much interest for improvement and optimisation of urban land use. Urban masterplans
have been developed for some cities, but with limited public participation. Implementation
is hampered by the inability of most urban residents to comply with zoning regulations for
housing. These are expensive and often beyond the reach of the urban poor, which may
result in a loss of land rights and the benefits of living in urban areas. They are forced to sell
their land to those who can afford to build according to zoning regulations. A high housing
demand, with the highest need among low income groups, exacerbates planning issues.
Another concern is insufficient economic activities in urban and urbanizing centres outside
Kigali.

Current urban planning documents need revising, including modification to land use
specifications and zoning regulations to achieve greater efficiency in land use. Monitoring of
urban local development plans should be mandatory. Legislation relating to building permits
should be adopted and implemented appropriately. Planning and building regulations
should be disseminated, where local authorities receive appropriate training.

There is a broad understanding of the urgency to develop inclusive policies, supportive to
the private sector and civil society, for urban planning and efficient resource use. The new
set of orders and policy regulating housing and urban development is a significant
milestone. The commitment is high also for continued implementation of decentralization
to improve local urban management and where cross-sectoral partnership agreements will
become increasingly relevant, and will result in higher resource efficiency. However,
effective coordination of planning and implementation of plans remain a significant
challenge as plans are often developed without public input.

1.4 Public land management
Public land categories include lakes and waterways; national roads and feeder roads; land
with public buildings; natural reserves and national parks; and wetlands. All public land has
been identified through LTR and has been titled, including 379,398 State-owned land parcels
(comprising 1,309 km2) and 635,368 wetland parcels (comprising 1,049 km2).


                                                3
Specific policies or strategies for public land management are not in place, nor are there
adequate financial resources to manage public land. A clear distinction of roles amongst the
relevant institutions is lacking, often creating inefficiencies where no reference is made to
the land use plan where there is conflict over land use. In practice, management of public
lands often is left in the hands of local authorities who commonly do not have adequate
knowledge or sufficient resources to deal with these issues. This had led some local people
to claim ownership over public land in certain areas. In other cases, public land is used for
private benefit. A specific public land management policy is required that also assigns the
mandate to a specified “public land management authority” and is ideally included in the
ongoing review of the NLP currently underway. Land use plans should cater for public use,
with land use monitoring mechanisms and indicators in place.

Expropriation of land by the State is done in the “general public’s interest”, but the
definition used is often unclear, and decisions made on land acquisition are sometimes
ambiguous. There is also conflict over compensation for expropriated land. The amount is
considered too low, also because unregistered rights such as renting a house, grazing, and
fishing are not compensated. The law on expropriation should address compensation for
non-registered rights (e.g. renting, fishing, grazing etc.), and those who have been
expropriated should be relocated to a well-planned area. Certified valuers are the only
professionals allowed to carry out valuation for expropriation purposes. This new mandate
came with the amendment of the expropriation law. Commonly, reference prices are used
during the valuation process instead of market prices. Poor land owners cannot afford
counter valuation costs, leading them to get an unfair price for their land during
expropriation.

1.5 Panel 5: Transfer of large tracks of land to investors
Rwanda Development Board (RDB) is specifically responsible for investment promotion.
Business registration for local and foreign investors has been made easier through the
introduction of online services. The establishment of RDB ensures that approval of
investment follows clear protocol and takes into consideration the public interest. It also
provides reasonable timelines in terms of investment project reviews and approval. RDB
ensures that investors provide sufficient information to allow rigorous evaluation of
proposed investments. Land scarcity in Rwanda is worsening and a clear policy is needed to
improve access to land for investors as well as a mapping of potential land for investments.

The transfer of public land for private use now goes through a more transparent process. As
of June 2013, the allocation of public land to investors is done through a competitive bid
process. But, where land belongs to private individuals, there is often a disparity in
negotiation strength when such land is transferred to investors, often leading to bad
bargains.


                                             4
However, there are no proper mechanisms in place to assess social and community benefits
attained through various investment projects. Contractual provisions regarding benefit
sharing are not publicly disclosed. Only ad hoc monitoring systems exist to check that local
stakeholders’ interests are fully protected. Further, there are no clear records to capture all
investment related projects where land is acquired or transferred to investors, including
records of all public land allocated to private investment. Regular monitoring of investor
activities is required, as well as compliance with land lease obligations.

1.6 Public provision of land information - registry and cadastre
A land administration manual listing all land transactions and their requirements have been
created. Regular review of procedures for land information access are in place, for example,
all commercial or investment land transfers are processed in one day instead of seven as it is
for other types of transactions; district land officers and sector land managers work as land
notaries to fast-track daily land transactions. Not all sectors have sector land managers,
leading some people to travel long distances and pay expensive travel costs to get basic
services.

Public land information is stored in the land register. Through both sporadic and systematic
land registration, a lot of administrative data has been created. Information is digitalized
and available in textual as well as spatial formats. Various electronic facilities have been
created to host all land information including the fully integrated textual-spatial land
register known as the land administration information system (LAIS). LAIS is now linked to
other services such as the mortgage registration system and the national identification
programme, and is currently being linked to the taxation system. Attempts to ease access to
land information by putting some data online are currently underway. LAIS interoperability
should be improved to increase efficiency across services, such as with the courts, city
planning authorities, the ministry of agriculture, office of the ombudsman etc.

To ease access to information, the national land register is being decentralised at district
level to ensure information is accessed and updated at local level. The digital land register
(LAIS) is not currently decentralized in all districts and is not linked to other important
systems such as e-court systems. This decentralization of LAIS to district level should be
accelerated.

Costs of registering property through systematic registration are generally low even though
some people in rural areas are unable to afford these fees and the government has to
subsidise them. In this regard, there is a large divide between urban and rural areas where
many people in urban areas can easily afford land registration costs whereas people in rural
areas find it very expensive.

The challenge is ensuring that the land data is updated, requiring that all transactions are
registered. Informal transactions are still taking place. The preliminary results of a World

                                              5
Bank study on LTR impacts suggest that in rural areas, only 32% of transactions are officially
registered (52% informal, and 16% registered with the village leader). This is a very low
figure, and if confirmed, might jeopardise the long term viability of the formal system. The
transfer of property (irrespective of size) is done by the payment of a flat fee (RwF 27,000)
as an incentive for investors, but for most others, the fee is very high, often representing
more than 50% of the property value. With 65% of the Rwandan population earning less
than Rwf 50,000 per month, the flat fee charge is a real burden for more than half Rwanda’s
citizens, and this could be a real barrier for many people to register their transactions. This
is also the case for survey costs, which may be prohibitive especially in rural areas. These
issues threaten the reliability of the land register and the registration process as people try
to avoid payment. There remains many unregistered land transactions. Between January
2014 and March 2015, only 26,000 transactions resulting from sale were formally registered
(this figure would appear low).

Land transaction costs should be varied, and in particular, reduced in rural areas where the
fee is prohibitive to many. Likewise, surveying fees should be reassessed. This will improve
the reliability of the land registry by discouraging informal transactions to take place. All
services and their pricing policies should be clearly defined. Unless this is done, other
resources cannot be aligned to produce those services, and stimulating demand through
public awareness campaigns, for example, could be counterproductive.

Lack of awareness has also proven to be an issue. Some land owners do not know their
rights while others do not know the procedures for registering land transfers. In this regard,
the ‘land week’ awareness campaign has had a positive impact in helping people understand
their rights and encourage them to register any land transactions.

1.7 Land taxation and valuation
With the completion of LTR, all landowners liable to pay annual land lease fees are known.
The majority of land in Rwanda is held under long term lease and many people are liable to
pay lease fees. People consider payment of land lease fees as a barrier to full enjoyment of
land rights.

Those with freehold titles pay property tax (known as fixed asset tax) and which are listed in
the digital land register.

According to figures collected in 2014, in three districts of Kigali city, land based revenues
increased despite not having a proper collection system. Until recently, there was no link
between the tax and land lease fee collection systems and the land register. For example,
between 2011 and 2013, land based revenues in Kicukiro district increased from
1,065,842,855 Frw to 2,111,738,248 Frw. However, it is estimated that less than 50% of
owed fees/taxes are being collected nationally. It is clear that with an adequate land
revenue collection system in place; these figures would be substantially higher. There are no

                                              6
proper tax collection systems in place in many districts, leading the Rwanda Revenue
Authority (RRA) to take over the collection of all lease fees, including fixed assets taxes but
the law should be amended to give RRA the mandate to collect these. A land-based revenue
information system should be developed (integrated into the existing land information
system) to enable RRA to determine where land taxes and lease fees are payable, and to
monitor the collection process.

The land valuation profession, and certified valuers, are relatively new in Rwanda, with the
law establishing and organising the real property valuation profession approved in 2010.
The same law provides for valuation rolls to be established. This has been further clarified
by the amendment of the expropriation law that suggests that reference prices should be
reviewed on a regular basis. However, currently, there are no valuation rolls in place in
Rwanda since there is a shortage of professional land valuers (or those that exist have
insufficient capacity).

The Institute of Real Property (IRPV) should be tasked with establishing reference prices to
reflect the market price. Property values should be captured and updated on an annual
basis, and should be made available to the public. Each district should carry out this process,
under the guidance of the IRPV. Further capacity building is needed for IRPV members to
carry out these functions, where lessons can be learnt from colleagues in the East African
community.

1.8 Land disputes resolution
According to RNRA, there are 23,488 (0.2%) parcels (90,277,511.52 m2) under dispute
(including restrictions on the land). With the completion of LTR, there is now a
comprehensive land disputes database. Most of these disputes are intra-family in nature.
The land register does not provide clear categorisation of land disputes, nor does it record
overall figures of disputes which are pending or resolved. There is a need to undertake a
proper assessment of existing land disputes (and their substance) which are before the
courts, Abunzi etc., and determine how they can be dealt with more efficiently. There are
various avenues for land disputes resolution including traditional and community-led
solutions (e.g. Abunzi, Agakaye k’ibibazo, Akagoroba kababyeyi, Maison d’acces a la justice
etc.). Most of these disputes resolution mechanisms are accessible and affordable, and
agreements between parties are encouraged. To improve the execution of dispute
resolution outcomes, local authorities need to be more involved. The existence of various
alternative disputes resolution mechanisms sometimes provides a source of forum
shopping. Moreover, there is no clear and robust platform for information and
communication exchange between the institutions involved in land disputes resolution,
therefore it is easy for inconsistencies to arise. Lower courts and the Abunzi need improved
training to deal with the high volume of disputes before them, and to ensure quality is
sufficient so that there are reduced challenges on appeal to the higher courts.

                                              7
Since most disputes go through mediation avenues first, reduced disputes cases should take
place in formal courts, which are more costly. There is no clear segregation of land disputes
in the formal courts system. Land disputes in the formal court system are believed to
account for more than 50% of total court cases, meaning that better attention may be
required to resolve disputes earlier on. Specialist judges should be identified to deal with
land-related cases solely, which would speed up the process and improve quality and
consistency of judgements.

1.9 Institutional arrangements and policies
In 2004, Rwanda approved its first National Land Policy which required a set of institutional
arrangements for full implementation. The OLL also required a fully functioning land
institutional framework. The following institutions were therefore created to deal mainly
with land administration, land tenure and land use planning issues: a ministry responsible
for land issues, an agency responsible for the implementation of policy and laws, the
department of lands and mapping, and the office of the registrar of land titles supported by
five zonal offices. District land offices were also created across the country supported by
land managers at sector level. All these institutions are supported by sector and cell land
committees that operate at lower administrative level.

Given that land is a cross-cutting issue, there are parallel institutions that also address
specific land issues such as agriculture, environment, conservation, forestry, city planning
etc. They work together with the land administration institutional framework mentioned
above. Given that these institutions are relatively new, most staff are undergoing on-job and
off-job training to ensure the effective implementation of the organisation s’ mandates, with
focus on long-term sustainability rather than addressing current issues. There is strong
management eagerness to adopt effective systems, leading to regular reviews of the
relevant laws and policies. This encourages new development and addresses emerging
issues. There is also an increasing focus on the quality of education, and on the delivery of
vocational and tertiary education, which addresses sustainable quality management in the
work of future professionals in both the public and the private sector.

There are also adverse effects of regular public sector reforms affecting land institutions.
These issues are exacerbated by insufficient financial resources.

There is a lack of efficient coordination between the various organisations and a lack of
capacity in certain areas. Clear communication amongst institutions is not always present,
resulting in limited integrated planning processes. Where the current legal and regulatory
framework is not sufficiently clear, they should be redefined to avoid duplication of roles.
Further, to avoid institutional overlaps especially during project implementation, there
should be a clear definition of roles before commencement of the project, and an
establishment of adequate coordination mechanisms between all institutions, particularly
where the project necessitates multi-institutional input.
                                               8
Oversight from multiple organisations makes the monitoring systems harder to achieve.
Harmonized coordination of land institutions at local and central level should be
established. All sector land managers and district land officers should be under the direct
supervision of RNRA to ensure efficiency and accountability. A performance monitoring
system should be established to ensure the effectiveness of local staff. Integrated planning
frameworks and processes should be developed to guide all land institutions. Joint planning
should be mandatory prior to implementation. Further, having achieved very good results in
the LTR programme, it should be possible to concentrate more resources on the institutional,
capacity and systems building aspects to ensure that sustainable systems are in place.

There is currently no monitoring system in place to assess the cost effectiveness element of
the land administration system and the sustainability of the system remains difficult to
ascertain, because a lot of investment in the sector is donor funded. This is hampered by the
fact that the determination of land service fees is not necessarily based on cost of service
provision, as well as the inability of many rural land owners to pay for land services. A
monitoring system should be established to undertake a cost/benefit analysis of the various
land administration services available. Clear costing should be provided for the
implementation of the land policy, and regular reporting on the implementation process
should be ensured.
There is also a lack of systematic monitoring to report various land governance indicators,
such as disputes, transaction by type, mortgage, land use change etc. The government of
Rwanda with stakeholders should set up a land governance monitoring framework to help
determine how the recognition of land rights is implemented in practice and identify issues
arising.
In terms of land administration, a comprehensive business/strategic plan should be created
to provide a basis for a refocussed organisation, where service delivery, organisational
structure and IT development are the key priorities for delivering secure and reliable
services. Given that the current land administration framework is built on LTR requirements
which are almost complete, the new business development policy must be refocused on
sustainability.


Chapter 1: Introduction
Land is an extremely scarce resource in this densely populated, mountainous country,
where land disputes were one of the causes of the violence that the country experienced.
The government decided to invest in land reform and has provided continuous political
support. The land sector in Rwanda has undergone fundamental reforms since the 1990s,
aimed at increasing tenure security of landowners, improving land management and land
use, establishing a land institutional framework, and a legal and regulatory framework for
the land sector. Since the completion in 2012 of the land tenure regularisation programme
with all land parcel recorded, RNRA through the Department of Lands and Mapping is
                                             9
focusing on enhancing the sustainability of the land administration system, expanding
service delivery, and ensuring that land information is complete, reliable and current.
Rwanda has made significant progress in land administration and land management and is
setting an example for other countries.

However, the legal and institutional reform and implementation of the land tenure
regularisation reform programme has not come without challenges, and the completion of
the LTR process raises new questions of maintenance and sustainability of what was
achieved for increasing tenure security, further expanding land governance to underpin
national land use, urban development, reducing land disputes, economic development and
improving livelihoods of landowners.

LGAF provides a systematic approach to assess key dimensions of land governance at
country level by Rwandan experts and in a way that is technical, comprehensive, provides a
benchmark, is participatory, and generates priorities for next steps. The framework
assessment provides the basis for a routine monitoring system to track progress towards a
well-functioning land governance system.

The framework will facilitate comparison with other countries, identify potential good
practice, address priorities, and provide other countries interested in better understanding
Rwanda’s achievements to exchange experience and good practice and participate
effectively in regional initiatives. Rwanda is also increasingly serving as a model to countries
engaging in land tenure regularization, and LGAF will help to communicate the
achievements and challenges in a more systematic way. Rwanda will thus be able to learn
from more advanced countries and serve as a model to those countries whose systems are
less sophisticated.

LGAF contributes to identifying and quantifying achievements, gaps and bottlenecks in
policy, legislation, and institutional practice; identifies knowledge gaps and data needs and
sets out possibilities for addressing these. The LGAF process involves stakeholders from
within the various government branches, academia, and civil society, and encourages
dialogues amongst these land experts on the status of land governance and requirements
for improving capacity.

Chapter 2: Methodological approach

LGAF is a country level, independent and comprehensive assessment guided by a framework
of indicators, and undertaken by local experts using existing data and information. The LGAF
assessment combines an analysis of the policy and institutional framework, with an
assessment of the actual practice of implementation. It does so by compiling available data,
information and experience, and drawing on expertise from all levels within government,
academia, CSO/NGO and the private sector. The participatory process used consists of a
series of steps to arrive at a shared assessment of the status of land governance in the
country and agreed priorities.

The LGAF development was coordinated by the World Bank in collaboration with a range of
organizations and a steering committee composed of African Union, FAO, IFAD, UN-Habitat
and IFPRI). Although LGAF precedes the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance of
Tenure of Land, Fisheries, and Forests in the Context of National Food Security” (VGGT),
endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) in 2012, it’s development was
inspired by the consultations leading to the guidelines. The LGAF methodology piloting
started in 2010, was published in 20121 with a peer reviewed article in 20142.


LGAF Framework is based on international standards of good land governance and
constructed around nine thematic modules, each composed of land indicators and
dimensions, with predefined scores from A to D. The scoring is, as much as possible,
quantified with the thresholds being defined according to what is regarded internationally
as good practice. Country teams draw their own conclusions based on available evidence.
The modules or panels are: land tenure recognition; forest and common lands, and rural
land use regulations; urban land use, planning, and development; public land management;
transfer of large tracks of land to investors; public provision of land information; land
taxation and valuation; land disputes resolution; and institutional arrangements and
policies. The scores indicate where a country is doing well and areas for improvement. The
score given for each dimension was assessed against existing legal and/or regulatory
frameworks and established practice. In certain areas, although regulatory tools such as
laws and orders exist, they are not effectively implemented mainly due to a lack of human
and financial resources, institutional capacity, or a lack of clarity.

Quality assurance and technical guidance and support to country-teams implementing
LGAF is coordinated by the LGAF Secretariat and provided by Technical Advisory Groups

(TAG) of key African experts for each of the panel areas. This approach helped to boost the
reliability of the score and provide key policy recommendations for implementation.


The framework provides a format that facilitates the communication of findings and
recommendations with policy makers. LGAF3 thus identifies how arrangements in countries
compare to global good practice in key areas of good governance identified as: (i) how land
tenure and rights to land are defined, recognised, can be exchanged, and are transformed;
(ii) how public oversight over land use, management, and taxation is exercised; (iii) how the
extent of land owned by the State is defined, how the State exercises its management
responsibility, acquires or disposes of land, such as for large-scale land based investments;
(iv) the management of land information and ways in which it can be accessed; (v) avenues
of resolving and managing disputes, and holding land administration services to account.
Local Rwandan experts were tasked with carrying out LGAF and their reports were discussed
in panels. The list of experts and panel members is presented in annex 3. Their background
is academia (4); Government (22); CSO/NGO, private sector and independent consultants
(21) - where 85% were men and 15% were women.

Following agreement from Government, the LGAF assessment started in October 2014.
Background reports were completed by January 2015 and reviewed by the TAG. Panels were
completed by February 2015. The draft synthesis report by June 2015 and submitted for
review. Validation was undertaken in January 2016.4

Justification for the score: where dimensions score A (highlighted in green in the report), it
does not necessarily mean that there is no room for improvement. Maintenance of this
score also requires continuous effort. Similarly, dimensions that score D (highlighted in red
further in the report) does not mean that there are no positives, rather, that the amount of
effort required is higher than what is already in place (for example, one dimension may
score D only because the law in place has not been implemented or is in the process of
being implemented, and as such, the impact is not yet visible).

  In 2011, the Rwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development (RISD) coordinate a LGAF in Rwanda and
prepared a draft report, but this was not validated as the government was undertaking significant reforms
(review land legislation and the institution framework in 2013) making the analysis and assessments
outdated. Key challenges identified were already addressed. In 2014, LGAF was resumed.

Chapter 3: Background to Rwanda’s economic development and land
         sector
         3.1. Availability of land and development
Rwanda is a small, densely populated country of 26,338 km2 (of which 75% is agricultural
land – WDI) located in central east Africa. In 2012, there were 11 million Rwandans with
2.8% population growth5, estimated to have increased to 11,7m, of which 28% live in urban
areas. Urbanization is a combination of natural population growth, rural-urban migration
and the return of refugees6 with Kigali having 1.2 million people. . The average population
density of 490 pp/km2 (2014 - global development indicators), which is the highest for
Africa. Agriculture is predominantly rain-fed, employs almost 80% of the population, who
farm on 0,1ha/capita and contributes 33% to GDP (2014 -GDI)7. Land holdings are
fragmented – the average household possesses four plots of land.


As the most densely populated country in Africa, Rwanda has long faced the challenge of
establishing a land system that would provide incentives for investment and rational land
use to create economic opportunities, while at the same time overcoming gender biases in
land access.

         3.2. Land tenure system in pre-colonial Rwanda
Political management in pre-colonial Rwanda was based on the control of the economic
system which was founded on three pillars, namely land ownership for agricultural
purposes, livestock and security. These rights were enjoyed under the supreme protection
of the King and had a feudal character. The main aspects of land tenure in pre-colonial
Rwanda were8:

“Ubukonde” or clan rights, held by the chief of the clan, who was the first land-clearer.
The chief could own vast tracts of land on which he would resettle several families, known
as “Abagererwa”. The latter enjoyed land rights, subject to some customary conditions.

“Igikingi “ or right to grazing land, granted by the king or one of his chiefs known as
“Umutware w’umukenke”, to any family that reared livestock.

“Inkungu” or custom, enabling and authorizing the local political authority, on his own or
on others’ behalf, to own abandoned or escheated land. These lands were considered as a
sort of land reserve which the ruler of the time could grant to anybody who needed one.

“Gukeba” referred to the process of settling families onto the grazing land or fallow land.
Gukeba, or Kugaba, as it was sometimes called, was an exercise within the province of the
local authority.

In charge of good management was the chief in charge of the land, “Umutware w’ubutaka”,
and a chief in charge of livestock, “Umutware w’umukenke”, both considered being at the
same level as the chief of the army, “Umutware w’ingabo”.


         3.3. Land tenure system during colonial rule9
German colonization started right after the end of the 19th century and lasted till 1916. The
German colonial authorities recognized the King’s authority over land from whom the first
Catholic and Protestant missions bought land and thus became land owners.

The changes introduced by Belgian colonization led to the dismantling of the traditional
system and its transformation into a centralized administration. In order to exercise control
of the country more effectively and get colonial orders accepted, a reform was introduced in
1926 that divided the country into chieftainships and abolished the system by which a chief
could own several land properties in different parts of the country, which had been a factor
of national unity and cohesion. Belgian colonial authorities also introduced written law
appearing in the “codes and laws of Rwanda”, in order to guarantee land tenure security for
settlers and other foreigners wishing to invest in land in Rwanda. Only the Colonial Public
Officer could guarantee the right to use the “vacant” land taken from indigenous Rwandan
systems, and land use should be accompanied by a title deed. This was not seen as
dispossession as vacant land was considered as state-owned land. This provision introduced
the duality of systems in the country’s land tenure system.

All other occupied land remained subject to customary law, and only settlers and other
foreigners could benefit from the new written law system that was protected by the colonial
administration. The written law applied also to Catholic, Protestant and Seventh Adventist
Missions owned land (decree of 24/01/43 concerning free transfers and concessions of land
to scientific and religious associations as well as to parastatals), urban districts, as well as
trading and business centres.

From 1959 onwards, the land tenure system became a factor of real conflict among groups
within the population. It was during this period that, with the eruption of the political crisis,
the first ever wave of refugees went into exile, leaving behind both their land and real
estate properties.

3.4. Land tenure system after Independence10
Compared to the colonial period, the situation has not changed much after independence in
1960 as 90% of the country’s arable land remained governed by customary law. The written
land law still applied to a small number of persons and religious congregations, mostly
located in urban areas and business communities.

While at the beginning of the 60’s the Government banked on abolishing the system of
“Ibikingi” in order to put them under the authority of the “Communes” and on recovering
the land abandoned by the 1959 refugees to acquire new agricultural land, the 1970-1980
decade was characterized by intensive migration from the already densely populated
regions of Gikongoro, Ruhengeri, Gisenyi and Kibuye to the semi-arid savannas of the East
(Umutara, Kibungo and Bugesera) in search for vacant land. It is during this period that the
Government attempted to transform the existing human settlement system into one of
grouped homesteads, known as the “paysannat”. The purpose was to make more rational
the occupation and use of land which was becoming more and more scarce

The new Government gave an important role to the “Communes”11 in the administration of
land, and through the “Loi Communale” of 23/1/63, the protection of rights relating to
registered land under the customary law became the responsibility of the “Commune”.
However, the provisions of this law were virtually nullified by Decree No. 09/76 concerning
the purchase and sale of customary land rights or land use rights that authorized individuals
to purchase and sell customary land after an application to the competent authorities, and
subject to the original owner retaining at least 2 ha of land. The buyer was also to justify
that he did not have land property equal to at least 2 ha. Ever since, the Government
recognized only the right of ownership based on land registration and became, therefore,
the eminent land owner of all non- documented customary land.

At the beginning of the 80s, there were no more new lands. From an average of 2 ha in 1960
per household, this was reduced to 1.2 ha in 1984 (agricultural survey data). Problems of
land scarcity began to emerge, such as decline in soil fertility and insufficient land for
cultivation, more food shortages, family conflicts over land ownership, growing number of
landless peasants, and conflict between agriculture, livestock and natural reserves etc.
From the 90s onwards, the country found itself in a land-related deadlock of low
productivity and degradation. At the same time, through agricultural projects, particularly
forestry and grazing land projects, the government strengthened its role as the owner of
vast stretches of land with reforestation becoming an important factor in land accumulation

by the State and private individuals, but also taking farmland out of production as forests
extended in lands fit for crops as well as marshlands.

The socio-political situation became increasingly unstable in the period around
independence and marked by eruptions of violence that forced a significant number of
Rwandans to flee the country in 1959, leaving behind their property which was thereafter
allocated to other Rwandans by the government, or occupied illegally. These tensions and
conflicts culminated in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi and the failure to meet the land
system challenges has been identified as a contributing factor.
There was a dual tenure system with the majority of land continued to be held under
customary tenure while a small proportion of urban land held under statutory law. There
was no proper land policy or land law, except for a few scattered land regulations, and very
restrictive written law that enhanced this duality, giving rise to insecurity, instability and
precariousness of land tenure.

3.5. Land situation after 1994
The death and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans and the massive return
of refugees led to the systematic destruction of existing wooded areas (an estimated 50,000
ha was cut or damaged), abandoning and destruction of anti-erosion structures and a quasi-
anarchical takeover of protected zones, namely the Akagera National Park and the Gishwati
natural reserve.

After 1994, reconstruction and resettlement programs, over-cutting of forests for energy
purposes (since over 97% of households use wood as a source of energy) by orphanages,
prisons, schools and tea factories increased the pressure on wood resources. The losses
were alarming.

After the genocide, the need to resolve land issues became all the more urgent. In the
aftermath of the genocide, there was a lack of clarity over legal status and rights to land,
with successive waves of landowners returning to Rwanda to find their land occupied by
others.12 As new and old refugees returned home, land became increasingly scarce and in
many parts of the country, land disputes increased. Old case refugees (those who fled the
country in 1959) tried to reclaim land that was already occupied by others. The surge in
population led to the occupation of park reserves, deforestation, land degradation and
increasing landlessness.

Various interim and short-term initiatives aimed at resolving these problems were
established, though not legally binding. For example, government attempted to resolve
individual disputes by encouraging land sharing between alleged “owners” of land. In urban

                                             16
areas, “Tent Temporary Permanent programmes” were set up where people were allocated
pieces of land and were provided iron sheets to build roofs on a temporary basis, although
as time went by, they would be recognized owners of the parcel of land allocated to them.
By the late 1990s, the GoR recognized land as a critical issue in the country’s long-term
development. Since then, enormous effort have been undertaken by the government of
Rwanda to clarify land rights and provide the basis for overcoming traditional biases,
culminating in the LTR programme.

In 2003, the New Constitution for Rwanda stated “Every person has the right to private
property” (Article 29)13. The NLP14 and OLL15followed. The OLL outlined new procedures for
land tenure and titling, registering and administering land and land titles, and guidance for
land use and land development. LTR was to be the tool to implement the new provisions, as
far as land registration is concerned.

The GoR’s Vision 2020 and 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) list land as a
priority. By supporting the land sector, GoR was aiming to achieve three things: promote the
land market, mainly through the mortgage industry, increased productivity (through the
consolidation of land holdings and greater incentives to invest in agriculture); hence
economic development and reduced social tensions following the genocide.

The GoR expects that land tenure reform will strengthen tenure security, promotes rational
use of available land, support fair and transparent land markets, increase investments and
thus achieve social, as well as economic growth and development. Rwanda development
strategy is guided by Vision 2020, approved in 2000, which identified 6 priority areas that
together should lead to poverty reduction. These areas are (1) Good political and economic
governance, (2) Rural economic transformation; (3) Development of services and
manufacturing; (4) Human resource development; (5) Development and promotion of the
private sector; and (6) Regional and international economic integration (see annex for more
detail)16. Implementation is guided by the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction
Strategy (EDPRS) for which phase 1 is completed ( 2007-2012) and phase 2 started in 2013
with four thematic areas: (i) Economic transformation; (ii) Rural development; (iii)
Productivity and Youth Employment; and (iv) Accountable Governance. Rwanda has made
significant progress on development indicators for education, health, water, infrastructure,
and agriculture17. The GDP per capita was USD 652 in 2014 and increased with 7% in the

39.1% in 201418.

3.6. Legal reform
To provide secure land tenure to all Rwandans and create preconditions for structural
transformation, far-reaching legal and institutional changes were embarked upon.
The Rwanda Constitution was voted in 2003 and is the primary legal document which
recognises the right to private ownership of land and other rights to land which are granted
by the State (See Articles 29-32)..

Based on animated debate, the NLP put forward general principles for efficient and
sustainable use of scarce land resources and the general framework for the legal, regulatory
and institutional reform. The NLP aim is to resolve land issues and spur economic
development through land reform19.
The NLP was codified in the OLL that provides the legal bases and creates institutional
structures for accessible land administration at national and local levels. The OLL/land law of
2013 recognizes customarily acquired land and makes first-time registration of all land
(whether publicly or privately owned) and recording of follow up transfers compulsory. It
recognises both leasehold and freehold tenure types and the upgrade from leasehold to
freehold. It also provides for controls on accessing land for investments. The land law also
limits foreigner rights to leasehold, streamlining land use control procedures and
requisition. One of its key provisions is to establish a single statutory system of land tenure
that vests land ownership with the state and provides users with long-term usufruct rights
(up to 99 years, depending on land use) that can be sold, passed on to heirs, mortgaged,
leased, or otherwise transferred. The law prohibits sub-division of agricultural land parcels
less than one ha; requires approval for any subdivision of parcels; and lays the basis for land
expropriation (with compensation) in the public interest. The law also sets various
obligations related to the protection and promotion of land and reserve areas, including
wetlands and parks, to ensure efficient use of land.

To achieve these aims, the OLL provides for a set of secondary (implementing) legislation
and an institutional framework to guide and govern land tenure reform in Rwanda. Most of
this secondary legislation is in force and land governing institutions that were established
for this purpose are fully operational.

       The 2005 OLL20 determines the use and management of land management and was
       promulgated and amended in June 2013. Objectives are:

           Recognition and protection of land rights (written or unwritten) of all land owners
            (nationals as well as foreigners);
           Abolition of any form of discrimination in land ownership (i.e. women and men have
            equal rights to land);
           Categorisation of land depending on land use (i.e. residential, commercial,
            agriculture, reserve etc.) and ownership (individual, State etc.);
           Most land to be held under long term lease (from 15 to 99 years);
           Allocation of State land through open competition;
           Special conditions for conservation and exploitation of land;
           Obligation to register all land owned; and
           Prescription period.



3.7. Institutional context
Rwanda has five levels of local administration. It is divided into four provinces (North, South,
East and West) and the city of Kigali, 30 districts (of which three are within Kigali), 416
sectors, 2,146 cells, and 14,876 villages (umudugudu). Provinces are a liaison for
coordinating district development planning with the national policies and programmes and
supervise implementation at district level. Districts are responsible for local economic
development planning and coordinating delivery of public services. Sectors coordinate the
delivery of public services and collect monitoring data and information, while cells prioritize
needs and mobilize community support. Villages have no specific administrative functions
(Republic of Rwanda 2007).

Until 2006, Rwanda had no clear land institutional framework with land-related
responsibilities spread across different ministries (ministries21 responsible for lands,
infrastructure and housing; agriculture, water and forestry; rehabilitation and refugees,
etc.). Land issues were dealt with at central level with limited involvement of local
government and there were two registrars of land titles (rural lands and urban land outside
Kigali by the ministry of lands; urban land in Kigali by the Mayor of Kigali city).

The NLP and the OLL required the establishment of a land institutional framework and, in
2006, a new legislation was passed to set up various land institutions.22 The OLL amendment

     In Rwanda the hierarchy of law is as follows: (i) constitution, (ii) organic law, (iii) law, (iv) presidential order
and (v) ministerial order.

in 2013 abolished land commissions, established in 2006, as their existence was becoming
less important given the progress with land registration, but introduced sector land
managers to ease service delivery at local level

Currently, RNRA is the overall leading agency responsible for land administration, and works
closely with MINIRENA for land administration policy and legal formulation, and the zonal
registrar’s office and district land office for implementation. RNRA is also the leading agency
in land use planning. There are other ministries and agencies (listed in Annexe 1) which tend
to work mainly at sector level. The National Land Center (NLC) was formed in 2006 as the
technical agency in charge with national and district land commissions providing oversight,
and housed the Office of the Registrar of Land Titles (with five registrar of land titles). In
2011, NLC was integrated into RNRA as the Department of Land and Mapping.

At the decentralised level, district land commissions, Kigali city land commission and district
land offices were created as well as sector and cell land committees. At district, town, and
municipality level, District Land Bureaux (DLBs) are responsible for land administration and
land use planning. They are complemented by land committees at sector and cell levels
which serve as focal points for land registration and land use planning to facilitate
decentralized and participatory OLL implementation.

3.8. Institutional framework for urban land

Urbanization and Human Settlement Sector is under the coordinating responsibility of the
Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA). The implementing agencies belonging to MININFRA
are: Rwanda Housing Authority (RHA); Office National de Transport en Commun
(ONATRACOM); Road Maintenance Fund (RMF); Rwanda Transport Development Agency
(RTDA); Rwanda Civil Aviation Authority (RCAA); the Water and Sanitation Authority
(WASAC); and Rwanda Energy Group (REG).

RHA was established in November 2010 with the aim of restructuring and organizing urban
development and the construction industries. Its overall mission is “to implement the
national housing and construction policy through coordination, conception, development,
monitoring and evaluation of actions and programs”. RHA since 2014 also hosts the Rural
Settlements Program which links rural communities to the area of land use and human
settlement planning, and supports “imidugudu” development and implementation.

The responsibilities for urban, rural, economic and sectoral planning are supervised by
different Ministries, especially urban and human settlement development by MININFRA,
land use planning by MINIRENA, and economic development planning by MINECOFIN,



functioning and the composition of Land Commissions; Prime Minister’s Order N° 17/03 of 09/10/2006 establishing the Task Force in
charge of land reform and management in Rwanda; and Ministerial Order N° 001/2006 of 26/09/2006 determining the structure of Land
Registers, the responsibilities and the functioning of the District Land Bureau.
                                                              20
MINICOM, MINALOC, MINAGRI, and all sectors. Notwithstanding the said-advantages of
shared responsibilities, significant challenges are observed in overlapping duties.

MINIRENA is responsible for land use management, ensuring sustainable land use and for
the conservation of the natural environment. MININFRA remains responsible for habitat and
urban infrastructure planning. MINIRENA is also involved in exploration for available local
construction materials.

The Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) is interacting with the urbanization and
human settlement sector trough Districts and the City of Kigali for the implementation of
planning documents.

RNRA is one of two implementing agencies under MINIRENA and is responsible for land
administration and management. It maintains a country-wide cadastre for the support of
the district land offices. It collaborates on flood planning and integrated water resource
management aspects of urbanization planning and regulations.

Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA) is the implementing agency of
MINIRENA and is consulted on all issues regarding environmental impact of town planning
and building projects. It posts a technician in the COK OSC to coordinate with the
construction permit administration.

RDB collaborates with the MININFRA in attracting private investment in public infrastructure
specifically in town planning and buildings.

Land management and urban and human settlement planning is currently located in two
different Ministries, with districts responsible for the management and administration of
land resources. The One Stop Centre is a department in the district structure which is
responsible for all development related services, and integrates land use management, land
administration, planning, development authorization and inspection. The district structure
has recently been revised to accommodate all aspects of local development management,
and the number of staff accommodated in the district structure has significantly increased.
The structure further distinguishes between urban and rural districts, and this make way for
higher adequacy of administrative capacities of Secondary City Districts. Currently, the
district One Stop Centers are not staffed according to the new structure, but measures to
facilitate staffing are being taken at national government level and with responsible
institutions.

Since 2010, academia and training institutions have established land administration
programmes and research, and include INES, University of Rwanda, and Umutara
Polytechnic. Particularly NGOs and farmer associations are organised in LandNet Rwanda
Chapter, established in 2000, coordinated by RISD. LandNet has 35 members.

Private sector service provider organizations: From 2010, the IRPV, a professional body of
land valuers, has been active in Rwanda. Institutes of urban planners and land surveyors are
also in the process of being established. Private land surveyors and land valuers tend also to
work in urban areas where land owners can afford independent assessments.

Consultancy services land administration and land use: The private sector’s role in both land
use planning and land administration is still limited. Private companies (generally
international) are hired to design these tools. However, implementation of the plans
remains the sole responsibility of government agencies.

Estate and project developers: estate developers are involved to a limited extent in the
implementation of plans in urban areas.

There are also projects working on various land related issues. For example, the USAID LAND
project focuses primarily in providing capacity building to local research organisations to do
evidence-based research that would help address policy making. In this regard, the project
has produced various research papers on gender, land administration sustainability, land
based revenues and land use consolidation etc. Results from the research have been shared
with responsible government institutions for consideration.

3.9. Land tenure regularization (LTR) programme
LTR aimed at clarifying rights on all of the country’s estimated 10 million land parcels as a
precondition for their formalization and full legal recognition, manifested in the award of
title certificates to land holders (Sagashya and English 2010).23 The costs were calculated at
7,69 US$ per parcel title plus lease contract (including the cost of aerial photography) (see
HTSPE24).

From the outset, the LTR programme was ambitious given its timescale, coverage and cost.
The realities of implementation required amendments to be made and flexibility on the part
of development partners, beneficiaries and implementing agents regarding changes in time,
scale, cost and targets.

Government buy-in, ownership and political will were essential for the success of the
programme in order to ensure that the necessary legal reforms were undertaken in time.
The performance accountability systems and governance structures that were in place in

23
  As is usual in programs of this nature, LTR aims to formalize rights to land already possessed by land users.
24
  The fee is RWF 1000 (US$ 1.84 at the 2008 rate) per parcel or about RWF 4000 (US$ 7.36) per household taking the national average of
four parcels per household. This compares to a cost of approximately US$ 9-11 in the pilot—since then reduced to about US$ 5—per parcel.
                                                                  25
Rwanda also contributed to the programme’s success. Central government was able to
mobilise local administrative structures to support the LTR process, such as Cell Land
Committees. Additionally, the NLC (currently Lands and Mapping department of RNRA)
demonstrated dedicated leadership and ownership. It closely monitored Land Tenure
Regularization Support Project (LTRSP) team performance and led weekly LTR management
meetings to assess project’s implementation progress, respond to issues that needed quick
attention and provide further guidance. This gave them the opportunity to discuss any
issues; it was noted that they took quick decisions based on lessons learned in the previous
week’s field and back office operations.

Key steps undertaken in LTR process are documented in a manual that sets out procedures
for implementation of LTR by mobile teams in campaign-style and which was continuously
updated and improved based on feedback from implementation (Republic of Rwanda Office
of the Registrar of Land Titles 2009). After declaration of an area as subject to adjudication
and conduct of stakeholder sensitization programs, locally trained para-surveyors
demarcated parcel boundaries in the field in the presence of land owners and all adjoining
neighbours, marked them on an aerial photo to create a parcel index map and, for
undisputed parcels,25 issued a claim receipt. This receipt contained the names of the rightful
claimants. The claim receipts were signed by the rightful claimants. . Information from the
receipt was transcribed to a registry book, digitized in the central office, and together with
the parcel index map, displayed publicly. If no objections were raised within a public display
period of at least two weeks, the information is formally registered, allowing award of a
formal certificate upon payment of a nominal fee.
The 14 steps used were as follows:26

1 Notification of areas for the LTR programme
  District, sector and cell authorities are notified about LTR commencing within the next
  three months.

2 Cell index map and field sheet production
  The cell boundary dataset is taken from the Bureau of Statistics and overlaid onto the
  orthophoto image. The Field Manager (FM) then walks the cell boundary together with
  the Cell Executive Secretary. If necessary, the boundary will be corrected.
  Then, numbered rectangular polygons are arranged to cover the entire cell area with an
  overlap of 5%. Scales vary: 1:1.000 for Kigali, 1:1.500 for South, West and North
  provinces, 1:2.000 for the East province. ArcGIS 9.3 and DS Mapbook (open source) are

25
  Parcels, the ownership claims to which are disputed, are recorded in a separate dispute register. Disputed claims can then be pursued
separately through either administrative or judicial channels with the possibility of legal NGOs playing an important role in moving the
process along.

   the software packages used for batch printing of one copy of the Field Sheet and four
   copies of the index map.

3 Mobilisation, Public awareness raising
  On a cell level general meeting, led by the FM, the public is suitably informed and made
  aware of LTR, of their rights and involvement in the process. Flyers and booklets are
  distributed. For the urban population there are records of song, dance and drama, as
  well as a website.

4 Training of para-surveyors (PS) and Adjudication Committee
  10 PSs are recruited in each cell after a test from a number of applicants and trained by
  a PS-trainer (from a completed cell) to read a map and trace a physical boundary on a
  field sheet. They will form four teams with two each (plus 2 PS in reserve).
  The cell land committee appoints the Adjudication Committee of 8 members who are
  then are trained in legal matters around LTR by the FM and/or an experienced trainer.

5 Demarcation
  The PS traces the parcel boundary on the field sheet walking around the parcel with the
  claimant, the neighbours and the village leader. No markers are placed. A unique parcel
  number is given and annotated. The claimants then get a Demarcation Receipt and are
  instructed to take it immediately to the Adjudication Committee to register their claim.
  Disputes about claims are referred to the Adjudication Committee, but the boundary of
  the parcel is demarcated. Where the line of a boundary is disputed it will be marked on
  the field sheet and also left to the adjudication committee, the village leader or a special
  mediator to be resolved.

6 Adjudication
  The Adjudication Committee books all legally necessary information about the
  claimant(s) in the claims register under the claim receipt number. Disputes subsisting
  after 30 minutes of discussion and advice are entered into the disputes register and the
  parties referred to the mediator or a court. This is a first occasion to pay the registration
  fee of 1.000 RWF in rural areas and other cities other than Kigali City (5.000 RWF in
  Kigali).

7 Data entry and checking
  Data from the claims register, dispute register, field sheets, claim receipt books and
  dispute receipt books are entered sector by sector into the database LTRSS at the Zonal
  Office, and checked for plausibility.

8 Parcel Digitisation (parallel to 7)

                                              27
   Field sheets are scanned, then geo-referenced (in QGIS, also open source software).
   Heads-up digitisation of all parcel boundaries follows under their UPI and the calculation
   of the area in m². Finally a cell map is printed on one or more A0 sheets, with villages
   colour-coded and parcels with their UPI.

9 Objections and corrections (O&C)
  O&C starts in all cells of a sector at the same time and lasts 2 weeks under the
  responsibility of the FM and a special O&C committee. All claimants can inspect the cell
  maps and their data. If necessary, changes can be made of every data collected.

10 Data corrections after O&C (parallel to 11)
   The LTRSS database is corrected with the information obtained during the O&C period.

11 Post-O&C parcel correction in the GIS, cadastral extract generation
   With all geometric data now correct, for each parcel an extract is generated (in jpeg
   format), showing the parcel and its adjacent neighbours, with the UPI.

12 Lease preparation
   A (collated) lease document contains four pieces: original and duplicate lease contract,
   certificate of emphyteutic lease and parcel cadastral extract. The certificate is sealed,
   whilst the contract and extract are stamped.

13 Lease issuance
   After another intensive public awareness campaign, the public in a cell is informed in a
   meeting that the lease issuance shall begin in one week and last four weeks.
   Now the claimant has to pay the fee, when picking up the documents. The duplicate
   contracts are collected and sent to Kigali for scanning and archiving.

14 Migrating LTRSS data to LAIS
   In this final step, all data shall be migrated sector by sector from the LTRSS to the LAIS
   Maintenance Database. During a few days the LTRSS is blocked for ongoing transaction,
   after which the LAIS takes over this task.

Key innovative approaches to land rights recognition

   1. Use of modern technology in registering land rights: Rwanda has used aerial
      photography in demarcating individual plots. This process was made easier to
      be understood by local community who implemented the programme;

   2. Land demarcation and recording of individual land rights was done by locally
      trained community members. Procedures and processes were clear and local
      people were trained on how to implement them. This made the process
      quicker, easier and transparent;

   3. Increased awareness campaign at different level of administration: various
      communication campaigns were used including TV, Radio, newspaper, church
      gatherings, meetings etc

   4. Liking land use to tenure recognition. There is clear linkage between land
      tenure system adopted by Rwanda and land use. Article 27 of law n° 43/2013
      of 16/06/2013 governing land in Rwanda provides that “all land leases and
      land transactions shall respect the land use plans of the area where the land is
      located”. That is why it is provided on every land title the use designated for
      the land.

   5. Linking the digital land register (land administration information system-
      LAIS) to other services. As of now, the Rwanda land register is linked to banks
      for mortgage registration, national identification project, tax authority
      (Rwanda Revenue Authority) and to Kigali city master plan. Plans are
      underway to connect LAIS to the six secondary cities which are: Rusizi,
      Rubavu, Musanze, Nyagatare, Huye and Muhanga.

   6. Recognition of women’s land rights: women in legal (and later also informal)
      marriages were registered as co-owners along their husbands; single women
      were registered as defacto owners and in some cases women were registered
      as people with interest on the land.

3.10. Land use and distribution of land by tenure type and conditions

The total surface area of Rwanda is of 2,633,800 hectares, arable land is 1.4 million
hectares, which is about 52% of the total surface area of the country. However, due the high
population density and heavy pressure on the land resource, the actual area cultivated has
reached about 1.6 million ha in recent years, thus bringing the total land under use to
almost 61% of the total surface area of the Country (UNDP/SLM, 2008; REMA, 2009)27. A
recent inventory of wetland resources in the Country shows that they represent 278.536 ha,
equivalent to 10.6% of the total surface area (REMA, 2009)28. The water body (lakes and
rivers) represent a total surface area of 176,050 ha equivalent to around 6.6% of the total
surface area of the Country (REMA, 2009)29.


A recent forest inventory shows that the total forest cover is about 640,00030 ha, when
including also trees on small parcels <0.5 ha , equivalent to about 28,8% of the total surface
area of the Country (National Forest Cover, 2013). Grazing land consist of two main areas: a
part of Gishwati forest and a part of the Akagera National Park.

Seven types of swamps are found in Rwanda, classified on the basis of: relief, altitude, soil
type, vegetation, hydrology and size of the swamp, slope of the watershed and population
density. Main functions of swamps include agriculture production, hydrological functions,
biodiversity reservoirs, leisure and tourism and cultural value. Given the importance of
swamps ecosystems in terms of ecosystem and provisioning services a vulnerability criterion
has been developed to assist with management. However, the conversion of swamps to
agricultural production has increased rapidly over the last two decades due to the acute
scarcity of agricultural land. To a great degree, the Government supports this swamps
development with the aim of boosting agricultural production, revitalizing the rural
economy and reducing poverty. As far as swamp land tenure is concerned, Article 19 of the
land law stipulates that “Swamp land belongs to the State. It shall not definitively be
allocated to individuals and no person can use the ground of holding it for a long time to
justify the definitive takeover of the land. However, it may be lent to a person based on
agreement concluded between both parties”. This is a source of dispute in the case of
swamp lands having been cultivated for decades.

About 40% (800,000 ha.) of Rwanda’s land is classified by the FAO as having a very high
erosion risk, 37% requires soil retention measures before cultivation, and only 23% of the

   This figure is different to what is reported in the land register. Areas used for forest plantation increase
every day therefore this may have not been captured during the land registration campaign which ended in
most art of the country by June 2012.

cultivated land is more or less free from risk of erosion. As regards soil fertility, a high
proportion of has significant acidity, 75% of the land is “highly degraded,” and overall it has
one of the highest negative nutrient balances in sub-Saharan Africa31.

The Ministerial Order No. 002-2008 defines modalities for land registration including the
establishment of a Register of Land Titles, procedures for the registration of titles to land
and other interests in land, transfers of title to land and other transactions related to land,
and related matters. It provides for two types of certificates of land rights – the Certificate
of Registration of Conditional Freehold Title or Freehold Title and a Certificate of
Registration of Emphyteutic Lease. Ministerial Order No. 001-2008 determines the
requirements and procedures for land lease. There is also condominium title as provided for
by law No. 15/2010 of 07/05/2010 creating and organizing condominiums and setting up
procedures for registration. Condominium titles have already started to be issued in urban
areas. There is need, however, for this law to be disseminated widely to ensure awareness.

It is not possible for agricultural land to be upgraded from leasehold to freehold. However,
residential land (in urban areas), commercial land, industrial and social land use may be
upgraded if the requisite standards and building conditions are met.

The majority of land is held under a long-term lease (known as emphyteutic lease) which
varies from 15 years to 99 years. The difference in lease term depends on what the land is
designated for (e.g. agricultural land has a 99 year lease whereas residential land has a 20
year lease).

It is important to note that state land in the private domain can become individual land once
an allocation is made by the state to a private party (i.e. Kigali city and district land allocated

destined use.

    Chapter 4: Results of land governance assessments by theme and
       indicator

This chapter sets out a summary of LGAF results from all 27 indicators and 120 dimensions
assessed across all nine panels. It provides key challenges facing each panel and key
innovations Rwanda has achieved under each panel.

Dimension scores highlighted in green (score A) do not necessarily mean that there is no
room for improvement. Maintenance of this score also requires continuous effort. Similarly,
scores highlighted in red (D) do not mean that there are no positives, rather, that the
amount of effort required is higher than what is already in place (for example, one
dimension may score D only because the law in place has not been implemented or is in the
process of being implemented but the impact is not yet visible).

         4.1. Recognition of land rights

As mentioned earlier, the Rwanda LTR programme aims at recognizing land rights of
claimants through a mass land registration and titling campaign. This marks the shift from a
dominant customary tenure system to a statutory tenure arrangement. With this move, it is
expected that recognition of rights people have on land would give them more security to
their land, would encourage them to invest, would promote peace and stability and reduce
land related disputes. After the regularisation of over 11 million parcels, the section below
assesses how the recognition of land rights is done, what types of land rights are held by
individuals and how are they protected. Also, the section would provide insight on issues
related to land rights recognition that are pending and makes recommendations towards
improving land rights recognition and full enjoyment.

Recognition of land rights is made of two key land governance indicators which are:
    LGI1: Recognition of a continuum of rights: the law recognizes a range of rights
      held by individuals (incl. secondary rights of tenants. sharecroppers, women etc.)
    LGI2: Respect for and enforcement of rights.

The land law governing land in Rwanda is well drafted and recognises individual land rights
for both rural and urban land (whether acquired from custom or from formal law).

        Law N° 43/2013 of 16/06/2013 governing land in Rwanda states that: Every person who is in
        possession of land, acquired either in accordance with custom, or granted by a competent authority,
        or by purchase, is the recognized proprietor under a long term lease. According to articles 29 and 30
        of the Constitution (2003) and article 3 of the OLL, “… land is part of the common heritage of all the
        Rwandan people: the ancestors, present and future generations ”. Further, article 4 of the same
        lawstates that “all forms of discrimination, such as that based on sex or origin, in relation to access to
        land and the enjoyment of real rights shall be prohibited ”.

Disputes on former tenure rights were avoided by the abrogation of all former tenure rights
(Article 87, OLL 2005). Conflicts were therefore limited to boundary conflicts which were
successfully mitigated through mediation in the field. Only 11.840 cases, some 0,1% of all
inventorized parcels, remained in dispute and were not registered. These are mostly family
disputes over inheritance39. However, the law is not well known by the population or even
by some local leaders. If this is not addressed, it might lead to further land rights abuses.

All customary rights have been converted into written rights in a form of long term lease.
The NLP and OLL stipulated that all customary land rights and land use rights will be legally
granted and documented by the competent authority with the beneficiary receiving rights
of ownership through a long lease, which guarantees the security of land tenure and raises
the land value which is essential to both the tenants and the state.40 This legal recognition
was implemented in practice through the LTR process described above that was conducted
between 2009 and 2013.

There is an issue however, regarding marsh lands tenure. Article 19 of the 2013 land law
provides that “swamp land belongs to the State. It shall not definitively be allocated to
individuals and no person can use the ground of holding it for a long time to justify the
definitive takeover of the land. However, it may be leased to a person based on agreement
concluded between both parties”. This provision is a source of controversy since part of the
swamps have been occupied for decades by occupants who claim custom tenure over them,

which was not approved under LTR. Although this seems to be an issue, on the broad
perspective, there are public benefits that reach even those that appear to lose some rights.
Further, restrictions on marshlands is only prohibited on very few of these marshlands while
on the majority of the marshlands use, such as agriculture, is allowed.

In addition, evidence based on customary law for formally registered parcels is accepted for
land dispute resolutions and can be used to acquire a legal document-title or lease. Some
derived customary rights over land like sharing arrangements (e.g. a woman’s right to use
her parent’s land held by her brother) may also still exist locally.

Land rights of vulnerable people were recognised through the issuance of a land title in their
name and those who could not afford and who were registered in the list of poor
households were exempted to pay registration fees. Indigenous communities in Rwanda
correspond to the Batwa Community, referred to in the Rwandan Constitution as
“historically marginalized people”. However, the “National Social Protection Strategy”41
makes no difference in terms of treatment between “historically marginalized people” and
other vulnerable groups. In Rwanda, historically marginalized people are integrated within
other communities and have access to similar development programmes.

Legal inconsistencies may potentially threaten the recently established rights to land,
especially in urban areas where impact of planning and zoning regulations may be seen by
some as hampering full enjoyment of land rights for poor urban residents. Master Plans
cause the change to land rights for two different reasons. Firstly, they are still
implementable in the public interest. This may be seen as causing tenure insecurity to land
owners who cannot afford to build according to zoning regulations and are likely going to
forcefully sell their land and move away from the city. This is due to the fact that most plans
were developed after tenure regularization and people’s abilities to adapt to planning and
zoning regulations are limited especially for small land holdings in urban areas. Neither plot
areas of individual plots nor capacities of individual land holders match with the visions
expressed by newly developed Masterplans and zoning regulations in the majority of cases.
However, it is important to note that ownership rights and use regulations are different. Use
regulations are needed to ensure public interests are taken into consideration as well as
broad urban development plan. If these are supported by a well-functioning land market,
then landholders can get full value of their rights if they can't develop as required and they
can opt to sell at market price.

Therefore, measures are now needed which help private individual land holders to become
competitive in development, and which provide an alternative to the sale of individual

Rwanda has made enormous progress recognising, recording and mapping individual land
rights through tenure regularisation, including women’s land rights. The majority of women
in Rwanda enjoy their land rights as their male counterparts.

Until 2009 when land tenure regularisation programme was launched, less than one percent
of land in Rwanda was registered and was mainly located in planned urban areas.
Registration of each parcel is mandatory and needs to include an index map.42 All land in
Rwanda has been demarcated and adjudicated, with the land information recorded in the
land register which contains both legal and cadastral parcel information. By the end
December 2014, 10,675,443 parcels were demarcated and adjudicated of which 85.2%
(9,095,468) had complete information; 80.6% (8,604,398) approved to titles; and 67%
(7,164,230) issued with titles. All parcels are mapped, but a distinction between urban and
rural areas cannot be made due to the lack of clear urban delineation.

The registration of land rights is affordable in relative terms, but it is deemed expensive by
some landowners, especially since registration (and issuance of lease) results in the start of

  Art 18 of Ministerial Order n° 002/2008 of 01/4/2008 determining modalities of land registration, which
states that: “on the basis of the provisional demarcation records prepared during systematic registration …., or
from other reliable sources, the Registrar or the Deputy Registrar must order the design and preparation of a
registry index map or series of registry index maps.”
                                                                  40
an annual payment, instead of a one-time payment. Those regular fees are difficult for poor
urban residents to afford.

As noted above, in Rwanda only individual rights are recognized by the Rwandan land law
and this has been implemented during the land tenure regularization campaign. Collective
rights of registered cooperatives and companies are also recorded.

However, a conceptual review is needed with respect to the different categories of land,
their location, and their consequences (the categories are: Private State Land, Private Kigali
City Land, Private District Land and Individual Land). This is because of their direct impact on
the length of a lease (20, 30, 49 and 99 years). The difference between “residential” and
“urban agricultural” use classification was equally not done in a strategic manner and the
consequences of such classification was not well communicated to those affected.

The land law opens the land market as the rights on land can be freely sold and mortgaged.
The following land transfer restrictions exist:
 Article 30 of the land law provides that it is prohibited to subdivide land reserved for
   agriculture43 if the subdivided parcels are each less than 1 hectare in size. Those who are
   not allowed to subdivide shall co-own and use the land in accordance with the laws.
   Though officers in charge of land registration observe this restriction, rural land owners
   do not comply with it.
 Article 29 of the land law requires prior consent from the co-registered owner for land
   transactions, which is checked by the land office before registration of a transaction.
   However, women may have been informed but not consulted, which may lead to family
   disputes later on.
 Restrictions related to the nationality of the land owner44 - non-Rwandan nationals may
   only receive full ownership titles where plots are located in Economic Development
   Zones, unless they are associated to Rwandans who own more than 51% of the shares.
   There is some discussion still regarding freeholds for foreigners in relation to reciprocity
   in multilateral or bilateral conventions, and freehold rights for those married to
   Rwandans and vice-versa.



43
    Comprises as well, range land and forest land.- Article 30 land law “it is prohibited to subdivide plots of
land reserved for agriculture and animal resources if the result of such subdivision leads to parcels of land of
less than a hectare in size for each of them. Owners of lands prohibited to be subdivided shall co-own and use
the land in accordance with the laws”.
44
   Art. 6 of OLL nº 08/2005 of 14/07/2005 stipulates that “any person whether a Rwandan or a foreigner who
invested in Rwanda, or an association with legal personality shall enjoy full rights of ownership of land
reserved for residential, industrial, commercial, social or cultural and scientific services”. But, Article 3 of the
same OLL states that “Land is part of the public domain of all Rwandans; ancestors, present and future
generations”. These two provisions seem to be contradictory reason why the Government opted for a
renewable long term lease of 49 years, for foreigners, as stipulated in Article 23 of Law nº 043/2013 of
16/06/2013 governing land in Rwanda.
                                                        41
The State can expropriate if the landholder does not intend to use the land himself, but s/he
has the option to lease it to a willing user, by means of a contract in writing. A sublease45 is
only legally recognized and protected for agricultural land. Other categories of subleases
(such as residential, commercial, industrial etc.) are not legally recognized but also not
prohibited either. In practice, subleases are not common. Investors (e.g. solar power plant
in Rwamagana; coffee growers in Rulindo) use this type of contract in order to have a larger
area of land forinvestment).

4.1.3. Women’s rights to lands
The GoR has taken significant steps to protect women ’s rights to land and can be found in
many laws in Rwanda. Women in Rwanda formerly had land use rights only through their
husbands’ lineage implying that widows were unable to inherit their widow’s property – at
best - could use it until their male children grew up.46 The aim of the 1999 inheritance law
was to eliminate such gender bias in three respects: first, daughters and sons were to be
granted equal rights to inherit parental property; second, subject to the family law (which
under the conjugal property regime mandates equal shares), property rights by women in a
legally registered marriage would be protected;47 and third, spousal consent would be
required for transfer any matrimonial property.

Key provisions of the inheritance law were incorporated into the 2003 constitution, with
articles 11 and 16 stipulating that women and men have equal rights and prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of sex. This is supported by the land law which grants husbands
and wives equal rights to land. In addition, women have rights to purchase and sell their
property. The constitution recognizes only monogamous marriages between a man and
woman and is registered under civil law. Law No. 22/9948 governs marital property and
inheritance rights. Echoing the Constitution, this Law only recognizes marital property rights
arising out of civil marriages, but consensual unions and polygamous marriages are not
recognized49. Law No. 22/99 also governs inheritance rights and provides that children have
the right to inherit their parents’ property equally and without r eference to gender.

   Women without children lost use rights to family land unless they maintained family ties by marrying one of
their late husband’s brothers (Republic of Rwanda 2004).
47
   Rwanda’s Constitution gives legal recognition to registered monogamous marriage between a man and a
woman. Other arrangements are not recognized by law implying that no legal protection for property rights by
women who live in unregistered marriages or arrangements that are not formally recognized such as
consensual unions, customary or religious marriages, and polygamous unions. Anecdotal evidence suggests
that, in light of prohibitive cost of a ‘proper’ marriage ceremony, poor couples may live together informally for
extended periods of time.

    Anecdotally, Adjudication Committees are working to resolve issues of land rights within polygamous
households both locally and within the law. In this way, polygamy is tacitly acknowledged, but not recorded, as
it is illegal. For example, most cases involving polygamy include multiple plots, as men need to have the
                                                       42
Recent research conducted on women’s rights50 revealed that daughters are increasingly
securing land through inheritance and more often in equal shares with their brothers, a
major shift following the implementation of the 1999 succession law. Likewise, daughters
are now claiming umunani from their parents, traditionally a gift given by parents to their
sons at the time of the son’s marriage to start their household. While women may inherit
some land from their families, it is often less in extent and quality than that received by
their brothers. In addition, the minimum plot-size requirement prohibits subdivision of small
plots which constitute the majority of rural plots. Further, although today a considerable
proportion of women enjoy rights to land acquired through umunani, inheritance, and
marriage because of the significance of the current trend towards husband-wife-co-
ownership, the practical day to day control over land and the benefits derived from land is
not reflected.51 There are indications that men might be still enjoying their land rights more
than their female counterparts.

Most families lack the resources to compensate heirs for their share of un-partitioned land,
and heirs may jointly farm a plot in order to realize the benefit of the inheritance. However,
because many women move to their husbands’ villages when they are married, they are less
likely to continue to receive the benefits of a jointly held plot. Women often feel pressure to
relinquish their rights to their brothers, especially if they move to their husbands’ villages. A
recent study52 has suggested a figure of 86% of females possess sound awareness of land
related law and land rights. While this indicates an effective public awareness strategy,
there is also counter evidence to suggest that understanding of the registration procedure is
relatively low.53

Despite the progress made, cultural barriers and lack of knowledge still negatively affect
some women, especially those in rural areas. There are issues related to change of mindset
and ignorance of various policies, laws and regulations. Some men still do not understand
that women have equal rights to land as men. Moreover, some parents do not give
inheritance to their female children precisely because of gender. To address this issue, the

economic means to acquire a second wife. Therefore, some of the husband’s plots will be registered jointly
with his first wife, and other plots registered solely in the name of the second wife, naming the children of the
second marriage as persons of interest. Where an agreement such as this cannot be reached, it is recorded in
the dispute register.

Government in partnership with non-government organisations and civil society
organisations are increasing awareness campaigns, sensitizing women on their land rights
(Scalise and Giovarelli 2010; Brown and Uvuza 2006; GOR 2007; GOR Law 22/99 1999).

Women are encouraged to regularise their marriages. To facilitate them, government have
levied the fee for marriage regularisation, including mass marriage regularization. Couples
in registered marriages can elect one of three marital property regimes: (1) a community
property regime in which property is held jointly; (2) a limited community of acquests in
which the couple designates property acquired during marriage as either community or
separate (individual) property; or (3) a separate property regime. The selected regime
governs couples’ rights to property in the event of death, divorce, or separation. If, for
example, a couple in a community property regime divorces, each spouse will be entitled to
half of the property. If the couple does not elect a regime, a community property regime is
presumed. In practice, this regime is the most commonly adopted (GOR Law 22/99 1999;
Brown and Uvuza 2006).

In terms of land registration and as far as women are concerned, Article 51 Ministerial Order
n° 001/2008 of 01/4/2008 determining the requirements and procedures for land lease
states that “where a person who applies for allocation of land is legally married under the
regime of community of property or the regime of limited community of acquests, the lease
must be issued and registered in the names of both spouses as co-owners of the real right in
the land created by the lease”. Furthermore, the same Article recognises the right of single
women (or men) to register as sole lessees. In Rwanda, 24% (1,847,853 land parcels) of all
land registered is solely owned by women.54

The LTR program started with a pilot phase accompanied by an impact evaluation, which
revealed that women in customary marriages (the majority of married women in rural
areas) were losing out. The requirement of legally registered marriage for registration of
joined titles was then subsequently abolished by government for LTR and with success. The
follow up impact study analyzed the short-term impact of the registration program and
found that it improved access to land among legally married women, prompted better
gender-neutral recording of inheritance rights, and led to increased investment and
maintenance of soil conservation measures, particularly among female-headed
households55.

LTR figures show that women own 24% of registered lands, while joint ownership (could be
men and women, or joint women, or joint men) own 62% (4,757,886 land parcels) of

4.2.1. Introduction to the forest sector
The “Forest Mapping Project” (2005- 2008)58 concluded that in 2007 the total forest cover
(defined as all forests and woodlots >0.5 ha large, with a height of >7m, and with a crown
coverage of >20%) was 241,000 ha. This includes 80,000 ha of humid natural forest, mostly
confined in the two blocks: Nyungwe Mountain Forest in the South West; and the Volcano
National Park in the North-West. Eucalyptus, pine, young plantations and coppices occupied
roughly 115,000 ha, while the rest consisted of smaller areas of dry forests, bamboo and
bush land.

Forestry or tree dominated agro-forestry land-use (including forest areas less than 0.5 ha)
cover in total some 640 000 ha, which is about 28% of the country’s surface. There are large
numbers of trees on farm, which are growing individually or in groups smaller than 0.5 ha




58 The project was funded by the Government of the Netherlands and implemented jointly by GIS Centre at
the National University (responsible for reliable and up-to-date satellite inventory methodologies) and RAB
(carrying out the field sampling measurements).
                                                    46
The forest law59 clearly identifies categories of forests, ownership, and responsibilities for
use. Forests are owned by the State, the district or by individuals, and subsequently
subdivided by category. Rwanda no longer has forest under customary tenure or as
classified communal areas and thus there is no more group ownership. The law provides
that natural forests may, through contract management, be granted to private investors.
State productions forest and private forests of more than 2ha will be managed according to
the forest plan. Forest harvesting shall always be subject to a prior license, except for
individual forests of less than ½ ha.

The forest types are:
        State forests:
             o Protected forests60;
                      National parks;
                      Natural forests;
                      Forests along the shores of rivers and lakes;
                      Isolated protected trees.
             o Production planted forests ;
             o Forests reserved for research
        District forests:
             o Production planted forests;
             o Protected forests to maintain and safeguard environment.
        Private forests:
             o Small production planted forests which do not exceed two hectares (2 ha);
             o Large production planted forests exceeding two hectares (2 ha).

However, the law is not widely known and forest categorization is only known by
professionals. There is also a lack of robust forest management practices. According to
information from Department Forestry and Nature Conservation (DFCN) the ownership
structure of planted forests larger than 0.5 ha is as follows:

         State forests:                   27%
         District forests:                12%
         Private forests:                 61%

Vision 2020 aims at ensuring that present forest cover is first over all maintained, well
managed and increased to 30% of country total area in 2020. The goal of the National

Gazette nº 37 of 16/09/2013

   The largest protected areas are: Akagera National Park, Virunga National Park, Nyungwe National Park,
Mukura Forest (to be soon a national park) and Gishwati Natural Forest.

                                                    47
Forestry Policy is to make the forestry sector one of the bedrocks of economy and national
ecological balance for sustainable benefits to all segments of the society. The latest forest
law dates from 2013, but implementation is suffering from the lack of the deriving
secondary legislation.

In each District, a DFO (District Forest Officer) manages forests on a daily basis. Whereas it
is supposed that in each administrative sector a forest technician is in charge of forestry
extension, a forest extension worker is often in charge of two sectors without adequate
transportation means for carrying out forest extension tasks in the whole area of
afforestation.61

The governance of forestry has gone through crisis and has not yet overcome the
consequences of the war and the genocide resulting in the loss of most forest professionals
and ceasing of all development projects. Currently there are various initiatives set up to deal
with the issue of insufficiently qualified staff, including on-the-job training of existing staff
and local universities training foresters. The forest department has recently recruited skilled
staff to support the implementation of forestry policy and development programmes.
Supervision of forests is an area that also needs attention. This is especially for the smaller
natural forests which are left to the responsibility of already understaffed local authorities,
making them vulnerable to encroachment and degradation. It is thus essential that forest
management plans or conservation strategies be developed.

Rwanda has made commitments to promote activities of Reducing Emissions caused by
Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) and the roles of conservation, sustainable
management and enhancement of carbon stocks in forests, and will prepare a National
Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) regarding Monitoring and Measurement, Reporting and
Verification (M&MRV) of the forest cover and REDD+ activities, and via COMIFAC, engage in
the Congo Basin Forest Fund (CBFF) and implement a "Forest Monitoring Systems and
National MRV ( Measurement, Reporting and Verification).


4.2.2. Rights to forest and common lands

Forest rights in Rwanda follow the land tenure regime as provided for the law governing
land in Rwanda. It is only when it comes to forestry management, especially harvesting, that
owners have to deal with restrictions and permissions.

As part of LTR, private forests were registered by their owners, and granted a lease period
of 99 years, while the State registered the public forests on behalf of central government,
parastatals or districts. Forest concessions have been granted to investors, for production
purposes, such as Nyungwe Forest Company, who was granted a lease of 49 years on
Nyungwe buffer zone forest. Elsewhere, the use of natural forests and national parks is well
protected. Use of natural parks is subject to permission, limited to touristic activities,
granted by RDB. Use of natural forests is subject to an eventual management contract,
between the Government and an investor, as provided for by Article 40 of the forest law.

Customary based group rights no longer exist in Rwanda and were converted into leasehold
during the LTR process.

A new type of group rights is being developed as part of a land consolidation policy. Land
Use Consolidation (LUC) has been designed as a component of the Crop Intensification
Programme. The rationale for LUC is that joining small plots together to farm as a single unit
would deliver important economies of scale. Under LUC, participating farmers agree to grow
a single priority crop that has been identified by MINAGRI as best suited to local conditions
and consistent with Rwanda’s overall agricultural strategy. Farmers retain individual
ownership of their parcels under LUC, but agree to consolidate aspects of their operations
within the program, with the minimum size of a consolidated plot being 5 ha (MINAGRI,
2012). The law links LUC to settlement patterns and commercialization of agriculture (GoR,
2004). In 2011, approximately 13% of the total land area under cultivation in Rwanda was
under LUC, with approximately 40% of the farmers in the country participating and involving
all district (MINAGRI, 2012).

There are 35262 land disputes cases between the state and individuals, as some people
registered state forest under their names during the LTR.

The “Plan Forestier de District” brings together all relevant forests information (including
the size, the name of the transaction, if any, etc.), while a forest cadastre is under
development. Law nº 47bis/2013 of 28/06/2013 determining the management and
utilization of forests in Rwanda provides a list of forests to be recorded in an appropriate
register, which is under establishment by the Department of Forestry and nature
Conservation within RNRA, based on the Land Registry or LAIS, which is the land data base
and is now fully established following the identification of public lands with forests
(protected and not protected) as well as private forests.

Natural resources include water, mining, forests and other protected areas.

         innovative irrigation regulations that include provisions for securing small-holder
         farmers‟ land rights67.
        Mining: the expropriation law provides that mines are the property of the
         Government. Exploitation permissions may be granted to individual applicants by the
         state and a contract is signed with the Government, including respect for and
         protection of rights. The National Policy on Mining puts emphasis on exploration for
         minerals, industrial processing of minerals and value addition to minerals as part of
         exports and national revenue diversification and job creation. A new mining code
         which is more investor-oriented has been developed. It is anticipated that investing
         in research and value addition through industrial processing; mineral mapping and
         exploration will transform Rwanda’s mineral potential into a real economic sector.
         The mining policy recognizes the need to work with other closely interfacing sectors
         namely lands, forests, water and energy and environment, thereby strengthening
         institutional synergies in natural resources management.

Multiple rights on natural resources (such as water, mining, forests and other protected
areas) can legally coexist as stated above. Article 36 of the land law stipulates that rights on
land containing minerals and quarries shall be held by the person that has proof of legal
allocation. However, the minerals and quarries designated are State property which is also
emphasized by the expropriation law68 which classifies minerals as acts of public interest,
such that exploitation by the concession holder may not be obstructed by the land holder,
although compensation will be given.69 The provision implies that a land title can coexist
with concession permission. However, there are examples where certain conflicts arise
between landowners and the State. For example, the law provides that subsoil resources
belong to the State. Where such resources, (e.g. coltan) are discovered on land owned by an
individual, the State has the mandate to expropriate the land and compensate the land
owner, even if the land is freehold. In practice, disputes have been reported, most of them
relating to the compensation value.

Multiple uses can exist for a plot, though disputes may arise where different people claim
the use right and/or land right itself. This is in fact addressed in the land law.70

   Ministerial Order n° 001/2008 of 01/4/2008 determining the requirements and procedures for land lease
(Article 19) provides that “the emphyteutic lessee has no right to mines on or underground and he/she shall
not act against the person who is entitled to enter in his/her land or part of it for research purposes or
extraction of mines. However, the emphyteutic lessee shall obtain compensation in accordance with laws for
his works that could be damaged”.

   The land law (Article 35) gives a solution to the situation: “All buildings, crops and other works found on land
that have been performed by the land owner using his/her money or otherwise are presumed to be his / hers.
However, this does not prohibit any other person to own buildings, crops and any other works on other person
land in accordance with procedures provided for by the law, other laws or agreement with the land owner.

The NLP’s fundamental principles are the following:

        The land use and development must be administered and managed so as to
         contribute to the sustainable development for the benefit of current and future
         generations of Rwanda;
        The land use and development must take into account gender considerations among
         all Rwandans and between men and women;
        The land use must help minimizing the need for land development based on the
         excessive use of land, energy and natural resources;
        The planning of land use and development must prioritize higher density, multi-
         family residential settlements either located in an urban or rural area;
        The land use must prevent urban sprawl, maximize mixed zoning and integrated land
         uses; and




When buildings or crops have been developed by a person on the land that is not his/hers through procedures
that are contrary to laws or agreement with land owner, the later has the right to request the person who
performed them to remove such development without prejudice to the land owner to claim indemnities for any
damages suffered.”

        The land use must focus on integrated land uses like residential, commercial, civic
         and community and light industrial in settlement areas in which people live and work
         to minimize physical distances.

The national land use planning portal71 contains land use plans and related information such
as maps, to make them easily accessible.

The land law contains numerous stipulations as to effective management of land. Landlords
have to use their land in a productive manner. The State has the right to requisition the land
over a given period and eventually confiscate it, if the landowner does not use the land in
the way prescribed by land use regulations.

Harvesting woodlots on farmland requires permission, but as a result of the decentralization
of the decision making process, it is reported that obtaining permits has become very
difficult, partly due to overlapping responsibilities between local governments and forestry
services.

The land law72 stipulates that land leases and transactions shall respect land use plans.
Restrictions regarding rural land use are mainly related to the implementation of the
National Land Use and Development Master Plan73, which is included in the list of acts of
public interests in the expropriation law. Legally, regulations and restrictions should be
regarded as serving the public interest but enforcement is challenging because restrictions
often are seen as imposed on the public and sometimes people claim that they have not
been consulted.

The notion of public interest74 in relation to expropriation has led to discussion and
misunderstandings (see USAID, 201475). There is general agreement putting in place roads,
public schools, hospitals, electric lines, and water and sewage facilities qualify as being in
the public interest given that they generate clear public benefits, but becomes more
controversial when aim is not clearly defined and involves private benefits too. Some
District Land Officers carried out land expropriation in the name of public interest for a
master plan that is still in development, to anticipate meeting their performance contract

   Article 27 of the land law stipulates that “the national land management shall be governed by the law
relating to the planning of land use and development in Rwanda. All land leases and land transactions shall
respect the land use plans of the area where the land is located”.
73
   Law n°24/2012 of 15/06/2012 relating to the planning of land use and development in Rwanda
74
   Public interest in the expropriation law includes, “activities to implement master plans of the organization
and management of cities and the national land in general” as well as “any other activities aimed at public
interest which are not indicated on the expropriation list that are approved by an Order of the Minister in
charge of expropriation, at own initiative or upon request by other concerned persons.”

(Imihigo) commitments toward implementation of master plans. Although presented as a
win-win situation between private investors and the GOR, others argue that it only
benefitted a small number of affluent persons (USAID, 2014).

The second category of restrictions is dictated by the provisions of Article 30 of the same
land law whereby, for the purposes of optimization of productivity, land use consolidation
for agricultural and livestock has been set up, as defined in the master plan. As indicated
above, rural land transferability is restricted by minimum plot size to prevent further land
fragmentation.

By the end of 2015, all rural land use plans have been approved by district councils.


Preparation process of an Integrated District Development Plan (IDDP)




Public participation in rural land use plan development needs to be thorough and given enough
time. The government’s commitment to capture people’s views in the plans is a good indication of
participatory planning. However, the process of collecting the public’s views needs to be properly
monitored to ensure consultations are done effectively so that due consideration has been given in
the final approved plan.

The number of applications for change of land use that were received by districts in Rwanda
varied from 0 to 10,55076 in Gasabo, with a mean of 37. 77 It was however, not possible to

     Basically, this big number is dictated by the compliance with master plan.

check if approved land use change applications were implemented according to the
destined use. Most changes were proposed in order to comply with the new master plan.

Protected areas and valuable agricultural land, including pastures, are zoned in the national
land use and development master plan (NLUDMP), which is prepared based on the existing
situation on the ground as illustrated by the figure below. Compliance with the provision of
the NLUDMP is mandatory. This means that there should be no land put aside for a specific
use. The current use may be, however, in few cases, different from the master plan.

Land owners in areas converted into settlement areas will have three compensation
mechanisms: sale, exchange and/or expropriation, with exchange being the most common.

The legal process as provided by Law n°20/2011 of 21/06/2011 governing human habitation
in Rwanda is as follows:
Article 17: Choice of a group settlement site and applicable criteria Local communities shall
participate in the process of identifying a group settlement site, which is determined by the
Council of the relevant administrative Sector upon the approval of the District Council and
after the advice of the RHA. The choice of a group settlement site shall be made on the basis
of the local land use development plan.
Article 18: Expropriation of land selected to serve as a group settlement site Any land
selected to serve as a group settlement site shall be expropriated in accordance with the
procedure provided for by the laws relating to expropriation in the public interest.
Article 19: Subdivision of a group settlement site Land selected to serve as a group
settlement site shall be subject to a land subdivision plan. The Rural Land Subdivision Plan
shall indicate locations reserved for: 1 º construction of roads; 2 º routing of various
networks; 3 º infrastructure; 4 º dumps; º harvesting and treatment of rainwater and
wastewater; 6 º any other public use facility.
Article 20: Establishment and approval of the Rural Land Subdivision Plan The Draft Rural
Land Subdivision Plan shall be developed by RHA at the District level. The District Mayor
shall submit the Draft Rural Land Subdivision Plan to the District Council after seeking advice
                                              56
from the persons in charge of environment, infrastructure, and hygiene and sanitation at
the District level. However, the Draft Rural Land Subdivision Plan cannot be submitted to the
District Council unless it is accompanied by a written advice.

Land use consolidation programme in rural areas has been a controversial subject. While
assessing the economic, social and environmental impacts of land use consolidation of the
crop intensification programme in Rwanda, the research team from the University of
Rwanda78 concluded that: ‘most but not all farmers are satisfied with Land Use
Consolidation (LUC) and believe it has brought them benefits, including increased yield; while
both satisfaction and agricultural productivity of land are high, food insecurity, vulnerability
to shocks, and poverty remain a serious problem for LUC farmers; participation in LUC
provides farmers with important access to inputs, such as improved seed and fertilizer, as
well as frequent visits by extension agents and these aspects should be emphasized;
although LUC is voluntary by law, many farmers felt some degree of pressure to participate
and initially exhibited resistance to the program. Working with farmers to understand and
address these concerns when rolling out the program to new areas should receive greater
emphasis; and farmers lack access to storage and post-harvest processing for crops, which
should be emphasized to maximize benefits from increases in productivity.’

Although from the above one could see many positive views of the land use consolidation
programme, there are other views that suggest otherwise. For Huggins, land use
consolidation in Rwanda is an attempt by the government to exert state control over
agricultural land.79 It is not clear how the state control on agriculture land is achieved when
ownership, use and benefits from land is exclusively the responsibility of land owners whose
land is under the land use consolidation scheme.

           policy objectives                                          are enforced



During the land tenure regularisation, only land rights are formalized, not housing.
Currently, there is no differentiation between land and fixed assets on the land, collectively
called property. However, where buildings do not match with newly introduced zoning
regulations, they will eventually be demanded to be redeveloped as per current practice
observed in the City of Kigali.

For most of Rwanda’s territory, urban planning and land use planning documents have
recently been developed, or else development is ongoing, or has not started. This means
that there was no previous formal assignment to most areas in terms of land use. Planning
and zoning have a direct effect on people’s rights to land, even if formally registered as
rightful owner. Master Plans change use regulations, because they make the landholder
dependent on whether or not the new plan and zoning are suitable; and due to their current
power to be implementable in the public interest based on expropriation law. The issue is
that zoning regulations, which come with Master Planning, are by nature conditional, and in
that way limit the unconditional land use right to the plot.

This may be seen as problematic, because land tenure regularization was carried out after
the de facto possession of land. This way, for the use of their land, plot owners are
dependent on the decision taken regarding the zoning of a plot, but which might not fit the

                                                         58
purpose of the plot owner, for which s/he wants to, or has to, utilize it. In other words,
landholders of concerned land have not purchased their plot according to their desired land
use and zoning regulations suitable to his/her budget, but are now identifying the newly
introduced zoning regulations and use for their particular plot. This is the case for the City
of Kigali, which is covered by a detailed Master Plan in all locations, and will also affect other
urban areas when urban planning documents are introduced or detailed. However, in cases
where adherence to zoning regulations is problematic, there are mechanisms in place to
revise the Master Plan to meet people’s needs without jeopardising zoning regulations.

Further, most of these land use restrictions introduced by planning regulations are meant to
serve the general public interest. In areas where land use regulations inhibit full enjoyment
of land rights by the user (i.e. in cases where private land is planned to be used to build
public infrastructure such as roads) compensation has to be paid. However, because most of
the proposed zoning regulations are long term projects, some people whose land is affected
have not been given compensation for their land and are not allowed to do any
development on the identified land. Clearly, zoning regulations do not necessarily please
everyone especially in a country like Rwanda where planning is a new phenomenon.

Regulations restricting land use for the purpose disaster prevention exist in all urban
centres. Currently, such regulations are through zoning within planning documents.
Effective enforcement is only seen in Kigali City and other cities where plans exist. What is
defined are non-buildable slopes and their grade, and it is prohibited to build in wetlands or
along lakeshores. Moreover, zoning regulations are not yet developed with a legal basis,
except for lakeshore development. The Urban Planning Code, which is planned to be
established by the Ministerial Order Determining Urban Planning and Building Regulations,
will guide zoning principles.

Some of the regulations do not provide alternatives regarding building techniques and
technology which may facilitate building in moderate risk areas because of the generally
challenging terrain in Rwanda. The implementation and enforcement of disaster risk–based
land use restrictions may therefore lead to rather rigid activity and decision-making, and
may include unreasonable cases of denying permits, or involuntary resettlement, because of
a lacking differentiation in their applicability.

Alternatives could provide sustainable and environmentally sound solutions for stepped
building on steep slopes, or building on stilts in wetland areas. Low density of small buildings
made of natural materials could be permissible even within a lakeshore protection zone;
stable existing constructions on steep slopes must not be demolished; accurate topographic
surveys shall be the basis of slope determination before any demolishment is being
proposed. With the effective implementation of the new national urbanization policy, most
of the issues raised above are expected to be addressed.

4.3.2. Transparency of land use restrictions: changes in land use and management regulations are
made in a transparent fashion and provide significant benefits for society in general rather than
just for specific groups
This indicator is divided into three dimensions, as analysed below.

 LGI 3.2. Transparency of land use restrictions: changes in land use and management regulations are made
 in a transparent fashion and provide significant benefits for society in general rather than just for specific
 groups
 3.2.1 The Process of urban expansion/                          Information on planned urban expansion and
         infrastructure development process is                  infrastructure development is not publicly available
         transparent and respects existing rights
 3.2.2   Changes in urban land use plans are                    Public input is sought in preparing and amending
         based on a clear public process and                    land use plans and the public responses are used by
         input by all stakeholders                              the official body responsible for finalizing the new
                                                                plans, but the process for doing this is unclear or
                                                                the report is not publicly accessible
 3.2.3   Approved requests for change in urban                  Not scored
         land use are swiftly followed by
         development on these parcels of land



Information on urban expansion is not publicly available. Even the national land use master
plan as a guiding document is not known by some leaders who are meant to facilitate its
implementation, although available online.

Citizens are informed about Master plan regulations but consultations need to be thorough
to ensure the public is fully involved in the plan preparation. In the past and before the
adoption of new orders regulating a plan elaboration process, Master Plans were developed
with limited public input, because of the way public consultations were conducted.
Previously, procedures were not determined, and most of the plan designs were elaborated
by foreign firms with little supervision by the responsible agency. Views were not well
reflected, and often people were only represented by a Council. In that way, plans were
prepared for people but not with people.

Lacking human resources are a driver of mistakes made in the plan elaboration process, and
its supervision and approval. A best practice example from Gisagara District (rural district)
demonstrates how ownership may result in realistic and adapted plans, reflecting people’s
wishes and experience within the area. Change and plan review was caused in this case,
because the Mayor refused to validate the proposed plan since no consultations had been
carried out.

Urban planning documents for the majority, are not yet implemented. Concrete figures are
not available at this point. There is currently no way to monitor in detail the issue at District
level. In fact, the existence of urban planning documents is still limited at district level.


                                                      60
A set of newly adopted orders, however, will address the procedures of plan revision valid
for urban planning documents. The procedure clearly defines the steps and opportunities
for public involvement.

A newly adopted set of implementing orders addresses the details of a land use plan
elaboration process, including public participation. The process of urban
expansion/infrastructure development is therefore expected to become more transparent,
and respectful of existing rights.

                                                                  formal



The current urbanisation rate is 16.5%. The goal of Vision 2020 is for this figure to rise to
35% by 2020, which is about 4.5 million people and at least 560,000 additional housing units
in addition to the current gap in housing supply, as well as at least 5,000 ha of additional
urban land for houses, services etc. Meanwhile, the NLP seeks to contain urban sprawl to
ensure ease of infrastructure service provision. It therefore provides for measures to
discourage disorderly growth of squatter areas and unplanned settlements. However, out of
the 127 neighbourhoods in Kigali, 71 are informal and 23 mixed and are partly located in
peri-urban areas. Most people live in informal or semi-formal neighbourhood, where
population density is highest.

                                                         61
One additional problem which the country is currently facing is the wasteful development
noticeable in rural areas in relative proximity to urban centers. This is the result of lower
land prices, lower tax, and inexistent zoning regulations. Such transformation of the use of
agricultural land for individual residential development is a noticeable change during the
last few years, and likely a consequence of LTR.

Current zoning regulations, where available, in many zones do not match the intensity of
ongoing and desired urbanisation, and need to accommodate growth with higher focus on
resource-efficiency. This is especially the case for the expansion areas. Currently, the urban
planning documents for the four next largest cities are limited in terms of effectiveness and
applicability, considering the need for higher compactness, resource efficiency, and the
need to address the demanded land uses. Also, they have been developed not in a
comprehensive approach but rather for 500 ha of the urban areas only. There was until now
no quality control in terms of planning hierarchies and consistencies between the different
hierarchy levels and across different sectoral plans. The infrastructure demand does not
cover the supply in the current context, and much less for the projected demand.

However, there is a set of implementation orders that have just been adopted, which
determines the validity of urban planning documents and the need for updating, among
other basic provisions. Complementary, detailed feasibility studies for six next largest cities
are in preparation and will help guide infrastructure development in response to the current
and projected demand.

The largest city is the City of Kigali. Kigali is advanced in terms of availability and coverage of
urban planning documents, development management tools based on digitized systems,
and staffing. Also, the approach to the liveability of a city makes exemplary progress. Every
sector in Kigali city has a properly trained urban planner and civil engineer. Yet, the Kigali
City One Stop Centre mainly focuses on building permitting without strategic planning
contributions to the best use of the municipal resources. The collaboration between the
permitting authority and other infrastructure development departments (transport, water
and sanitation, waste management) is un-optimally coordinated.

The city is not yet operating fully autonomously and especially in the areas of service
infrastructure and related implementation strategies still depends on the technical and
financial support by the MININFRA’s implementing agencies. To draw a clear line between
the responsibilities between the national agencies and the city becomes another constraint
in the efficient management of development.

Access to housing for all is still constrained by a number of factors, mainly by a low
household income structure respectively to high formal house construction and sales costs,
and to large household sizes requiring rather large unit sizes. During the report validation
workshop, it was reported that RHA has acquired land in Kigali City to start the construction

                                                62
of affordable housing units which primarily will benefit civil servants. A survey is currently
underway to determine those civil servants who are eligible for this scheme. One would
request that this scheme be extended to all those in need of low cost affordable housing.
Informal construction activity is decreasing due to increasing awareness and enforcement of
urban planning documents especially in inner-urban areas. However, it continues to exist
(see also 7.4.4) and a shift toward residential mansions on rural land in the peripheries of
urban areas is noticeable, and the reasons for this have been discussed in the analysis
section of this report.

A lacking clear policy and implementation framework had to date made it difficult for the
government to provide clear answers to potential private investors in housing development
and to clearly frame such development and integrate clear conditions in order to achieve
affordability and accessibility for the largest population groups in need of housing. A
National Housing Policy has been adopted and an implementation framework is in adoption
process. The National Housing Policy sets the framework for governmental, non-
governmental and private housing programs and projects and guides their sustainable
implementation. It looks at urban and rural housing holistically and systemic, and addresses
three pillars: 1) Public Benefit, 2) Resource-Efficient Planning, Green Technology and
Professionalism, 3) Governance and Partnership.80

A strong political will from the government of Rwanda presents hope that many people
have been waiting for to reform urban planning and development process in Rwanda. This
started with the adoption of six orders related to urban development and the adoption of
the national human settlement law. Further, each district has now approved its master plan
taking into consideration all provisions and procedures provided for by the recently adopted
legal framework. Under, the country’s long term development horizon know as Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS2), six secondary cities have been
identified and during EDPRS2 lifespan, these identified cities are meant to be developed to
resolve existing problems and cater for future demands.

Whilst most of the strategic and policy developments towards the provision of low cost
housing have been set up by government, it is still too early to assess their impact.




80
   The policy clearly addresses the issue of access to housing for all groups of people irrespective of income
situation and location. The National Housing Policy sets the framework for housing programs and intends to
guide and boost private sector engagement. It outlines the principles pursued by the Government when
supporting housing development, and the conditions of support to the private sector to engage in cost-
efficient and sustainable human settlement development and construction. The strategic policy principles are
especially: Collaborative finance and investment; Promotion of saving for housing; Collaborative development
and land pooling; Strengthen the local construction industry through emphasis on professionalism, skills
development and increase of local material production and SME’s; Optimum use of land.

         granted promptly and based on reasonable requirements
This indicator has five dimensions as discussed below.

  LGI 3.4: Speed and predictability of enforcement of restricted land uses: development permits are granted

          infrastructure, and housing                              but existing regulations provide incentives for
                                                                      new informal occupations
 3.4.5   A condominium regime allows                                  Common property under condominiums is
         effective management and recording                           recognized and the law has clear provisions for
         of urban property                                            management and publicity of relevant records
                                                                      that are followed in practice



Obtaining building permit is expensive for buildings above 100m2 especially because of the
requirement of having to work with professional architects and engineers. However, for
single storey buildings below 100m2, requirement for professional services has been
drastically limited by the new order on building permitting, which makes a permit
affordable.

An equally important question is how many residents actually request a building permit
before constructing; also, how many make this request at the competent planning
authority.

Yet, Rwanda is among the best performers in the region in terms of improvements so far
made to expedite processing and issuance of building construction permits. This is mainly
applicable to Kigali’s inner urban areas, since Kigali has an established building permitting
procedure. Permitting in the City of Kigali, which is based on an online application system, is
within maximum 30 days and may be as fast as 10 days. For other districts the time frame is
still arbitrary and varies largely, but the online permitting system is currently being
extended to more districts, which raises expectations of higher efficiency and transparency
of the building permitting process. The cost in the case of the City of Kigali is between Rwf
20,000 and Rwf 60,000. This is difficult for the majority of the population to afford, but is
cheap for investors. A Ministerial Order regulating building permitting is in adoption and will
regulate time frame, among other procedural issues.

                                                        64
There is a parallel permitting process ongoing at administrative levels below the responsible
district level, which is illegal because it does not follow any procedures and does not
contribute to ensuring public health and safety. The illegal payments which are demanded
from builders may reach very unaffordable amounts coupled with repetitive requests for
payment.

A new legal framework has recently been adopted by cabinet and dissemination of clearly
laid out processes is now intended for the rest of the country, so is the roll-out of the online
construction permitting system which Kigali is already using. The new legal framework and
its dissemination among local authorities and also among the public is expected to reduce
any informal permitting practices thorough which faulty permits may have been issued due
to lacking knowledge. Up to now, there are no building permitting procedures clearly
anchored in the legal framework, but a Ministerial Order has recently been adopted by the
cabinet to cater for this.

Formalization of existing housing does not exist in Rwanda. With LTR, most of the plots have
been registered and rights acknowledged country-wide. The only informal tenure after LTR
is due to non-recorded transfers. However, informal construction of houses continues and
is incentivised by different factors, including:
   -    Corruptive practices at local administrative levels below district level;
   -    Lack of knowledge of proper procedures within local administrations including
        Districts outside of Kigali;
    - Lack of awareness of possible accessibility of building permits among low income
        residents;
    - Hardly achievable zoning regulations depending on the location.
There is a Condominium law, which will be complemented by an implementing order
regarding real estate development (in adoption process). The land registration system
allows for the registration of multiple owners to the same plot. The law is currently not
widely adapted but the transformative process is supported by new policies promoting
collaborative development and ownership, especially by the new Draft National Housing
Policy.

can be in the public or private domain of the State. It may donate to any public institution or

institutions and land that belongs to local authorities whether being in their public domain or in their private
domain’.

local authority its land reserved for public83 or private domain. Public institutions or local
authorities may also acquire land by purchasing or through donation from individuals or
associations.

During Land Tenure Regularisation, all public land was registered. According to figures from
RNRA, the area under public land is 57,494,251m2. This information is accessible by law,84
and in practice, no restrictions are reported, except for national security activities or due to
some privacy reasons some of the information related to public land may not be accessed
by interested parties. In Rwanda, allocation of state land in the public domain can be done
by Central Government through the Cabinet, City of Kigali and Districts through their
Councils. The land registry is able to provide information for a specific piece of public land
that has been allocated. However, the current land register functionality does not record
source of land allocated for parcels in the register as most of the parcels registered were
brought to the register as a result of LTR.

Although management responsibility of public land is legally well assigned, functions and
levels of government are either not well defined, are at the wrong level (i.e. at local level
instead of central or regional level), or lack resources. As a result, implementation is
hampered by overlap and ambiguities. Information on public land is also not well
disseminated. Sometimes, institutions do not know what belongs to them and what belongs
to others. An example to this is Rusizi lakeshore’s parcels which were removed from State
public land to State private land by the cabinet, although the Rusizi District believed that
those lands belonged to them.

Most institutions with a responsibility for public land have a very low budget allocated to
land management and as a result, land management is left mostly to local authorities.
However, they do not have the technical and financial resources to effectively manage
public land assigned to them. Local generated revenues and resources from government
annual budget or donor organisations have to be used and the focus is mostly on
development of the land (buildings, forests, conservation, roads). There are some
institutions such as RHA that have funds dedicated to land management.

One implication of the general lack of effective management of public land leads is that the
land is not protected. The LTR process noticed that there were many cases of individuals
having encroached on public land and attempting to register it in their names. A recent

   Art 12 land law: State land in the public domain consists of all land meant to be used by the general public
or land reserved for organs of State services as well as national land reserved for environmental protection.

after paying the fee determined by the regulations”.

4.4.2. LGI: 4.2. Justification and time-efficiency of acquisition processes: the state acquires land for
         public interest only and this is done efficiently
This indicator has three dimensions:

 LGI: 4.2. Justification and time-efficiency of acquisition processes: the state acquires land for public interest
                                          only and this is done efficiently

 4.2.1   There is minimal transfer of acquired                 Less than 10% of land acquired in the past 3
         land to private interests.                            years is used for private purposes
 4.2.2   Acquired land is transferred to                       More than 70% of the land that has been
         destined use in a timely manner.                      acquired in the past 3 years has been
                                                               transferred to its destined use
 4.2.3   The threat of land acquisition does                   None at all
         not lead to pre-emptive action by
         private parties.



The main ways public institutions use to acquire land are: purchase, expropriation,
acquisition through donation, foreigners lease non-renewal, confiscation of unused land and
acquisition of vacant and escheat land. The most common mean is however expropriation,
but no pre-emptive action has been reported.

Expropriation in the public interest after LTR seems to have transitioned to land acquisition
for private sector led development with public support. The situation after LTR seems to
strengthen this tendency, because individual land rights are now legally acknowledged,
while most land holders have small plots perceived as not fit for modern development,
making private sector led large-scale land purchases a generally accepted development tool
in planning.

There is no administrative data available to assess whether acquired land is transferred to
its destined use in a timely manner. Although the land law (Articles 14, 15 and 16) stipulates
that land acquired through expropriation due to public use is included in the private domain
of public institution, the expropriation law provides that expropriation is always made in
public interest. In other words, land acquired through expropriation should always serve the
general public interest and not private interests. However, a quick assessment conducted in
five districts (Kicukiro, Gicumbi, Nyanza, Kayonza and Karongi) showed that about 10% of
expropriated land was allocated to private investors. However, allocation of land to private
investors does not imply that land allocated would be used without public interest benefit.
Indeed most of these investors build education and health facilities, recreational facilities

which generally benefit the general public. The assessment mentioned above found that
there was no change in land use for any of the acquired land.85


4.4.3. LGI 4.3: Transparency and fairness of acquisition procedures: acquisition procedures are
        clear and transparent and fair compensation is paid expeditiously
This indicator has five dimensions that are described below.
 LGI 4.3: Transparency and fairness of acquisition procedures: acquisition procedures are clear
 and transparent and fair compensation is paid expeditiously.
 4.3.1 Compensation is provided for the                Compensation, in kind or in cash, is paid for some
           acquisition of all rights regardless           unrecorded rights (such as possession, occupation etc.),
           of their recording status.                     however those with other unrecorded rights (which may
                                                          include grazing, access, gathering forest products etc.) are
                                                          usually not paid
 4.3.2     Land use change resulting in                   Where people lose rights as a result of land use change
           selective loss of rights there is              outside the acquisition process, compensation in cash or in
           compensated for.                               kind is paid so that these people have comparable assets
 4.3.3     Acquired owners are                            Between 50% and 70% of acquired land owners receive
           compensated promptly.                          compensation within one year
 4.3.4     There are independent and                      Independent avenues to lodge a complaint against
           accessible avenues for appeal                  acquisition exist but there are access restrictions (i.e. only
           against acquisition.                           accessible by mid-income and wealthy).
 4.3.5     Timely decisions are made                      A first instance decision has been reached for more than 80%
           regarding complaints about                     of the complaints about acquisition lodged during the last 3
           acquisition.                                   years


The flowchart below provides a summary of the acquisition (expropriation) procedure:

Even though provided by the expropriation law, land commissions are no longer
operational86 and have been replaced by Expropriation Committees as provided for by the
amended expropriation law. Meanwhile, institutions with expropriation projects have to
seek no objection from the Ministry in charge of expropriation matters.

As already discussed previously in the report, land use changes are generally dictated when
a masterplan is developed and implemented with landholders having to comply with new
zoning regulations. This is mainly happening in Kigali city. When land owners cannot comply
with these requirements, they will not lose their land rights but some may feel pressured to
sell because they cannot afford to comply with the zoning regulations.

The expropriation law stipulated that compensation for loss of registered land can be paid in
kind or in cash, but does not include compensation for unregistered resource use rights
(grazing, gathering forest products etc.). In Rwanda, the expropriating entity deals with the
real right holder while unregistered secondary rights are the responsibility of the real right
holder to handle. However, the amended 2013 land law states that 5% of the property
valuation will be paid as a ‘disturbance fees’.

Article 24 of the 2007 expropriation law provides that just compensation approved by the
competent authorities shall be paid within a period not exceeding 120 days from the day
when the amount of compensation is determined. In cases where it exceeds that period, the
expropriation is supposed to be rendered invalid, unless the person to expropriate and the
one to be expropriated come to acceptable terms. In this case, during the time the person
to be expropriated is still waiting for payment, s/he has the right to cultivate crops within a
period not exceeding 90 days and harvest the crops on the land.

However, in practice a study found complaints over delayed compensation, with
expropriated landholders having waited several years to be compensated, despite the
stipulations of the law (USAID, 2014). There are also complaints over the amount of
compensation (see also section land taxation and valuation on valuation). For example,
expropriated residents in a village in Kacyiru Sector, Gasabo District bemoaned delays in
compensation payments for 39 demolished homes in order to construct new embassies.
Land holders had agreed to move because the government constructions would benefit the
general public. While awaiting compensation, residents were forbidden to repair their
halfway demolished houses or undertake any business activity, even though the project had
stalled. These cases have been similar to the ones faced by residents of Gahanga Sector in
Kicukiro District and Rilima Sector in Bugesera District where a new stadium and national
airport are to be built, respectively.

                                                     70
This situation seems to be caused by the haste to implement master plan projects combined
with limited financial capacity, poor planning and weak coordination among government
institutions charged with implementing expropriation. The officials involved noted that
compensation delays were due to multiple procedures required before compensation can
be released to ensure that the process is transparent.

Complaints are registered at the district level. The table below shows the number of
complaints with regard to land acquisition by expropriation which were registered during
the benchmarking exercise conducted between 2012 and 2013. However, the
benchmarking gives no indication on whether complaints registered concerned the
expropriation project, the valuation or the liquidation of compensation. Based on previous
experience, it can be assumed that the majority of the complaints are compensation
(valuation) related. The inventory registered 136 cases of expropriation; 435 complaints
related to expropriation of which 86% were successfully resolved. Most districts are
involved in expropriation and complaints seem to be common; only 25 cases did not
produce complaints.

There are various independent appeal avenues available for land holders who are not happy
with the process or the compensation offered. An administrative appeal can be made to the
decision maker (and escalated within the hierarchy of the decision making authority for
expropriation). The other avenue is via the courts (intermediate court, high court and
Supreme Court). However, the courts seem not to be used very often. Even though access
to justice may be an issue for some categories of people as the case introduction fees have
increased (see panel nine for details), existing administrative avenues are accessible free of
charge and help deal with such cases. From 2009 to July 2012,88 from information gathered
in the high court, only five complaints cases related to expropriation were received and
were dealt in the following order as the Vice president of High Court89 indicated:
     1 case received a decision within 5 months;
     2 cases received a decision within 12 months;
     1 case received a decision in 17 months;
     1 case has not yet received a decision.

Transfer of public land in Rwanda is done in a transparent and competitive process using
open tender, especially since the 2013 review of the land law.90 Allocation is done on an
equal treatment basis whether the investor is foreign or local. The equal treatment
phenomenon regarding investment is legalized in the Investment code article 7 which states
that, “Foreign investors may invest and have shares in investment projects in Rwa nda and
shall be treated in the same way as Rwandan investors in matters related to incentives and
facilities”.

  Law 43/2013 of 16/06/2013 art. 17: “Allocation of public land in private domain for investment shall be done
through an open competition except when authorized by an Order of the Prime Minister on a well-defined
land”.
                                                             73
Foreigners are guaranteed 100% freehold in free economic zone91 and the procedure is that,
upon purchasing land, a leasehold is assigned which will facilitate the investor to develop
the land. Freehold is only given after the investor has finished building as per the building
regulations as set by the Zone Authority. Up to 2015, no foreigner in the free economic zone
has yet obtained a freehold title.

Only in case of a “strategic investment” the condition for open tender can be exempted. An
example is the allocation of 700 hectares to Bramin Ltd company to grow maize and soya
beans for local food production and to supply raw materials to a local brewing industry
(Bralirwa), which was considered a strategic investor because it had switched its source of
raw material from scarce sorghum to maize, which would be in a constant supply via Bramin
ltd. The exemption process will take at least three months. It involves RDB writing to
MINAGRI for approval in case the investment is agricultural. Upon satisfaction, the ministry
prepares a cabinet paper explaining the need to have public land given to an investor
showing all the social-economic benefits to the nation. After cabinet approval, the legal
formalities take place. This requires a prime minister’s order changing land from public to
private, prepared in three languages, then submitted to cabinet approval. After that, it is
sent to the official gazette for publication. It is only upon publication that the office of the
land registrar can start the property transfer process.

Land prices are decided by the district council based on the technical advice from certified
valuers hired by the district. The section on land taxation ad valuation below provides
further details.

Those who have been allocated public land are required to pay a lease fee. All payments of
public land leases are collected at the district level in accordance to the rules and
procedures although this is being taken over by RRA. Everyone who leases land pay the
required amount before the end of the year. Before 2013, land owners were paying a lump
sum before 31st of March but now they have the flexibility of paying in installments.
However, it was difficult to get exact figures of collections due to the fact that data is
scattered. Land can be given out at ministerial level or district level. There is no central desk
to provide such information.

Although there is no guideline or mechanism to ensure public capture of benefits,
allocations of public land are often accompanied by agreements that spell out issues related
to local job creation (employment), local raw material usage etc.

   The 2013 land law, arte 6 states that, all Rwandan citizens are entitled to freehold titles. The same article
stipulates that, “For a group of individuals co -owning land, a business company, an organisation or association

citizens, except for land designated as Special Economic Zones”.

There is no written policy in place on using public land to improve equity in asset use.
However, equity is invariably the common denominator in all Rwanda government policies,
including the NLP. Actual interventions deriving from this policy include, for example, land
sharing that was affected across the country, with the main aim being to ensure all
Rwandans have access to land and property. This was also the case with the land
redistribution programme implemented in the Eastern province where land was taken away
from those with large portions and given to the poor and landless. In some cases, urgent ad-
hoc policies have been developed to make land available to returning refugees. An example
is related to incoming refugees from Tanzania (2012-13) with no ability to access land.
Subsequently, the government initiated a scheme to resettle all refugees on land allocated
by the local district government. Districts without land to accommodate the refugees, like
Bugesera district, then reassigned part of land intended for forestry research for distribution
to these refugees. There are no reliable records for redistributed land areas.92 Assisting the
poor and marginalized groups to secure their land (LTR) and make them productive is
“normal” practice.

4.5.2. LGI.5.2: Private investment strategy
This indicator on private investment strategy has seven dimensions which are assessed
below.

 LGI.5.2: Private investment strategy


 5.2.1     Land to be made available to investors is             A policy to identify land that can be made available to
           identified transparently and publicly, in             investors exists, based on ad hoc assessment of land
           agreement with right holders.                         potential but with community consultation and
                                                                 agreement, and is applied in more than 90% of identified
                                                                 cases
 5.2.2     Investments are selected based on                     Process is in place that properly considers both national
           economic, socio-cultural and environmental            and local benefits and is adhered to. Benefit sharing
           impacts in an open process                            mechanism are in place
 5.2.3     Public institutions transferring land to              Institutions to make decisions are clearly identified and
           investors are clearly identified and regularly        have the necessary capacity (incl. resources for field
           audited                                               verification) and strong incentives in ensuring socially
                                                                 beneficial outcomes in a way that minimizes transaction
                                                                 costs
 5.2.4     Public bodies transferring land to investors          There is effective coordination to solve competing land
           share information and coordinate to                   use, although no policy is in place for effective inter-
           minimize and resolve overlaps (including              ministerial coordination to ensure that decisions on land
           sub-soil).                                            use and land rights are well coordinated across sectors.
 5.2.5     Compliance with contractual obligations is            There is regular monitoring of compliance, results are
           regularly monitored and remedial action               publicly available but remedial action is taken only in
           taken if needed.                                      some cases
 5.2.6     Safeguards effectively reduce the risk of             Substantive application and disclosure of safeguards
           negative effects from large scale land-               (EIA, SIA etc.) are in line with global best practice, and
           related investments.                                  mostly applied
 5.2.7     The scope for resettlement is clearly                 Resettlement policy does not exist; if resettlement takes
           circumscribed and procedures exist to deal            place than it is in an ad-hoc manner.
           with it in line with best practice.

Institutions that transfer land to investors are in place. In Rwanda, the law is very clear; it is
either the Cabinet or district councils that approve allocation of public land (transfer) and
issue instruments to that effect. The registrar of land titles can then register the transfer.
With a decentralization policy, districts are even allowed to allocate land to investors and
the level of resourceful persons is actually guaranteed because all land offices must be run
by qualified personnel at least of university degree level.

In Rwanda, there is no written policy that describes how land is transferred to investors. In
practice, all institutions dealing with transfer of public land have got clear coordination
amongst them. Normally, the process starts from RDB for purposes of registering the
investment and consequently requesting land. From that stage, RDB consults for farmland
either with MINAGRI first if it is a large piece of land and whether this is available, or directly
works with the district to identify land and informs the ministry later.

The only part of the country where land is set aside for investment is Kigali City via the 2013
Kigali master plan, which includes a free economic zone. The rest of the country does avail
land on an ad hoc basis. Potential land for investor is availed according to availability of
investment whose nature clearly meets the requirements of investment registration.

A process is in place for selecting and approving the investment based on economic, socio
and environmental benefits to the nation and the local people in general. In Rwanda, the
issue of environmental protection is treated with priority by each level of administration
and the general public is highly sensitized, though this should be a continuous process.
Legislation exists to ensure sustainable land use93 and prevent degradation and pollution.94

Upon the satisfaction of the Ministry concerned as regards the economic, social and
environmental matters, a cabinet decision is requested to transfer public land to investor.
Rwanda normally requires the consensus of the cabinet to reach such decision and this high
level meeting will assess the economic, social and environmental benefits and agreed upon
the land allocation. If approved, then RNRA is informed so as to implement the decision.

Consultations with the rightful owners are done and an agreement is reached before land is
acquired by investors, which is usually done through expropriation process. Although this

monitoring and enforcement of the planning of land use and development at all levels of administrative
entities in Rwanda towards sustainable and equitable social, economic and environment development for
current and future generations in Rwanda.
94
    Law n°63/2013 of 27/08/2013 determining the mission, organization and functioning of Rwanda
environment management authority (Rema) spells out regulations, modalities and penalties to prevent
environmental degradation or pollution.


                                                   76
process is done in a transparent manner, there are complaints over the compensation given
which is often low compared to the market value.

Resettlement policy does not exist and it only takes place when the need arises, on an ad-
hoc basis. However, Rwanda should develop a resettlement policy with all the regulations
for implementation, such as modalities of resettlement, responsibilities, categories of
people to be resettled, their rights and obligations of the authority. Policy should also be
looking at the short term and long term resettlement schemes based on the circumstances.
For instance some resettlement might be needed due to disaster or any other reason of
similar nature.

A process of sharing benefit is in place as one of the contractual obligations is to give back
some benefits to the residents of the place. This is well established in the tea sector. All
fifteen contracts for tea plantation privatization signed between government and investors
indicate that employees, who are organized in cooperatives, should get a percentage in the
shareholding structure, have stability in employment, and could be a supplier of tea leaves
(see examples in the table below).

Table 7: Shareholding structure between investors and cooperatives formed by the
citizens in tea sector

COOPTHE MULINDI                     MULINDI                                 35%

THE VILLAGEOIS                      ALL TEA FACTORIES                       10%


The process of monitoring of contractual obligations is in place and remedies where
necessary are also in force. In an instruction from Prime minister dated 28th May, 2014 on
recommendation from the Senate, it was emphasized that districts should always
participate in contract process regarding public assets transferred to investors for effective
monitoring of compliance. However, the results of the monitored obligations are only made
public when contractual obligations are not met and might necessitate repossessing the
land. Otherwise there is no practice of publicly showing the results from monitoring process.

The case of a “biofuel Company” is an example of how the monitoring process is
implemented. This company was given 8000 hectares of land to plant jatropha for producing
bio diesel fuel. However, the contractual obligations were not met as the company did not
grow jataropha and the government now intends to terminate the lease agreement and
assign to another investor to better utilize that land. Once the land is back in government’s


                                             77
possession, any investor interested in the land would go through competition as explained
above.

4.5.3. LGI.5.3: Policy implementation is effective, consistent and transparent and involves local
         stakeholders
This indicator has four dimensions analysed below.

         LGI.5.3: Policy implementation is effective, consistent and transparent and involves local stakeholders
 5.3.1   Investors provide sufficient                        Investors' business plans (application materials) require
         information to allow rigorous                       some evidence of technical viability, community
         evaluation of proposed                              consultation, and availability of resources but this is only
         investments.                                        sufficient to identify project risk ex ante
 5.3.2   Approval of investment plans                        All investment application related documents are reviewed
         follows a clear process with                        according to a uniform process and receive a response
         reasonable timelines                                within 3 months of date of submission
 5.3.3   Right holders and investors                         Those holding rights to land with potential for investment
         negotiate freely and directly                       have incentives to properly negotiate but their rights are
         with full access to relevant                        unclear or opportunities to obtain relevant information or
         information.                                        assistance do not exist
 5.3.4   Contractual provisions                              Modalities for benefit sharing are routinely included in
         regarding benefit sharing are                       relevant contractual arrangements, but there is limited
         publicly disclosed.                                 public disclosure



Law n° 26/2005 of 17/12/2005 relating to investment and export promotion and facilitation
in its article 3, stipulates that, all investors in Rwanda submit their business plan together
with their application of investment certificate. The investment business plan should clearly
include the following; executive summary of the project, profile of the project promoters,
project background, market study or market analysis, investment plan over a five year
period, the level of loan and equity financing, projected statement of income and
expenditures, projected balance sheet (five years), projected statement of cash flow,
payback period, NPV and IRR, loan amortization plan/schedule, project implementation
plan, notes on assumption made in the business plan (RDB, Rwanda investor info pack,
2014).

The process passes through an evaluation procedure conducted by RDB experts. The aim is
to verify whether the information therein actually matches the economic, social and
environmental benefits to the country. All investment plans at RDB are reviewed using the
uniform process and summarized in a table95 (RDB, One stop center, 2015). The investment
license will only be issued when RDB is satisfied with the flow of information in the business

95
   Areas to be filled by RDB staff: brief information about the company, project classification if it is new or an
already existing company, name of the company, promoter of the company, legal nature of the company
(Limited liability or public etc), address of the company, planned investment capital (equity or loan etc),
employment to be created as in numbers, categories of jobs, technical viability (kind of technology to be used),
financial viability which includes the expected yearly profits, expected taxes to be paid, expected net profit etc,
proposed methods of waste treatment, what promoters expect from RDB, observation by the staff and his/her
recommendation.

plan. The aim is that investors receive the decision on their licenses within 48 hours from
the time of application (which can be done online).

Following approval and identification of the land, right holders and investors negotiate
freely and they have full access to relevant information. However, there is no clear
assistance given to landowners when it comes to negotiating with investors, even although
this requires some skills and knowledge. It has been reported96 that educated and affluent
people are able to negotiate higher prices than those people who are uneducated.

The benefit sharing modalities is always embedded in the contracts and information is open
to public, like in the case of the tea industry (see example above). However, the means used
to know such details require the interested party to visit the land office, RDB or the
concerned investor or submit an application letter requesting such information with an
indication of the intended use of the information requested. There is no repository centre
(i.e. an electronic portal) where such information is stored and can be accessed by any
interested party.

4.5.4. Contracts involving public land are public, easily accessible, with agreements monitored and
         enforced
This indicator has three dimensions as presented below.

    LGI: 5.4 Contracts involving public land are public, easily accessible, with agreements monitored and
                                                   enforced.

          compliance exist and obtain timely
                                                                 mechanisms to quickly and effectively reach arbitration in
          and fair decisions.

Information related to leases for investors is always available in land offices to any
interested party by law97, but it is given on request.

There is little third-party monitoring of investors' compliance with safeguards and
mechanisms to ensure adherence quickly and effectively are virtually non-existent.

   The investor who developed the Kigali conventional centre was in charge of negotiating and carrying out the
expropriation. Some people claimed to have received more money because they were better able to
negotiate.

   Ministerial order n°002/2008 of 01/4/2008 determining modalities of land registration article 21 which states that” The
Register of Titles and the Alphabetical Index are public documents. Anyone may consult them under the supervision of the
Registrar or the Deputy Registrar, after paying the fee determined by the regulations.
                                                            79
The avenues to deal with non-compliance exist in Rwanda, but it is not done in a systematic
way. It happens on a case by case basis through community initiatives or through
government offices like those in charge of environment for issues related to land
degradation. A good example is the recent mining concession (Gatumba) that was closed
due to the outcry of residents who claimed that the mining activities were contaminating
their water as well as creating noise pollution. This initiative from local residents brought
the mine to a stop.

Other examples include:

    1- Sociex Ltd in agriculture. This was a company that had around 100 hectares of land
       where the company was supposed to grow maize. Instead, the company resorted to
       renting land to cooperatives of residents of the same area, who subsequently
       complained to government on the wastage of land by the company for it was not
       doing what it presented to government, as well as their behaviour of renting out
       land at higher prices when it had been obtained at small price.

    2- Rwanda Flora Ltd, flower farm in Nyacyonga. The people complained about the
         wastage of a large piece of land that was not utilised by the company for over five
         years when it could be made productive by other people. In addition, people
         complained about the loss of employment opportunities for farmers. This flower
         farm spent many years without working and consequently was declared bankrupt by
         court of law and placed in liquidation. So the residents of Nyacyonga through its
         district of Gasabo complained and government decided to take back the land.

To ensure land rights of every individual are protected,98 the GoR put in place the NLP, land
law and other subsidiary decrees. As a result, there is a clear, practical and formal process of
recognizing individual, State and public land and this process has been implemented
effectively, consistently and transparently since 2009 when implementation of land tenure
regularization started through a systematic land registration process as explained above
(Chapter 3).

The land law and other subsidiary decrees recognize all forms of ownership that existed
prior to formal registration of land as well as long-term, unchallenged possession, whether
public or private land (although different rules may apply). During LTR, non-documentary
evidence (mainly word of mouth) was acceptable99 as proof of land rights. The adjudication

land without necessarily requiring any written evidence. Post LTR, this is clearly no longer an
acceptable form of evidence, since land documents now protect landowners’ land rights.

First time registration in Rwanda has been a systematic process, with registration fees for a
rural parcel (irrespective of size) amounting to USD 1.5 and less than USD 8 per parcel in
urban areas. Government exempted poor people from paying the registration fee.

Post LTR, registration is much more expensive. Fees charged for parcels that are subdivided
or merged are high. In addition, land survey costs are USD 50 per parcel, which is
particularly high for many people in rural areas where the land value may be very low.
Survey costs for parcel subdivision may even exceed USD 50 if the surveyor has to travel
long distances.100


4.6.2. LGI 6.2. Completeness of the land registry
This indicator has seven dimensions, as assessed below.

                                    LGI 6.2. Completeness of the land registry

 6.2.2    Information held in records is                         More than 90% of records for privately held

 6.2.3    All relevant private encumbrances                      Relevant private encumbrances are recorded
          are recorded                                           consistently and in a reliable fashion and can
                                                                 be verified at low cost by any interested party
 6.2.4    All relevant public restrictions or                    Relevant public restrictions or charges are
          charges are recorded                                   recorded consistently and in a reliable fashion
                                                                 and can be verified at a low cost by any
                                                                 interested party.
 6.2.5    There is a timely response to                          Copies or extracts of documents recording
          requests for accessing registry                        rights in property can generally be obtained
          records                                                within 1 week of request.

100
     To merge or subdivide plots, rectify boundaries or move from general boundaries to fixed boundaries,
there is a minimum survey fee of 30,000 Frws to a private surveyor for land less than a hectare. Each portion
above a hectare will be charged at an additional fee of 30,000 Frws. This fee is not organized by any legal
instrument.

101
   This dimension has been split into urban and rural areas because the situation is different in both areas. In
rural areas, the cost of registering a property transfer may exceed 5% of the property value because generally
land holdings in rural areas are small and therefore their value is small.
                                                       82
 6.2.6   The registry is searchable                             The records in the registry can be searched by
                                                                both right holder name and parcel.
 6.2.7   Land information records are                           Copies or extracts of documents recording
         easily accessed                                        rights in property can only be obtained by
                                                                intermediaries     and     those    who    can

                                                                payment of the necessary formal fee, if any.



As stated earlier, all land in Rwanda has been registered and mapped. The current land
register has been linked to the spatial database to the extent that there is only one digital
land register integrating both textual and spatial databases. Each individual parcel is
mapped and has a unique parcel identifier (UPI). Information on land use, owner’s name,
parcel location, lease term, parcel size etc. are all registered in the land register including
the rights and obligations of landowners.

Rwanda has a digital land register (LAIS) which makes land related records easily searchable
by both right holder name and parcel. They can also be searchable by identification number
(ID) or passport number of the right holder. The digital land register has now been
decentralized for 29 out of 30 districts across the country, so this system can be accessed
more easily as applications are being processed at this level.

According to the law, the land register is a public document102 and anyone interested can
view its content. In practice, no restrictions are reported, except for national security
activities or privacy reasons. Copies or extracts of register documents can be obtained by
anyone who pays the appropriate fee (if any).

For information sharing purposes, some government organisations such as RDB, District
Land offices and commercial banks are connected to the land register with the right to
access only the information/function they need. However, the digital register is not yet
linked to other important systems such as e-court systems.

All encumbrances such as mortgages, caveats of various forms and disputes are recorded
against the relevant parcel on LAIS. However, some encumbrances may not be recorded
mainly as a result of people not knowing how and where to do so. There are no alternative
means to verify encumbrances that are unreported and awareness campaigns would be
useful.

LAIS records all relevant public restrictions or charges which are brought to the registrar of
land titles for registration and these can be verified at a small cost by any interested party.


102
   Article 22 of Ministerial Order n°002/2008 of 01/4/2008 determining modalities of land registration provides
that “the Register of Titles and the Alphabetical Index are public documents. Anyone may consult them under
the supervision of the Registrar or the Deputy Registrar, after paying the fee determined by the regulations”.
                                                      83
Because there is no categorisation of public restrictions in LAIS, it is almost impossible to
carry out any analysis.

Rwanda has introduced a ‘one day, one procedure’103 for commercial and all investment
related land transactions. Should an application meet the necessary requirements, the
transaction will be done in a day with a new title issued the same day. All other transactions
are processed within seven days. In Kigali, the office of the Deputy Registrar of Land Titles
in partnership with District Land offices receive and process at least 50 files a week and the
service is regularly monitored by the legal department.

The decentralization of land administration services has reduced the cost, number of steps
and time for land transactions. Additional benefits include: giving powers to district land
officers and sector land managers to act as public notaries; the abolition of a required
notarized sale contract; and the abolition of a required tax clearance certificate. Local
authorities below sector level are being strengthened and assigned with the task of
monitoring and providing the service of registering land transfers as well as notary services.

There is a flat fee of 27.000 Frw for property transfer irrespective of value (comprising
20,000 Frw for transfer fee, 2,000 Frw for notary fee and 5,000 Frw for the issuance of a
new title). The standard fee for property transfer of 20,000 Rwandan francs was introduced
in 2009 and replaced 6% of total sales value. For urban land, the total cost for property
transfer is now less than 1% of the property value whereas in rural areas, the transaction
fees can be more than 30% or even 40% of the property value.104

Although this flat fee might have facilitated investment, small rural landowners have been
facing challenges to pay this amount. This is a primary reason for not reporting transactions
as the flat transfer fee is disproportionate to the relatively low value of rural land holding.
Distance and high travel costs to land offices are other reasons. As a result, a considerable
number of land transactions have not been formally registered, undermining the quality of
the registry and the LTR process. Moreover, unregistered transactions are not legally
recognised, and can become a source of dispute.

The policy of setting up a flat fee for all transactions is advantageous for those who have
high property value, but is punitive for those who cannot afford to pay. Hence, there is a
need to review this policy to make it more balanced. A formal process has been initiated to
reduce transfer fees.

In order to inform people about land related services and encourage them to register land
transactions, RNRA introduced a land week campaign where staff from RNRA head offices
and zonal offices, district land officers and sector land managers run various meetings in all


103
      This was introduced following a study visit by the office of registrar staff to Georgia.
104
      These figures are estimates only because there has not been a proper study to document this.
                                                        84
districts to meet land owners, answer questions, provide notary services for those who
transacted their land etc. This campaign lasts for one month and is done annually.

When there is a transaction which needs parcel boundary rectification (i.e. parcel merging
or subdivision), the cadastral map must reflect the new changes and update the information
in the land register. However, where such transactions are not reported, the cadastral map
will not be reflective of the reality on the ground. Below is example of mapped parcels in
rural areas:

4.6.3. LGI 6.3: Reliability: Registry information is updated and sufficient to make meaningful
         inferences on ownership
This indicator has two dimensions as detailed below.

 6.3.2   Registry information is up-to-date                    Not scored
         and reflect ground reality


Links are in place for all types of public land information registries and mandatory checks
are performed to ensure legitimacy of any transactions that materially affects certain
parties’ land rights before they can be finalized. Interoperability between the land register
and the national ID project helps to ensure that claimants to land are genuine and that land
leases and certificates are allocated correctly. Further, the register is linked to the mortgage
registration system and Kigali city master plan. Interoperability in this way helps to reduce
costs and risks associated with mortgage registration.

Some LTR registration may have been fraudulent. For example, where the adjudication
process was not able to identify clearly the real owner, it may have been possible for
someone to register a parcel of land that did not in fact belong to them. During panel
discussions, it was noted that there were a few cases where claimants used non-
documentary evidence to abuse other people’s legitimate rights. As indicated earlier, there
are also cases of private registration of public land, some of which are now disputed by
government. It should be noted that fraudulent land owners, with legal land documents
(that have not been disputed) can legally sell a parcel that does not belong them. The
“curtain principle” of Torrens registration system, also applied in Rwanda, enables the
person who is appearing in the land registry to be regarded as the true owner.


                                                     85
The expert investigator had scored A for this dimension, “ Registry information is up-to-date
and reflects ground reality“, because he believed the register is up to date to the scale of 90%.
However, panellists argued that the land week campaign showed that many informal
transactions are not recorded therefore the register is not kept up to date. They also
revealed that there are no statistical records which would serve as basis for the dimension
score.

4.6.4. LGI: 6.4 Cost -effectiveness and sustainability: Land administration services are provided in
        cost - effective ways that are sustainable in the long term.
This indicator has two dimensions, described below.

                                                                  developments



Currently, there is no mechanism in place to monitor if the registry is financially sustainable.

The government, in collaboration with development partners, is supporting the land
administration system. The law that sets up the registry does not allow it to collect any fees.
RNRA collected land registration fees during the land registration process but all revenues
were given to the national treasury. Some key activities including the payment of sector
land managers are funded by donors.

Collected fees from land transactions and other land services are used for district
operational services. Most land-based service fees, including issuing a new title, transaction
fees and fixed asset taxes are collected by the district authorities even though some of these
services are provided by RNRA (as required by law). Some districts fail to invest in their land
offices despite them generating a bigger share of the district budget.

Human and physical capital investment is sufficient to maintain current service standards
related to LTR, but does not account for new land administration requirements. Demand for
quality services still weighs supply. For example, 86 sector land manager positions out of
416 are still not filled. Further, some key services (such as land valuation, land surveying
etc.) do not have sufficiently qualified and skilled staff to occupy these posts.

4.6.5. LGI: 6.5 Fees are determined transparently to cover the cost of services provision.
This indicator has three dimensions, as discussed below.

              LGI: 6.5 Fees are determined transparently to cover the cost of services provision.
 6.5.1   Fees have a clear rationale, their                     A clear rationale and schedule of fees for
         schedule is public, and all                            different services is publicly accessible and
         payments are accounted for                             receipts are issued for all transactions.
 6.5.2   Informal payments are                                  Effective mechanisms to detect and deal with
         discouraged                                            illegal staff behaviour exist in all registry offices
                                                                and all cases are promptly dealt with.
 6.5.3   Service standards are published                        Effective mechanisms to detect and deal with
         and regularly monitored                                illegal staff behaviour exist in all registry offices
                                                                and all cases are promptly dealt with.



Each district can set its own land administration service fees (although some are fixed)105
within the range as provided for by the law. District councils have the responsibility to
implement and publish rational and affordable fees. Fees paid differ between the 30
districts depending on land use and location. The way the fees are established is therefore
not necessarily based on cost of service provision.

Effective mechanisms to detect and deal with illegal staff behaviour exist in all registry
offices and all cases are promptly dealt with. To discourage illegal payments, payments for
various services are paid through the bank. In rural areas, payments are done through
saving cooperative schemes (SACCOS), with RRA being in charge of monitoring this process.
The office of the Ombudsman also monitors (mainly senior) staff in the land registry that
have the ability to abuse their positions to acquire wealth illegally. This is done through an
annual declaration of wealth to the Ombudsman office.

The land registry has introduced a digital document tracking system which notifies the route
of a file at different levels to support the standard monitoring process. This “land query
notification system” sends text messages to the applicants once the application moves
through various steps/phases. In addition, there is a “document tracking system” , an
application used by staff responsible for land administration services. It allows progress to
be monitored in processing applications and allows management to monitor staff

    Fees charged for services related to land tittles, leases of immovable property are set as follows: Changing
ownership of immovable property for any reasons shall be subject to a fee equal to twenty thousand Rwandan
francs (Rwf 20,000) irrespective of the value of concerned immovable property; Registration, cancellation,
review or assignment of debt mortgage shall be subject to a fee equal to one thousand and two hundred
Rwandan francs (Rwf 1,200); Changes or requests for a new land lease tittle issued by the Land Registrar shall
be subject to a fee equal to five thousand Rwandan Francs (Rwf 5,000); Request for a map showing the
boundaries, design and acreage of a land plot shall be subject to a fee equal to ten thousand Rwandan franc
(Rwf 10,000).105

effectiveness in service delivery. However, the tracking system is neither structured nor
regular.

If an application is delayed by one particular staff, the system would be able to detect who
is delaying the process and necessary action can be taken.

Service standards are published through a district client charter and are always monitored
by a task force established by the prime minister to ensure services are delivered effectively.

To improve further the quality of services a “land model office” is being developed. This
model office is meant to be a place where all land delivery service procedures are tested,
and applied effectively. Other land offices will come to learn and apply similar procedures
and processes in their respective offices.

The focus of this section is on valuation for the “fixed assets tax106” or property tax for land
and property held under freehold and annual lease fee for parcels held under long term
lease, and with also some references to expropriation.

Initially, valuation was mainly done for expropriation purposes and only
investment/infrastructure on land was valuated. The value of the land itself was excluded
because the State claimed ownership. This practice changed after the promulgation of the
2005 land law that recognised people’s rights to land and which fed into the 2007
expropriation law that set out modalities and procedures for expropriation.

The valuation profession in Rwanda is relatively new and only formally established in
2010107.
This is unlike in the past where valuation was carried out by random people who were
predominantly civil engineers and were regulated by the central bank. This was mainly the
case because there were not land economics and land valuation specialists in the country.
Anyone who had completed a civil engineering, architecture or construction degree and was
willing to enter the valuation profession had to apply to the central bank which registered
them and allowed them to carry out valuation work. However, this process was not a
requirement under any law.

In 2010, the government of Rwanda introduced law N°17/2010 of 12/05/2010 establishing
and organising the real property valuation profession in Rwanda. However, the Institute of
real property valuers (IRPV) has not done enough to raise awareness amongst land users,
and apart from registering professional land valuers, IRPV has done much yet to improve
capacity and benefit from regional cooperation as Rwanda valuers are lagging behind and it
was also observed that some of the registered valuers struggle with some of the valuation
methods. During panel discussions in February 2015, the president of the IRPV announced
that an action plan is being developed, including a land valuation database. IRPV is in
discussions with Rwanda Revenue Authority and the banks on how to strengthen
relationships and improve knowledge of IRPV members.108.

   Law N° 59/2011 of 31/12/2011 establishes the sources of revenues and property of decentralised entities
and governing their management defines fixed asset tax as “a tax levied on immovable property”/ “property
that has a fixed location and cannot be moved elsewhere and includes parcels of land, buildings and
improvements thereto”. All fixed assets must be valued.

    law N°17/2010 of 12/05/2010 on establishment of the Institute of real property valuation in Rwanda, its
functions, organisation and responsibilities and the establishment of the council of regulation and its
responsibilities. The law also discusses briefly valuation methods. Article 27 stipulates that “Valuation of any
type requires that the valuer apply one or more valuation methods provided by the valuation law this Law or
any other method accepted by the Council. The valuer shall select the best valuation method that can be used
to determine the fair market value of the real property.”

The 2010 law also stipulated land valuation to be based on land market price. However, in
some rural areas this is not the case. Prior to the law approval of the law mentioned above,
in 2008, the Government had established reference land prices used for expropriation
purposes. These land prices are still being used as reference prices during the valuation
process for expropriation purposes mainly in the rural areas partly because people cannot
afford to pay professional valuers. Moreover, even when land valuation is done, market
prices ae not always considered. In this regard, Goodfellow109 notes for example that in
Ubumwe cell in Kigali city, landowners were paid by the city authorities around RwF
1000/m2 while the land nearby was paid RwF77,000/m2 and suggests that this “huge
discrepancy in pricing emerged partly because there was little by way of systematic
Valuation.” All these practices lead to many complaints by expropriated land holders over
lack of fair compensation.

This is expected to change as the amended expropriation law gives professional certified
valuers the right to review land prices every two years as a way of avoiding speculation and
ensuring that expropriated people are given fair compensation which is equivalent to the
market price. There are still challenges related mainly to the limited number of qualified
valuers, inability to pay for them by many people in rural areas.

There are no valuation rolls in place yet in Rwanda even though the 2011 fiscal
decentralization law110 suggests that such document/file containing all property values in
districts be established.
Currently, there are ongoing discussions between Australian company, Property Mode, and
the Government to see how property values can be captured and updated on a regular
basis. Further, the government through the ministry of finance has started the process of
reviewing the property taxation system with the proposal of having property tax and other
local land revenues collected by the RRA which has more capacity than districts which
currently have the task of collecting all land based revenues. Consultations with all key
government and private institutions are underway to ensure that their ideas are taken on
board. It is assumed that RRA will establish a uniform and advanced property and land
revenues collection system across the country and establish effective ways of monitoring
property tax and land based revenues collection system.

Though real property tax and lease fees are newly introduced since the LTR, taxation as such
is not new. Pre-colonial, indigenous rulers and institutions Umwami allocated land to their
subjects who were expected to provide free labour in return. The Belgian colonial
administration built on this practice and introduced in 1912 a graduated tax and tax on real
property.111 After independence, the 1973 law governing property tax was adopted, which
was reformed in 1997. The 2002112 reforms that introduced administrative decentralization
also addressed fiscal decentralization, which was repealed in 2011. After adopting Law nº
59/2011 of 31/12/2011, the government promulgated Presidential Order N°25/01 of
09/07/2012 establishing the list of fees and other charge levied by decentralized entities,
including the threshold levels.113 This order serves as the main legal guide for establishing
land-related revenues.114

Article 4 of the 2011 law stipulates that the revenue of decentralised entities should come
from various sources, including funds obtained from rent and sale of land of decentralized
entities, funds obtained from issuance of land certificates by decentralized entities, all other
fees and penalties that may be collected by decentralized entities according to any other

Rwandan law, fixed asset tax and rental income tax. The tax on a ‘’fixed asset,’’115 should be
levied on the market value of parcels of land, buildings, and other immovable
improvements, such as quarries.

Most land is held under leasehold from the state and land holders pay an annual lease fee. A
lease certificate is subject to pay an annual lease fee, which applies to commercial,
industrial and residential lands. Article 18 of the 2011 law establishing sources of revenue
for decentralised entities provides a list of property which should be exempted from paying
tax. Land used for agriculture, livestock or forestry which is under two hectares, fixed assets
and usufructs used primarily for residential purposes with a value not exceeding 3,000,000
RwF is exempt to pay tax or lease fee. If the assessed value exceeds such an amount, only
the excess value shall be taxed. The law also exempts land reserved for construction of
houses in rural areas, without basic infrastructure. The order also gives the District Council
the authority to exempt any other land. There are some poverty categorisations of those
who cannot afford to pay social service fees (e.g. mutuel de santé etc.) and various taxes
imposed by the State, including land-based taxes and fees. This poverty categorisation
process is community led.

As mentioned above, there is no land valuation rolls in place in Rwanda for fixed asset tax.
The fact that districts (responsible for collecting land-based taxes and fees) usually do not
possess adequate records of all taxable land parcels and the amount of fees to be collected
presents a major challenge to revenue collection efforts. Only a few land fixed asset /
property tax payers are known (especially in urban areas) as well as those own their land
under freehold tenure system.

Since all land in Rwanda is registered, the land register has all parcels where annual land
lease fee is required. Figures collected in November 2014 from the digital land register
(LAIS) shows that the number of parcels where lease fees are required to be paid is
1,545,105 or 15% of all land registered across the country. A study by Musharraf et al (2013)
revealed that the estimated revenue potential from only assessing fees and taxes on
agriculture parcels over 2 hectares that are liable to pay RwF 4,000 per hectare116 is Rwf 1.4
billion.117

Parcels where lease fees are required are scattered in both urban and rural areas with urban
areas requiring the majority of lease fees since most agriculture and grazing land in Rwanda
are smaller than two hectares and therefore are not subject to paying any lease fee.
However, the register was not able to provide the total amount of lease fees. At the time of

115 Article 2, 19 º of Law nº 59/2011 of 31/12/2011 defines ‘’fixed asset’’ as a property that has a fixed location and cannot
be moved elsewhere and include parcels of land, buildings and improvements thereto.

collecting the information, reporting modules were being developed in LAIS to ensure that
in the future such information is easily accessible.

Even though property tax and land lease fees collection system is inefficient and almost
non-existent in some districts of the country, assessed property taxes and land lease fees
are collected at the maximum level. This is eased by the fact that currently, identified tax
payers have been given the option to pay the land tax and land lease fees in instalments
instead of being required to pay a lump sum as used to be the case. Before October 2012,
taxes were paid directly to the tax collection branches of the districts located in sector
offices. Now, taxpayers first go to a financial institution, either a bank or a SACCO (a
financial cooperative institution) pay the amount due for a specific tax or fee such as the
annual lease fee, obtain a receipt from the financial institution and surrender this receipt to
the tax collection office in exchange of a tax receipt.

Although, Kigali city districts have systems that facilitate property tax and land lease fee
collection, these need further improvement to ensure all amount due are effectively
collected. A recent study on land lease fees and property tax collected by local government
in Kigali City found that collected land revenues increased sharply from RwF 1,934,072,537
in 2011 to RwF 10,628,076,702 in 2013 (World bank, 2014).118 For all Rwanda as a whole,
the targeted land lease fees amount (RwF 182,342,675), of which only 41.6% (RwF
76,000,353) was collected up from 30 % between 2012 and 2013, only 30% 119. There are
exceptions and Kayonza district, for example, collected 100% of targeted fixed assets tax
(property tax) for 2013 and 2014 , while this is less in other districts due to a of information
on the exact number of properties owing taxes and fees. Most of the time the targeted
amount to be collected is based on pure assumption (USAID, 2014). 120

Even though the property tax collection system still faces challenges, the amount of
property tax collected on assessed property exceeds the total cost spent to collect these
taxes. Property tax departments in districts do not have many staff since tax payment is
done through the bank. The tax department’s role is to ensure that bank reconciliation is
done properly and for this role, districts do not need many staff.

In Rwanda, there are parallel avenues for dispute resolution. They can be informal or
formal and either dealt with at the local administrative level – including mediation
committees (“Abunzi”) - and judicial ways via conventional tribunals.

There are numerous informal systems that are used to resolve land disputes. When a land
dispute involves members of the same family, often the family council can solve the dispute.
When land disputes are outside the family, two or more people who are in dispute can
agree on how to resolve the dispute and most of the time groups like ikimina121, cooperative
or association intervene to mediate parties in such disputes.



121 “Ikimina” is an informal group of people who actually work together, practice same
activity like motorcycle drivers, or who are de facto group. The aim of those kind of groups
is to help each other, advisory, to mediate in case of dispute, …
                                                           94
On the other hand, if concerned parties cannot agree on how to resolve the disputes, there
are other local and informal methods used such as “Population council” (Inteko
y’abaturage) where citizens are invited to participate in land dispute resolution. Usually,
resolution of land disputes where the local population is invited to help find a solution takes
places on the disputed land itself. All disputants with the help of local people are
encouraged to resolve their issue on the spot. The same system is applied during “ Inama ya
nyuma y’umuganda” (meetings held after community works held every last Saturday of th e
month in all neighbourhoods) and “akagoroba k’ababyeyi”. All these are platforms used
where citizens come together to share ideas, best practices and to resolve disputes,
including land disputes.

Land disputes amongst individuals, families and other private parties may be taken to
administrative authorities (Umudugudu, Cell, Sector, District, Office of the ombudsman, etc)
and those institutions would assist in getting the disputes resolved. Given the
decentralisation nature of the Rwanda administration system, it is possible to use the lowest
administrative entity, either the umudugudu (village level), which is supposed to cover 100
households, or the cell level - composed of three to five imidugudu. Both umudugudu and
cell levels are very near to the population and they both play a key role in dispute resolution
before the dispute is escalated to other levels. There is no need for anyone to pay for
transport costs or walk long distances to access umudugu or cell leaders. When a dispute
case is pursued at local administration level, the appeal is done at the superior level at any
time free of charge.


Methods described above resolve a significant number of land disputes and solution
adopted by using one of those methods is recognized in formal administration or judicial
system. A good example is the case whereby the Registrar of land titles may remove a land
dispute recorded in any case and at any time with the consent of all interested parties
without any intervention of local administration or judges.

One case can be submitted to different institutions in parallel. Parallel dispute resolution
can only happen in informal disputes resolution practices and never in the judicial system.
However, even though there is no established mechanism for sharing information, some
methods used are helpful as far as information sharing is concerned:

   Institutions have learned to resolve land disputes in the field. Once field visits are
    organized to resolve land disputes, local-based institutions are invited to participate and
    therefore information is shared amongst all represented institutions.

   Another method is “Dispute booklet (Agakayi k’ibibazo)”- a system introduced by local
    authorities that helps track how a given dispute was resolved. With this system, the
                                              95
      dispute resolution starts at the lowest administrative entity “ Umudugudu/Village”. At
      each administrative level, they record how a given dispute was resolved and the
      authority who resolved has to sign and stamp in that booklet. When the case is
      appealed to a higher administrative authority, they are required to present the booklet.

However, clear information and communication exchange mechanisms amongst all
institutions involved in land disputes resolution is needed, as it is very easy to overlap.

The judicial system begins with mediation committees (Abunzi) based at cell and sector
levels. All these instances are accessible to all communities and they are empowered to
provide a first instance of conflict resolution as well as to take a bidding decision. The
mediation committee’s competence is limited to the value of the land in dispute, the case
has to be pursued in the Primary Court if the land being disputed is above a certain value
(Frw 3,000,000). In Rwanda there are 60 primary courts which have the power to deal with
land disputes; an equivalent of at least two Primary Courts in each district.

Whereas when the case was taken to the mediation committee at cell level, the appeal is
done at the sector level free of charge. However, if the dispute is not resolved at any of the
levels mentioned above, it will be referred to the primary or intermediate court according to
their respective competency. At this stage, the disputant has to pay court fees. People are
often advised to refer to the mediation committees to settle their disputes in order to save
time and money because cases heard in the courts involve many people, cost a lot of money
and time, affecting not only the parties but also judges, lawyers, bailiffs and even the State.
For instance, the court fee to introduce a demand before primary court is 25,000 frw and
50,000 frw at intermediate court.122

In addition to this, though the appeal is free at certain levels, the applicant has to follow the
case and s/he is obliged to leave her daily activities which is likely to impact household
income, require transport and accommodation etc. Further, if the dispute is not resolved
amicably by using the above mentioned informal or administrative methods, the applicant
will have to bear the cost of the court bailiff to execute the decision.

However, any strategy that would help people use informal dispute resolution methods
which are less time consuming and costly would be recommended. On top of solving the
dispute, they also provide reconciliation and restore trust in the community.

This indicator has three dimensions.

In Rwanda, there is a comprehensive land dispute database which is integrated in the land
register but this is not linked to the e-court system. As a result, there is a difficulty in
knowing the exact number of land disputes in courts the former are categorised within the
category of civil matters which include other cases not related to land. Since land related
disputes are recorded under civil cases, it is not ease to find the exact number of land
related cases in a given court. It would be good if the judiciary system could review their
classification and record system accordingly.

However, at intermediate court, there are many land related cases and it is estimated that
70% of case brought before primary court and intermediate court in the first Instance are
land related cases123. Also, those figures may be justified by the fact that some cases are
submitted directly to formal courts without passing through the mediation committees due
to the limited jurisdiction and competence of the mediators.
The table below presents a report by the Supreme Court for the period between 2012
and 2013 on the average time a certain court would take to make decision about cases

From what can be seen in the table above, the timeline between receiving cases and making
decision illustrated above is in line with what is proposed by the law except for the Supreme
Court.

Based on the annual report produced by Supreme Court; a decision in Primary court is
reached in Five months, four months in intermediate courts and seven months in High court
and 32 months in Supreme Court124. As for the cases submitted to administrative officials,
the seized authority is required to respond in a period of one (1) month which runs from the
date he/she received the informal appeal125. If he/she does not respond, the request shall
be considered as if it is rejected and the party can lodge the case in a competent court.

The increased knowledge and capacity of judges have reduced the amount of time
previously spent in making decision. This has led courts to make quicker decisions. If the
party who lodges the case does not follow it for a period of more than 6 months, his or her
case is dismissed in court’s records. This reform also contributed to the reduction of long -
standing land disputes in the courts around the country.

There are no long standing land cases considering that most land cases are found in primary
and intermediate courts. Some cases which may take long in the court are found in the
Supreme Court. Thus, following what has been said above, one would conclude that, the
long standing land disputes in Rwanda are between 5 and 10 percent of all cases in the
courts.

4.9. Institution arrangements and policies

This panel has two indicators and 13 dimensions. The indicators are:

        LGI: 9.1: Clarity of mandates and practice: institutional mandates
         concerning the regulation and management of the land sector are clearly
         defined, duplication of responsibilities is avoided and information is
         shared as needed.
        LGI: 9.2 Equity and non-discrimination in the decision-making process:
         policies are formulated in a broad public process, address equity, and
         implementation is meaningfully monitored.

         public bodies; key parts are                            reasonable cost and is readily accessible, largely due to
         regularly reported on and                               the fact that land information is maintained in a
         publicly accessible.                                    uniform way
 9.1.5   Overlaps of rights (based on                            The Legal framework and procedures for land-related
         tenure typology) are                                    matters (incl. renewable and subsoil resources) are

         problems.                                               for coordination are in place and regularly used




                                                        99
All institutions dealing with land administration issues have their respective mandates
clearly defined and are decentralized to facilitate service delivery at different territorial
administrative levels. The legal framework and procedures related to land are consistently
drafted.

When a land policy is formulated, such as the NLP, the ministry responsible for land
provides a draft which is then debated within the wider environment and natural resources
sector, and land sub-sector group (comprising government ministries and departments, civil
society organizations, donor agencies, and academic institutions). The agreed final draft is
then taken to Cabinet for consultation, then approval. Once approved, the policy is
implemented by the relevant land institutions under the ministry responsible for land,
namely, RNRA, as well as other departments from ministries also involved in land
use/management. The Abunzi and lower courts are responsible for arbitrating local land
issues. Where these issues cannot be resolved, they are escalated to the higher courts.
These functions generally operate separately and independently with some level of
collaboration, mainly limited to information exchange. For example, with respect to land
litigation, the land registry would be required to disclose relevant information to assist in
the resolution of land related disputes handled by the court in question.

Generally, there are few examples of overlaps of rights since the legal and regulatory
framework that governs land management, land tenure and land administration in Rwanda
is clear about tenure typology. However, there are examples where certain conflicts arise
between landowners and the State. For example, the law provides that subsoil resources
belong to the State. Where such resources, (e.g. coltan) are discovered on land owned by an
individual, the State has the mandate to expropriate the land and compensate the land
owner, even if the land is freehold.

Interpretation and application of these tools are sometimes contradictory. This is often as a
result of a lack of capacity in terms of knowledge by the responsible body. For example,
with respect to the judiciary, there have been some recent examples of the courts finding
that individual pieces of land should be sub-divided in situations where the piece of land is
agricultural land and is less than one hectare in size. In this case, the Office of the Registrar
of Land Titles has not enforced these rulings since the law only allows subdivision above one
hectare.

There are also situations where separation of roles is not always clear-cut. For example,
where there are complaints with respect to service delivery by a particular institution, that
same institution will be responsible for addressing the complaint (e.g. complaints by
individuals for delaying transfer of land rights, or title documents, with RNRA being both the
subject and arbiter.



                                              100
Horizontal overlaps amongst institutions are often a result of having mandates that are
similar. This is the case, for example, between Rwanda Housing Authority (RHA) and RNRA,
where both are responsible for land use planning at national and local level. This causes
confusion when land use plans are being prepared especially at district level. Although RHA
is supposed to focus more on urban centres and RNRA on rural land at national level, RNRA
also has the mandate to draw national land use plans to provide guidelines on land use plan
development in both urban and rural areas. When it comes to individual land use plan
development at district level, there are similarities in mandates of both organizations. This is
evidenced by district professionals working with both RHA and RNRA in district land use
plans where they often complain of receiving diverging messages from both bodies. During
panel discussions, it was suggested that where such duplication arises, institutions should
be merged (where the problem is endemic) or responsibility be delegated to one institution
only. This would improve efficiency.

That said, there are examples where institutions sometimes have conflicting mandates with
respect to land which can cause problems. Following the land registration process, Rwanda
Transport Development Authority (RTDA) was given the mandate to allocate road reserves,
sometimes encompassing (either partly or wholly) privately-owned land which was
previously registered (thereby sanctioned) by RNRA. These landowners were unable to use
their land, and were even required by Rwanda Revenue Authority to pay tax for the land
they ‘owned’.

Institutions at the decentralized level are generally set up with distinct mandates but more
clarity of roles and responsibilities is desirable especially during the implementation of cross
cutting projects such as land use plans. The District land office (DLO) was used as an
example. RNRA considers that it has the technical mandate to support and advise the DLO,
but the district executive authority also believes that the DLO is under its mandate as it is
housed under district premises, and they also pay the district land officers. Inevitably, the
DLO receives multiple (sometimes contradictory) instructions from the two institutions.
Panelists observed that often planning is done in isolation and in an ad hoc manner,
resulting in poor implementation of various programmes. Lack of integrated planning and
communication amongst institutions were raised as reasons for these issues.

There are functioning mechanisms in place to support the coordination between all land
institutions, and cooperation is observed on a regular basis through various working group
meetings, workshops and joint field visits. For example, the environment and natural
resources (ENR) sector group brings together all institutions working on land and other
natural resources. There is also a land sub-sector committee that brings together all
institutions that work on land at central and local level, development partners and civil
society organizations.


                                              101
Regarding information sharing, RNRA has also developed a national land use master plan
and is currently supporting districts to develop detailed districts land use plans. This
information is held by RNRA, as custodian. The National Land Use Planning portal which is
an electronic platform used to share land use information and data free of charge.

Land right and use information is stored in a uniform way, by a single institution, RNRA. The
land register holds land information for each parcel of registered land, including parcel size,
location, and land owners’ names, information related to the rights and obligations of
landowners, land use and restrictions. Individuals, government and private institutions in
need of information pertaining to land apply to RNRA. Information requested by
government institutions is given free of charge, such as to the courts, the ombudsman office
and other ministries. With respect to land litigation, the land registry would be required to
disclose relevant information to assist in the resolution of land related disputes handled by
the court in question.

Given that the register is public information, individuals who are interested in land related
information recorded on the register, are also able to access certain information under the
supervision of the registrar of land titles. There is a small cost involved for obtaining this
information. However, due to confidentiality issues, not all information can be shared with
the general public (e.g. information related to national security, personal information,
mortgage details etc.). Some information can be accessed via other methods such as the
National Land Use Planning portal which is an electronic platform used to share land use
information and data free of charge.

Food security, security of tenure, and poverty reduction are some of the key pillars upon
which the NLP is built. Its objectives advocate for equity and poverty reduction (GoR, 2004),
including: (i) to establish a land tenure system that guarantees tenure security for all
Rwandans for the promotion of investment in land; (ii)to promote good allocation of land in
order to enhance rational use of land resources according to their capacity; (iii) to establish
mechanisms which facilitate giving land its productive value in order to promote the
country’s socio-economic development; and (iv) to focus land management towards more
viable and sustainable production by choosing reliable and time-tested methods of land
development. Whilst these objectives have been implemented, where land rights are
equitable, and the rights of the poor are protected, progress towards these goals is not
publicly monitored or recorded.

Three of the NLP objectives are specifically related to ecological and environmental
sustainability: (i) to develop actions that protect land resources from various effects of land
degradation; (ii) to promote the involvement and sensitization of the public at all levels in
order to infuse land use practices that are favourable to environmental protection and good
land management; and (iii) to promote conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. In
practice, all rivers, reserve areas such as wetlands and lakes have a buffer zone where
human activities such as farming or building are prohibited. For wetlands, for example,
farming and building is only allowed 50 meters from the wetland boundary. For rivers,
farming is allowed 10 meters away from the river and 50 meters from the lake shore. This
buffer zone principle is respected in practice and where the land in buffer zones is privately
owned, land owners are only allowed to develop “friendly” activities that do not cause soil
degradation or water pollution. Whilst these objectives have been implemented, progress
towards these goals is not publicly monitored or recorded.

The NLP advocates for security of tenure and equity for all landowners including vulnerable
and poor people. The land tenure regularization programme included land belonging to
                                             103
poor and vulnerable groups such as orphans and widows. These groups were issued land
titles during the registration process notwithstanding failure to afford the fee. In such cases,
these fees were waived by government. Although the NLP is clear in its objectives to protect
the vulnerable and poor, in practice this is not always the case. For example, given that the
law does not recognize women in informal marriages, these women are unable to have joint
ownership rights recorded on the land register. Moreover, whilst the law protects the rights
of women to inherit land, in practice, there is still some unawareness, leading men to assert
incorrectly their claim over the land in question.

One key component of both national and district plans (part of the implementation of the
NLP) is to ensure that all high risk zones are identified and the concerned institutions are
informed. For example, according to the plan “The Districts of Gicumbi, Gakenke, Nyabihu,
Rulindo and Muhanga have the greatest proportion of land above 13 and 25 degrees” and
this       makes         them          high        risk      zones       in        Rwanda.
Based on the national land use plan, these high risk zones were demarcated. The ministry of
local government was tasked to draw up a resettlement plan to ensure all concerned
communities or individuals would be relocated to safer areas. Due to financial constraints,
the planned resettlement plan has not been fully implemented.


There is no systematic regular reporting on policy implementation on NLP or the OLL. Most
policy implementation reports are done on an ad hoc basis and usually those reports are not
publicly accessible, nor is the public aware that such reports exist. Although, the NLP’s
implementation is not reported systematically, it is worth noting that the implementation of
the NLP was broken into various key programmes, which were systematically monitored and
reported. These include mainly the land tenure reform programme and the national land
use master plan.

The NLP came into being in 2004 after more than seven years of consultations amongst
various stakeholders. Stakeholders the public and private sector organizations, civil society
organizations and the general public were consulted and views were gathered from all these
groups. The current revised, legal framework governing land issues has gone through
several public consultations where various stakeholders were invited to give their views,
which in most cases, were considered in the final draft legislation. Given that some
objectives of the NLP have been achieved, new objectives need to be set to deal with
changes that have taken place since the NLP’s adoption, as well as reforms to the policy as a
result of lessons learnt. It is therefore timely that the NLP review has already started, as
anticipated by Government when it suggested a mid-term review in order to make any
necessary adjustments. Some of the changes needed in the policy review as noted by
Byamugisha include: ‘urban growth, climate change, environmental conditions, land
pressures and intra family land disputes. Other issues include defining and implementing

                                              104
expropriation; implementation and impact of land use consolidation; concerns on
implementation of grouped settlements; confiscating and managing unused and abandoned
land and property; prohibiting sub-division of agricultural land to below one hectare;
concerns over sustaining land administration services; prevalence of land disputes and the
ability of institutions to address them; taxation and high land transaction fees for the poor;
concerns over sustainability of land administration services; need for guidance in allocating
and leasing marshlands; concerns over land lease durations and conditions for renewal;
concerns regarding land rights of women in informal or polygamous marriages etc.

Land policy implementation activities are costed but usually expected benefits are not
systematically calculated and compared with the costs incurred since the advantages are
obvious but medium term, and there is a necessity to implement the activity itself, such as
for example, the national land tenure regularization programme. The focus was more on
mobilizing the budget required to get all land on the register. However, the same approach
is used for the current land administration system that should be sustainable as much as
possible with local resources. Costing is done for the investment needed to establish a
sustainable land administration system, but no calculations of the benefits the system
would generate.

There are common challenges to all institutions listed above. These are limited capacity, lack
of sufficient funds, high staff turnover and regular civil service reforms. According to the
review of the training needs assessment of the land sector, capacity issues are prevalent at
three different levels (Makuza, 2011).126 Staff working in the land sector lack basic land
administration and management skills. This is a historic problem stemming from Rwanda’s
education system which did not have a specific curriculum on land. Land administration
graduates from INES, University of Rwanda, and Umutara Polytechnic are still few. For some
technical areas including land valuation and land surveying, there is insufficient local
expertise to fill the gaps currently present, such that Rwanda is dependent on expertise
from regional countries. On the job training is affected by civil service reforms transferring
trained staff to other sectors. At the organizational level more capacity is needed regarding
effective communication and sharing information and the review recommended that a
reporting system should be established.

4.9.3. Key institutional challenges


         Financial sustainability of the land administration system. It is important to ensure
          that beyond development partners support, the land will be able to establish cos
          recovery system and therefore allowing the service to be self-financing; and

      Capacity of the justice sector to handle all land related disputes.
      Frequent changes and reshuffles in the civil service sector
      The functioning of District land Offices can be hindered as responsibility for
       supervision is scattered between the District Authorities and the Rwanda Natural
       Resources Authority. Moreover, DLOs are often also assigned tasks by their
       administrative hierarchy in addition to land matters (such as rural settlement
       implementation policy, expropriation matters, or very different monitoring tasks
       such as tracking “Nyakatsï’’ (grass thatched houses, etc…). It is imperative that
       District Land Bureaus are fully dedicated to land matters, with clear supervision
       channel.
      Governance of the forest sector has gone through real crisis with regards to
       consequences of the war and the genocide. For instance the death and exile of forest
       professionals and end of all development projects due to the withdrawal of donors
       had great impact on the sector. Currently there is a general shortage of human
       resources in terms of competence and number. Supervision of forests is an area that
       also needs attention. This is especially for the smaller natural forests which are left
       to the responsibility of already understaffed local authorities, making them
       vulnerable to encroachment and degradation. It is thus essential that forest
       management plans or conservation strategies be developed.


Chapter 5: Best practice, key issues and recommendations
5.1. Best practice
The implementation of the LTR programme has resulted in a number of good practices
which other countries could learn from should they wish to roll out a similar programme.
The section below presents a summary of key best practices:

      Implementation of a low cost (less than USD 8/parcel) community-led mass land
       registration campaign using aerial photography for land demarcation. Post
       demarcation and adjudication, all spatial data was digitalised and centralised in an
       electronic land register and cadastre. The national land register and cadastre
       contains all land in Rwanda which is recorded and mapped (including State-owned
       land, private land, forests, protected areas, wetlands and swamp lands);
      There is no disparity between men and women owning land in Rwanda (reflected in
       the figures where, for example, land solely owned by women amounts to to
       2,068,137 (18%) parcels);
      Open competition in the allocation of public land, where everyone interested in
       acquiring public private land for investment has to go through an open bid tender
       process. This process has been in place since June 2013 with the aim of improving
       transparency in terms of public goods management;

                                            106
      Reserve and protected areas such as wetlands, lakes and rivers are well protected
       with a buffer zone around them. A national land use development master plan was
       developed in guiding land use and management in Rwanda;
      Establishment of both forest and mining cadastre and register;
      Establishment of a national continuous operating system (CORS) covering the entire
       national territory to facilitate all land survey work;
      Creation of e-governance in land administration including a digital land
       administration information system (register and cadastre); a land query notification
       system (that is, where the applicant receives a tracking number for the file. S/he
       receive the message indicate the number of the file, where the file is, brief the status
       of the file; a mobile phone land information system which is currently under
       construction. This system will anyone willing to buy any piece of land to check
       information on that piece of land including land size, location, use and any
       encumbrances that might be registered to the parcel.
      Introduction of land week awareness programme. Since 2014, the government of
       Rwanda adopted the land week awareness programme every year. Land week aims
       at raising awareness on land related issues especially encouraging land owners to
       register any land transaction, collect their land titles and respond to any query
       landowners might have. Staff from RNRA, zonal offices, District land offices and
       sector land managers make various visits to meet local community and held
       meetings with them. Local authorities including Mayors and sometimes Ministers are
       also invited to attend such meeting to stress the importance on registering land
       transactions. Campaign also helps land officials to know issues pertaining to land
       they may not have known shouldn’t they have visited the communities.
      Regular and speedy revision of laws and policies to keep up with developments and
       emerging issues;
      Model office: The model office concept is currently being tested at Kicukiro district.
       The purpose of the model office it to optimize organizational design, reduce
       procedures, staffing, tooling, control and monitoring in small and large office. This
       Module office will reduce time for applicant and also cost for transport. The handling
       of physical files and the issuance of certificates at the zones office should be phase
       out. The files should be scanned and stored and used to process and approve. That
       would improve the delivery time and available capacity effectively. In the module
       office certificates should be replaced by computer printouts.


5.2.   Summary of key issues
Whilst Rwanda has made significant in-roads in its land reforms, LGAF has identified a
number of areas which require improvement. The main issues identified in this report are:


                                             107
      Non-recognition of rights of women in informal marriages;
      High level of informal land transactions;
      Lack of policy governing public land;
      Institutional overlaps in land management;
      Absence of resettlement policy;
      Ineffective land revenue collection;
      Inadequate compensation for expropriated land.

Other issues along suggested recommendations are outlined in 5.3 section below in the
policy matrix. The policy matrix also provides ways in which the identified issues can be
resolved.

ANNEX 2: RWANDA VISION 2010 AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY


Key objectives of Vision 2020 approved in 2000 are:127

      1. Good political and economic governance: “Good governance is essential to
         successful development. Security is an absolute prerequisite, as Rwanda’s
         experience has clearly shown. Respect for human rights and increased popular
         participation in Government, through the bottom-up approach to democratisation,
         are critical. Equally important is the establishment of sound economic management
         and macroeconomic stability.”
      2. Rural economic transformation: “In order to raise agricultural incomes and generate
         opportunities to earn incomes outside agriculture, the rural economy needs to be
         recapitalised and transformed. This can be achieved by building on the traditional
         strengths of the rural Rwandese economy and by introducing new technologies.
      3. Development of services and manufacturing: “As incomes rise, we need to develop
         other engines of growth and to transform our economy. We therefore need to
         increase competitiveness in services and industry. Key sectors identified are the re-
         establishment of Rwanda as a regional trade and service centre, by strengthening
         our use of information and communication technology (ICT) and by encouraging the
         development of tourism. In the manufacturing sector there are opportunities to
         expand the production of mass consumer goods, in particular of garments.”
      4. Human resource development: “Rwanda currently imports human resources within
         the region and has scarce human capacity. An increase in educational attainment is
         needed at all levels. Better health care is needed to reverse the decline in health
         indicators and to confront the major killer diseases, HIV/AIDS and malaria.”
      5. Development and promotion of the private sector: “Private sector development calls
         for further liberalisation, privatisation and enhanced public-private partnership. In
         order to lower risks of doing business in Rwanda, and to encourage the formalisation
         of existing informal enterprises, the whole legal framework for business needs to be
         reviewed.”
      6. Regional and international economic integration: “Rwanda has joined the Common
         Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) with a three year phasing in
         period of the free trade area. We are committed to joining the East African
         Community [Rwanda joined in 2007], and to exploiting the opportunities offered by

         international trade agreements, including the World Trade Organisation and the
         recent Africa Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) in the USA.”
      7. Poverty reduction: “The reduction of poverty is not a separate objective, but the
         effect of the achievement of out other objectives. A concern with the reduction of
         inequality needs to be a foundation for all public actions. This includes reducing
         inequalities arising from gender and age.”


In 2007 Government adopted the EDPRS,128 which represents a comprehensive strategy to
tackle poverty, and was the result of an extensive consultative process and the involvement
of a number of stakeholders. Priority areas, linked to Vision 2020 are:
    1. Poverty and vulnerability reduction.
    2. Institutional capacity building and social capital formation.
    3. Sustainable management of the natural environment.
    4. Good governance and enhanced efficiency and accountability of the public sector.
    5. Enhanced performance of the private/service sector focusing on information
        communications technology.
    6. Economic infrastructure development, specifically transport, energy, water and
        information communications technology.
    7. Rural development and agricultural transformation.

EDPS1 ended in 2012 and in 2013, EDPRS2 was introduced, covering the period between
2013 and 2018, with special focus to the following four priorities thematic areas:

      Economic transformation: “This thematic area targets accelerated economic growth
      (11.5% average) and restructuring of the economy towards more services and industry
      as we move towards middle income country status. The main targets relate to: strategic
      infrastructure investment for exports, increased private sector financing for increased
      exports coverage of imports, urbanisation and green economy approach for
      sustainability.”
      Rural development: “This thematic area is focused on ensuring that poverty is reduced
      from 44.9% to below 30% by 2018. This will be achieved through focus on increased
      productivity of agriculture which engages the vast majority of the population and
      ensures sustainable poverty reduction. Enhanced linkages of social protection programs
      will also be developed with particular attention to increasing graduation.”
      Productivity and Youth Employment: “This thematic area is focused on ensuring that
      growth and rural development are underpinned by appropriate skills and productive

employment, especially for the growing cohort of youth. The main objective is the
creation of at least 200,000 new jobs annually.”
Accountable Governance: “The objective of this thematic area is to improve the overall
level of service delivery and ensure citizen satisfaction above 80%. It also focuses on
increased citizen participation as a way of ensuring ownership and feedback for
efficiency and sustainability.”
