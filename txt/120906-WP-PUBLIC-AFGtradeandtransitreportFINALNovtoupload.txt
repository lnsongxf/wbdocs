                 KEY MESSAGES:
                 •	 Afghanistan’s   growth rates have dropped significantly in recent years. During
                   2013–18, growth rates are predicted to be only around 4 to 6 percent. With
                   further declines in international assistance expected over the coming years,
                   the Government of Afghanistan faces new challenges to enabling new growth
                   drivers such as trade.


                 •	 Trade   as a growth driver in a fragile country like Afghanistan needs to be
                   compatible with the objective of reducing conflict and supporting political
                   stability. A plausible trade-driven growth strategy should promote economic and
                   export diversification by focusing on two complementary areas: competitiveness
                   and connectivity.


                 •	 Despite the potential the extractive sector presents for Afghanistan with respect
                   to trade and development, there are uncertainties going forward, at least in the
                   short run. Current estimates suggest that as of 2015, the country earned only
                   US$30 million from its mineral sector for a third straight year, far less than earlier
                   projections of US$1.5 billion.


                 •	 Improving   trade competitiveness in both goods and services is a fundamental
                   step for Afghanistan to diversify exports away from conflict-enhancing sectors.
                   Increased market access and regional integration in goods and services are also
                   key for trade to be a channel for growth and prosperity in Afghanistan.

trade. Projections suggest that mineral resource development                 job creation may be limited for the extractive sector, where
could eventually generate between US$700 million and                         rents are not necessarily appropriated domestically. The

from the sector could reach US$10 billion to US$12 billion per               is marginal on the Afghan scale.


                             Box 1.1: A framework for the relationship between trade and conflict


    There are three main mechanisms for how trade-related changes in commodity prices can affect conflict. The opportunity cost effect
    holds that changes in real incomes, for example, driven by trade price fluctuations, alter the incentives for participating in conflict by
    changing the return on participation in violence compared with more productive activities. The rapacity effect refers to the incentive
    to fight for control of valuable economic resources. And the resource effect recognizes that both government and rebels may fund
    their activities by taxing the production of commodities, so that changes in their value affect the ability to sustain conflict (Calì, 2015)

    Recent empirical literature on the impact of economic shocks on conflict suggests that conflict reduces the negative impact
    of increases in export commodity prices (see, for example, Carter and Bates 2012; Bruckner and Ciccone 2010). This negative
    relationship supports the opportunity costs hypothesis: that is, the costs for individuals of participating in hostilities or violent
    acts are equal to the income they should forego. Therefore, the higher the income level, the higher the cost of conflict (Collier
    and Hoeffler 2004). The negative relationship between income levels and shocks and conflict might also reflect the lack of state
    deterrence of conflict in low-income countries: when income is low, so is the state’s ability to collect fiscal revenues and thus to
    contain possible rebellions through military force or by buying off rebels (Fearon and Laitin 2003).

    Export prices increases can also help rebel groups finance their rebellion if they fight for and win control over these commodities (or a
    part of them). This “rapacity effect” has found empirical support in recent within-country evidence (Berman et al. 2015; Dube and Vargas
    2013; Maystadt et al. 2014). Analysis across countries on exported natural resources, such as oil and mineral commodities, also supports
    the rapacity effect: an increase in the value of these exports of 10 percent raises the risk of conflict by 2.2 percent on average across
    countries. The higher the value of resources that can be easily appropriated through fighting, such as minerals and oil, the greater the
    incentive to fight over them (Calì 2015).

    Whether opportunity cost or rapacity effects predominate depends on several factors, including the value of the resources that can be
    appropriated through fighting, the level of capital intensity, and the geographic concentration of the resources (Dal Bó and Dal Bó 2011).
    For example, specialization in point-sourced export commodities versus agricultural commodities could lead to different outcomes in
    terms of conflict. The strength of the effect of commodity exports on conflict also depends on country-specific characteristics. Changes
    in economic conditions have a much greater potential for generating conflict where there are deep-seated, historical grievances among
    groups; where economic inequality is high; and where government institutions are weak or corrupt.

    Beyond commodity prices, other trade-related shocks may be relevant for conflict as they can determine substantial changes in
    individual incomes. A few studies suggest that rising demand from neighboring countries reduces the probability of conflict and its
    intensity (Berman and Couttenier 2015; Bruckner and Ciccone 2010; Chaudion, Peskowitz, and Stanton 2012). This evidence is consistent
    with the opportunity cost hypothesis.

    Some evidence is also emerging on the role of trading partners’ trade policy in affecting the intensity of conflict. Specifically, trade is
    particularly effective in preventing conflict when it occurs under international trade agreements (Berman and Couttenier 2015; Bhavnani
    and Jha 2011). This result is consistent with the idea that a high volume of trade between two neighbors A and B increases the costs to
    A of a conflict in B, thus reducing the likelihood that A would intervene to foment civil conflict in B (and vice versa). It also supports the
    idea that trade may raise the level of trust between the peoples of neighboring countries (Rohner, Thoenig, and Zilibotti 2013).

          Box 1.2: The opium trade—Afghanistan’s leading economic activity and illicit export commodity



   Afghanistan is the world’s largest source of opiate production, accounting for 80 percent of the world’s illicit opiates and heroin
   in the last decade (UNODC 2016a). For much of the rural population, the opium poppy economy is an essential source of basic
   livelihoods and human security (Felbab-Brown 2016). In a 2016 survey by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC
   2016b), 71 percent of opium growers gave an economic reason for growing opium, and 28 percent identified income-related reasons
   but framed their answers under agronomic and ecological reasons.
                                                                     a
   Opiates produced in Afghanistan are mainly intended for export. In 2013, for instance, 96.3 percent of the total net value of opiates
   was exported and only about 3.97 percent of opiates was consumed domestically. The value of exported opiates corresponded
   to 14.4 percent of GDP that year (Ministry of Counternarcotic 2014). The net value of opiates was equivalent to 12.6 percent and 10
   percent of GDP in 2014 and 2015, respectively (UNODC 2015).

   The primary transit routes for Afghan opiates have been Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Central Asia. However, the so-
   called “southern route” via the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan is expanding. Heroin is being smuggled through the area south
   of Afghanistan, via the Near and Middle East and Africa, as well as directly from Pakistan (UNODC 2014). Subsequently, Afghan
   opiates reach the main destination markets, which are West and Central Europe, and the Russian Federation. Afghan heroin, in
   contrast, is trafficked to every region of the world except Latin America (UNODC 2016b). Between 2002 and 2008, a yearly average
   of 150 tons of Afghan heroin was transited through Pakistan, 105 tons through the Islamic Republic of Iran, and 95 tons through
   Central Asia (UNODC 2010).

   In terms of production and share of GDP, opium’s importance has been declining since 2007, when it reached a record production
   of 8,200 tons. Currently, production is closer to 3,700 tons (UNODC 2012), or 3.3 percent of GDP in farm-gate value, compared to
   13 percent of GDP by farm-gate value in 2007. Average opium GDP growth has been only slightly higher than non opium GDP
   growth in recent years, suggesting that opium has not been an important driver of economic growth. However, opium is still
   Afghanistan’s most important cash crop and, therefore, has significant implications for income and consumption patterns of rural,
   poor households.

   Studies such as by Katzman and Rosen (2014) suggest that Afghanistan’s drug trade is unlikely to slow drastically in the foreseeable
   future, and the country will remain the primary source of opium poppy cultivation and production of opiates for years to come.
   Many organizations have tried to tackle the issue of opium poppy cultivation, for example, by offering “alternative livelihood”
   programs. However, there is little agreement on the effectiveness of these measures. In Helmand province, where 47 percent of
   total opium poppy cultivation occurred in 2015, the alternative livelihood programs significantly reduced poppy cultivation, results
   that persisted after the programs ended (UNODC 2016a). However, it is also argued that reduced poppy cultivation in Helmand has
   been mainly due to the falling price of opium. The alternative livelihood programs, it is argued, are poorly designed, ineffective, and
   rarely generate sustainable income. Finally, the alternative livelihood programs are sometimes criticized for not reaching out to all
   poppy farmers and for benefiting only growers living close to cities (Felbab-Brown 2016).


   a . “Opiates” is the generic name given to a group of naturally occurring drugs derived from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum)
   such as opium, morphine, and codeine; semisynthetic substances such as heroin (which are opiates in the strict definition);
   and opioids, which are “opiate-like,” wholly synthetic products such as methadone, pethidine, and fentanyl (see UNODC,
   https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/illicit-drugs/definitions/).




Given Afghanistan’s limited resources for development, it is             for an appropriate sequencing of policy reforms and strategic
essential to provide realistic scenarios for trade development           infrastructure investment that will improve trade connectivity
and regional integration. Such scenarios are the foundation              and firms’ productivity in the country.

suggests, however, that around 40 percent of Afghanistan’s
total trade takes place informally across the border among
small merchants and traders (PAJCCI 2012). These transactions

are not reflected in the analysis in chapter 2.

policies is primarily drawn from Afghanistan’s WTO Accession

the lack of information on domestic services regulations.

                KEY MESSAGES:
                 •	 Lack of supply is the main cause of Afghanistan’s export underperformance. The
                   high concentration of production (and exports) in primary products and low levels
                   of competitiveness reflect the economy of a fragile country with high levels of
                   ongoing conflict.


                 •	 After controlling for supply constraints and conflict, most of the underperformance
                   of Afghan exports is associated with poor logistics and trade-related infrastructure
                   rather than lack of market access.


                 •	 Even with existent infrastructure, export flows could be improved by 20 percent
                   in the short-term by tackling export delays related to customs and border
                   procedures or high risks during transportation.


                 •	 In the long-term, reducing export delays, coupled with Afghanistan’s productivity
                   converging to regional levels, could lead to a more than six-fold increase in
                   exports.

                      Box 2.1: How to measure the labor sophistication of Afghanistan’s exports



    The Sophistication of Products (EXPY) index of labor sophistication can be used to measure trade-weighted average labor-
    market outcomes of the goods and services that appear in Afghanistan’s export basket. These measures extract information
    from labor market conditions and other characteristics of economies that specialize in certain products exported to certain
    markets. Based on these observations, it is possible to draw inferences about how products and regional trade patterns can
    impact employment, wages, and skill demand in Afghanistan.


    A country’s EXPY is calculated in two steps for each of the six labor-market outcomes (wage, value added, skill ratio, output per
    employee, human capital, and physical capital), following Hausmann, Hwang, and Rodrick (2007). The first step calculates for
    each product a PRODY value, or the global trade-weighted average labor-market outcome covering all countries in the world
    that export the product. For example, we can calculate a wage PRODY reflecting the average international wage of countries
    that export the product, a skill PRODY reflecting the average share of skilled workers of countries that export the product, and
    so on. The second step then weights the PRODYs appearing in Afghanistan’s export basket by the share of each product in
    Afghanistan’s total exports, denoted EXPY. The formulas are:




    where      is exports from country   in sector     is total exports of   , and    is the labor- market outcome. These resulting
    EXPYs reflect the global average labor-market outcome of goods that appear in Afghanistan’s export basket. The PRODYs
    and EXPYs are calculated using mirror data from United Nations Comtrade database; the World Bank’s World Business
    Environment Survey and Enterprise Surveys; and Shirotori, Tumurchudur, and Cadot (2010).


    For each of these labor-related EXPYs for Afghanistan, we (a) look at how their levels have evolved over time since 2000; (b)
    consider variations in labor sophistication across different destination markets, comparing the average for all Afghan exports
    (that is, destined to the “world”) to those destined to the European Union-28, the United States, and South Asia; (c) make
    bilateral comparisons of labor sophistication with a range of regional exporters, including Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan,
    Niger, Turkey, and the Russian Federation; and (d) repeat each of the above analyses across the entire distribution to see
    which products are driving the observed differences.

                      Box 2.2: Estimating Afghanistan’s trade potential with gravity equations


 In its general version (here adapted from Head and Mayer [2014]), the gravity equationa represents tra de flows between two
 countries and by the following relation:

                                                                            (B2.2.1)

 where        represents the export value from to ,        captures the capability of country        to export to all destinations, and
       expresses bilateral accessibility between and . The         variable expresses the characteristics of the destination market
  that affect imports from all sources. It can be shown further that                     , where       is the total expenditure of country
 and       measures the average accessibility of consumers in to supplies the rest of the world (also referred to as the degree of
 competition in country ).

 Equation B2.2.1 can be aggregated to express total exports of a given country, like Afghanistan, to the world. Summing over all
 destinations j and rearranging, the following expression is obtained for total exports (       ):

                                                                              (B2.2.2)

 where                            is the market access of country     to the world, as it represents the sum of expenditures addressed
 to , weighted by the relative bilateral access between country and , compared to all other exporters to          (that is,   ). It is
 interesting to see that two elements determine total exports of a country , its capability (        ), and its market access to the world.

 From theory to the data

 To predict total exports of a country (that is, to estimate its potential exports), the capabilities of that country and its access
 to world markets are proxied by the multiplication of the GDP of the exporter and the sum of GDPs of importers, respectively,
 weighted by the inverse of their distance to the exporter.

 In the same manner, another simple prediction can be obtained of bilateral exports by multiplying the GDP of an exporter with
 that of the importer and dividing by the distance between them. By comparing predicted (bilateral) values to actual (bilateral)
 flows, one could deduce a country’s over- or underperformance.

 Note: a. The gravity model has been used extensively in international trade due to its intuitive empirical and theoretical appeal.

  Foreign Direct Investment

  Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and capital investment in tradable sectors, through favorable (but non distortionary)
  investment incentives, could help Afghanistan expand its product offerings up the value chain. Afghanistan’s fragility and ongoing
  conflict could negatively impact investment prospects and longer-term strategy. FDI can bring essential knowledge and technology
  and access to new markets, but high levels of conflict and lack of security can make attracting investment in Afghanistan more
  difficult. Conflict weakens governance, undermines economic development, and threatens both national and regional stability.
  Investors must consider the return on their investment relative to the risks they are taking, especially political risks such as
  expropriation, currency convertibility and transfer restrictions, breach of contract by the sovereign, and war and civil disturbance.

  Despite deteriorating security situations, there are still investors seeking business opportunities in fragile and conflicted
  countries, so long as the investment yields a sufficiently high rate of return, plus a risk premium. Investors appear more focused
  on unexpected and arbitrary changes in government policies against their investments, rather than the security issue itself. There
  is concern, for example, about cumbersome processes for renewal of licenses and permits, paying taxes, and various contracts
  signed with the government. The government should encourage and facilitate foreign investments by mitigating the risks related
  to regulatory and policy uncertainty.

  Human Capital

  Afghanistan has dramatically increased investment in human capital since 2001, but much still needs to be achieved. For example,
  the number of primary school students has increased from 770,000 in 2001 to more than 6 million today. As described in chapter
  4, limitations in the provision of education and health services constrains the country’s human capital accumulation. Only around
  50 percent of children attend secondary school, and literacy rates are among the lowest in the world. Reduced access to health
  and educational services has been especially pronounced in conflict-affected areas.

  Policies that target education can improve economic diversification and labor sophistication. Skills mismatches can be a
  significant constraint on firms, and increasing productivity and innovation requires enhancing the quality of the labor force. In
  Afghanistan, there are important concerns regarding education quality and perceived mismatches between investment in skills
  and labor market demands. Unmet demand for qualified labor in manufacturing could keep wages relatively high, reducing firms’
  competitiveness and diversification. A large pool of skilled and competitive labor is also an essential component both for attracting
  investment in higher-value activities, and for enabling firms to upgrade the quality of their goods and services. Increased demand
  for educational services, particularly in higher education, has outpaced supply. The Afghan Ministry of Higher Education and the
  United States Agency for International Development estimated that in 2012 approximately 75,000 high school graduates did not
  gain admission to an institution of higher learning because of insufficient places. In addition, there are few MA and PhD programs
  in the country, and there is a shortage of qualified faculty.

  A strong emphasis on general education allows workers to better adapt, which is critical in a world where technologies come and go
  quickly. Supporting these goals requires policies to increase educational attainment; more support for basic education; curriculum reform
  as necessary to meet market demand, including soft and entrepreneurial skills; and aligning vocational training to private sector demand,
  particularly export-oriented private sector demand. A good example is the educational reforms in the country of Georgia. They have
  a long-term plan (2014–24) to develop a consolidated education sector strategy, spanning from early childhood education to higher
  education. This consolidated sector promotes the notion of lifelong learning and quality education for all. Similar efforts in Afghanistan
  could over time reduce the country’s skills gaps and mismatches.

  Enhancing management capacity and staff training could also help address the skills and education gap. Policies could address challenges
  such as firm incentives to invest in training, strengthening vocational education and training (VET) quality, and stronger engagement of
  the private sector on VET and life long-learning needs. Investment in adult education is also limited in Afghanistan. In response, the
  government could expand second-chance vocational training, and adult education programs to improve labor productivity.

       regulatory framework, strengthening irrigation associations, and strengthening the irrigation department of the MAIL to
       manage the irrigation network.

2. 	Agricultural research and technology (Some of these recommendations are being addressed under the World Bank Agriculture 	
	    portfolio in Afghanistan)

	    To deliver better technologies for farmers and increase yields and productivity, the capacity of the national research system 	
	    needs to be improved in the short -and medium- term through:

    •	 Rehabilitation and strengthening of the existing network of research stations; and outsourcing research to international and
       national research centers working in similar agro-ecological areas.

3. 	Access to high-quality inputs (Some of these recommendations have been addressed under the World Bank’s Agriculture 		
	    Portfolio in Afghanistan)

    •	 Efforts   should focus on the creation of an effective regulatory system and on strengthening the capacity of the MAIL to

       (a) enforce certification of seeds, veterinary medicines, vaccines, and so forth; (b) control banned pesticides; (c) constantly

       monitor domestic supplies; and (d) prevent imports of low-quality and hazardous agricultural inputs.

4. 	Business climate:

    •	 	
       Reforming the regulatory framework: Streamlining licensing processes, documentation, and customs procedures requested

       for exporting. The goal is to expand the domestic agroprocessing industry and reduce the time and cost of exporting

       commodities.

    •	 Serviced land facilities in industrial parks, greater access to electricity: Food manufacturing and processing businesses lack
       adequate access to serviced land facilities such as industrial parks. Access to quality, uninterrupted electricity will help boost

       private sector investments and expand business operations.

    •	 Access    to credit: Implementation of risk-sharing practices, particularly partial credit guarantees, would increase access to

       finance for the real economy by improving the information available on borrowers and by building the credit origination and

       risk management capacity of participating lenders (see chapter 3).

    Trade and markets recommendations:

     •	 Post-harvest   handling: Poor post harvest handling (packing, processing, cleaning, storage, and so forth) of agricultural

        products is a constraint to businesses and results in the loss of at least 30 to 35 percent of crops. To increase crops’ shelf

        life, prevent losses, and increase supply of products to domestic and international markets, it is important to improve post-

        harvest activities.
     •	 Building storage and warehouse facilities: Incentivize private sector investment in cold storage and warehousing facilities in
        provinces and at customs ports for exporters, so that the shelf life of perishable exportable commodities is increased.

     •	 Provision   of grading and processing facilities: Extensive grading and processing facilities for all exportable agricultural

        products are lacking in the country. Grading and processing facilities are extremely important for promotion of exports from

        Afghanistan and yielding maximum profit. Building of standard grading and processing facilities would help export promotion

        and import substitution.

     •	 Provision of standard and quality certifications: The private sector should be incentivized to invest in well-equipped quality
        control and testing laboratories that issue standard-quality certificates of agricultural exportable commodities. Strengthening

        institutional and legal frameworks governing certification is also vital for export promotion.

     •	 Functional market intelligence: Establish online platforms for gathering and disseminating market information for Afghan exporters.
     •	 Marketing for promotion of exports: Marketing campaigns in the form of trade fairs, agricultural exhibitions, and business-to-
        business matchmaking in and out of the country are vital. They facilitate promotion of domestic sales, exports, and the flow

        of information regarding processed agricultural products. Marketing campaigns will help Afghan exporters meet end buyers

        and promote their exports to high-value markets by complying with their quality requirements.

                             Box 2.5: Suggested interventions for Afghanistan’s carpet industry


   1. Production and processing:

     •	 Improve   the supply of raw materials, through facilitating investments in local production of chemicals that are used as raw
        materials for carpet production as well as production of dyes from natural materials that are produced locally.
     •	 Establish sophisticated processing units the inadequate availability of which increases production costs and adversely affects
        direct exports from Afghanistan.
     •	 Provide serviced land in industrial parks for carpet weaving and processing, which will reduce costs for carpet producers and
        hence increase their competitiveness in local and international markets.

   2. Design quality:

     •	 Incentivize the private sector to invest in carpet weaving and processing machinery, which will improve design consistency and
        reduce production costs and time.
     •	 Enforce copyright laws to safeguard innovations of the private sector in carpet production and help expand private sector businesses.
   3. Export promotion:

     •	 Establish online platforms to increase market information and awareness, which are essential for Afghan carpet exporters and export promotion.

                                  Box 2A.1: Afghanistan’s trade performance determinants


To assess the obstacles that might curb trade of one country with another, after accounting for size and geography the following
specification is estimated:




where log       represents the log of bilateral exports between country i and country j.       represents exporter i capabilities such as
size and level of development, which are proxied by the log (Population) and the log (GDP per capita).         is related to the importer’s
characteristics in terms of its propensity to import, and in a symmetrical manner is proxied by the size of its demand, again through
the log(Population), and the level of development via GDP per capita.

Other unobserved determinants that can also affect an exporter’s capability to export to the rest of the world and an importer’s
capability to import from the rest of the world are captured by a set of exports and import fixed effects              . Time fixed effects
      are also included to control for time-varying characteristics affecting equally all the countries equally.

The        variable measures by how much trade could be distorted between two countries due to transaction costs. Here three types
of transaction costs are considered.

1. Cost specific to the bilateral relation. This is represented by the extent of transport costs between countries, the difficulties
to communicating, conflicts or disputes between them, or simply due to bilateral commercial policies set by either of the parties
toward the other. These variables are approximated by the log(Distance), a dummy equal to 1 if both partners share a same frontier
(contiguity) or share a same common official language (comlang_off), and zero otherwise; a dichotomic variable of Military Interstate
Dispute (MID); and a bilateral tariff variable (log(tariffs)).

2. Costs deriving from specific characteristics of the exporter, independently from the importer. First, some variables related to
the quality of institutions of the country are introduced. These include the rule of law variable (rol), to which we also add variables
describing the existence or intensity of internal conflicts (variables civil war, or the log of deaths per capita from civil war, ldeathspc).
Other variables specific to the export activity by itself are also introduced. A first proxy introduced is a dummy variable indicating
whether the exporter is landlocked. Another important variable specific to the exporting activity is the length of time to export.
Time to exports encompasses the duration of time related to documentary and border compliance.

3. Transaction costs variables uniquely associated to the importer. Here the same variables as above apply, except to characterize
the obstacles with which the importer is now faced.




                                                                                                                                          57

NATIONAL REFORM AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION




                 KEY MESSAGES:
                  •	 Afghanistan’s   services trade patterns reflect the conflict and reconstruction
                    efforts (for example, a large share of exports of construction services) and the
                    recent reduction in international presence (leading to a net deficit in services
                    exports). More generally, the development of services trade has been inhibited
                    by the low human capital endowments and the challenges in attracting foreign
                    direct investments.


                  •	 If relatively peaceful and secure conditions were established, then services trade and
                    investment could help build both the hard and soft infrastructure needed to enhance
                    domestic production, boost export capability, and facilitate the accumulation of
                    human capital. Services trade in three key areas could be particularly important for
                    Afghanistan: connectivity, and health and educational services.
                         •	 Foreign   investment in transport and communications infrastructure
                            and   services   could   enhance    connectivity    both   domestically   and
                            internationally. Such investment would facilitate not just trade in goods,
                            services, and ideas, but could also create the basis for Afghanistan to
                            become an exporter of transit services to its neighboring countries (as
                            discussed in chapter 4). But it may only be feasible to attract significant
                            foreign investment if security conditions improve.
                         •	 The   consumption by at least some Afghan citizens of foreign health
                            and educational     services could help boost domestic human capital
                            accumulation in the long run. International cooperation and improvements
                            in the technologies of digital delivery could facilitate these services
                            imports. A future work program in this area could be structured around
                            recent initiatives on trade facilitation in services.


                  •	 Underdeveloped local financial institutions form a bottleneck for local business
                    development. Domestic regulatory reform could encourage greater domestic and
                    foreign participation in financial services, leading to enhanced access to finance.
                    Key reforms in this direction are the improvement of the deposit insurance
                    scheme, implementation of partial credit guarantees, and continued work on a
                    regulatory framework that balances openness and the regulatory capacity of the
                    central bank.

   Between 2002 and 2009, the Virtual Silk Highway Project provided high-speed internet access via satellite to teaching and research
   establishments in Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and
   Uzbekistan. The aim of the project was to facilitate local, regional, and international communication between academic institutions, and
   to encourage collaboration in research and education. Between 2009 and 2010, the project was handed over to the European Union
                                                                                                                    a
   for sponsorship in some Central Asian countries under the Central Asian Research and Education Network. It remained with the North
   Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United States Department of State in the case of Afghanistan as the SILK-Afghanistan Program.

   Throughout 2015, the SILK-Afghanistan Program continued to cover about 90 percent of the bandwidth costs of the 34 Afghan
   universities that joined, now connected via fiber optic cable instead of satellite. Member institutions continued to increase their
   regional and global links as Afghanistan joined the Trans-Eurasia Information Network in 2014. This initiative enables Afghan scholars
   to gain qualifications through multimedia-based distance learning, and allows researchers to work on international projects. The
   initiative encourages collaborative research and diminishes incentives for skilled workers to leave. It also allows universities to widen
   the scope of their online library services, electronic learning environments, and supercomputing facilities.

                                      Box 3.2: The potential of telemedicine in Afghanistan


   Telemedicine involves the use of broadband technology that provides real-time, high-speed access for the transfer of medical imaging,
   video, data, and voice. Applications include the ability to send real-time X-rays, ultrasounds, and computerized axial tomography scans for
   evaluation. This sort of technology also enables e-learning and learning through video conferencing. Some initiatives in this direction have
   been started in Afghanistan to address shortcomings in the supply of health care services.

   The Afghan Telemedicine Project started in 2007, only in Kabul, as a partnership between Roshan (a mobile phone provider), the French
   Medical Institute for Children (FMIC, a health facility in Kabul), the Aga Kahn University Hospital in Karachi, and the American technology
   company Cisco. In 2009, the project expanded beyond Kabul to provincial hospitals. This initiative allowed FMIC, and later other hospitals, to
   offer advanced diagnostic services in radiology and ultrasound by providing real-time access to specialists and training expertise from abroad.

   More recently, several international firms have started to provide medical consultations in dermatology, infectious diseases,
   neurology, and orthopedics, as well as diagnostics of medical imaging, via telemedicine services and in collaboration with
   professionals and institutions around the globe.

   Modern banking and the credit culture that accompanies it is new to Afghanistan. For centuries, and to this day, the population has
   relied on informal money service providers to transfer cash and provide limited lending and deposit services.

   Starting in 2002, the government and the international community promoted the formalization of financial services. This encouraged rapid
   growth of the formal banking sector, from two state-owned commercial banks and four state-owned development banks in 2003 to 10 privately
   owned commercial banks, two state-owned commercial banks, and five branches of foreign commercial banks in 2009. But banks struggled
   to develop normal banking practices and skills. The legal and accounting infrastructure to support non-relationship lending was nonexistent,
   weak, or untested. An ineffective judiciary and corruption hampered establishing or recovering collateral and enforcing contracts. As the banking
   system in Afghanistan grew, asset quality and governance suffered. While there were considerable efforts to build the financial sector in terms
   of its institutional and legal framework, the supervisory capacity struggled to catch up, exposing the banking sector to systemic risks.

   Concerns over soundness caused a run on Kabul Bank in early September 2010, during which the bank lost about half of its US$1.3
   billion in deposits. With one-third of the banking system’s assets in Kabul Bank, the crisis threatened the stability of the financial
   system. The rapid initial intervention of the central bank prevented a full-blown crisis, but to end the crisis, the government had
   to provide US$825 million to cover the deposit guarantee (about 5 percent of GDP). Subsequent crisis management was slow in
   tackling difficult issues such as asset recovery and the privatization of the resulting bank, the New Kabul Bank.

   The evidence of fraud and money laundering uncovered in this scandal highlighted the relevance of the diligent implementation
   of prudential regulation, the importance of the development of local capabilities alongside reforms, and the risks of rapid banking
   sector growth with inexperienced supervision or weak rule of law. Besides the immediate fiscal costs, the Kabul Bank crisis had
   far-reaching negative effects on intermediation, as it had by far the largest and most effective branch network in the country. The
   crisis also called into question the central bank’s supervisory capabilities. Moreover, it undermined confidence in the banking sector
   (preference for cash increased and deposit growth came to a halt), and further overburdened banking supervision.

4.TRANSIT TRADE: LEVERAGING LOCATION INTO A COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE




                 KEY MESSAGES:
                  •	 Roughly estimated, the gains for Afghanistan’s transit trade in goods may rise to
                    US$287 million per year (around 5 percent of total transit trade). However, gains
                    from commodity transit trade may be difficult to materialize.


                  •	 First,   transit trade will require large investments in transportation and border
                    infrastructure.     Policies   to   improve   transit   trade   should   resolve   existing
                    congestion at important trade points, meet emerging needs in local productive
                    sectors (agriculture and mining), and involve partnering with the private sector.


                  •	 Second,     transit trade potential is also shaped by sensitive geopolitical
                    considerations that are not entirely under Afghanistan’s control.


                  •	 Building regional connectivity for energy transit trade could provide Afghanistan
                    with electricity to meet its own acute domestic shortages and could add 3.1
                    percent to export growth annually and contribute US$530 million to revenue by
                    2030 (1 percent of GDP).


                  •	 Full   completion and operationalization of large-scale infrastructure projects
                    such as CASA-1000 (Central Asia-South Asia, electricity), TAPI (Turkmenistan-
                    Afghanistan-Pakistan-India, natural gas), and TUTAP (Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-
                    Tajikistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan, electricity, under negotiation) are essential for
                    Afghanistan to fully benefit from energy transit trade.


                  •	 In   the medium -to long- term, factors such as lack of synchronization of power
                    systems across countries, potential decreased demand for energy from neighboring
                    countries, and concerns over political instability may decrease Afghanistan’s
                    attractiveness as an energy route.


                  •	 With respect to renewable energy, rough estimations suggest that investment in
                    hydro generation and major transmission infrastructure could propel Afghanistan
                    to become a net energy exporter by 2026. In practice, large-scale generation plants
                    for renewable energy such as hydropower plants may be difficult to finance under
                    the fragile security conditions prevailing in Afghanistan. A more effective strategy
                    would be to focus on domestic transmission to achieve full electrification of the
                    country in the medium -to long- term.

   CASA-1000

   In 2015, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan signed the historic Central Asia-South Asia (CASA)-1000
   agreement. With an estimated cost of US$953 million, the CASA-1000 project aims to transmit 1,300 megawatts of electricity from
   the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, via Afghanistan, into Pakistan, of which Afghanistan will utilize 300 megawatts for domestic
   use. The remaining 1,000 megawatts of electricity will eventually reach Pakistan to remedy the severe shortage of power the
   country faces during summers. The Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have substantial amounts of surplus power in the summer that
   would remain idle if not used. The CASA-1000 will bring the surplus power to Pakistan, generating transit fees for Afghanistan and
   enhancing its growth prospects, in addition to addressing its domestic electricity shortage. The project provides access to clean
   energy and creates jobs, and will also bring approximately US$45 million in annual transit fees to Afghanistan (Kabul Times 2014).

   TAPI

   The ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) project was first signed by the governments of Turkmenistan and
   Pakistan in March 1995. However, the project stalled due to unrest in Afghanistan and tensions between India and Pakistan.
   Negotiations restarted in 2010 and the four countries finally signed the agreement for construction of the pipeline in early 2016.

   The TAPI pipeline is expected to cost US$10 billion. It will transport natural gas from the Yolotan gas field in Turkmenistan, via
   Afghanistan and Pakistan, to India, over a distance of 1,735 kilometers, 735 kilometers of which would be on Afghan soil. The project
   will transport 33 billion cubic meters of gas per year for 30 years. The project not only benefits Pakistan and India, but will also
   help Turkmenistan diversify its export of natural gas. Afghanistan will receive US$400 million annually in transit fees. The project is
   expected to create approximately 12,000 jobs in the country.

   TUTAP

   The Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Tajikistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (TUTAP) project aims to transmit 2,600 megawatts of power (Kabul
   Times 2014) from Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Although TUTAP is in its initial stages of
   negotiation, it is expected to unlock Afghanistan’s potential as the transit hub in the region, bringing in jobs and contributing to growth.

                                      Box 4.2: Hydroelectricity and trade in Afghanistan



With its mountainous terrain and extensive river system, Afghanistan is estimated to have recoverable hydroelectric potential of
more than 23,000 megawatts (MW). The clear majority of this potential (roughly 20,000 MW) is in the northeast on the Amu Darya,
Panj, and Kokcha Rivers. A further 1,900 MW are located to the east of Kabul, with over half of this on the Kunar River near the border
with Pakistan. The Balkh and Jowzan regions in the northwest have approximately 800 MW of potential, and the remaining 500 MW
of Afghanistan’s hydroelectric potential lies in the west-central region.

Current plans for development of Afghanistan’s power generation capacity include a significant role for hydroelectricity. The Power
Sector Master Plan has proposed adding seven new hydropower plants (HPPs) totaling approximately 1,550 MW by 2032. Domestic
hydro would represent 41 percent of total supply and 67 percent of domestic supply. The largest plants are at two sites on the Kunar
River (Kunar A and B), with a planned combined capacity of 1,089 MW at an estimated capital cost of US$2.7 billion. Together, the
plants would generate 6,260 gigawatt-hours of energy each year.

Integrating potential hydroelectric generation into Afghanistan’s supply system poses challenges. Proposed plants, including Kunar,
do not include significant storage, and hence their output over the course of the year varies with the flow in the rivers, typically
highest during the early summer. The Kunar cascade, for example, would operate at only 22 to 24 percent of capacity during the
winter months, which is also the country’s period of peak demand. To make up the winter supply shortfall, additional thermal and
import transmission capacity will be needed, which in turn will sit idle during the summer months.

Using hydro resources to provide electricity for export has also been suggested as an option, with Kunar as the primary candidate.
Afghanistan badly needs revenue, and several arguments can be put forward in favor of building one or more projects either
exclusively or partially for export. Among other benefits, the projects will attract financing, create job and skill development
opportunities, and possibly show profitability. Every premium of 1 cent per kilowatt-hour in the export price over the cost of alternative
sources of supply would generate almost US$63 million per year in net incremental revenue. The reality, however, is likely to be less
than expectations. A large HPP such as Kunar would be among the costliest private-sector-financed electricity projects in recent
years, and it would be a departure for international finance institutions to allocate such large sums to a single project in a low-income
country. Many of the physical risks are unknown because no geotechnical studies have been conducted, although a comprehensive
feasibility study could address some of these uncertainties. Security risks are high not only within that region of Afghanistan, but
also in the adjacent Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan, and community engagement would be a priority.

Local impacts of the project are not likely to be substantial. Construction contractors in Afghanistan will not have the heavy
equipment needed to work on the plant, and skilled labor is also in short supply. It is more likely that an international contractor
would be engaged on an “engineer, procure, construct” basis, and the successful bidder will likely contract both heavy equipment
and skilled labor from elsewhere. Technical components like turbines, generators, and controls will also be imported, leaving very little
of the project’s acquisitions available to domestic suppliers. Impacts after construction are also likely to be minimal, as HPPs require
little in the way of operational staff.

Finding an export market for such a project looks promising since Pakistan, whose highest demand falls during the summer
months, is short of peaking capacity. At present, Pakistan’s average supply cost is reported to be US$0.13 per kilowatt-hour,
although ongoing capacity additions will help reduce this average. But there are alternative sources of peaking energy available
to Pakistan apart from hydro imports from Afghanistan. Intraregional transmission projects (CASA-1000 and TUTAP) will provide
access to electricity from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. Pakistan could also build gas turbines to provide its own
peaking energy using domestic gas, or imports from Turkmenistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran. While hydro exports from
Afghanistan could likely compete with these options, there are questions as to whether the return would justify the risks. For
example, there is a risk that neighboring countries will object to Afghanistan’s use of power imports to serve domestic demand
while exporting hydro at an attractive price.

   Together with OPGW, similar, newer cable technologies can also be installed on low -and

   Unlike buried fiber, these aerial cables are exposed to the environment and are vulnerable to
   extreme weather. Furthermore, their metal coating is designed to attract lightning strikes to avoid
   damage to the power transmission lines. However, power transmission infrastructure provides
   greater security than traditional buried fiber optic lines; it is much less likely to be subjected to                     Figure B3.2.2:

   Similarly, pipelines and transport infrastructure, such as railway lines and highways, can be equipped                    (Kazakhstan-Russia)
   with optical fiber cables for internal communications purposes (for example, tolls and train stations).
   Other purposes include managing signaling devices to control the transit of vehicles. Again, unused
   capacity in these installations can be leased out.

   Systematizing the installation of ducts in energy and transport infrastructure is a low-cost strategy for
   expanding fiber optic networks. For example, the estimated cost of bridging a 23-kilometer gap in the
   fiber optic network on the border between Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation (see figure B3.2.2)
   varies under different scenarios: (a) the cost of rolling out stand-alone fiber is US$425,000, (b) the cost of
   rolling out fiber if ducts were installed when building the road or railway is US$250,000, and (c) the cost
   of “liberating” existing fiber if already installed in ducts when building the road or railway is US$115,000.             Source: Puig Gabarro,

transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, and railways typically
install optical fiber networks for their own telecommunications
requirements, thus allowing any surplus capacity to be used on a
commercial basis by telecom operators (see box 4.3).


Infrastructure sharing is already being implemented in some of the
major infrastructure projects, such as TAPI and CASA-1000, via the
                      61
project Digital CASA.      Such projects will facilitate the installation of
fiber optic cable and other network equipment in provinces currently
not connected, and will also establish additional cross-border links.
In terms of domestic impact, estimates suggest that an additional
eight million inhabitants can be connected. Regionally, it would
improve transborder connectivity among all CASA-1000 members,
and, inter-regionally this could eventually, be a component of an
alternative Europe-to-Asia terrestrial connection.


These examples illustrate the importance of encouraging
cross-sector infrastructure sharing to accommodate duct and/
or fiber installation. To this end, it will be critical for the Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology to coordinate with
the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of Transport and Civil
Aviation, and the Afghanistan Railway Authority (where applicable),
as well as with regional authorities. Coordination will help avoid
retrofitted installation of fiber along new infrastructure projects,
which can create significant costs, logistical challenges, and delays.

   Evidence suggests that regional trade agreements lower
the risk of conflict when trading with neighbors (Calì 2015).
Also, deeper agreements are more peace enhancing; financial
integration and monetary interdependence may play a more
important role in promoting peace than trade 		
alone (Gartzke et al. 2001).

   In rail: an independent national Afghanistan Railway Authority
(AfRA) was established in 2012 and the Afghanistan National
Railway Plan was designed (over 5,000 kilometers of railways
by 2030). In air: only the airports in Kabul and Herat are up to
international standards, but updates to airports in Mazar-e-Sharif,
Jalalabad, and Kandahar are already planned. In addition, in 2015,
the air space and traffic control was transferred to the Afghanistan

for the 2,160 MW Phase I project nearing close, 		
and preliminary work now underway.
