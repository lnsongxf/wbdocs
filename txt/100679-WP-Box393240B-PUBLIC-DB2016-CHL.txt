THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      Seal accounting books, invoices and other documents at the IRS

      Invoice and receipt forms can be sealed only after the tax registration

      RUT must appear on them. This procedure is generally carried out once
      the forms are duly printed.

      When using electronic invoices, companies are not required to seal

      once electronic invoices are enacted in law and in practice, this
      procedure will be eliminated.

      In 2005, a number of municipalities introduced a pilot program
      for a one-stop shop (la Ventanilla Transaccional de Trámites
      Municipales, VTM), an Internet platform where nine proceedings
      can be completed. The project was expected to be in full

      Municipality of Santiago introduced major changes to its
      regulatory plan (plano regulador) to regulate some omissions
      from the construction ordinance (ordenanza de construcción),
      without changing the current rules of construction.

      Some municipalities -- for example, Las Condes, Providencia, San
      Miguel, and Ñuñoa -- have restricted construction in terms of
      density and building height. The same restrictions were expected

                                                                            complete
      in Santiago in 2007. The latter is due to community pressures,
      reduced municipal revenues for this type of building permit, and
      the impact of the projects on public services and infrastructure.

      Other municipalities in the greater Santiago area are planning
      the opposite to attract investments, such as La Florida, San
      Bernardo, Maipú, and Quinta Normal. Environmental
      requirements are requested to obtain building permits, which in
      turn, can affect the schedule of a construction project. The plot
      for the case study warehouse would most likely be located in Los
      Andes, which has not been affected by either change.

      The cost of the building permit is 1.5% of the construction cost.
      The construction cost is calculated according to a fee schedule.
      The fee schedule is not based on a simple classification of
      buildings. There are two elements to consider: 1) classification
      based on material and structure used and 2) classification based
      on the amount of positive attributes that the building has.

      Regarding classification based on material, one can classify the
      building based on 9 different categories (A-I) depending on the
      materials (steel, concrete, wood, etc.) and structures used.
      Regarding the classification based on positive attributes, one can
      classify the building into 5 different categories based on the
      number points the building would obtain following the provided
      technical guide (design, structure, installations, and finishing of
      the building).

      The 5 different categories are: Category 1 – Superior (20 or more
      points); Category 2 - Medium superior (13-19 points); Category 3
      - Medium (6-12 points); Category 4 - Medium inferior (0-5
      points); Category 5 - Inferior (based on definition 2.3).

      The Doing Business warehouse would fall into classification A
      and obtains 3 points. Thus, the warehouse falls into classification
      "A4" (A because it is steel and 4 because it receives 3 points).
      Therefore, the cost per square meter is CLP 114642

      * Sign supply contract before a notary

      If the customer is the owner of a limited company, he has to sign the
      supply contract in front of a notary attesting to his role as the owner of
3     the company.                                                                  1 calendar day       CLP 5,000

      TThe customer accepts the contract and submits the necessary
      supporting material such as the declaration in front of the notary and the
      power of attorney. For the finalization of the contract the acceptance of
      the cost estimate has to be accepted and paid for and the inspection
      certificate issued by the "Superintendencia de Electricidad y
      Combustibles (SEC)" on the internal wiring (Anexo TE-1 SEC) has to be
      submitted.

      other material, inspections, approvals with the municipality and the civil
      works (excavation permit) needed for the connection. The price of the
      excavation permit to open a sidewalk (2 m width * 4 m long) for a period
      of 6 days in the town of Santiago is about 60,000 CLP.

      To sign the supply contract the following documents have to be
      submitted:
      • The declaration in front of the notary attesting to the fact that the
      customer is the owner of the building. If the owner is a company the
      declaration has to clarify the persons that are legally responsible for the
      actions of the company.
      • Certificate of the number of the relevant municipality (“Certificado de
      número Municipal”).
      • Copy of the identify document of the owner or legal representative of
      the company
      • Tax registration number of copy of the tax registration number (Rol
      Único Tributario - UT).
      • Coordinates of the person receiving the cost estimate for the
      connection and future consumption bills.
      • Relevant documents needed to grant the “way of right” for installation
      of transformers on the premises of the customer.

      Once the supply contract has been signed, Chilectra will then carry out
      the actual connection works. Material for the connection is provided by
      Chilectra and always available.



      Agency: Chilectra



      * Obtain approval of internal installation

      The internal wiring is client’s responsibility but needs to be authorized by
      the "Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles (SEC)".
      Once the internal wiring has been completed the customer has to
      request an inspection by the "Superintendencia de Electricidad y
      Combustibles (SEC)". When applying for the inspection, the electrician in
      charge of the internal wiring has to submit a declaration that he has
      executed the installation works according to standards of the SEC.

      SEC inspects the premise randomly and issues a certificate (Formulario
      SEC – T1).                                                                     11 calendar days       USD 0

      The legal time limit for the issuance of the certificate by SEC is 10 days
      (http://www.sec.cl/portal/page?_pageid=33,
      2256885&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL). The progress of the process
      can be checked on over the phone after the 5th working day by calling
      SEC (600 6000 732) or by contacting one of the organization's regional
      offices.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
