                     INTRODUCTION


                                                                               3
Welcome to CURB: Climate Action for Urban Sustainability. This toolkit is designed to help guide
cities through the process of planning and implementing a range of actions to reduce energy use, save
money, and cut local greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The technology and policy actions covered by
CURB can also help deliver important local quality of life benefits, including improved air quality, local
economic development and job creation


CURB was developed through collaboration between the World Bank Group, C40 Cities Climate
Leadership Group, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and AECOM Consulting. Each institution is actively
engaged in supporting climate, energy, and sustainability planning efforts at the local scale in cities
around the world. CURB is intended to allow planners to assess the implications of different policy and
technology interventions.


CURB’s flexible and modular design responds to local realities, recognizing that impacts germane to one
city (e.g. energy or emission impacts, cost savings, etc.) may be valued differently by others. CURB
therefore presents information in different ways so users can select the information most relevant to their
work.


The calculations made by the CURB tool are based on modeling approaches or assumptions developed
by world-class engineers, economists, and urban planners. The accuracy of the calculations is, however,
linked to the quality of the data used in the tool, which is why CURB consistently asks the user to provide
locally relevant information. Since data gaps are a common problem in cities, CURB does provide city,
national or regional proxy data that the user can rely on if local information is unavailable or considered
unreliable.


This User Guide explains the purpose and approach used in each of the six modules contained in the
Toolkit. This User Guide also explains what types of information are required to run each module, and
what type of output is generated to support local planning and decision-making.


If any section of this user guide is unclear, please offer suggestions on how it can be improved by
contacting the development team via this feedback form or at curb@worldbank.org.


CURB contains a total of six modules:


       Setup is where the user can enter basic data about the overall situation in a city and sectoral
        profiles. This information is then used repeatedly throughout the Tool to help make different
        calculations.
       Inventory converts the information provided in the Setup module into estimates of which sectors
        create the greatest energy demand and GHG emissions and how the situation may change over
        time. It is in this module that the user also has the option to set future reduction performance
        targets against which progress can be measured.
       Context provides details regarding the sub-activities, end uses, and materials that currently
        generate the city’s emissions. The module also allows users to compare their cities with other
        cities across a range of key performance indicators in each sector.
       Actions is the heart of the tool. This module allows the user to select which sectors she would
        like to focus on, and then to rate the city’s authority to take action in each sector. This information
        is then quickly translated into a rapid assessment of the maximum impact potential and
        implementation feasibility of every action included in CURB. This module is intended to help
        users decide which actions are worthy of further exploration. Users then determine whether each
        action will be included or excluded in the overall plan. Detailed cost and impact assessments are


                                                      4
    calculated based on information provided about the anticipated deployment level of each action.
    At any time, users may go back and change the options selected, either to drop or add actions or
    to change the anticipated deployment rate that will ultimately be achieved.
   Results shows the combined impact of selected actions on urban GHG emissions, local energy
    demand, and spending levels. This module also demonstrates how successful the particular
    scenario will be at delivering the city’s emission or energy demand reduction targets.
   Database provide users with the proxy data that serves as inputs for the tool, as well as data
    sources.


In the Introduction sub-module tabs, users can understand the tool’s purpose, learn about the
CURB partners, and ensure that the tool is displayed in an optimal manner for their computer settings.


CURB is optimized for use on Microsoft Excel 2010 (32-bit version) for Windows. The development
team has made extensive efforts to ensure cross compatibility with other versions of Excel (64-bit for
Windows) and Excel for Mac Operating Systems. Since these are not the primary platforms, users
should consider saving their file frequently to avoid loss of data. Additionally, please note that
graphics may be modified on Mac computers.




                                                5
            1. SETUP

Setup is where the user can enter basic data about the city that will be used in other modules.


All user entry fields are highlighted in blue.


1.A) City Context
City Context first asks the user to provide basic information about the city’s urban environment, including
climate and population. It then allows the user to set baseline and target years for emissions.




The next step is to enter a greenhouse gas emissions inventory if the city has one. A greenhouse gas
emissions inventory shows how much emissions are produced within each sector, such as buildings,
waste, and transportation among others. If the city has conducted an emissions inventory that was
developed in accordance with the Global Protocol on Community Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission
Inventories (GPC), and the city has reported this information using the official template developed by the
C40 and World Resources Institute, then this information can be easily entered into CURB. When
entering data manually, users should ensure that any information submitted as part of their GHG
inventory is consistent with city data entered throughout the rest of City Context. Refer to section 1.E)
Data Import of this user guide for additional details on automatically importing a GPC compliant inventory
from the C40 City Network’s City Inventory Reporting and Information System .




If the city does not have an inventory, CURB will automatically generate one based on the sectoral
activity data provided. This sectoral data includes:
            Residential and commercial buildings
            Municipal buildings and public lighting
            Grid-supplied energy profile


                                                       6
           Solid waste generation levels, composition, and management practices
           Wastewater generation and management
           Water conveyance system design
           Transportation patterns


These data comprise the bulk of the data requirements for CURB. For a detailed view of the data required,
please consult Annex 1: CURB Data Requirements or the CURB Data Template. For cities that have
already completed a comprehensive energy study or GHG emissions inventory, many of the data points
required for the sectoral activity data in this section will already have been collected. If the city has
conducted an emissions inventory that was developed in accordance with the Global Protocol on
Community Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC), and the city has reported this
information using the official CIRIS tool developed by the C40, then this information can be easily
uploaded into CURB.

Where available, the far right column marked "source" provides space to add any additional comments,
such as noting if a particular data point is from a year other than the Baseline Year. In subsequent
versions, CURB will adapt calculations accordingly. Some of the blue cells provide dropdown menus to
select different options. Selecting the cell will display the dropdown arrow to choose from different options.




To the extent possible, the user should seek to enter locally specific data to improve the accuracy of the
results. At the same time, CURB recognizes that data is not always readily available. The tool thus
provides the option to select default values that draw on proxy data already built into CURB. These
estimates are linked to data from a similar city, country or larger geographic region where the user is
located.

The option to use proxy data will typically appear as Option 1 in the selection menu for each section.
When the user clicks on Option 1, the proxy values that are assumed will appear. Ideally, the default
option will only be used in cases where there is no or only partial city-specific data available.




If the user opts to rely on certain proxy data, he can move onto the next question. If the user selects the
option to provide local data, lines will appear for the user to provide city-specific information.




                                                      7
If partial data is available, the user can enter the available data for certain sections and paste in proxy
data for the remaining sections.

The underlying data assumptions can be changed in Advanced User (1.D) which are outlined in the
Advanced User Options (1.D) section below.

Throughout the tool, users may see a gray button to set “Actions to Match Base Case”. By clicking on this
button, the action conditions in the Actions module (described later in this guide), will be set to reflect the
baseline context. The default conditions are set to zero, that is, they reflect the absence of any city
activities. If users should use this function after entering data in the Setup module, this will update action
conditions to the baseline scenario, upon which the city’s actions can be easily designed. Please note
that any previously designed actions will be overridden.




1.B) Cost Data
This section asks the user to enter various inputs on the cost of energy in the target city and provides
proxy data for each region if data is unavailable. To the extent that the user is able to provide locally-
specific data, CURB will better model the costs and savings of various actions as they contribute to
changes in energy use over time.

Each data point is sorted by sector (e.g. residential, commercial) and fuel type (e.g. electricity, natural
gas). The user is also asked to enter a discount rate for financial analysis.




1.C) Emission Factors
The emissions page allows the user to specify different emission factors for their city. For grid energy
emission factors, CURB allows the user to select from three options: select national emission factors that


                                                      8
are obtained from the International Energy Agency (IEA) database; enter city specific emission factors to
be applied to all sectors; or enter city and sector specific emission factors.

For fuel energy emission factors, users can use default emission factors or enter custom emission factors.

Selecting any these options will display a set of cells, similar to previous sections, which will allow the
user to view or enter the information for the specified option. When entering custom emission factors,
users should ensure emission factors are present for each greenhouse gas and that the units are
accurate.




1.D) Advanced User Options
Advanced User Settings allow the user to change the technical assumptions underlying the Building
Energy, Electricity Generation, Solid Waste, Wastewater, and Transport models. These include
information such as estimates of how much energy is consumed by different energy technologies (in
different contexts), emission “factors” used to convert energy data into GHG emissions , etc. Due to the
advanced nature of this option, it is not recommended that users change these default estimates. If this
action is desired, however, please contact the CURB team for information on how to access this data.




                                                    9
1.E) Data Import
Data Import allows the user to import Setup data entered in another version of CURB or inventory data
from the GPC inventory from the C40 City Network’s City Inventory Reporting and Information System.

The first option allows a user to upload a setup data from a previous version of CURB that they have
populated with city-specific data. The upload function will import the setup data, the setup settings, and
inventory data. At this time, the upload feature will not import the projections assumptions or the actions
implementation assumptions.

The second upload option allows a user to import a GPC compliant inventory from the CIRIS Tool. CURB
allows the user to select and upload the file and use it as the Inventory section of CURB.

Both functions, can take about 2-10 minutes to complete depending on the computer’s specifications. The
user, is given the opportunity to stop the upload at certain points. The data upload to that point will be
preserved in the current version of CURB.




                                                    10
          2. INVENTORY


Inventory takes the information provided by the user in the Setup module and visualizes emissions
sources and how they will change over time. It is in this module that users have the option to set an
emissions or energy use reduction target against which progress can be measured.


2.A Base Year Inventory

        I. Base Year Charts
The Base Year Chart tab provides a graphical representation of emissions in each sector in the baseline
year that was selected in City Context (1.A).




The toggle at the bottom right of the chart allows users to switch between viewing this information in
terms of emissions (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent: tCO2e) or energy (MWh).




Note that if a user chooses to view information by energy rather than emissions, the user will not be able
to see as many sectors; results are confined to Building and Facility Energy, Manufacturing and
Construction Energy, Energy Industries, Agriculture and Other Energy, and Transport. Other sectors like
Solid Waste, Wastewater, Industrial Processes and Product Use, and Land, Forestry and Land Use are

                                                   11
omitted here because they do not involve energy use. For instance, any energy use from solid waste
trucks would be included in Transport, while energy use in industry would be covered under
Manufacturing and Construction Energy.

Categorization of sectors in this section is consistent with GPC methodology. By clicking on the sector
logo for each sector, the GPC reference number and a description of the sector will pop up. For more
information, see Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories.

If a CURB generated inventory as described in section 1.A. City Context is used, then the categories of
sectors will be different from the GPC sectors. These sectors are as follows: Private Building Energy,
Municipal Building and Facility Energy, Transportation, Solid Waste and Wastewater. This chart will be
generated by CURB based on data provided by the user in the Setup module, rather than a user-provided
GPC inventory. This option is best for cities that are collecting data from scratch and also allows cities to
easily compare baseline emissions and energy usage against gains or reductions achieved through
actions in CURB.




        II. Base Year Tables
This tab shows the same information as in Base Year Charts, but in tabular format and with additional
detail. It goes beyond aggregate emissions in each sector to give a detailed breakdown of energy use
and emissions for each fuel type and end use. In other words, this tab provides a full emissions inventory.

If the user entered information from a community greenhouse gas in City Context (1.A), that information is
seen here. If the user selected a CURB generated inventory, these values are modeled from the other
inputs provided in the Setup module. If there are any values that seem inaccurate, users have the option
to override them with their own data.




                                                     12
The GPC inventory is broken down to three levels of detail:

       Scope 1: Direct emissions from sources within the defined boundary
       Scope 2: Energy-related indirect emissions from the use of grid-supplied electricity, heating,
        and/or cooling
       Scope 3: All other indirect emissions

More detailed information on scopes can be found in the GPC guidance.

2.B) Growth Factors
This section allows users to set growth factors for emissive activities in the target city. The information
entered here will allow CURB to take the Baseline Inventory and project energy use and emissions until
the final Target Year in the form of a “business as usual” scenario. The results of these projections are
available in the next section, Projections (2.C).

There are a four types of growth factors that may be considered to represent activity growth:

       Population growth (projected or historic): This assumes that growth in energy use and
        emissions across all sectors will be proportionate to citywide or national population growth.
        Population data is drawn from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs
        Population Division and their report World Urbanization Prospects: The 2014 Revision.
       GDP growth (projected or historic): Using GDP growth as a proxy assumes that activity growth
        corresponds to economic growth.
       Emissions growth (historic only): Historic emissions growth is derived from EA’s ‘CO2 Highlights
        2015’ study. While this report is linked to fossil fuels, selecting this growth factor will apply the
        emissions growth rates to all sectors.
       Custom growth rate: City-specific growth rates likely to provide the most accurate estimate of
        how energy use and emissions will change over time, yet it is also the most demanding for the
        user. The user is asked to enter growth factors for each fuel type by end use, across multiple time
        periods. In most cities this data will not be readily available.

The options presented allow users to select the type of growth factors to be applied independently or in
combination.


                                                    13
Once a growth factor type is selected, the user can view and adjust the growth factors and how they will
apply to each sector or activity.

If Option 1 (population growth rate) is selected, users must choose whether to use a standard national
rate, enter city specific population growth rates, or to specify individual rates for the resident population as
well as the commuter population. The commuter growth rate assumes that commuters contribute to
greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption and will take this population into account in
emissions calculations. If commuters are to be taken in to account, users should complete a table that
estimates commuter activity as a proportion of resident activity (e.g., the average commuter is likely to
consume zero residential building energy in the City, but will likely consume approximately 50% as much
commercial building energy as a resident does). If commuters are not specified, only the resident
population growth rate will be used to drive activity growth.




If a combination of growth factors is selected in the Define Population Growth Rates section, users have
the option to apply only one of the selected growth factors to every sector, or, to apply custom growth
rates to each sector using drop down menus.




                                                      14
If a user would like to apply a historic growth rate, he or she must select the past time period for which the
historic average should be taken.




If Option 4 is selected, the user can apply custom growth factors to every item in each sector from the
base year inventory. As expected, this provides the most accurate results for the city if local data is
available, but is the most user demanding. If some data is available, then a combination of proxy growth
rates and sector specific rates may be used.




2.C) Projections

        I. Sector Projections
The resultant emissions using the data from sections 2.A and 2.B are displayed in 2.C.I – Projection
Charts. On this screen the user can view aggregate emissions or energy use in each sector and how they
are likely to change over time, based on the growth factors entered in 2.B. Like in section 2.A above, the
user can toggle back and forth between viewing energy and emissions using the buttons at the bottom


                                                     15
right of the graph. The sectors shown in the graph will correspond with those in the inventory. If a user
entered inventory was selected in 1.A City Context, the sectors will be the 10 GPC sectors, and if a CURB
generated inventory was selected, the sectors will be the 6 CURB sectors.




        II. Inventory Projections
Here the user can see a more detailed version of forward projections in tabular format, with emissions
and energy use broken down by fuel type and end use.




2.D) Targets
This section helps the user to set a citywide target to reduce either greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or
energy use.

Once the target is set, subsequent modules will guide the user through the process of selecting and
customizing different actions to reduce energy use and emissions in the target city.




                                                   16
In the Results module (5), users can see how far chosen actions take their city towards achieving the
city’s target. Note that it is possible to make changes to the target at any point in the tool.

        I. Target Type Selection
There are three main steps in this section, with further guidance on each provided in Target Setting
Resources (III).




The first step asks the user to select whether to set the target in terms of emissions or energy reductions.
The relative merits of each are described in more detail in Target Setting Resources (III). It should be
noted that when setting an emissions reduction target, the user will still be able to see the impact of
various actions in terms of energy use—and vice versa.

The second step asks the user to select what specific type of energy or emissions target he would like to
select. There are three main options in CURB: base year goal, base year intensity goal, and baseline
scenario goal. Some types of targets may be more appropriate than others for the target city. More
information is provided on each in Target Setting Resources (III).

The final step asks whether the user would like to set interim targets in addition to longer-term energy or
emissions reduction goal. More information is available in Target Setting Resources (III).

        II. Target Level
Once the type of target to set has been selected, the next page allows the user to choose how much to
reduce energy use and emissions and by when.

Research by C40 Cities and Arup has identified 228 cities across the world that have set emissions
reduction targets, most of which are set for 2020 or 2050. These targets vary in the level of ambition from
less than 20% all the way to 100% reductions in GHG emissions.

        III. Target Setting Resources
This section provides the user with detailed information and guidance on how to approach selecting the
target type (Section I) and target level (Section II). A brief overview is provided below; please refer to the
CURB Excel tool for more detail.

To set targets, the user must choose between options in 3 areas:

1. Emissions vs. energy target: The user may choose to set their targets in terms of emissions or
   energy use.
      a. Emissions is a commonly used benchmark, and more than 200 cities around the world have
          set greenhouse gas reduction targets to help guide local climate action. Further, an
          emissions target covers actions in all sectors.
      b. Energy reduction may be appropriate for cities focused primarily on energy reduction goals.
          However, not all actions may lead to energy reduction, such as those in Solid Waste and
          Water and Wastewater.

2. Target type: This step determines the reference point upon which targets are calibrated.
      a. A base year goal calculates each final and interim target as a relative quantity to the base
           year. Because base year information is known, this target type grants a degree of certainty
           and few additional data requirements.
      b. A base year intensity goal refers to targets relative to a ratio in the base year, such as
           emissions per person or per unit of GDP. This method may be advantageous for cities
           experiencing large economic or population growth, but provides less certainty due to the
           introduction of an additional projected variable.

        c.   A baseline scenario goal sets targets relative to projected emissions in a “business as usual”
             scenario. This target type is suitable for cities in which emissions are expected to increase
             significantly over time if no actions are taken.

3. Interim targets: Users may choose to set interim targets for the intervening years between the base
   year and the long term target. Interim targets help to track progress over time, but requires user
   inputs for those intervening years.

          3. CONTEXT

Context provides details regarding the sub-activities, end uses, and materials that currently generate the
city’s emissions. The module also allows users to compare their cities with other cities across a range of
key performance indicators in each sector.

3.A) Emissions Context
The Emissions Context section provides context into the drivers of emissions and energy use for the city’s
sectors. This is achieved through detailed breakdowns of emissions and energy use sources. Charts can
provide high-level views of emissions components or sector-specific views. By understanding the key
drivers within each sector, the user can begin identifying action areas to focus on.




                                                   19
3.B) Benchmarking

        I. City Comparison
CURB allows the user to compare the target city’s performance to other cities around the world in the
Benchmarking module. CURB currently includes 23 different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across
six sectors. Data from other cities was obtained from a variety of datasets. To the maximum extent
possible, the CURB team has relied on data sets that are updated on a regular basis to ensure CURB
stays as current as possible.




To assess the target city’s performance, select a Sector by clicking the logo on the left. The Key
Performance Indicators available for that sector will then appear in the middle of the screen. Select one of
these KPI’s and the bar chart on the right will change, displaying a city-by-city comparison of the selected
KPI. In the bar chart, the target city will be highlighted in yellow, with other cities represented in light blue.
In general, the best-performing cities are those closer to the right side of each graph.

By default, the target city is compared to all other cities for which data was available. To narrow the list of
cities to which the target city is compared, select one of the “Benchmark Comparison Filters”, which
include:




       “Region” -- this filter compares the target city with others in the same geographic region.


                                                       20
         “Development” -- this filter compares the target city with others at a similar level of socio-
          economic development, as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI) rating.
         “Climate” – this filter compares the target city with others in a similar climatic zone.

While the Region and Development filters may be of general interest to the target city, the Climate filter is
designed primarily for use in two specific KPIs: “Building GHG emissions per capita” in Private Building
Energy and “Public building energy consumption” in Municipal Building Energy. This is because c limate
type is a strong driver of energy demand and associated emissions in buildings, since heating and cooling
loads vary widely across regions with different climates. For instance, all other things being equal, a city
with hot summers and cold winters is likely to have much higher energy use in its buildings sector than a
city with a more temperate climate.

When selecting a filter, click on the filter and then re-click on the KPI of interest to update the chart.

At the bottom of the screen, the user can see the information from the bar graph in tabular format, with
precise values, the year the data is from, and the source of the data.

          II. Indicator Summary
The 23 KPIs referenced within CURB are listed below. Please refer to the CURB Excel tool for more
information on each of the KPIs, including definitions of each and data sources.

          4. ACTIONS

Actions is the heart of the CURB tool. This module allows users to select which sectors they would like to
focus on and rate the target city’s authority to take action in each sector. Estimates of feasib ility, cost, and
emissions reduction potential allow users to quickly compare potential actions and make a preliminary
selection of actions that seem most suitable for the city. Users then have the chance to customize each of
the chosen actions and see how each contributes to the overall emissions reduction target. After
customizing actions, users will be able to view more detailed information on costs and co-benefits. At any
time, the user may go back and change the options selected, either to drop or add more as desired.

4.A) Action Selection

        I. Overview
Action Selection (4.A) provides a brief overview of the different steps involved. First, users are asked to
rate the target city’s level of authority to take action in each sector City Powers Survey (4.A.II). Second,
users are asked to select which actions they would like to develop further in the next section, based on
more detailed data about feasibility and potential impact in Identify Actions (4.A.III).




        II. City Powers Survey
This section asks the user to assess what authority the local government has to take action in each sector
and sub-sector. This is important because the degree of authority a city has in a particular area will
necessarily reflect the feasibility of any given action. Users are only asked to evaluate city authority for
those sectors selected in the previous section.




                                                       22
Authority is measured across three different parameters:

(i)     Own/Operate: the degree of ownership the city exercises over the particular
        asset/function/service in question. For instance, a city which owns/operates the local public
        transport system is likely to have a stronger ability to take action in that area than a city that has
        limited or no influence over operations.
(ii)    Set/Enforce Policies and Regulations: the degree to which a city is able to set and enforce
        policy in each sector. For instance, a local government that is able to set and enforce policy over
        private buildings will have a greater capacity to act than one which lacks the authority to set policy
        in that sector, or which can set policy but has limited power in terms of enforcement.
(iii)   Control Budget: the degree to which the city controls the budget for the asset/function/service in
        question. For instance, a local government that controls the budget for public street lighting is
        likely in a better position to take action in that sector than one in which the local government has
        no budgetary control.

It is important that the user select the appropriate degree of authority the target city has over each sector,
since this will help determine the feasibility of each action as displayed in Identify Actions (4.A.III)

Note that in the case of private buildings, it is only possible to determine the city’s authority in terms of
policies, regulations and enforcement, since it is assumed the city authority does not by definition own or
control the budget of private assets, except for district energy.



        III. Identify Actions
This section summarizes the inputs from this module in a single table, which allows comparison of
different actions in order to decide which actions the user would like to develop further in Action
Development (4.B). The last column on the right allows users to jump to the design page for each action.
Note that the user can return to this summary page at any point during the action design process.




                                                     23
In this module, each column uses the terms “high”, “medium”, and “low” to assess each action across a
few dimensions.

Level of City Authority summarizes the results of the City Powers Survey (4.A.II).

Level of Technical Difficulty gives an overall sense of how difficult each action is from a technical
perspective, unrelated to the target city’s capacity.

The following two columns, Implementation Cost and Payback Duration provide information on expected
implementation cost and the payback duration, or the amount of time it takes to recoup costs.

The final column, Emissions Reduction Potential, is related to the emissions abatement potential.

The user should review the provided information and select actions that the city wishes to pursue.

4.B) Action Development
The Action Development sub-module allows the user to customize each individual action for the city. It is
the largest sub-module and will likely be where the user will spend the most amount of time. The user
begins by clicking on a sector to start with, as shown on the screen below. At any time, the user can
return to this screen (by clicking Action (4.B) at the top of the page) or switch to a different action area
without losing any progress made in developing different actions.




                                                    24
At the bottom of this screen, there is a page called Action Implementation Details. In this section, users
can view a summary table of all the implementation years they have chosen for each action.
Implementation year can be set for each action taken by typing in the blue boxes. This information is used
in various calculations, including emissions impact and cost projections. This information helps the user
make a more realistic plan for the city by staggering actions as appropriate for local circumstances.
Additionally, this information provides insights into cash flows for each action.




Users can also see a summary of whether each action is under the control of the local government or the
national government. Users can indicate the percentage of each action that is implemented by the city or
the national or regional authority. This information will be used to visualize the impact from local versus
national/regional actions in Results.




                                                    25
Each action area is described in more detail later on in this user-guide, but there are some common
features to each that are worth pointing out upfront. Once the user clicks on an action area, for instance
private buildings, he will be taken to a home screen for that sector. On this home screen there are several
important pieces of information, as shown on the screen below.




On the left is a list of different actions, grouped by category. In the example above, actions related to
lighting, appliances and so on are all grouped within the Existing Residential Buildings category.

Each action has a button to the right hand side called “Go to Action” which the user can click on to begin
customizing that individual action.



                                                    26
Once the user begins customizing actions, the impact of that action will appear in the columns on the right
hand side. Impact is expressed in terms of emissions abatement (tonnes CO 2/year), energy reduced
(kWh/year), implementation cost ($US) and annual savings ($US/year). Users can also see what
percentage of total emissions abatement in that particular action area any given action contributes. For
instance, in the screen above, 22% of the total emissions reductions from private buildings are coming
from lighting upgrades in existing residential buildings.

The bar at the top of the screen summarizes the combined impact of actions in that action area. In the
example above for instance, the combined impact of all actions related to private buildings have resulted
in carbon abatement of 1,457,701 tonnes CO2/e each year (13.9% of total emissions reduced through all
actions developed in the tool), with energy savings of 3,205,948,356 kWh/year.




The tabs on the right hand side of the summary bar refer to the target year and interim targets set in 2.D
Targets—in this case 2020, 2035 and 2050. These are important as they control the timing of different
actions. Clicking 2020 sets the timeframe for any action customized between the baseline year and 2020.
Clicking 2035 sets the timeframe for any action customized between 2020 and 2035. Clicking 2050 sets
the timeframe for any action customized between 2035 and 2050. This allows staggering of different
actions across time. For instance, the user may wish to pursue energy efficiency upgrades in existing
buildings between now and 2020, while focusing on new buildings post 2020. Users may wish to pursue
some actions in all years until the target; others may be shorter term and begin or end in one of the
interim targets.

Please note that the emissions impact of any action selected in on time frame (e.g. 2020) are only
accounted for within that time period; to realize benefits across multiple time frames, the action should be
selected for each interim target year. For convenience, many actions in later target years provide a “Set
Page to Prior Year” button. This enables users to quickly design actions from where they left off in earlier
target years.




The dials in the upper right corner show progress towards the emissions reduction target set earlier in the
tool (if one was set). The dial on the left shows overall progress towards the target through all actions in
all sectors that have been customized so far. The dial on the right shows the emissions reductions
achieved for a given action area—in this case private buildings.




                                                    27
          PRIVATE BUILDING ENERGY
          Actions related to private buildings can be split broadly into demand side and supply side
          actions. Demand side actions involve energy efficiency (plus some fuel switching), while supply
side actions include distributed renewables and district energy.

All actions can be applied to residential buildings, commercial buildings, or informal buildings. Residential
buildings are divided into low, low-middle, high-middle, and high-income buildings. Commercial buildings
are divided into retail, office, hospital and hotel spaces. Informal buildings are not divided into sub-
categories.

For energy efficiency and fuel switching measures, the user can choose to apply actions to both existing
buildings (i.e. retrofit) and new buildings (i.e. new construction).

As with other sectors, the user can specify a time period in which the action is to be implemented by
using the buttons in the top right hand corner. Users should ensure action design is provided for all target
years.

The following is a brief summary list of the actions in the private buildings sector:

Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential, Commercial, and Informal Buildings

Includes separate actions for lighting, appliances & electronics, space heating and cooling, water heating
and fixtures, and building envelope. Cooking is assessed for informal buildings. Actions involving heating
allow for fuel switching in addition to efficiency upgrades.

Energy Efficiency in New Residential, Commercial, and Informal Buildings

Similar to existing buildings, actions for new buildings assess actions for lighting, appliances & electronics,
space heating and cooling, water heating and fixtures, and building envelope. Cooking is also assessed
for informal buildings.

Distributed Photovoltaic Systems in Existing Buildings

These actions allow the user to select the average system size (kWh/m 2) and the percentage of buildings
the action will target, with separate inputs for different income cohorts or building types.

District Energy in Existing Buildings

The District Energy action allows the user to determine the efficiency of the boilers, whether cogeneration
is to be used, and the fuel. For district cooling, the user can select the chiller efficiency. The user can then
decide what percentage of different types of buildings to which heating and/or cooling systems should be
applied.

In each case, clicking on the “Go to Action” button will take the user to a design page:




                                                      28
The page above shows the lighting efficiency action for residential buildings. Within the action, users can
specify how lighting fixtures and controls will change for their city. Fixtures refers to the type of light bulb
that is used (e.g., Incandescent, Fluorescent, CFL). Controls refers to how the lighting will be turned on or
off (e.g., Occupancy Controls, Daylighting, or a combination). Using drop down menus, users can alter
the baseline situation, which should already reflect the inputs in the Setup module. Then, users can
design the proposed situation.

Below the selections of fixtures and controls, users can specify the “saturation” level of each separate
design item, i.e. what percentage of the building stock will the actions target?

Users can design two strategies for four income groups: low income residential housing, low-middle
income, high-middle income and high income residential housing. This allows for flexibility in customizing
actions. For instance, a user may wish to pursue upgrades to CFL lightbulbs that target only low income
households (e.g. 80% of low income households, determined by the saturation level) rather than all
income groups, or vice versa.

Upon changing the saturation level, users can immediately see changes reflected in the summary bar at
the top. This shows emissions reductions, energy reductions, costs and savings for this specific action (i.e.
residential lighting efficiency for existing buildings, in this case).

The bar charts on the right hand side show the impact of each different action on energy demand. There
is a separate chart for each income group. The vertical axis shows energy demand in kWh per square
meter. The horizontal axis has two different bars showing energy demand before/after action has been
taken. The base case bars represent energy demand for that building type and income group (in this case
low income residential housing) before any actions were taken. The improved case bars show decreased
energy demand accounting for all actions taken (including those designed in other page views). The
charts are dynamic, such that they immediately reflect changes in energy use resulting from entering the
saturation level of technology. Each color represents a different source of energy use: purple for heating,
blue for cooling, light grey for fan energy, green for appliances and electronics, yellow for lighting, orange
for hot water, red for cooking and dark grey for other.

Once the user has finished entering the proposed strategy for this action, the user can return to the
private buildings summary screen by clicking “Private Building Energy” in the top left cor ner. All the data is
automatically saved and the user can return to the action page to edit selections at any point.

For Commercial Lighting Efficiency in existing buildings, the action page looks very similar:



                                                      29
Instead of different income groups, the actions can be customized for different commercial building types:
retail, office, hospital and hotel. Similar to residential buildings, users can specify what percentage of
buildings are impacted by each action. The bar charts on the right show a base case and improved case
for each building type.

For Informal Lighting Efficiency in existing buildings, the action page is slightly different:




Efficiency adjustments are made by fuel type (Kerosene, Propane, Charcoal) as detailed in the Setup
module. For example, Kerosene-based fuel lamps can be switched to solar lamps or CFL bulbs. Users
can select the existing fixture type using drop down menus, as well as the proposed fixture type and fuel
source.

In the next category of actions related to buildings, Distributed Renewables, the action design pages look
slightly different:




                                                       30
In addition to selecting a saturation level that determines what percentage of each building type the action
will target, the user can also choose the size of the average solar system in kW/unit. Here, “unit” refers to
an individual building. Users can change the total panel area installed and the amount of electricity
generated per unit. The action page for commercial buildings is very similar.

The final action page in the private buildings sector is for District Energy:




                                                      31
Here, users can select the percentage of buildings covered by district heating and cooling. This can be
done for each building type. Users can also specify details regarding the district heating system, such as
boiler type and heating fuel.




                                                    32
           MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS AND PUBLIC LIGHTING


There are three types of actions in Municipal Buildings and Public Lighting: 1) Energy Efficiency and Fuel
Switching, 2) Public Lighting Energy, and 3) Municipal Distributed Renewable Energy.




Energy Efficiency and Fuel Switching
Municipal Building actions related to energy efficiency and fuel switching are very similar to the Private
Building Energy actions. They are essentially a subset of Private Building Energy actions. For example,
for Municipal Office Building Envelope standards, the user can propose multiple strategies for how the
future state will differ from the baseline.

There are multiple strategies that the city can pursue, represented by distinct sections. Using drop down
menus, users can first alter the baseline situation in the first row, which should already reflect the inputs in
the Setup module. Then, users can design the future state scenario using the dropdown menus. The
options presented specify different wall, roof, and window insulation types.

For each strategy, users can specify the floor area to which these actions should be applied. When the
saturation level is changed, users can immediately see changes reflected in the summary bar at the top.
This shows emissions reductions, energy reductions, costs and savings for this specific action (i.e.
municipal building envelope standards for existing buildings, in this case).

The bar charts on the right hand side show the impact of each different action on energy demand. There
is a separate chart for each income group. The vertical axis shows energy demand in kWh per square
meter. The horizontal axis has two different bars showing energy demand before/after action has been
taken. The base case bars represent energy demand before any actions were taken. The improved case
bars show decreased energy demand accounting for all actions taken (including those designed in other
page views). The charts are dynamic, such that they immediately reflect changes in energy use resulting
from changing the saturation level. Each color represents a different source of energy use: purple for


                                                      33
heating, blue for cooling, light grey for fan energy, green for appliances and electronics, yellow for lighting,
orange for hot water, red for cooking and dark grey for other.

Once the user has finished entering the saturation level for each technology, the user can return to the
municipal buildings summary screen by clicking “Municipal Building and Public Lighting” in the top left
corner. All the data is automatically saved and the user can return to the action page to edit selections at
any point.




For Municipal Heating System Efficiency and Fuel Switching, actions are grouped by fuel type. For each
fuel type, users can record two strategies for switching to more efficient fuels or improved heating
systems. As with other actions, users can select a new heating system and choose to change the fuel
associated with the system through the dropdown menus.




Municipal Cooling System Efficiency and Municipal Lighting Efficiency and Controls are designed in
similar ways. Using dropdown menus, users can specify the infrastructure differences between the
baseline and the proposed scenarios and then enter the saturation rate of the proposed strategy.


Public Lighting Energy


                                                      34
The Public Lighting Energy action allows the user to change what percentage of streetlights and traffic
lights are using various lighting technologies. Users can specify the number and percentage of baseline
lamps that should be upgraded to an improved technology.




Municipal Distributed Renewable Energy
In Municipal Distributed Renewable Energy, the user can determine how much power the city would want
to generate through photovoltaic systems. Since the city might choose to put photovoltaic systems in
places other than rooftops of buildings such as open land or parking lots, this action is extremely flexible
to accommodate what the city chooses. The user will enter the anticipated photovoltaic system size into
the blue cell.




                                                    35
          ELECTRICITY GENERATION
         There is only one action that the user can take in Electricity Generation and that is Grid
Decarbonization. The user can change the carbon intensity of grid-supplied electricity by altering how
much electricity is generated from each energy source. To do so, the user must design three different
components: the electricity grid emission factors, the mix of electricity generation energy sources, and the
amount of electricity generated from each source. Clicking on each of these options at the top bar will
generate a new input form below.




When Emission Factor is selected, the user has the option to customize the grid emission factor used, or
simply use the “base case” emission factor.




When Generation Mix is selected, the user is shown a portfolio of energy sources. The proposed energy
mix can then be changed by adjusting the dropdown menus for “2020 Improved Technology” and
adjusting the percentages associated with each energy source. The total electricity being generated
should be equal to 100% of the energy being generated in the baseline case. If this is the case, there will
be a green checkmark and 100% written at the bottom of the table. If not, there will be a number in red to
indicate that the user is lacking or in excess of the generation of electricity. The base case and adjusted
emission factors are displayed below the energy source table. There are graphs to the right of the action
to visually depict the changes being made.




                                                    36
Finally, when Generation Capacity is selected, the user will see a similar page. Here, the user should
indicate the generation capacity (in mega-Watts, MW) of each energy source.




The carbon intensity of grid-supplied electricity is an important driver of urban emissions. However, cities
across the world may have varying degrees of control over the electricity generation mix, ranging from
little to no control to high levels of control. Regardless of the level of control that the city has, including
this sector allows cities the flexibility to understand how changes in the local/regional/national electricity
mix might influence their emissions over time—especially in cases where these changes are likely to be
significant. Those cities which with less influence over this sector could begin to consider what additional
actions beyond their scope of control might be needed to reach their target, i.e. it is possible that some
cities will find it very difficult to reach their emissions target without changes in grid supplied electricity,
which may help them to better articulate what changes are needed on the part of other stakeholders if
local sustainability efforts are to be successful.

It should be noted that calculating or modelling a specific emission factor without sufficient facility level
operations data is challenging. Therefore, the emission factor calculated from the Improved Generation
mix is an approximation. When using this action, the results are more accurate when major changes are
made to the generation mix, as opposed to marginal or small changes.


                                                       37
          SOLID WASTE
         The Solid Waste Action page has four main categories of actions: 1) Waste Management, 2)
Waste-to-Energy, 3) Fugitive Emissions Capture, and 4) Waste Collection and Transfer as seen below.




The user must first make decisions about how to manage different types of waste in the actions
listed under Waste Management. Each type of waste has several options for how it can be managed. For
example, plastic waste would not be composted or put into an anaerobic digester, but rather managed via
a landfill, recycling, or incinerator. The tool is designed to allow the user to select how to manage each
type of waste that has climate implications. Please note that after completing the waste management
actions, it is possible that the actions in Waste-to-Energy and Fugitive Emissions Capture might not be
relevant for the user. These actions are only appropriate for specific waste management methods:
anaerobic digestion, incineration and landfilling. More information follows.

Once the user has chosen how to manage each type of waste, if there is waste being treated via an
anaerobic digester or incinerator, then the user should select the action under Waste-to-Energy. This
action will allow the user to determine how to use the biogas from the anaerobic digester and the heat
energy from the incinerator. How the user chooses to treat the end product will determine the climate,
energy and cost implications of each technology.




                                                   38
If any waste in the city is being disposed of in a landfill , then the user could select the action under
Fugitive Emissions Capture. This will enable the user to decide whether and how much methane
generated in the landfill will be captured.

Lastly, the user can decide how to collect and what kind of facility would be used to transfer waste prior to
treating or disposing of it.

Waste Management
Within each Waste Management action, the user will see their baseline and proposed waste management
situation in two ways: 1) the percent of the waste type (i.e. paper, organic, plastic) going to each
management method, and 2) the total quantity of the waste type going to each management method. The
user can take action by changing the percent of the waste type going to each management method in the
blue boxes. The user can reset the proposed management actions to the baseline at any point by clicking
on the Reset to Baseline button. Below the Reset to Baseline button, the user will see their baseline and
proposed waste management situation in terms of quantity of waste (thousands of tonnes). These
quantities will automatically adjust as the user changes the percent of waste being moved.




Once the user has gone through all of the waste types that the city would like to improve management of,
he should click on the Solid Waste button at the top left corner of the screen to return to the main Solid
Waste Action page. At this time, if the user has chosen to manage some waste with either anaerobic
digestion or incineration, he should select the Waste-to-Energy action. If not, and the user has chosen to
manage some waste via a landfill, then he should select the Enhanced Landfill Methane Recovery action.
If the user has not chosen any of these methods to manage the city’s waste then he can proceed to
another sector.

Waste to Energy
The Waste-to-Energy actions allow the user to determine how the end product (i.e. biogas, heat energy)
of the waste-to-energy technology will be utilized. If the city already has an anaerobic digester and
incinerator, the user can enter what the city currently does with the biogas and/or heat energy in the left
column of the blue cells under Baseline Split. For example, if the city currently manages some waste via
anaerobic digestion, the user can enter how much of the anaerobic digester biogas is flared, used to
generate electricity, used for thermal energy and/or used for co-generation (both thermal and electricity).


                                                     39
Otherwise, the user can directly enter in the proposed split of how the biogas and/or heat energy will be
used in the right column of the blue cells. How the biogas and/or heat energy is used will determine the
emissions impact of the anaerobic digester and/or incinerator.




Fugitive Emissions Capture
If the city manages some waste at a landfill, the user should select the Enhanced Landfill Methane
Recovery action. In this action, the user can decide how much of the methane generated in the landfill the
city will be able to capture. The user will input the anticipated recovery into the blue cell and immediately
see the emissions abatement that will result by each waste type.




Waste Collection and Transfer Energy

                                                     40
In Waste Collection and Transfer the user can enter information changes to the vehicle fleet that collects
waste as well as to the energy currently consumed at any transfer stations. Changes to waste
transportation emissions occur through fuel switching to cleaner or more efficient fuels. Changes to
transfer station energy consumption can occur to fuel switching to cleaner fuels, changes in fuel usage,
and changes in electricity usage. Then the user can determine emissions, energy and financial
implications of anticipated changes in fuel and quantity consumed for both the vehicle fleet and transfer
station.




Return to the main Solid Waste Actions page to see the summary of emissions, energy, and financial
implications of the solid waste actions.




                                                   41
         WATER AND WASTEWATER
         The Wastewater and Water Action page has three main categories of actions: 1) Wastewater
Treatment Switching and Optimization, 2) Wastewater Biogas-to-Energy, and 3) Water Conveyance
Energy Improvements as seen below.




In Wastewater Treatment Switching and Optimization, the user can change their current wastewater
treatment methods and/or improve their current treatment methods. In Wastewater Biogas-to-Energy, the
user can determine how to use any biogas being generated through anaerobic digestion. How the user
chooses to treat the end product will determine the climate, energy and cost implications of each
technology.

Water Conveyance Energy Improvements allows the user to change the pump efficiency for water
conveyance, increase the number of improved water conveyance pumps in the city and improve
distribution water loss.

Wastewater Treatment Switching and Optimization
In the first action, Wastewater Treatment Type Switching, the user will see their baseline and proposed
wastewater treatment types. The user can take action by changing the percent of wastewater being
treated by each treatment type. The two graphs on the right side of the screen show how the proposed
distribution of wastewater treatment types compares to the baseline in a visual format.

The user should ensure that the total amount of wastewater that is being managed does not exceed
100% of the original wastewater quantity. To do so, the user can see below the table if there is a green


                                                  42
checkmark with a corresponding text of 100% indicating that all of the wastewater is being managed or if
there is a red number that is less than or greater than 100. The user can reset the proposed management
actions to the baseline at any point by clicking on the Reset to Baseline button.




The user can also choose to improve the treatment technologies beyond the baseline through the rest of
the actions in Wastewater Treatment Switching and Optimization. In Latrine Improvements, the user can
change the level of sediment being removed from latrines by entering the proposed level in the given cell.




For Anaerobic Treatment Lagoon Improvements and Facultative Treatment Lagoon Improvements, the
user can change the percentage of lagoons with surface aerators specifying it in the cell provided. Note
that aerators are only applied to lagoons without biogas capture systems.




For Activated Sludge Treatment Plant Improvements, the user can specify the maintenance level of
activated sludge plants with or without nitrogen removal. Activated sludge plants can be 1) Poorly
Managed or Overloaded or 2) Well Managed.




                                                    43
There are three options for nitrogen removal levels at activated sludge plants: 1) Basic (50% removal), 2)
Advanced (80% removal), or 3) Limit of Technology (3 mg/L).




For Direct Discharge Improvements, the user can select a new pre-treatment technology to increase BOD
removal efficiency and that what portion of flow the new technology should apply to. The options for pre-
treatment technology are 1) coarse screens or 0% removal, 2) fine screens or 5% removal, or 3) primary
settling or 30% removal.




Wastewater Biogas-to-Energy
The Wastewater Biogas-to-Energy Optimization action allows the user to determine how generated
biogas will be utilized. The user should only select this action if biogas is being generated through an
anaerobic lagoon or anaerobic digester. The user can view the baseline assumptions in the “Baseline
Split” column for each action. Then, the user can decide how to use the biogas from each treatment type
by entering in the proposed split of end uses (vented, flare only, electricity generation, thermal energy,
and/or co-generation) in the right blue column. How the biogas is used will determine the emissions
impact of a lagoon or anaerobic digester.




                                                    44
Water Conveyance Energy Improvements
There are two water conveyance actions, one to improve pump efficiency and the other to reduce losses
during water distribution. For Water Conveyance Pump Efficiency, the user is able to improve the
efficiency of water conveyance and increase the proportion of improved water conveyance pumps.




In Water Delivery Loss Reduction, if the user anticipates any improvements in water distribution losses
then the new rate can be specified.

and financial implications of the solid waste actions.




                                                   45
          Transportation
          The transportation scenario planning builds upon the Avoid-Shift-Improve1 strategy framework
that is commonly used in cities to calculate the emission and energy effects of different types of
transportation actions. This framework categorizes actions as one of the following:

    • Avoid/Reduce: addresses the need to improve the transportation system by a reduction in length of
      trips or number of daily trips

    • Shift/Maintain: aims to improve efficiency by promoting modal shift from high energy consuming
      modes (i.e. Auto) to public transportation or non-motorized options.

    • Improve: focuses on vehicle fuel efficiency, low carbon fuels and energy carriers

The following is a brief summary list of the actions in the transport sector:

Low Carbon Urban Design
This module allows the user to specify the reduction in future total trips or trip distance that come as a
product of efficient and compact urban design, and transit oriented development.

Passenger Mode Shift
CURB allows the user to specify the modal shift expectations for the future of the following modes: private
automobiles, motorcycle, taxis, moto-taxis, micro/minibus, standard bus and BRT, subway, light rail,
commuter rail and ferryboats

Vehicle Fuel Switch
This action allows the user to change the fuel usage (motor gasoline, diesel/gas oil, biodiesel, biogasoline,
ethanol, compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen and electricity) of different vehicle
types (passenger automobiles, light and medium-duty trucks, motorcycle, taxis, moto-taxis, micro/minibus,
standard bus and BRT, subway, light rail, commuter rail and ferryboats).

Vehicle Fuel Efficiency
This action allows the user to change the fuel efficiency of remaining internal combustion powered
vehicles. The user can select to enter the efficiency improvements as a percent improvement or as
specific fuel efficiency in units of km/liter or km/liter equivalent.

External Transportation Model
This action will allow the user to input from other scenario planning or transportation planning models.

Once entering the transportation sector, the user will find a summary of all sector actions:

Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale GIZ

                                                      46
In selecting the Passenger Trip Reduction action, the user will be presented with the following page:




In this action, the user can change the percentage of households that will be in transit oriented
development areas in the selected horizon year. The user can then select the percentage of trips that will
decrease in these households as a result of transit-oriented development. This cell is locked to a
maximum value of 25%, as this has been the maximum level of decrease that has been observed in new
transit development projects.




                                                    47
In selecting the Passenger Mode Shift action, the user will be presented with the following page:




The passenger mode shift action allows the user to specify the modal shift for the future. The Action
Implementation Assumptions section allows the user to view the modes that passengers may shift away
from. A set of cells below each mode type allow the user to specify the new distribution of total trips by
mode.

By entering percentages in these cells, the user can redistribute the trips from the selected mode to a
new mode. For example, the image above shows that the user has chosen to move trips away from
private automobiles. The sliders allow the user to redistribute trips, in this case, 40% of those trips will
now be taken by subway, 10% by bus, 7% by bicycle and 5% by taxi. The tool displays the current and
new percentage of trips that will be taken in each mode.

The top graph on the right displays the current modal distribution of trips, while the one in the bottom
shows the proposed future mode share.

The user can immediately see any changes made in the cells reflected in the summary bar at the top.
This shows emissions reductions and energy reductions for this specific action (i.e. passenger mode shift,
in this case).

The user can return to the transportation sector summary page by clicking on the Transportation button in
the top left corner.




                                                    48
From there the user can select the Vehicle Fuel Switch action, which will lead to the following page:




Similar to the previous action, the Passenger Vehicle Fuel Switch action allows the user to change the
fuel used by vehicles and follows the same logic. The top left section allows the user to view the vehicles
types for which the future fuel use can change. Below, a set of cells is provided for each vehicle type. The
user may propose a new fuel for each specific vehicle type by specifying the percentage in the cells.

By entering the percentage in the cells, the user will be able to redistribute the fuel usage from the
selected vehicle type to a new usage mix. For example, the image above shows that the user has chosen
to change the fuel usage of private automobiles and light-duty trucks. The total mix of fuels must equal
100%; the total sum at the bottom of the page will highlight green when it is correct.

The top graph on the right displays the current vehicle fuel distribution, while the one in the bottom shows
the proposed fuel distribution.

The user can return to the transportation sector summary page by clicking on the Transportation button in
the top left corner. From here the user can go the Vehicle Fuel Efficiency action. Which will lead to the
following page.




                                                    49
This action allows users to change the fuel efficiency of the different vehicle types as well as fuel types for
each by specifying the percentage improvement. It follows a logic similar to the previous actions. The top
left section allows the user to view the vehicles types for which the fuel efficiency can change. Below, a
set of cells is provided for each vehicle type by fuel type. The user may propose new fuel efficiencies for
each specific vehicle type by specifying the percentage in the cells.


The final transportation action, External Transportation Model Inputs, enables users to utilize the
outcomes of more complex behavioral models within CURB. Inputs within this action replace any
other actions within the Transportation module.




                                                      50
The action allows the user to input the following:

       Emissions Reduction in 2020 (CO2/Year)
       Energy Reduction in 2020 (kWh/Year)
       Trip Reduction in 2020 (Trips/Year)
       Reduction in Vehicle Kilometers Traveled in 2020 (VKT/Year)
       Net Present Value (NPV) of Implementation Cost 2010 to 2020 ($US1000)
       NPV of Cost Savings 2010 to 2020 ($US1000/Year)

These results will then be used to compare the sector outcomes with the other sectors ’ emission
reductions, energy impact and costs.

4.C) Financial Metrics

        I. Financial Performance Table
This sub-module provides the cumulative financial implications for every single action that was chosen.
The information includes net present value of cost of capital, net present value of gain from investment,
net present value of implementation, annual savings (or revenues), and payback period.




        II. Abatement Cost Curve
This section provides a chart of the emission abatement cost curve for each of the selected actions. Each
action is indicated by a rectangle:

       The width of the rectangle (on the horizontal axis) shows the reduction potential of the action
       The height of the rectangle indicates the cost of the action
       Actions with positive costs are above the zero line
       Actions below the zero line are expected to result in savings (or negative costs)

The legend below the cost curve allows the user to select and deselect the actions included in the
abatement curve and provides detailed information. It should be noted that the abatement cost curve only
displays the actions which have emission reductions and a financial cost or savings.


                                                     51
4.D) Co-benefits

        I. Co-benefits Matrix
The co-benefits matrix displays the final selection of actions, the emissions abatement (tonnes CO2/year)
and energy reduction (kWh/year) for each action, and the co-benefits associated with each action. The
co-benefits are currently shown qualitatively with the intention of having quantitative co-benefit
information in subsequent versions.




                                                   52
        II. Co-benefits Description
The co-benefits associated with each action selected are listed with information on why each co-benefit
exists. This can be used as supplementary materials to support the selected actions. CURB provides
information on co-benefits related to air quality, public health, ecological health, deferred infrastructure,
local economy, energy independence, public services and social equity.




                                                     53
          5. RESULTS

Results demonstrates the combined and individual impact of chosen actions on urban emissions, energy
and costs. Here the user can see how actions add up to reach the city’s emissions target, understand the
financial implications, and view the emissions and energy impacts. If desired, the user can go back to
adjust or select additional actions.


5.A) Aggregate Results

        I. Emissions Performance
This section demonstrates results in terms of GHG emissions. In the graph, the dark line represents the
Reference Case Forecast, which is a “business as usual” scenario of how emissions are likely to change
over time in the absence of action to reduce emissions. The Reference Case Scenario is based on the
growth factors entered in Section 2.B.




The dashed blue line represents the emissions target set in Section 2.D. The colored wedges represent
emissions reductions from the Reference Case Scenario based on the different actions selected and
developed in Section 4.B, which each color representing a different sector . In the example shown in the
graphic, a portion of the wedges is above the baseline forecast line. This is because certain
actions have caused an increase in emissions. For example, certain wastewater treatment actions
cause an increase in emissions although they have other benefits like those related to public health and
ecological health.




                                                  54
The graph helps demonstrate whether the actions developed have helped to meet emissions reduction
targets, showing also the relative contributions of actions in each sector. If current actions do not meet the
target, there are at least two options for further action.

First, the user may wish to adjust the ambition of the target, either by changing the level of the target or
the target type. To change the level of the target, the user can simply use the arrow keys at the top of the
graph. To change the type of target, the user can use the buttons at the top right of the page to choose a
different or more or less ambitious goal (for instance, a baseline scenario target instead of a base year
target).




The second option is to return to the Action module and select more or different actions, or else increase
the ambition of actions already selected, for instance by increasing the penetration rate. Note that it is
generally better to pick actions that are achievable if target and results are to be realistic.

The table on the right gives a more detailed breakdown of the information displayed in the graph. For
each target year, the user can see emissions quantities for the Reference Case, the target set, the
reductions achieved with actions, and any potential gap between the target and delivered reductions.




Users also have the option to view reductions from actions that will fall under the authority of national and
regional governments separately, by clicking on the dropdown menu to the right of the target entry cells,


                                                     55
and selecting the option “Show Separately”. The reductions from national and regional actions will be be
shown in grey.




        II. Energy Performance
To understand results in terms of energy usage, select the Energy Performance (5.A.II) button at the top
right of the page. This view of the chart demonstrates results in terms of energy performance. Information
is presented in the same format as Emissions Performance (5.A.I) above, only with progress shown
towards the energy reduction goal rather than emissions goal.

5.B) Sector Results

        I. Emissions Performance
The graph in this section shows the same results as in 5.A.I, but with more emphasis on the relative
contributions of each sector to emissions reductions, including those attributed to national actions. This
graph is shown as a waterfall so that users can quickly see which sectors are contributing the most to
emissions reduction.




                                                   57
The user can select using a dropdown menu whether to view the waterfall graph in terms of sectors (as
seen in the screenshot above) or in terms of national actions versus local actions by sector. The latter
chart enables the city to quickly understand what sectors they have more control over and what they can
contribute to emissions and energy use reduction.

       II. Energy Performance
This section demonstrates results in terms of energy performance. Information is presented in the same
format as Emissions Performance (5.B.I) above, only with progress shown towards energy reduction
rather than emissions goal.



5.C) Action Summary
The table in this sub-modules shows the emissions reduced/year, % of total emissions reduction, energy
reduced/year, implementation cost, and annual savings for every action in order to compare the results
side-by-side rather than view these results individually or sectorally in the Action module. Users can
return to the sub-module 4.B. Action at any time to alter actions.

5.D) Scenario Comparison
In the Scenario Comparison sub-module, users can save up to three scenarios, which are a
comprehensive suite of actions, and then see how they compare when deciding the cit y’s final set of
actions. The sub-module provides information on how the scenarios compare to their targets, how they
compare to each other by sectoral and overall emissions, and how they compare in terms of emissions,
energy and costs. The scenarios that are saved are static and cannot be changed. The current scenario
can always be adjusted based on lessons learned from previous scenarios.

       I. Scenario Selection
This action allows the user to name and save the current scenario in order to go back and build a new
scenario. In Add a Scenario, users can select whether they wish to save the current scenario as Scenario
1, 2 or 3, name the scenario, and save it. As scenarios are developed, if the user wishes to remove any
previous scenario and add the newly developed one, the user can scroll below to Remove a Scenario and
select the scenario to be removed before pushing the associated button. The user can also choose to
remove all scenarios.




                                                  59
        II. Scenario Results
In the graph, users can see the emissions trajectory for all 3 saved scenarios, the current scenario and
the baseline projections. Users can compare these results to any of the targets set by selecting the
scenario with the desired targets. Users can select the scenario in a dropdown to the bottom-right of the
chart.




                                                   60
The table on the right side of the chart provides information for the selected scenario related to baseline
emissions or energy, targets and performance of the selected scenario compared to the targets.

        III. Scenario Charts
Users can select which metrics to compare for a given horizon year across the scenarios, whether they
want to compare by sector or overall, and whether the impact of local and national should be separately
viewed. Users can compare across emissions reduction, energy savings, and cost performance of the
scenarios.




                                                     61
        IV. Scenario Tables
This table provides the same information as in the Scenario Charts and more detailed information. It
allows users to compare between all scenarios and actions taken. The user can select the metric
(emissions reduction, energy savings, or cost performance), horizon year, and the level of detail desired.
At any point, a user can revisit the current scenario to make adjustments as needed based on the
comparisons.




                                                   62
            6. DATABASE

Module 6, Database, provides users with the proxy data that is used within CURB. In the first module,
Setup, users had the choice to provide specific data for their city or to use CURB’s proxy data. Here,
users can view datasets for each sector. To do so, click on a specific dataset and a spreadsheet will
appear. Users can return to the main page by clicking on the Back to Database Main Page button.

ANNEX 1: CURB DATA REQUIREMENTS

Overview
The following provides a high-level view of the key data requirements needed to use CURB, broken down
by sector. In general, the more city-specific data you provide, the more accurate the results of the
modelling exercise will be, although proxy data is available if needed.
