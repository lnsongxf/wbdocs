Preface

In pursuit of building an ASEAN Community by 2015, ASEAN adopted the 2010 Master Plan
on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC), which set forth a set of infrastructure, trade facilitation, and
community-building strategies to promote economic, political, and social integration. To keep
track of the Connectivity initiative, the ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee (ACCC)
developed an ASEAN Connectivity Implementation Matrix / Scorecard (ACIM), an assessment
tool to monitor progress on physical, institutional, and people-to-people connectivity strategies
and activities. The ACIM has evolved from a project dashboard report to provide a more
comprehensive representation of the outcomes related to progressing ASEAN Connectivity.
Since the start of the MPAC implementation period in 2011, the ACIM has been reviewed and
improved, with an aim to incorporate more systematic, quantitative assessment of
Connectivity and MPAC key actions and strategies.

This Final Report on Enhancing ASEAN Connectivity Monitoring and Evaluation presents the
status of MPAC strategies and priority projects, progress to date on measures of ASEAN
Connectivity, and observed and projected impacts of MPAC and improved connectivity
measures on economic development and people to people connectivity. The report also
presents progress to date on application and revision of the ACIM, including recommendations
for improvements to the Monitoring and Evaluation program.

The World Bank, through its Singapore Infrastructure Hub, is providing technical assistance
(TA) for enhancing the ACIM at the request of the ACCC and the ASEAN Secretariat (ASEC)
and with funding from the ASEAN–Australia Development Cooperation Program Phase II
(AADCPII). In collaboration with the ACCC, the World Bank reviewed the initial ACIM
framework and alternative methods of monitoring and evaluating connectivity and proposed a
set of systematic, largely quantitative indicators of connectivity linked to the MPAC’s three
strategic dimensions and 19 strategies. The report presents the application of this revised
strategy-level evaluation tool and makes recommendations for its expanded and improved
use at the close of the implementation period and beyond.

The First Interim Report summarized progress made by the World Bank from December 2013
to February 2014, based on early discussions to define the monitoring and evaluation
framework, including assessment of the ACIM as it had been applied to that point. More
importantly, the report framed the theoretical and methodological base for proposed indicators
of connectivity. These indicators have since been further refined. The Second Interim Report

                                                                                               4
presented the Bank’s assessment of the status of ASEAN Connectivity by way of the revised
ACIM and served as a key input for the Final Report.

This report is authored by a World Bank team from the Singapore Infrastructure Hub including
Darwin Marcelo (Task Team Leader), Cledan Mandri-Perrott and Schuyler House. Jared
Haddon and Rong Hui Kan provided valuable inputs. The Institute of Developing Economies,
Japan External Trade Organization (IDE-JETRO) provided Geographic Simulation Modeling
and contextual inputs based on extensive geographic and economic analysis of the region. A
team of economists at the Asia Competitiveness Institute (ACI) at the Lee Kuan Yew School
of Public Policy, National University of Singapore, led by Professor Tan Khee Giap,
contributed the SVAR Multiplier Effects models and supported gravity modeling and indicator
inputs. The team would like to especially thank Mr. Lim Chze Cheen of the ASEAN Secretariat
for his helpful guidance and comments throughout.

Executive Summary

In pursuit of building the ASEAN Community, ASEAN has embarked on a course to advance
regional Connectivity. Adopted in 2010, the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC) set
forth nineteen strategies for enhancing Connectivity in achieving wider goals of enhancing
competitiveness and economic growth, narrowing development gaps, and deepening social
and cultural understanding amongst Member States. As ASEAN approaches end 2015, the
Enhancing ASEAN Connectivity Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) report takes stock of
progress to date and draws out lessons for the next stage of ASEAN’s Connectivity journey.


The realization of an integrated ASEAN Community demands connectedness via improved
and expanded transport, communications, and energy infrastructure; the reduction of barriers
to trade and investment; and the opening of new opportunities for ASEAN-wide
communication and exchange. The MPAC provides a blueprint for such advances via three
strategic dimensions, each accompanied by strategies and key actions:
      Physical Connectivity: Improving transportation, information communications,
      energy, and technology infrastructure,
      Institutional Connectivity: Building effective processes, rules, and structures to
      facilitate the free flow of goods, services, investments, and skilled labour; and
      People-to-people Connectivity: Promoting social and cultural understanding amongst
      the peoples of ASEAN.


Charting the Course for Enhanced Connectivity


A review of the MPAC involves three broad components. The first examines how Connectivity
has progressed, and in particular, the role that the MPAC has played. The second sets forward
a course for the Connectivity vision leading up to 2025. This too, calls for reflecting on
performance to date to identify key areas of strength and weakness and potential policy levers
to advance Connectivity. The third sets out improvements to the M&E system to allow for
ongoing adjustment, policy reformulation and benchmarking. In this Executive Summary, we
first summarize the state of ASEAN Connectivity, drawing on quantitative analysis and
economic modeling, then follow with a discussion of implications for the future, both with

Implementation of Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity: 2011-2015


The assessment of progress on Connectivity relies on quantitative indicators associated with
each of the nineteen Connectivity strategies and a series of economic models. The indicators
illustrate the current state of Connectivity and demonstrate degrees of progress, while the
economic models evaluate MPAC’s specific role in advancing Connectivity and integration.


The indicators and economic models (see endnotes) show a number of policy areas that have
progressed well. Significant improvements were observed, particularly for process-oriented
and institutional measures related to transnational trade and people mobility. There has been
a significant increase in land crossings in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, for instance, and
many Member States have experienced appreciably increasing scores on indices like Trading
Across Borders1 (as measured by the World Bank Doing Business project) and the Logistics
Performance Index (LPI).


Other policy areas require further attention, either due to low performance or their key
importance to future development. For example, geographic simulation models suggest that
air and maritime sector development are particularly significant to projected trade volumes
and growth. But indicators show that, while air services liberalization has developed apace,
maritime developments are more modest, hampered by long gestation periods in port
construction and problems associated with port efficiency and quality. Similarly, progress on
the Singapore-Kunming Rail Link (SKRL), inland waterways development, and the
development of the Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipelines (TAGP) are lagging.


Overall, the indicators and models show that Connectivity has increased, but to varying
degrees of effect. While institutional measures have largely progressed apace, there remain
opportunities based on process harmonization and the implementation of key liberalization
policies that constitute ‘easy wins’. Although some of the physical infrastructure components
that make up the MPAC programme have progressed steadily, others encountered resource
mobilization challenges. These areas of lower performance constitute opportunities for future
development towards greater ASEAN Connectivity by 2025.

Physical Connectivity Progress
Fundamental to the MPAC are interventions for improving and expanding the physical
connections between ASEAN markets and societies. The construction of new infrastructure
and the rehabilitation of existing assets aim to reduce the transaction costs of regional trade
and mobility, as well as increase access to technology, communications and energy
resources. This includes infrastructure projects like the ASEAN Highway Network (AHN), the
SKRL, the Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline and the ASEAN Power Grid (APG), as well as more
general sectoral initiatives to improve maritime networks, inland waterways, multi-modal
transport, and information and communication technology (ICT) coverage.

Upgrading works, most importantly associated with Transit Transport Routes (TTRs), have
progressed in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, but require continued attention to reach their
targets. The most important issue looking forward is the upgrading of Below Class III roads
for prioritized TTRs that remain incomplete, particularly in Laos and Myanmar. Project
preparations are under way to upgrade two priority TTRs in Laos: AH-15, linking Ban Lao and
Namphao and AH-12, linking Vientiane to Luang Prabang. Of the three TTRs marked for
upgrading in Myanmar, a 93 km stretch of the AH-3 from Kyaington to Mongla has been
upgraded, while AH-1 and AH-2 are in progress.

Similarly, the APG has made significant progress following good progress on construction of
interconnections. Eight of the 16 APG projects have projected commercial operation dates
(CODs) between 2015 and 2020. Electricity trade between Thailand and Laos is likely to
increase with APG project nine, which connects the two Member States, building upon existing
high levels of bilateral electricity trade.

Other Physical Connectivity projects have enjoyed less progress, most notably the SKRL. Of
the 1285 km missing rail links targeted in the MPAC for construction by 2015, the SKRL
expanded by only 6 km, with construction completed for a link from Aranyaprathet, Thailand,
to the Cambodian border in 2016. The remaining 1259 km of missing links are currently in
various stages of planning targeted for completion by 2020. Progress has been slow due to
low traffic projections, competition for resources from other development projects and
substitution by alternative transport sectors, including road and air. Similarly, in the energy
sector, the development of the TAGP has been limited to progress on one domestic link within
Indonesia, between Kalimantan and Java. Though intra-ASEAN imports in the natural gas
sector grew between 2010 and 2013, trade increases were not attributable to the TAGP.


Further efforts are required to expedite the development of inland waterways and the
establishment of an integrated maritime network. Data on river trade is limited to 2011-2012,
but preliminary analysis suggests that Laos and Cambodia may have experienced increased
cargo throughput in river ports. Nevertheless, river networks, especially in Cambodia, Laos
and Myanmar, remain underdeveloped for trade and transit and require further support.
Similarly, while seaport container throughput has increased, particularly in Thailand, Myanmar
and the Philippines (Figure 3), maritime sector development has lagged with respect to
physical and institutional targets. Vietnam and Myanmar are the only two Member States to
have appreciably increased liner shipping connectivity over the MPAC period (Figure 4).

There are, however, opportunities for improvement: the establishment of a roll-on/roll-off
(RoRo) network is in the early stages of planning, following feasibility studies conducted in
2012-2013; and ASEAN is working on implementing the Roadmap for an Integrated and
Competitive Maritime Transport in ASEAN (RICMTA) and the ASEAN Single Shipping Market
(ASSM). Updated status reports on ASSM rules on foreign ownership, access, port
productivity and efficiency, and local content laws would provide helpful qualitative data to
contextualize the degree of shipping liberalization.

With respect to ICT, Connectivity has increased for all countries, but at a pace generally similar
to pre-MPAC growth. Philippines and Cambodia have experienced the most apparent
increases in Internet use growth rates during the MPAC period, and Cambodia has also
experienced a significant increase in mobile telephone subscriptions. Further ASEAN
mapping of mobile network coverage would inform a more comprehensive assessment of the
access to mobile telecommunications across the region.

Lastly, the establishment of an integrated multi-modal transport system is a key area of
development. This is supported by economic modelling and prospective simulations that
demonstrate important complementarities between trade and transport strategies.


Geographic Simulation Models (GSM) project the economic impacts of several key MPAC
interventions, including upgrading AHN roads and building missing links, constructing SKRL
missing links, developing the RoRo maritime network, liberalizing air services and improving
border facilitation. While the models suggest that, as individual interventions, border
                                                                                                 14
facilitation and the development of maritime and air transport would have the largest impact,
the most interesting results demonstrate the importance of network complementarities. The
simulated impacts of key interventions in combination yield growth effects 9 per cent higher
than the sum of results from individual interventions. The projected complementarity reaffirms
the need to monitor and promote the development of multi-modal networks and highlights the
need to enhance coordination with respect to infrastructure planning.

Institutional Connectivity Progress
Over the MPAC implementation period of 2011-2015, regional trade integration has increased,
suggesting that improved physical trade transport assets coupled with increased trade
facilitation and improved border management have had an appreciable impact on the structure
and pace of trade. These results are corroborated by analyses that show higher economic
multiplier effects within ASEAN in 2011 and beyond (Figure 10).

It is important to note, however, that major external trade partners like the OECD nations and
China exhibit higher multiplier effects on ASEAN economies than do other Member States,
both before and after the MPAC (Figure 11). The major external trade partners also
demonstrate significantly higher increases in multiplier effects following the MPAC. 4 These

  Structural Vector Auto-regression analysis demonstrates increased integration during the MPAC period as
compared to the ten years prior, both regionally and globally. By examining the structure of trade, pre- and post-
MPAC, and its impact on GDP, we show via economic multiplier effects that macro-economic responsiveness has
increased. In other words, economic shocks (positive or negative) in one ASEAN country have higher effects on
the growth rates of other Member States. Myanmar and Laos are not included in the analysis due to unavailability
of sufficient data.
                                                                                                              16
results show that intra-ASEAN integration has increased at a more modest pace than
integration with the global economy.

This points to the fact that, in line with the policy of ‘open regionalism’ 5 adopted by ASEAN,
Member States must continue to leverage links with key external economies to generate
growth within the region. The need to link Member States to major trading partners reaffirms
the importance of Physical Connectivity projects (especially land-based projects) to link
internal regions to China, India and ports serving key trade partners, as well as trade
liberalization and transport cooperation policies that create an integrated production base for
regional exports.


Modelling confirms the positive impact the MPAC has had on regional trade, via institutional
measures aimed at reducing cross-border transaction costs. 6 Modelling results show that,
since the implementation of the MPAC, a one-day reduction in the number of days required to
export is expected to increase intra-ASEAN export volumes by nearly 8 per cent annually.
Before the MPAC, the same reduction would have led to only a 3 per cent increase.


Trade facilitation and border management indicators demonstrate improvements, particularly
in terms of accelerating the free flow of goods, improving trade facilitation and enhancing
border management. 7 The World Bank’s ‘Trading Across Borders’ scores – which include a
measurement of ‘distance to frontier’ 8 (Figure 12) – have increased from 2011/2012 for nearly

This is especially apparent for Brunei, Laos and the Philippines, that experienced the sharpest
score increases. Laos has made significant progress with respect to reducing the days
required to export, from 36 days in 2011 to 23 days in 2014, and LPI scores for clearance
efficiency have improved significantly for Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand
since 2012 (Figure 13).

It is important to note that the increased sensitivity of export volumes to customs procedures
and border management – as cross-border trade barriers are reduced across ASEAN – is

                                                                                                                 18
likely to increase competitiveness within the region. This demands that all countries be vigilant
in their efforts to improve trade efficiency to avoid falling behind with respect to trade and
economic growth.


The implementation of the MPAC has also increased the relative importance of sharing
borders within ASEAN: improved land border management has increased trade volumes
between contiguous Member States. Whereas contiguity (i.e., sharing a border) would have
resulted in an expected trade increase of 133-139 per cent compared with non-contiguous
country trade levels before the MPAC, a shared border now increases this figure to 163-183
per cent. This suggests that improvements in border management have made a significant
difference in easing trade across land borders.

As the composition of traded goods shifts from mainly bulk cargo, typically transported by sea
and rail, to lighter, higher value components largely transported by air, the development of the
air sector becomes ever more important. Since the MPAC, growth rates of intra-ASEAN air
passenger and air cargo flows have significantly increased (Figure 14 and 15). 9

Despite limited progress in the quality of air transport infrastructure, passenger and cargo
flows have risen markedly following the implementation of agreements underpinning the
ASEAN Open Sky policy and the ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASAM). This suggests the
great importance of institutional factors relative to physical factors in determining air transit
flows. Economic modelling confirms the significance of air liberalization policies to air transit
and transport levels. 10 The granting of third and fourth air freedoms 11 under the ASEAN Open
Skies initiative significantly increased intra-ASEAN air passenger flows – the ASEAN
Multilateral Agreement on Air Services alone, increased expected bilateral flows by an
estimated 70.5 per cent.


With respect to mobility, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar experienced noticeable growth
increases in cross-border land arrivals after adoption of the MPAC, suggesting the positive
effects of easing border restrictions on transit to those Member States. While the number of
land arrivals for ASEAN overall has increased steadily since 2000, the growth rates of
international passenger arrivals 12 decreased after MPAC implementation, from an average of
5.8 per cent over the period 2005-2010 to an average of 4.9 per cent for 2011-2013.

A key strategy of the MPAC is to further open up ASEAN economies to investment. ASEAN
continues to perform well in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), with an increasing
proportion of FDI inflows originating from within ASEAN. Since the MPAC, Thailand, The
Philippines and Myanmar have experienced the most significant increases in their FDI growth
rates. The proportion of intra-ASEAN FDI to total FDI has risen modestly, year-on-year since
2010, from approximately 12 per cent to nearly 15 per cent in 2013.

For the purposes of M&E – particularly with a view to improving the coordination of MPAC
strategies and projects – a more comprehensive assessment of coordinating capacity is
essential. This requires utilization of qualitative methods and data gathered at the project level,
both of which are currently lacking. This is, therefore, a key area of M&E development,
particularly considering the need to coordinate across infrastructure sectors to leverage
complementarities and support Connectivity with trade-enabling institutional measures.


People to People Connectivity Progress
People-to-People Connectivity – which involves efforts to promote deeper intra-ASEAN social
and cultural understanding, and encourage greater mobility – is the most difficult dimension
of the MPAC to measure and evaluate. Assessment relies largely on proxy indicators, such
as intra-ASEAN student exchange and tourism that only partially or indirectly reflect levels of
People-to-People Connectivity. Nevertheless, it remains a key component of ASEAN
integration and thus requires greater attention, both in terms of initiatives and the assessment
of progress.


International student exchange and the matriculation of tertiary students throughout ASEAN
remains a key and underutilized opportunity for building People-to-People Connectivity. In the
early years of MPAC implementation, the number of tertiary international students from within
ASEAN did not appreciably increase, and in fact decreased in many Member States. More
data is required to assess exchange beyond 2012, but initial results suggest that improving
opportunities for interaction amongst students remain a key development area. This can be
supported by ASEAN’s ongoing efforts to promote educational exchange and ASEAN-focused
programs at the secondary and university levels.

                                                                                                21
On the other hand, there has been good progress in increasing tourism flows in ASEAN, with
the growth rate of Intra-ASEAN international passenger arrivals increasing following MPAC
from previous annual growth averaging 7.2% from 2006 to 2010, to a post-MPAC average of
10.5% between 2011 and 2014.


Looking Forward: MPAC Policy Implications


The policy implications discussed here emerge from the preceding analysis, which focuses
on interventions at the strategic, regional and national level. The main policy implications
relate to observed complementarities between strategies; identification of key policy levers;
observed policy tradeoffs; and areas of lagging performance.


The first key lesson is that important complementarities exist between the strategic
dimensions of Connectivity. GSM results confirm complementary effects between physical
and institutional strategies and highlight the importance of coordinated development of
infrastructure, processes, and trade rules. The economic models also demonstrate that rules
governing trade and exchange – including liberalization agreements and process and
measurement standardization, and the general quality of logistics services – have critical
implications for the usability and efficiency of existing infrastructure. Ongoing efforts to
measure and coordinate across strategies and sectors are important and would benefit from
regular project- and policy-level updates.


Secondly, the analysis suggests several key policy ‘levers’. Economic models show that legal-
institutional factors are among the most important to increased trade and mobility within the
region. The availability of connecting physical infrastructure remains important to trade and
growth, but border facilitation measures, the overall quality of logistics in importing and
exporting countries, and the rules that determine the time and costs associated with exporting
will enable ASEAN to make the best use of these physical assets. For example, GSM analysis
shows that some of the most significant effects on projected 2025 GDPs result from the
development of the ASEAN Single Aviation Market, development of the RoRo network, and
border facilitation. And economic modelling shows that the number of days required to export
a basket of goods is negatively related to trade volume, whereas the LPI and Trading Across
Borders scores for importers and exporters are positively significant.

                                                                                           22
These measures are all functions of policies, processes and capacities that affect the transfer
of goods and services across borders. Furthermore, results suggest that institutional factors
can effectively stave off the negative effects of lagging physical developments. For example,
despite limited progress in the quality of air transport infrastructure over the MPAC period, air
passenger and cargo flows have risen significantly following ASAM, suggesting the greater
importance of institutional factors to air flows.


Quality and efficiency improvements in existing infrastructure can also be as important as new
developments. For instance, upgrading of roads to above Class III status may have more
effect on trade than new road construction. Similarly, maritime development must focus more
on improving port efficiency and productivity rather than solely on the construction of new
ports. Lastly, land-based infrastructure projects such as the AHN and the SKRL will continue
to be important, as they are essential components of multi-modal transport networks and
important linkages to contiguous trade partners, including India and China, whose growing
economic impacts on the region are expected to continue.


A third major category of policy implications relates to policy tradeoffs, specifically between
economic growth versus equitable development, and between aggregated national impact
versus local impact. The analysis points to a number of cases where infrastructure and trade
facilitation measures are expected to have different effects at local, national and regional
levels. For instance, the overall economic impacts of developing the RoRo network are
projected to be fairly minimal for Indonesia overall, but a closer look at the local level shows
that some negative impacts on Java are offset by significant positive impacts in Sulawesi,
Sumatra and Kalimantan. Similarly, the expected economic impacts of the AHN are moderate
for Myanmar and Brunei, but the local effects are more pronounced in certain regions within
these countries. These patterns demonstrate how developments with important local positive
impacts help to close development gaps without necessarily having significant impacts on
national GDP growth.


Finally, indicator results suggest that some Physical Connectivity initiatives should be revisited
due to their limited progress. Where low performance is due to insufficient policy attention and
project delays, Member States could prioritize them in their next strategic plan. This is likely
the case for maritime development (particularly the RoRo network) and inland waterways

                                                                                               23
development. However, where low progress is due to low bankability, insufficient demand,
institutional complications or low projected impacts, as with the SKRL, Member States must
revisit project structuring.


Leveraging Knowledge: M&E Opportunities


Both assessing the past and charting the future course of ASEAN Connectivity entail
advancing the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. The former depends on sound
evaluation, whereas the latter demands finding opportunities for adjustment to stay the course
towards integration. The evaluation of Connectivity progress and MPAC’s role therein requires
both a mechanism and program to systematically gather data, as well as a thorough, yet
practical evaluation framework to measure impacts.


Connectivity M&E is framed by an ASEAN Connectivity Implementation Matrix / Scorecard
(ACIM), which tracks the progress of the strategies and their key actions. The ACIM has
progressed from qualitative progress updates to more comprehensive application of
quantitative indicators and economic modeling techniques to evaluate MPAC impacts. Due to
the diverse nature of the MPAC strategies and key actions, Connectivity progress may be
assessed at three levels:
        Outputs: The units of service that result from policy action (e.g., kilometers of road
        constructed, number of documents required to export);
        Outcomes: The effects on ‘clients’ receiving services (e.g., reduced time and cost to
        export, increased quality of logistics, liberalization of air transport); and
        Impacts: Higher-level effects that relate to macro-level goals (e.g., economic growth).


MPAC strategies and actions range in specificity and include aspirations, strategic goals,
infrastructure projects, key decisions and measurable actions. Because of this, strategies and
key actions lie at different analytical levels of effect. Strategies are mainly geared towards
immediate outputs and intermediate outcomes, whereas the MPAC as a whole is aimed at
long-term impacts such as economic growth and equitable development. With this in mind,
the M&E system must be designed to measure performance at different levels.


While M&E has progressed, the current framework could be developed to gather better data
and provide more detailed analysis about root causes of performance that would help Member

                                                                                            24
States prioritize certain projects, trace effects on policy outcomes, and isolate MPAC effects
from other drivers of connectivity. Moreover, there is currently insufficient information to
compare the projected benefits of Connectivity projects with their expected costs. As such, a
number of opportunities exist to improve oversight and assessment.


Recommendations relate to improving data access, quality and breadth, to more accurately
assess strategic performance and provide valuable contextual information; and to expanding
the ACIM to link performance at the project (or key action) output level to social and economic
impacts. By applying a multi-level evaluation framework to unpack performance at the output
and process levels, the ACIM can be used to identify important policy levers. Without this
information, decision makers will not be able to address implementation challenges effectively.


We currently report the state of Connectivity per strategy, with indicator selection based on
data availability and design. For example, progress on the AHN is reported at the output level,
according to the length of AHN roads built (Figure 18). Its impact on GDP is also projected via
modelling. In the future, however, ASEAN could also monitor outcomes such as the volume
of exports by road and transit times between major cities. Maritime development, on the other
hand, is currently monitored at the output (port capacity) and outcome (sea cargo throughout)
levels, with future impacts on GDP projected via modelling. This is a similar case for trade
facilitation strategies.

                                                                       Intermediate
           Inputs              Process               Outputs                              Impacts
                                                                        Outcomes

                                            • Documents            • Trade volumes    • GDP growth
                                              required to export
                                            • Time at border



We strive to identify a fuller set of linked output, outcome and impact indicators to develop a
more robust, comprehensive evaluation program. There are also important assessment gains
to be made by coupling quantitative indicator measurement with qualitative performance
assessment (including survey and interview data), timely project and policy implementation
data (including project costs), and risk assessment. The use of supportive qualitative data
provides valuable contextual information and has three primary purposes: (1) maintaining
updated records on project status and policy adoption; (2) triangulating results; and (3)
determining underlying root causes of observed outcomes.
                                                                                                     25
Lastly, identified data needs relate to untimely, incomplete or un-harmonized data. These may
be summarized as follows:

       Data harmonization: In order to compare Connectivity year-on-year, indicator
       measures must be strictly defined and uniformly constructed. The issue of
       harmonization is pronounced, for example, in the case of energy trade data, where
       large asymmetries are observed due to major differences in the ways imports and
       exports are recorded.

       Data availability and timeliness: Much of the data on trade by transport sector (e.g.,
       cargo throughput by river, exports by rail, etc.) is missing, irregular or too outdated for
       use in M&E. Many figures are reported only to 2012 or 2013, while others are
       altogether unavailable. Improved and timelier submission of statistics would allow
       better tracking of Physical Connectivity. Other shortfalls include the lack of baseline
       statistics with which to compare progress, the inability to disaggregate network
       extensions and expansions from upgrading and reclassifications, and a lack of
       important data on projected an annual project costs for key initiatives.


Building infrastructure asset registers could be another helpful solution to some of these data
issues, particularly those related to project status. Asset registers could incorporate
geographic information in the recording of physical and financial data for infrastructure, as well
as in inventories and conditional assessments. National asset registers could be used to track
the extension and improvement of segments of the AHN and the SKRL over time, as well as
port capacity and development, inland waterways development projects, and targeted ICT and
energy transmission projects.


The ACIM has become an increasingly useful tool, but there are clear opportunities for
improving MPAC M&E. While strategy-level assessment is important to guide policy,
evaluating impacts and defining opportunities for re-calibration requires analysis at the project
level. This means regular and systematic data collection and a multi-level approach. These
and other recommendations in this report give guidance as ASEAN embarks on building the
monitoring and evaluation framework for the Post-2015 agenda for ASEAN Connectivity and
the ASEAN Community 2025.

Indicators and Models

The indicators used to assess Connectivity (detailed in Chapter II and Annex 1) draw upon a wide variety of data
sources, including ASEAN Statistics, the World Bank, UN ESCAP, World Economic Forum, and industry
databases. These indicators demonstrate the changing state of Connectivity. To measure the significance of MPAC
to outcomes and impacts, econometric analysis and spatial modeling are employed to control for the effect of other
potential factors on Connectivity and growth. In other words, an increased indicator score may be attributable to

                                                                                                              27
extra-MPAC factors. Conversely, decreased or stable scores may not mean MPAC strategies are not working;
rather, countervailing factors that could have otherwise worsened Connectivity may be offset by MPAC gains.
Because of this, unless output measures are solely attributable to MPAC policy (e.g., operationalizing MPAC
frameworks or constructing AHN missing links), we recognize that indicators can only provide a ‘pulse check’.


To offer a more definitive picture of MPAC impacts, we employ econometric modeling strategies. Geographic
Simulation Modeling (GSM) directly simulates the impacts of key actions on patterns of economic growth at the
sub-regional level; gravity models are employed to isolate the effects of MPAC and component policies on intra-
ASEAN trade and air passenger flows; and structural vector auto-regression (SVAR) time series analysis allows
us to examine the effects of MPAC on GDP growth through the Intra-ASEAN trade structure. At present, data
availability restricts the ability to extensively model MPAC impacts. While future modeling (contingent on improved
data) should be applied to assess the MPAC effects on more Connectivity measures like trade volumes by transport
sector (e.g., maritime, air, land), Intra-ASEAN FDI, and energy trade, the methods used in this report provide a
basis for future application.

PART I: Connectivity Strategies and Progress



Chapter I. Introduction: Connectivity and the MPAC

1.1 Background

In pursuit of a resilient, competitive, and sustainable ASEAN Community, and in recognition
of the central role increased physical, institutional, and people-to-people connectivity would
play in this endeavor, ASEAN Heads of State adopted the Master Plan on ASEAN
Connectivity (MPAC) at the 16th ASEAN Summit in Hanoi in October 2010. The MPAC is an
ambitious strategic plan to advance regional Connectivity in pursuit of wider goals of enhanced
competitiveness, narrowing the development gap, global integration, and deeper social and
cultural understanding.

Realizing the ASEAN Community, comprising the ASEAN Economic Community, the ASEAN
Political-Security Community, and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community, depends on deeper
integration of Member States, including the reduction of barriers to trade, communications,
and people mobility, improved regional capacity to facilitate trade and transport goods and
people, and harmonization of rules governing trade and movement within the region. The
MPAC provides a blueprint for further integrating the people, trade, services, and capital of
ASEAN, both within the region and with the global economy, via three strategic dimensions.
The dimensions and their composite strategies aim to redress “hard” and “soft” barriers to
integration. Under the physical Connectivity dimension, MPAC attends to improving
transportation,   information   communications,   energy,    and   technology   infrastructure.
Institutional Connectivity strategies focus on building effective processes, rules, structures,
and organizations to facilitate the freer flow of goods, services, investments, and people. And
people-to-people Connectivity seeks to promote social and cultural understanding amongst
the peoples of ASEAN.

The MPAC specifies strategies and key actions for each of these dimensions, as well as
priority projects for rapid implementation, detailed in Annexes 1 and 2. Project funding is
generally the remit of Member States, though ASEAN established an ASEAN Infrastructure
Fund with the Asian Development Bank in 2011, to provide financing to sovereign or
sovereign-guaranteed infrastructure projects in the ASEAN region. Nonetheless, the
                                                                                            29
implementation of MPAC itself is nearly wholly dependent on the commitment of and
collaboration amongst Member States.

This MPAC Monitoring and Evaluation Report illustrates the progress ASEAN has made to
date with respect to improving ASEAN Connectivity over the 2011-2015 implementation
period, as well as the likely impacts of the MPAC program on economic growth and equitable
development in the future. Building on past analysis, research, and deliberation over the
modes and methods of measuring connectivity, this report presents both a pulse check on
ASEAN Connectivity as well as the earliest evaluation of MPAC’s policy impact. The
assessment of connectivity is framed by the ASEAN Connectivity Implementation Matrix /
Scorecard, an evaluation tool currently applied at the strategy level.

1.2 The ACIM Framework

The ASEAN Connectivity Implementation Matrix / Scorecard (ACIM) has been developed and
applied to monitor the progress on the initiatives associated with MPAC, as well as MPAC’s
role in progressing economic competitiveness and growth, regional integration, and equitable
development. The ACIM tracks the progress of seven physical, ten institutional, and two
people-to-people strategies and their associated key actions (32, 32, and 20, respectively),
with special attention to fifteen high-impact priority projects designated for quick
implementation (see Annex 2).

In its early inception (2010 to 2012), the ACIM was applied as a qualitative assessment of
progress on key actions, with appraisal based on expert interviews. Results were documented
on an ordinal scale which recorded the status of key action items and priority projects as
“Complete / Early Achiever”, “On Track”, “Behind Schedule”, or “Yet to Start”. These
descriptors were supplemented additionally by periodic project status reports. While this
offered a dashboard view of project status, the approach was entirely retrospective, insufficient
to capture degrees of progress or strategic relationships, and lacking measurements that
could be meaningfully compared over time.

Following the 2014 First Interim Report and consultation with ASEAN, the World Bank
suggested improvements to the ACIM to include quantitative indicators of progress towards
the MPAC strategies and key action items within them, as well as economic modeling
techniques to evaluate impacts. In doing so, the ACIM can evolve from a retrospective,
qualitative status update to a more balanced assessment tool incorporating quantitative data



                                                                                              30
and strategic assessment at the regional, national, and subnational levels, as well as analysis
of the impacts of MPAC on economic growth and regional and extra-ASEAN trade.

Measuring Outputs, Outcomes, and Impacts

Due to the diverse nature of the MPAC strategies and key actions, and their relationships to
greater goals of ASEAN Community-building and Integration, assessments of progress of
MPAC components are inevitably made at multiple levels of analysis. This analysis and
assessment framework recognizes that a chain of effects results from policy intervention. The
scope and scale of intervention extends the causal chain. As commonly applied in policy
evaluation, we assess MPAC’s effects in this report at three levels of analysis – output,
outcome, and impact – with nested causal relationships.

Immediate policy outputs are the units of service that result from the conversion of inputs via
government processes (e.g., number of kilometers of new road constructed, number of
documents required for export, new ports developed). These drive outcomes, which are the
effects on ‘clients’ receiving the government services or coming under the influence of new
rules (e.g., reduced time and cost to export, increased quality of logistics, liberalization of air
transport). Finally, impacts are the higher-level effects of interventions that relate to broader
policy goals (e.g., increased trade, economic growth).

Figure 19. Causal chain of policy inputs to impacts


         Inputs           Processes            Outputs        Outcomes           Impacts



Because the expansive set of MPAC strategies and actions range in specificity and include
policy aspirations, strategic goals, tangible infrastructure projects, key decisions, measurable
actions, and calls for further study or rule implementation, they do not necessarily lie squarely
in nested, causally linked configurations of output, outcome, and impact. While this is a
challenge to monitoring and evaluation, it is not a strict impediment. Rather, this evaluation
exercise accepts that, for each strategy, assessment of progress may involve reflections on
output and / or outcome performance related to Connectivity, depending on the structuring of
the strategy itself and the availability of data. Further, the analysis of MPAC impact on
Connectivity assesses the influence of MPAC policies and key actions on intermediate
connectedness outcomes (e.g., air cargo flows), as well as impacts such as economic growth,
increased trade and, thus, a more unified production and distribution base.


                                                                                                31
By and large, the strategies themselves are geared towards intermediate outcomes related to
improving levels of Connectivity, whereas the MPAC as a whole is aimed at long-term impacts
such as economic competitiveness, equitable development, and cultural understanding. As
such, the search for metrics utilized to measure strategy attainment prioritizes indicators that
are also at the outcome-level of analysis. Where outcome data is unavailable, however, output
indicators or outcome proxy indicators are utilized. Examples include ‘Growth in the capacity
of Intra-ASEAN passenger air travel’ as a proxy outcome indicator for ‘Building an ASEAN
Single Aviation Market’ and ‘Cargo throughput by river’ as an output indicator for ‘Establishing
an integrated inland waterway network’.

On the other hand, where a strategy or its key actions are aimed at producing specific outputs
(e.g., constructing missing links of the AHN, developing National Single Windows), the
comparison between the current level of execution and the expected outputs gives an
indication of the degree of implementation. But inferences may also be made about intended
outcomes, motivating inclusion of complementary outcome-level indicators. For example, the
‘Time and cost required to import and export’ are outcome indicators applied to output-oriented
strategy, namely, operationalizing trade and transport frameworks.

In addition, there is evidence that improved Connectivity positively affects economic growth
and socioeconomic conditions. For example, upgrading the ASEAN Highway Network (an
output) is expected to reduce freight transport time and cost (an outcome) which, in turn, is
expected to increase productivity, trade, and economic growth in the long run (an impact). To
measure the significance of MPAC to outcomes and impacts, econometric analysis and spatial
modeling is required.

Causal Inference

Several econometric modeling strategies are utilized herein to understand the causal links
between the MPAC policy and several macroeconomic outcomes. Geographic Simulation
Models (GSM) directly simulate the impacts of key actions on patterns of economic growth at
the sub-regional level. The simulated outcomes are contingent on the Connectivity
assumptions on which simulations are based and thus, reflect impacts of expanded and
improved transportation networks and border transit conditions. The gravity models of trade
and passenger air travel control for non-Connectivity factors that may also determine trade
flows, including geographic distance, common borders, and shared languages, allowing us to
isolate the effects of MPAC itself on trade flows and air passenger flows. Similarly, time series


                                                                                              32
regression analysis allows us to isolate the effects of MPAC from other contributing factors to
GDP growth.

This brings about two important methodological points related to interpreting indicators. First,
the indicators measure Connectivity, but not strictly MPAC’s impact on Connectivity, as other
factors affecting indicators are not controlled. An increased score for an indicator may be
attributable to extra-MPAC economic, political, social, or physical factors. Conversely,
decreased or stable scores may not mean MPAC strategies are not working; rather,
countervailing factors that could have otherwise worsened Connectivity may be offset by
MPAC gains.

Second, and because of this, we accept that many of the indicators are to be interpreted
primarily as a pulse check on Connectivity during the MPAC period (unless they are output
measures solely attributable to MPAC policy, e.g., operationalizing frameworks or constructing
AHN missing links). We can reasonably infer beyond this, however, that pronounced changes
in indicator trends following MPAC implementation suggest the positive influence of MPAC
strategies and key actions on those particular indicators of connectivity.

1.3 Improving the ACIM

Pursuant to improvements proposed in the First Interim Report and further deliberated with
the ACCC and ASEC, the ACIM has progressed to support the evaluation of MPAC outputs
and intermediate outcomes via a set of strategy-level quantitative indicators. Further, ACIM
indicators are used as inputs in the modeling of MPAC’s significance to economic impacts
such as increased trade and GDP growth, as well as in prospective models that forecast
MPAC impacts on future economic growth at the national and regional levels.

While the ACIM is improving to provide a more forward-looking picture of progress that
employs a more systematic approach to assessing MPAC, there remain opportunities to
improve M&E. For one, the ACIM does not currently track outputs at the activity level and,
thus, cannot offer assessments of the efficiency or effectiveness of activity-level processes.
National and sub-national evaluations that capture these aspects of MPAC performance could
be integrated into a more thorough multi-level assessment in the future. Secondarily, the
MPAC’s indicators cover outputs or outcomes, but not both, for each strategy. Thus, where
outcomes but not outputs are reported, we may demonstrate performance, but without
indication of causal relationships with particular activities. And where outputs but not outcomes
are reported, one may only cautiously infer the effect on intermediate outcomes.

                                                                                              33
To improve this aspect, better information systems and data quality are essential. Proposed
improvements (See 4.2) are based on identified data gaps associated with measuring
outcomes, which in turn limit the precision of impact evaluation. These issues challenge the
rigorous assessment of both current outcomes and likelihood of future strategy success.




                                                                                          34
Chapter II. MPAC Strategies and Connectivity Progress

This second chapter reports progress on physical, institutional, and people-to-people
measures of ASEAN Connectivity, organized by the MPAC three dimensions and their
associated strategies. Each strategy section specifies the indicator or set of indicators applied
to measure progress and reports Connectivity performance according to these indicators.

The MPAC also includes a list of prioritized projects from amongst the lists of key actions
under each strategy (See Annex 2). Where data is available, the status of these projects is
discussed in summary. Whereas the indicators are identified in this section, detailed indicator
definitions and technical notes on their selection and application are described, where needed,
in Annex 3. Data sources are listed and described in Annex 4.

Pursuant to the broader goals of the Connectivity initiative, the MPAC is intended to support
an integrated production and distribution base, which would require the seamless
transportation and trade of goods across borders, as well as the free flow of investments.
Recent research drawing on global trade data indicates that trade facilitation, transport
connectivity and logistics quality are more important than geographical distance in explaining
trade costs (Arvis et al, 2013). As such, the degree of connectivity between ASEAN States,
as it relates to both hard infrastructure and the processes, rules, and systems applied in trade
governance, are critical components of building a unified ASEAN Community. Similarly, the
MPAC aims to free the connectivity of the peoples of ASEAN across national borders.
Numerous aspects related to the flow of goods, services, and capital are attended to
extensively in the physical and institutional Connectivity strategy sections, whereas the flow
of people across ASEAN Member States is discussed in a review of people-to-people
strategies.




                                                                                              35
2.1 Physical Connectivity Performance

Strategies within the physical Connectivity dimension aim to alleviate “hard” physical
constraints to ASEAN Integration. The aims of physical Connectivity are to develop integrated,
effective multimodal transport systems and ICT and energy networks. Strategies span all
transportation sectors – road, rail, river, sea, and air – and their connection nodes, along with
the energy and information and telecommunications sectors.

Overall, ASEAN’s performance with respect to physical infrastructures has improved over the
years. According to the Global Competitiveness Report measures of infrastructure quality,
most Member States have maintained or incrementally improved the quality of their physical

The extension, expansion, rehabilitation, and upgrading of ASEAN physical infrastructure will,
thus, remain central to its trade competitiveness.



Strategy 1. Complete the ASEAN Highway Network

Including 23 designated routes covering 38,400 kilometers, the ASEAN Highway Network
(AHN) has been prioritized as a flagship transportation project due to the key role of overland
transportation to the transit of goods and mobility of people in ASEAN. ASEAN Transport
Ministers adopted a plan to develop the AHN in 1999, aiming to strengthen the system of land
corridors linking ASEAN Member States to each other and to the greater Trans-Asian Highway
Network. The MPAC reaffirmed this goal with specific targets to upgrade designated Transit

                                                                                                                                                                                         36
Transport Routes (TTRs) to at least Class III standards by 2012; upgrade “Class II or III”
sections with high traffic volume to “Class I” by 2020; and construct AHN missing links by
2015.

In addition to two missing links in Myanmar, Figure 20. ASEAN Highway Network
the MPAC identified over 5,300 km of Below
Class III roads in Myanmar, Laos, Indonesia,
Malaysia,    Vietnam,     and       Philippines,
including 2,070 km of TTRs in Laos,
Myanmar, and Philippines. Of these, five
TTRs (AH-12 and AH-15 in Laos; AH-1, AH-
2, and AH-3 in Myanmar) were prioritized for
upgrading.

Progress has been made with respect to
expanding and upgrading the AHN, but a
remaining missing link (60 km on AH-112 in
Myanmar)     and   slower    than     expected
upgrading    and   network      extension    all   Source: Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, 2009

challenge likelihood of full implementation by
the 2015 and 2020 deadlines for the AHN strategy’s key actions.

Indicator and Data Source
Both the ASEAN-Japan Transportation Partnership (AJTP) and UN Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) maintain data on the construction of ASEAN
roads and AHN network roads by class. Whereas AJTP data relates to roadways in general,
UNESCAP provides data specifically on the length of AHN roads, by class. The indicators and
data sources employed include the length of        MPAC Priority AHN Projects for 2015

Because information on specific road segments is not currently available, it is not possible to
definitively report the distribution by road class of the over 2,500 kilometers of newly
constructed road or to determine what proportion of the extensions in each class are
attributable to new construction versus upgrading and reclassification. As such, we can only
report changes to road length by class and changes to the proportionate distribution of the
AHN by road class. Supplemental project updates would add important information on the
additions attributed to construction versus upgrading.

Progress

UNESCAP data demonstrates progress between 2010 and 2015, both in terms of expanding
the AHN, completing one missing link, and upgrading road quality.

concentrated in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand (Figure 22). 13 The AHN was virtually
unchanged between 2010 and 2015 in Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Singapore.

A series of 2014 World Bank consultations with key governmental contacts in ASEAN Member
States suggests that in Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore, the AHN is either complete or close
to complete and within standard. In Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, road works
are underway for significant portions of their respective segments of the AHN, beyond MPAC
targets. In Laos and Myanmar, upgrading of TTRs as stipulated in MPAC has progressed but
did not fully meet the 2012 implementation deadline. At the time of writing, one of the two
missing links in Myanmar, the 141-km AH-123 link connecting the Dawei deep seaport to
Thailand, had been constructed but not yet paved (i.e., Below Class III standard). The 60-km

AH-112 link through southern-most Myanmar is currently under construction. 14 As such, at
least 70% of the missing links road length identified in MPAC is complete (at Below Class III
standards), and 30% is under construction.

Upgrading: Comparison of 2010, 2012, and 2015 data shows good progress in road
upgrading (Table 3). The percentage of roads Class II and above rose from 57.7% in 2010 to
66.5% in 2015. In Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand, where much of the extension was
concentrated, good progress was also made with respect to road quality (see upward
reclassification in Figure 22). Philippines also demonstrated good progress upgrading Below
Class III and Class III roads, and Vietnam brought much of its Below Class III road length to
Class III standards. Generally, the length of Primary, Class I, and Class II roads grew by
31.3%, 36.8% and 22.1%, respectively, between 2010 and 2015, reflecting new additions
along with good progress in upgrading Class III and below roads to higher standards.

Progress on upgrading the five prioritized TTR segments in Laos and Myanmar marked for
construction by 2012 appears fair. 2012 ASEAN Project Information Sheets recorded the
completed construction of Laos AH-15 and good progress on AH-11. Both roads are
constructed but are only at the project structuring stage for upgrading. Further upgrading
needs have been identified for both roads, which are stipulated as priority projects for the Laos
government, but works have yet to begin.

In Myanmar, 2012 ASEAN project status reporting suggests progress, but with indeterminable
results for AH-1 and AH-2, as the only overall highway lengths above Class III are reported.
Nevertheless, the 93 km AH-3 stretch was completely upgraded by 2012, and 73% of AH-1
(1208 of 1656 km total) and 43% of AH-2 (350 of 807 km) were above Class III. It is not
discernable how much of each road remains below standard. 15

   In Summary
         Approximately 70% of the total length of missing links has been constructed in Myanmar, but
         at Below Class III standards (unpaved).
         The AHN was expanded by 2,559 km, or 10.6% between 2010 and 2015.
         Expansion in concentrated in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand, whereas upgrading is evident
         in Myanmar, Cambodia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.
         Upgrading of Below Class III roads is a key area requiring added attention, especially for Laos
         and Myanmar.
         TTRs prioritized for completion by 2012 were progressing but not complete. Myanmar TTRs
         require further upgrading.

Strategy 2. Complete the implementation of SKRL project

The Singapore-Kunming Rail Link was proposed in 1995 at the fifth ASEAN Summit, reviving
interest in developing the rail system to increase intra- Figure 23. SKRL Map
regional     connectivity       of    cargo      and      passenger
transportation networks. As a priority project of the
MPAC, the railway was identified as a crucial linkage in
the “North-South Economic Corridor” by way of
connecting ASEAN Member States from Singapore to
southern China via Eastern and Western routes.

The planned network includes a prioritized Eastern line
from Kunming through Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand
(with a spur between Vietnam and Lao PDR), and the
Western line through Myanmar and northern Thailand to
Bangkok. 16                                                                Source: ASEAN MPAC, 2010



Indicator and Data Source

It is difficult to assess progress with only two years of data available following MPAC
implementation (2010-2012). Nevertheless, the pace of SKRL progress on constructing
missing links has also been minimal. As such, quantitative assessment of the degree of
completion is of limited use. For this reason, we supplement the early SKRL rail length data
with status report updates for the SKRL specifically, as well as data on the overall length of
the rail networks in ASEAN. Given the primary interest of MPAC in improving Intra-ASEAN
Connectivity, however, overall network length should not be interpreted as a direct proxy of
MPAC’s rail impact on Connectivity. Rather, it is indicative of increased coverage of rail
transportation networks in general. Status updates draw on reporting from 2014 World Bank
ASEAN PPP Pipeline Project country consultations with key government officials. Total
network length data is sourced from AJTP for observations in 2010 and 2012.

Progress

At the beginning of the MPAC 2011-2015 implementation period, there were 4,069 kilometers
of missing links or links in need of rehabilitation in Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
Thailand, and Vietnam. These spans included 1285 km of missing links targeted in MPAC for


16 In view of the greater challenges in establishing the Western line, it was deemed preferable to first complete the

Eastern to quickly develop an operational railway link between Singapore and China.
                                                                                                                 41
construction. Progress on construction and rehabilitation has been slow, limited only to three
sections. Project status updates from 2013 and 2014 also show little progress, with
implementation limited to constructing the 6 km missing link from Aranyaprathet to Klongluk
in Thailand and upgrading 28 km of rail to usable standards at Poipet to Sisophon, linking
Cambodia to Thailand. The missing spur linking Vietnam to Laos is currently under discussion
with China for financing. 17

Only the Singapore and Malaysia sections of SKRL are complete, with construction unrelated
to MPAC, as national systems were built independently of the SKRL initiative. World Bank
consultations suggest that the SKRL is of lower priority than other transport projects due to
low projected traffic, competition for resources from other development projects, and relative
attractiveness of alternative transport sectors (World Bank Infrastructure Hub 2014). The low
level of development is also due to concerns over SKRL’s overall impact on trade Connectivity
and growth. These concerns are corroborated by limited impacts projected in the Geographic
Simulation Model discussed in Section 3.1.

Table 4 shows that, of the set of expansion and upgrading activities to be completed by 2015,
only 2% of the missing links are complete, with another 10% under construction.

18   During planning, the length was reduced from 48 to 28 km (World Bank consultation, 2014).
                                                                                                                        42
Data on the overall rail network length (including SKRL) show an approximate 5% increase
between 2005 and 2012, from 18,991 km in 2005 to 19,889 km in 2012. Decreases in the total
rail length from 2005 to 2006 and 2011 and 2012 are due to reclassification and the removal
of 420 km of Philippines rail sections from inclusion in the 2006-2010 and 2012 network data.
Of this low rate of development, expansion was highest in Myanmar, where approximately
1,000 km were added to their national rail network since 2005. These extensions were
constructed prior to the MPAC implementation period, however.

  In Summary
          Progress on the SKRL has been extremely limited due to projections of low traffic volume.
          Since 2002, the overall ASEAN rail network has grown by less than 5%. From 2010 to 2012, the
          entire ASEAN network was expanded by only 106 km, which accounts for growth of just over
          0.5% in overall coverage.
          Of the expansion since 2010, less than 4% represents sections of the SKRL, limited to a 6km
          stretch in Thailand and upgrading of a 28km stretch in Cambodia.




                                                                                                        43
Strategy 3. Establish an integrated inland waterways network

The ASEAN region has approximately 51,000 kilometers of navigable inland waterways with
potential to develop passenger transport and regional trade, particularly for CLMV countries.
At the time of MPAC adoption, however, inland waterways had been underutilized for cross-
border freight transport. Thus, the MPAC included the direction to formulate and implement a
regional framework for developing inland waterways transport services, to include plans for
alleviating problems related to network underdevelopment, limited river ports and facilities,
and low intermodal connectivity.

Indicator and Data Source

One primary trade goal associated with developing inland waterways is increasing river
network usability for the transport of cargo. As such, progress is measured via a proxy
indicator, namely the growth rate of cargo throughput by river, expressed volumetrically. This
data is maintained by AJTP, available annually to 2012, for Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Progress

Data on river cargo throughput since 2004 shows a moderate yet steady increase in cargo
volumes transported via river ports up to 2011, with a slight decrease in the year following.
Due to the short time frame of available data, it is difficult to determine whether any changes
in throughput are associated with MPAC. That said, the limited implementation of MPAC
actions associated with inland waterways suggests that gains may be attributable to the
market rather than policy. Nevertheless, trade by inland waterway has increased.

Reviewing regional river trade, cargo volume throughout rose at an average rate of 6%
annually between 2004 and 2012, reaching an approximate 258 million tons in 2012. Of this
total, 251 million tons passed through river ports in Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Indeed,
use of inland waterways highest amongst Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, whose shares
account for 59.9%, 20.3%, and 17.1% of total river port throughput, respectively, for the period
of 2004 to 2012. While these countries combined recorded over 97% of the river throughput,
Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia – with large river networks but much smaller recorded river
trade volumes – stand much to gain from further developing inland waterways.

  In Summary
      Progress in the early implementation period (2011-2012) appears limited, though the short
      time frame and data limitations may be not be sufficient to demonstrate progress.
      Early data in Laos and Cambodia are promising, suggesting the possibility of increasing growth
      from 2011.
      River networks in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar are underdeveloped as trade transit modes.

Strategy 4. Accomplish an integrated maritime transport system

Maritime transport accounts for the greatest volume in international trade and is recognized
as the most efficient and cost-effective mode of transporting large cargo volumes. As such,
the development of a robust, integrated maritime transport system is critical to both ASEAN
regional and global trade connectivity and competitiveness. Central to the development of a
competitive maritime industry is the reinforcement and upgrading of existing infrastructure and
the establishment of reliable, efficient shipping routes and a system of competitive ports. Steps
towards these goals include increasing port capacity and services, particularly for 47
designated ports within the trans-ASEAN network, and establishing reliable roll-on/roll-off
(RoRo) shipping routes to capture cost and time efficiencies.

ASEAN has taken important steps towards integrating the sector, including 2007 adoption of
the Roadmap towards an Integrated and Competitive Maritime Transport in ASEAN
(RICMTA). Nevertheless, unlike air transport, progress in the maritime sector is lagging, in
part due to slow implementation of policy and exclusion of maritime cabotage from trade
reform deliberations. This, naturally, has the most significance for the connectivity of
archipelagic regions of ASEAN.

Philippines, which has prioritized RoRo to connect less-developed regions with economic
centers within and outside of the country, the network has been given limited attention on the
ASEAN maritime development agenda.


                                                                                                 46
There are currently three active projects in the ASEAN RoRo development framework. The
Brunei-Malaysia corridor has been active since 2010; an Indonesia-Philippines link between
Sulawesi and Mindanao was established in late 2014; and there are current plans for a route
between Phuket, Thailand, and Penang and Langkawi, Malaysia. Further, a feasibility study
has been undertaken by JICA, with three priority routes identified. Efforts to operationalize the
network are currently ongoing.

With respect to port infrastructure, the World Bank ASEAN PPP Pipeline Project found that,
as of December 2014, only 16 of the 47 identified ports have been completed or are under
construction / rehabilitation, and another 24 are scheduled for construction or rehabilitation.
Thus, 40 ports are constructed or have specific development plans, while the remaining seven
have not progressed. Three of these (Kyaukphyu in Myanmar, Kemaman in Malaysia, and Ho
Chi Minh in Vietnam) have been removed from national development plans due to limited
resources and/or strategic shifts in infrastructure development.

Therefore, since neither the ASSM nor RoRo network have reached the implementation stage,
and since port development is only approximately 30% implemented, progress on maritime
connectivity over the MPAC implementation period is reflective of general progress in the
sector and increased ASEAN attention to maritime development, rather than direct impact of
the full suite of MPAC maritime actions.

Indicator and Data Source

In addition to an overview of port and maritime network development key activities, progress
in maritime connectivity is reflected partially in the growth of volume of maritime trade and port
cargo throughputs, as well as changes in industry perceptions of port quality. Patterns of
integration and competitiveness are described along two aspects: maritime trade activity and
port quality. The first attends to international sea trade, drawing on import, export, and sea
cargo throughput data for ASEAN Members States. Data is available from the ASEAN-Japan
Transport Partnership (AJTP), with latest data recorded for 2012. The second aspect attends
to business executives' perceptions of the quality of port facilities in each member state. The
indicator ‘Quality of Port Infrastructure’ draws on perceptions data from the World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) dataset, recorded up to 2015.

Progress

International sea cargo throughput has increased steadily over the past ten years at an
average rate of 4.5-5.3%, growing in volume from 1.34 billion tons in 2005 to over 1.82 billion

                                                                                               47
tons in 2012. 19 While rate of throughput growth for ASEAN did not increase significantly during
the early years of the MPAC implementation, the limited time frame of post-MPAC data (latest
data is only available to 2012) and delayed implementation of key maritime activities also limit
the ability to detect a trend shift for ASEAN overall.

Examination at the country level, however, suggests that some Member States have, indeed,
experienced higher growth rates for sea cargo throughput during the early implementation
period: Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines all experienced increased rates of cargo
throughput growth in 2011 and 2012.

While imports by sea have been generally steady, exports by sea have grown steadily since
2005, albeit with no discernable trend shift following adoption of MPAC. Continuous monitoring
of exports and access to data on bilateral trade flows of sea cargo would be the next step in
monitoring the connectivity impacts of MPAC on sea trade, particularly following the
implementation of key actions that have yet to be realized.

While imports generally hold steady for ASEAN over the time period, they also fluctuate at the
country level with offsetting effects. While sea imports to Thailand fell, whereas imports to
Indonesia rose both before and after MPAC, Myanmar experienced a sharp increase in
imports by sea starting in 2008, carrying through the implementation period. As for exports by
sea, Indonesia data suggests an upward shift in growth from 2010 to 2012, though additional
tracking for the periods following is necessary to detect a trend change, if any.

Port Quality

Amongst many indicators of trade and economic competitiveness, the World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) captures annual survey data on respondents’
perceptions of the quality of port infrastructure across 133 economies. While these indicators
are reflective of perceptions rather than directly measured performance, they are helpful to
capture expert assessment of maritime infrastructure development over time. 20 In semi-annual
surveys, maritime industry respondents rank port infrastructure on a scale from 1 (port
infrastructure extremely underdeveloped) to 7 (efficient by international standards).

GCI Quality of Port Infrastructure data suggests that, while port services and capacity have
generally improved over the past ten years, they have progressed slowly. 21 Nevertheless, the
ASEAN average score for port quality has increased from 2007 to 2012, with a noticeable
increase during the 2012-2013 period. This brief surge was followed, however, by a decrease.
This may be simply a reflection of perception shifts, or may indicate that early attention to the
quality of port services during early MPAC slipped in the middle implementation period. This
pattern warrants further monitoring to determine whether a trend shift is to follow.

Country by country, Malaysia’s and Singapore’s port quality scores have remained at stable
highs, with both exceeding average scores for high-income OECD countries each year.

too, have Vietnam’s ports improved over the past ten years, but with the sharpest increase in
score improvement occurring just prior to MPAC implementation.

and port quality. Low port traffic in some
cases is attributable to directional port
traffic   imbalances   and   /   or   high
                                             Source: GCI, 2015
dispersion of limited volumes.

To the first point, consultations in Indonesia and Philippines suggest that maritime transport
average costs are prohibitively high in some locations due to ships entering ports with high
volumes and leaving empty (because of limited demand for those regions’ exports). In
southern Vietnam, on the other hand, a large port network is currently competing for low levels
of traffic, which are insufficient to make efficient use of the system.


                                                                                                          51
Another issue requiring attention is potential overdevelopment of new ports, as opposed to
development and improvement of support infrastructure, rehabilitation of existing ports, and
improved connectivity to other modes of transport. Consultations in Indonesia and the
Philippines suggest that further investments in large equipment (e.g., cranes) and ICT are
required to capture the benefits of prior investments in core infrastructure (e.g., berths,
breakwaters, etc.) and reduce costs associated with low berth turnover and long port
occupancies. Lastly, lack of sufficient investments in roads and rail connecting ports and
follow-on freight services has led to two contrasting problems: excessive port congestion (e.g.,
Tanjung Priok, Manila) or low utilization (e.g., southern Vietnam) (World Bank Infrastructure
Hub 2014). Further analysis of port capacity, productivity (e.g., average berthing / port stay
times), and utilization (e.g., berthing occupancy rates) is required to assess port efficiency and
identify areas of excess or insufficient capacity. Additionally, fieldwork and expert consultation
on perceptions of port quality would be helpful to identify key issues related to patterns of port
quality performance.


  In Summary
      Seaport container throughput has increased, particularly in Thailand, Myanmar, and the
      Philippines since MPAC implementation.
      Indonesia’s exports by sea have also increased significantly in the early years of MPAC.
      Progress in perceptions of port quality has been uneven: while most Member States’ scores
      rose, Thailand’s post-MPAC downward trend requires further monitoring, particularly given the
      country’s importance to maritime trade.
      More data on port capacity, utilization, and productivity is required to assess the development
      of the maritime sector.

Strategy 5. Establish an integrated multimodal transport system

On order to facilitate regional logistics connectivity and leverage developments in the road,
rail, air, river, and sea transport sectors, MPAC recognizes the need to integrate modes via
linkages. A multi-modal transport system requires seamless integration across land, sea, and
air, to connect the movement of goods across ASEAN. Key actions within this strategy
correspond directly to physical Connectivity strategies 1, 2, and 4, as they relate to developing
sections of the AHN and SKRL as well as upgrading and developing sea ports, particularly
where modes of transport intersect. In addition to these, key components of the envisaged
multimodal transport system include the development of terminal ports of the East West
Economic Corridor at Yangon and Da Nang; the construction of the Dawei sea port and
Mekong Bridge at Neak Loung as important components of the Mekong-India Economic
Corridor; and development of ASEAN dry ports in coordination with the AHN and SKRL.

The statuses of the key actions of physical Connectivity Strategy 5 are as follows:

Indicator and Data Source

Quantitative assessment of development of multimodal transport capability relies on data for
cargo flows passing through modal nodes (e.g. rail-to-sea, air-to-road, dry ports, etc.), which
are currently unavailable. Considering, however, that the aims of developing an integrated
multimodal system are akin to cultivating an efficient and extensive logistics sector, the World
Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) is employed as an overall demonstration of logistics
sector progress. The LPI is constructed using data collected via expert respondent surveys
                                                                                        53
and interview responses along six key dimensions: efficiency of the clearance process; quality
of trade and transport related infrastructure; the ease of arranging competitively priced
shipments; the competence and quality of logistics services; the ability to track and trace
consignments; and timeliness of shipments in reaching destination within the scheduled or
expected delivery time. Data is available for 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2014.

Progress

Since 2007, ASEAN has revealed LPI progress, with increasing scores in overall performance
for nearly every Member State. In the most recent data collection, however, Myanmar, Laos,
Philippines, and Singapore, experienced slight declines from 2012. Cambodia, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Vietnam, on the other hand, have improved LPI standing steadily since 2010.
Despite falling scores for Thailand between 2007 and 2012, the latest measurement period of
2014 shows a reversal and marked improvement.

Considering countries’ LPI scores as a percentage of the highest performer’s score (for the
world) for each year, ASEAN Member States’ improvement is relatively high for 2012 to 2014,
with the exception of Laos, Myanmar, and Philippines. While Singapore’s score fell slightly, it
remains one of the world’s top performers in logistics quality.

‘Quality and competence of the logistics sector’ scores (Figure 38) show that Indonesia,
Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam performed above the 2014 global
average. Score shifts over time are potentially measurement-related (given the nature of
perception-based surveys), making comparison across time periods imprecise. Nevertheless,
some countries experienced slightly decreasing scores, warranting further country-level
industry studies to identify the robustness of results and factors affecting assessments of
performance.

Infrastructure quality (Figure 39) increased generally, including for Myanmar and Singapore,
who experienced slightly decreasing scores in competence and quality. Again, while results
must be interpreted cautiously, this highlights the differentiated issues facing Member States
and potential offsetting of gains by losses in efficiency, traceability, or timeliness.

With respect to logistics infrastructure, it is also germane to MPAC that four Member States –
Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam – demonstrated a significant score increase
between 2012 and 2014, reflecting noticeable improvements in transport infrastructure during
the latter half of the MPAC implementation period. These improvements brought scores for
Indonesia and Vietnam over the global average in 2014 for the first time since 2010. From
these sharp score increases, it is reasonable to infer that MPAC attention to developing
logistics infrastructure has improved assessments of infrastructure quality in these Member
States. Considering the declining patterns evident in assessment of port quality in Thailand
and Cambodia (see physical Strategy 4), the increasing LPI in these same countries would
suggest that logistics improvements may be related to air and land transport and infrastructure
services.

  In Summary
        LPI scores demonstrate that the logistics sector is improving in ASEAN.
        With respect to LPI performance relative to top performers, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia,
        Cambodia, and Indonesia all made significant improvements between 2012 and 2014.
        Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam experienced sharp increases in both logistics quality and
        competence and infrastructure quality scores between 2012 and 2014.
        Cambodia experienced a significant increase in infrastructure quality during the MPAC period.
        Data on cargo flows passing through transport nodes (e.g., air to road, sea to rail) is needed
        to assess growth in multi-modal transport.




                                                                                                      56
Strategy 6. Accelerate the development of ICT Infrastructure and services

The development of a robust and extensive information and telecommunications sector is
critical to regional economic growth and competitiveness as well as human development and
the creation of a culturally and socially connected ASEAN Community. While Internet usage
and mobile telecommunications coverage have risen steadily over the past fifteen years, the
MPAC attends to reducing the “digital divide” within Member States in order to improve trade
infrastructure and promote equitable development. The set of priority MPAC ICT projects
includes the ASEAN Broadband Corridor (ABC), the Melaka-Pekan Baru Interconnection, and
the West Kalimantan-Sarawak Interconnection.

Indicator and Data Source

While ICT infrastructure includes fixed, mobile, and satellite communication networks in
addition to the Internet, Internet usage and mobile telecommunications connectivity are useful,
broad-covering proxies of citizen ICT connectedness. Thus, the growth of Internet users per
100 inhabitants 23 and mobile telephone subscription rates are employed herein. Internet data
is drawn from the International Telecommunications Union’s (ITU) database, which provides
annual data up to 2013, and mobile telephony data is sourced from the Global
Competitiveness Indicators, up to the 2014-2015 reporting period.

Progress

Internet connectivity continues to rise steadily in ASEAN, with growth rates naturally declining
in highly connected regions as the space for expansion contracts.

While Cambodia’s Internet usage rate remains very low compared to other ASEAN Member
States, as well as low-income countries, coverage and the rate of growth in coverage have
increased significantly since 2011, with rates increasing from less than 1% in 2010-2011 to
nearly 6% in 2014-2015. Myanmar’s coverage remains at just over 1% of the population.

Mobile telephone subscription rates are high and increasing for all ASEAN Member States,
with rates amongst ASEAN-5 exceeding or nearly reaching those of the global average for
upper middle-income countries by 2014-2015. ASEAN’s average mobile subscription rates
experienced a sharp increase during between the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 recording
periods, during the midpoint of MPAC implementation.

   In Summary
        While ICT Connectivity has increased for all countries, Philippines and Cambodia have
        demonstrated the most apparent increases in Internet user growth rates during MPAC.
        There is insufficient data to detect any change in Internet coverage in Laos and Myanmar due
        to the limitation of the time series to only two periods.
        Cambodia experienced a clear and significant increase in mobile telephone subscriptions since
        MPAC implementation.
        ASEAN mapping of mobile network coverage would supplement knowledge about the status of
        access to mobile telecommunications.




                                                                                                     59
Strategy 7. Prioritize processes to resolve institutional issues in energy
infrastructure

The transmission and trade of energy, a critical input to economic activity in the region, is
captured in two major initiatives that comprise the MPAC’s energy infrastructure connectivity
strategy, namely the Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline (TAGP) and the ASEAN Power Grid (APG).
These two key actions are united under the general goal of supplying sufficient power amongst
and within ASEAN Member States to support economic and demographic growth. The
integration of electricity and gas networks is aimed at capturing emergent benefits in terms of
energy security, flexibility, and consistency             Figure 45. APG Priority Project Map
and quality of supply.

Within Strategy 7, two priority projects of
the APG have been marked for rapid
implementation. These are the Melaka -
Pekan Baru Interconnection (IMT-GT) and
the       West      Kalimantan        -    Sarawak
Interconnection (BIMP-EAGA).

Indicator and Data Source

In addition to APG and TAGP project updates, the progress of energy sector integration may
be proxied by the growth rates of electricity and gas trade across borders. As such, we employ
the export and import of electricity and gas between ASEAN trading partners as indications of
the region’s capacity to freely trade energy amongst Member States.

Data on the growth of energy exports and imports within ASEAN is sourced from World Bank
World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) and UN COMTRADE database up to 2013. 24
Significant bilateral import-export data asymmetries are observed in the data, likely due to
differences in the recording approaches for electricity and gas applied by Member States
(some of which may be resolved over time with further harmonization of national practices) as
well as recording differences due to lack of customs or statistical declarations. As such, export
and import data are both provided.




24   The preferred data source, ASEANStats data, is not used since data is available only to 2011.
                                                                                                     60
Progress

Project updates on key energy activities have been gathered from World Bank country
consultations, as well as a May 2015 update from the Heads of ASEAN Power Utilities /
Authorities (HAPUA). HAPUA reported revised dates for the earliest expected commercial
operation dates (COD) for each interconnection on the ASEAN Power Grid (APG).

In addition to a fair outlook on expected CODs, World Bank consultations also found that
progress has been good with respect to constructing APG interconnections. Upon completion
of the set of projects currently under construction, the APG will link all Member States within
the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS), excepting connections between Laos-Vietnam and
Laos-Cambodia. The latter connection will be established, however, if current plans for
construction are implemented. Electricity transmission connections amongst Malaysia –
Indonesia – Brunei will also be strengthened by the completion of the two energy priority

projects, the Melaka – Pekan Baru Interconnection and Sarawak – Kalimantan
Interconnection, as well as the Sarawak – Sabah – Brunei link.

Data on Intra-ASEAN trade flows for electricity similarly reflect notable progress. Both
electricity imports and exports for the 2007 to 2013 period have increased (excepting a slight
export decline from 2011 to 2012), with noticeable increases from 2012 to 2013. These trade
increases are likely to continue as more of the APG projects reach completion, but further
tracking of import and export data is necessary to detect whether a sustained shift in the
growth rates of electricity imports and exports is experienced following implementation.

in the near-term.

Despite limited progress on the TAGP, gas trade as increased since MPAC implementation,
with a sharp increase in import values after 2010. This was largely due to the Singapore’s
entrance as a key gas importer in 2011.

   In Summary
         Growth is apparent in electricity trade, with increases in the growth of international electricity
         imports and exports following MPAC implementation. These are expected to rise as more APG
         projects are implemented.
         While the APG has been progressing apace, much of the growth in electricity trade was
         nevertheless between Thailand and Laos, delinked from the APG.
         Limited progress has been made with respect to developing the TAGP. Nevertheless, Intra-
         ASEAN imports in the natural gas sector grew significantly between 2010 and 2013. Further
         monitoring of gas trade data is required to determine whether growth will level in the periods
         following.




                                                                                                            63
2.2 Institutional Connectivity Performance

The MPAC institutional Connectivity strategies propose agreements, processes, and legal and
institutional mechanisms to facilitate trade in goods and services, reduce non-tariff barriers,
facilitate the movement of people within ASEAN, and promote increased productivity and
investments amongst Member States. Whereas physical indicators describe the “hardware”
of ASEAN Connectivity, the “software”, including harmonization of processes and standards,
implementation of rules and systems to facilitate trade and transit, and elimination of barriers
to Connectivity, are equally as important to building an ASEAN Community.

While two of the institutional Connectivity strategies are somewhat delinked from infrastructure
development (i.e., facilitating intra-ASEAN investment and improving coordination capacity),
most complement and/or underpin one or more physical Connectivity strategies. These inter-
linkages are critical to broader goals of economic growth and equitable development, and are
the subject of Chapter III on physical and institutional impacts on mobility, trade, and GDP.

Strategy 1. Operationalize the 3 Framework Agreements on Transport
Facilitation (AFAFGIT; AFAFIST; AFAMT)

Regional economic integration has been a priority for ASEAN since the early 1990s, coded in
several treaties and agreements bringing trade integration to the ASEAN agenda. 25 The
creation of a single market and production base, as envisaged in the ASEAN Economic
Community Blueprint, depends on building an integrated transport network and supportive
institutional arrangements, including the reduction of barriers to intra-regional trade.

Recognizing the high transaction costs associated with transiting across national borders,
ASEAN adopted three initiatives to facilitate trade, whose operationalization has become a
priority under MPAC. These include the 1998 ASEAN Framework Agreement on the
Facilitation of Goods in Transit (AFAFGIT); the 2009 ASEAN Framework Agreement on the
Facilitation of Inter-State Transport (AFAFIST); and the 2005 ASEAN Framework Agreement
on Multimodal Transport (AFAMT). These trade measures recognize that attaining the goals
of the AEC depends not only on enhancing connectivity via roads, railways, and air and sea
networks, but also on creating supportive rules and processes that govern access to these
transportation resources and remove barriers to the efficient and effective use of existing and
new transit routes. For example, national rules may preclude border crossing by trucks,

25
   These include the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS),
the ASEAN Agreement for Promotion and Protection of Investment (IGA), and the Framework Agreement on the
ASEAN Investment Agreement (AIA), all signed in the 1990s.
                                                                                                     64
requiring unloading and reloading at borders, and requiring up to four customs procedures to
cross a country lying between origin and destination.

Considering the high costs attributable to rules governing international trade and requirements
at border crossings, Member States adopted these frameworks for operationalization by 2015.
The AFAFGIT was signed in December 1998, with the objective of eliminating burdensome
customs procedures in road and rail transport. As stipulated in Article 4, “goods carried in
sealed road vehicles, a combination of vehicles, or a container shall not be subjected to
examination at Customs offices in route,” with some exceptions.

The ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Inter-State Transport (AFAFIST) was
signed in 2009, to allow ASEAN transport operators to provide services in other Member
States when goods are transported from or to the country of registration. Together with the
AFAFGIT, the AFAFIST is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of transit transport
by eliminating the need to unload and reload goods at national borders.

The ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport (AFAMT) was signed in 2005,
to determine the legal liability of multimodal transport operators and standardize multimodal
transport contracts. The AFAMT applies to international multimodal transport services
amongst ASEAN countries provided by officially registered ASEAN operators, thereby
requiring domestic legislation on multimodal transport.

Progress

As stipulated in the 2005-2010 ATAP and 2007 AEC Blueprint, the AFAFGIT was planned for
implementation by 2009, contingent on the conclusion of Protocols 2 (designation of frontier
posts) and 7 (customs transit system). Protocol 6 (railways border and interchange stations)
was signed in 2011 and is awaiting ratification by Member States. The main text of the
AFAFIST was schedule for finalization and adoption in 2009, with implementation beginning
in 2011 for ASEAN-wide implementation by 2015. As for the AFAMT, ASEAN Member States
mandated supportive domestic legislation by 2009. AFAMT was scheduled in at least in two
Member States by 2011, with ASEAN-wide implementation to be completed by 2013.

Due to the breadth of this strategy and its legislative nature, we rely on measures of Intra-
regional trade intensity and trade models described in Chapter III, as well as related indicators
for physical Connectivity Strategies 1 and 5 and institutional Connectivity Strategies 5, 7, and
8 to extricate indications of progress in facilitating trade within ASEAN.



                                                                                              65
The assessment of physical Connectivity Strategy 1 (ASEAN Highway Network) shows good
progress with respect to the upgrading and maintenance of TTRs, as stipulated in the
AFAFGIT, and physical Connectivity Strategy 5 (Developing the multimodal transport system)
suggests increasing performance in logistics quality and competence. More salient are the
indicators for institutional Connectivity Strategies 5, 6, and 8, which detail progress on trade
facilitation and customs and exhibit reductions in time and costs to import and export and
increased efficiency of border crossings across ASEAN (see section 2.3, Strategies 5, 7, 8).

With respect to goods trade and the creation of a united production and distribution system,
patterns in ASEAN trade reflect a downward trend in intra-regional trade intensity. This is not
to say, however, that ASEAN is suffering a regression with respect to integration. Indeed, the
physical and institutional dimensions of Connectivity that apply to the transit and trade of
goods across borders are also promoting extra-ASEAN trade Connectivity. Considering
ASEAN’s pursuit of an open regionalism strategy and the high multiplier effects of trade
partners like China, India, and OECD on ASEAN GDP (see Section 3.4), this pattern is
acceptable and merely reflects a more rapid integration with global markets. Further, market-
related, non-Connectivity drivers of the increased proportion of trade with non-ASEAN
partners may, in fact, be offset by trade increases derived from MPAC initiatives.

Nevertheless, measures of trade intensity are relevant to the discussion of ASEAN
Connectivity, both regionally and globally. Here, we present one measure of trade intensity:
the Intra-ASEAN Trade Intensity Index. The Intra-ASEAN Trade Intensity Index (IA-TII) is a
measure of trade openness that is more internationally comparable than other indicators
employed for similar purposes, due to lesser size dependence of the measures of integration.
It is the ratio of the intraregional trade share (out of total country trade) to the share of world
trade with the country or region (out of total world trade).

Nevertheless, measures of trade intensity are relevant to the discussion of ASEAN
Connectivity, both regionally and globally. Here, we present one measure of trade intensity:
the Intra-ASEAN Trade Intensity Index. The Intra-ASEAN Trade Intensity Index (IA-TII) is a
measure of trade openness that is more internationally comparable than other indicators
employed for similar purposes, due to lesser size dependence of the measures of integration.
It is the ratio of the intraregional trade share (out of total country trade) to the share of world
trade with the country or region (out of total world trade).

This de-intensification of Intra-ASEAN simply points to a change in the relative regional
intensity to the linkages between Member States and external engines of growth. Given the
results of SVAR analysis in Section 3.4, this should not necessarily be a cause for concern,
but could warrant a refocusing on lagging areas of MPAC implementation, as well as keen
attendance to the policy levers within ASEAN that appear to be more salient to economic
growth (See Chapter 3). These include positive projected economic impacts from connecting
ASEAN to bordering markets such as China and India (See GSM, Section 3.1). Degrees of
trade, communications, institutional, and social connectivity are exposited in detail hereafter,
via application of a number of direct and proxy indicators for each. An assessment of patterns
in trade and transport integration would benefit from the study of regional supply chains and
changes in the linkages therein over periods of Connectivity policy implementation.




  In Summary
  Whilst ASEAN trade intensity is decreasing, trade integration within the region is rising. The results
  demonstrate relatively higher integration of ASEAN states into the global economy. These results
  are in line with the results of SVAR multiplier effects analysis in Section 3.

Strategy 2. Implement initiatives to facilitate inter-state passenger land
transportation

MPAC proposes the expansion of road and rail connections not only for merchandise trade,
but also for people mobility. Facilitating land travel amongst ASEAN Member States promotes
travel and tourism, a key contributing industry in all ASEAN economies (Athanasopoulou
2013). MPAC recognized key challenges to transit across land borders, including restrictions
on entry of motor vehicles, inconsistent customs clearance procedures, and restrictive visa
requirements. In response, the GMS signed a Cross Border Transport Agreement (CBTA) to
facilitate cross-border transport for both goods and people; BIMP-EAGA implemented a
Memorandum of Understanding on Cross Border Movement for Buses and Coaches; and
several Member States entered into bilateral agreements to improve cross-border mobility of
passenger vehicles.

Indicator and Data Source

The growth of passenger land border crossings into ASEAN Member States is employed to
reflect shifts in inter-state passenger land transportation as well as proxy the results of
developments in border mobility initiatives. Passenger land arrivals data includes arrivals by
car, bicycle, bus, hitchhiking, coach, and motorcycle. Data is sourced from Euromonitor
International market research on travel and tourism, with annual observations to 2013.

Progress

International passenger land arrivals to ASEAN experienced a marked increase for several
Member States during the MPAC implementation period, though the growth rate of arrivals for
the region overall did not increase after 2011. The average growth rate for land arrivals in the
period 2005-2010 was 5.8% compared to an average of 4.9% for 2011-2013.

Growth rates of land arrivals did appreciate noticeably for some countries, however.
Myanmar’s growth averaged an annual 3.6% for the period from 2005-2010, as compared to
a massive 48.0% for the post-MPAC period between 2011 and 2013. Similarly, Cambodia’s
average growth rates rose from 18.0% to 25.1% pre- and post-MPAC, and Thailand’s
increased from 5.8% to 13.7% for the same two periods.

Examining Member States with lower scales 26 of international land transit volumes, the pattern
of increased transit following MPAC implementation holds. Countries with mid-range land
passenger volumes, including Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, all experienced notably
higher levels of land transit following 2010. So too, have low-volume countries, most notably
Myanmar, experienced sharp increases. More field research, and qualitative data collection is
needed to determine the factors behind these shifts.

      In Summary
          While land arrivals for ASEAN have increased steadily since 2000, the annual growth rate of
          international passenger arrivals decreased after MPAC implementation, from an average 5.8%
          over the period 2005-2010 to an average 4.9% for 2011-2013.
          Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar experienced noticeable growth increases after MPAC
          implementation, suggesting positive effect of MPAC on transit to those Member States.

Strategy 3. Develop the ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASAM)

Key MPAC actions associated with creating an ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASAM) include
the ratification and implementation of a series of agreements for liberalization of air freight and
passenger services, with an eye to meet the requirements of the ASEAN Roadmap for
Integration of the Air Travel Sector (RIATS) by 2015. The key actions of ASAM, stipulated in
MPAC are listed in Table 7.

Under MAFLPAS, Member State airlines were afforded unlimited third and fourth freedom air
traffic rights between ASEAN cities by June 2010, and unlimited fifth freedom rights by June
2013, establishing the basis for the ASEAN Open Sky Policy. Reflecting on global experiences
with similar air liberalization policies, the ASEAN Open Sky Policy is couched as an integral
element for achievement of the ASEAN Community and is expected to significantly enhance
international trade and people-to-people Connectivity. The RIATS agreements and protocols
were signed in May 2009, and the MAFLAFS has already entered into force with all Member
States except for Indonesia, which has ratified neither the main text nor its protocols.

Indicator and Data Source

Indicators of progress in the air transport sector draw on data on Intra-ASEAN passenger
arrivals, Intra-ASEAN flight cargo capacities, and the Quality of Air Transport Infrastructure.
Changes in the first two – passenger and cargo capacity – are proxy measures of tourism and
air trade growth as well as air transit liberalization. While growth in air traffic is contingent on
a number of factors, the rules governing air services and the opening of new routes are
undoubtedly an important determinant of passenger and cargo flows. Data for these indicators

                                                                                                      70
is sourced from the DiiO Aviation Intelligence database, via the World Bank’s Transport
Practice unit, with monthly data available up to year-end 2014. The database records air
passenger seat availability, which may be used as a direct indication of passenger demand
and access within ASEAN, for travel to other Member States.

A lesser but nevertheless significant determinant of competitiveness and quality in ASEAN air
transport services is perceptions data on Quality of Air Transport Infrastructure from the World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), available up to the 2014-2015
reporting period. Based on expert respondent assessments of air transport infrastructure,
countries are scored from 1 (extremely underdeveloped) to 7 (extensive and efficient – among
the best in the world).

Progress

Air Passenger Capacity

Data on monthly and annual air passenger capacity for intra-ASEAN international flights
indicates steady growth since 2005, with a noticeable surge since 2011. This surge in air travel
and transport within the region follows on directly from MAAS implementation and ratification
of MAFLPAS.

Figure 53 demonstrates this shift in growth rates to faster growth of Intra-ASEAN arrivals in
2011-2014 as compared to the pre-MPAC period.

Air Infrastructure Quality

While the primary airports of ASEAN Member States are generally deemed sufficient in terms
of runway lengths to accommodate existing operation, some face problems with respect to
providing sufficient support services and facilities, including number of runways and
warehouse capacity. These factors will become increasingly important in the face of
anticipated air transport growth.

This should be a focal attention point for the sector and Member States, particularly since air
transport infrastructure quality scores have not appreciably increased since MPAC (Figure
58), and in consideration of the high-profile concerns over air safety following a number of
incidents in 2014. Nevertheless, since air cargo and passenger flows have increased despite



                                                                                                               73
limited infrastructure improvement, these results also reinforce the importance of institutional
factors to the development of the air transport sectors.

   In Summary
       Growth rates of Intra-ASEAN air passenger and air cargo flows have increased significantly
       since MPAC, suggesting direct impact on development in the air transport sector.
       Despite limited progress in the quality of air transport infrastructure, air passenger and cargo
       flows have increasingly risen following ASAM, suggesting the relatively greater importance of
       institutional factors to physical factors in determining air transit flows.

Strategy 4. Develop an ASEAN Single Shipping Market

In addition to the physical aspects of maritime connectivity, MPAC and the 2011-2015 ASEAN
Strategic Transport Plan (ASTP) envisage the creation of an ASEAN Single Shipping Market
(ASSM), based on “rationalization, synchronization, liberalization and harmonization of
shipping services and trade procedures” (ERIA Study Team 2010). The liberal shipping
environment envisaged in ASSM applies primarily to global networks, as domestic shipping
services remain protected under the Cabotage Policy.

The MPAC and ASTP specify that Member States create a set of concrete actions by 2009
for 2015 implementation, with an eye to enhance regional maritime performance and cargo
handling capacity and increase integration into global shipping networks. The rationalization
of regional management and regulation of sea shipping has been slower than expected,
however. The ASSM implementation study reached conclusion only in 2013. An ASSM task
force was established at the 19th ASEAN Transport Ministers meeting in December 2013 to
promote further formulation and implementation of ASSM.

Indicator and Data Source

While the ASSM has not yet reached full implementation, the Liner Shipping Connectivity
Index (LSCI) is presented as a measure of ASEAN Member States’ connectivity to global
shipping networks. The LSCI is based on assessment of five components of the maritime
transport sector: number of ships, container-carrying capacity, maximum vessel size, number
of services, and number of companies that deploy container ships in a country's ports. A
country’s score is a measure of relative performance against the best scores for each
subcomponent and the overall LSCI score in base year 2004.

Progress

Even prior to ASSM implementation, changes in ASEAN LSCI scores over the past ten years
demonstrate steady growth in sea connectivity, most prominently for Singapore, Malaysia,
and Vietnam. During the MPAC implementation period, specifically, indicator performance
increased significantly for Vietnam in the early phase only (2010 to 2011), whereas Singapore
and Malaysia exhibit steady growth over the period at rates comparable to the pre-MPAC

Amongst mid-range LSCI countries (i.e. Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam), shipping
connectivity increased limitedly, with the exception of Vietnam. Vietnam’s sharp increase from
2009 to 2011 mirrors port developments discussed in Section 2.2, but the country experienced
a decline after 2012, resuming the prior trend.

Myanmar experienced upward growth over the MPAC period, particularly following 2011. A
scan of the current status of ASSM-relevant rules on foreign ownership, access, port
productivity and efficiency, and local content laws would provide helpful qualitative data to
contextualize the degree of shipping liberalization.


   In Summary
              Vietnam and Myanmar are the only two Member States to have appreciably increased liner
              shipping connectivity following MPAC.
              Additional data on status of maritime liberalization and shipping harmonization measures
              would provide valuable qualitative inputs to assess the degree of attainment of ASSM.

Strategy 5. Accelerate the free flow of goods within ASEAN
Strategy 7. Improve trade facilitation in the region
Strategy 8. Enhance border management capabilities

Institutional strategies 5, 7, and 8 share the common purpose of facilitating trade and reducing
barriers in the region in order to deepen the integration of ASEAN’s production and distribution
bases and reduce high transaction costs associated with cross-border transit. While nuanced
in their specific intentions, the measurements of progress in each depend on a common set
of proxy indicators and are, thus, discussed in tandem.

The indicators employed (time and cost to import/exports; amount of documentation required
for import/export; and the efficiency of clearance processes) together demonstrate progress
towards creating seamless transportation of goods across borders. This goal necessitates
reducing trade frictions and transaction costs associated with excessive documentation,
disharmony amongst customs and systems, and inefficiencies in border management.
Additionally, the status of National Single Windows (NSWs) projects is reviewed to provide
context to some of the priority institutional projects aimed at improving trade facilitation.

Indicators and Data Source

Assessment of trade facilitation and border management improvements relies on several
proxy indicators. The first set of indicators draws on the World Bank’s Doing Business dataset
for Trading Across Borders, which measures time and cost (excluding tariffs) associated with
exporting and importing a standardized cargo of goods, as well as the number of documents
required to import and export. Data is based on surveys of local freight forwarders, shipping
lines, customs brokers, port officials and banks. The overall scoring of economies on Trading
Across Borders is recorded as the Distance to Frontier –the distance of each country’s score
to the highest performer for each indicator. Observations are made annually, up to 2013.

The second proxy attends to the efficiency of the border clearance process. This data is
sourced from the Logistic Performance Index (LPI) semi-annual measures of ‘Efficiency of
clearance’, up to 2014.

Progress

The Trading Across Borders topic attends directly to the national and sub-national regulatory
impacts on the speed and cost of international trade. National performance is weighed against
the “frontier” – the best performance for that particular indicator for each year – and recorded

                                                                                                77
as the percentage of attainment of the best score. All ASEAN countries have closed the gap
to the frontier of Trading Across Borders performance since 2006, with the most noticeable
increases in Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.

The figure below demonstrates that, since 2011, nearly every country (except Singapore, who
remains steadily near the frontier) has experienced a step change in performance in line with
implementation of MPAC key actions, including progress towards National Single Windows
and cross-border trade facilitation measures.

Focusing further on the sub-components of the Trading Across Borders scores, Figure 62
demonstrates that the durations of time required to export goods from ASEAN Member States
has fallen consistently over the past ten years, with the most significant reductions in time in
Thailand, Cambodia, and Lao PDR. With further implementation of National Single Windows
and customs harmonization, these export times are expected to decrease further.

The AEC Blueprint prioritized National Single Windows (NSW) projects to streamline
international clearance via a system enabling single submission and processing of customs
data. Currently, Singapore and Malaysia have fully implemented NSWs. The 2013 ASEAN
Integration Monitoring Report provided NSW status updates as follows:

Table 8. Status of NSWs

The National Single Windows, border management procedure harmonization, and reduction
of non-tariff barriers related to clearance appear to have improved the efficiency of clearance
in a number of countries. Figure 63 demonstrates that LPI measures for ‘Efficiency of the
clearance process’ have improved for all ASEAN Member States except Singapore, which
nevertheless remains a top performer in border management and maintains a consistently
high efficiency score. Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and to a lesser extent,
Vietnam, experienced the most drastic score increases from 2012 to 2014.

   In Summary
       The Doing Business Trading Across Borders scores demonstrate increases from 2011/2012
       onwards for nearly every State, indicating reduced burdens with respect to documentation
       required, as well as reduced time and costs associated with international trade. This is
       especially apparent for Brunei, Laos, and Philippines, who experienced the sharpest score
       increases.
       Laos has made significant progress with respect to reducing the days required to export, from
       36 in 2011 to 23 in 2014.
       LPI scores for Efficiency of the Clearance Process have improved significantly for Cambodia,
       Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand since 2012, and to a lesser extent in Vietnam.

Strategy 6. Accelerate the development of an efficient and competitive
logistics sector, in particular transport, telecommunications and other
connectivity related services in the region

In 1995, ASEAN Member States endorsed the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services
(AFAS), which set out to liberalize financial, air transport, tourism, logistics, e-ASEAN, and
healthcare services in order to improve efficiency and competitiveness of services within and
outside ASEAN, eliminate restrictions on trade in services, and expand liberalization beyond
GATS, with the end aim of a regional free trade area for trade in services. Parameters and
targets were set in the AEC Blueprint, with the goal to eliminate restrictions on air transport
and tourism by 2010, logistics by 2013, and all services by 2015.

The MPAC focuses both on liberalizing investments (see Section 2.2, strategy 9) as well as
improving the quality and efficiency of Connectivity-related services, including logistics and
communications. With respect to the liberalization of transport and logistics, the Roadmap for
Integration of Logistics Services (RILS) was endorsed in 2008 to enhance competitiveness of
logistics services, including cargo handling, storage and warehousing, freight transport,
courier, packaging, and custom clearance services. The MPAC recognized that, while
substantial liberalization would be needed to create a unified production and distribution base,
several key challenges included domestic regulations and protectionism, as well as improving
the quality of services within ASEAN.

With respect to liberalization, the 2013 ASEAN Integration Monitoring Report recognized good
progress amongst Member States in implementing scheduled liberalizations under the AEC
Blueprint, aside from some delays related to eliminating restrictions on foreign investment.
Additionally, progress has been good in liberalizing the logistics sector in Brunei, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar. Even Singapore, which committed fewer
subsectors for services trade liberalization, has made advanced commitments in
telecommunications, and Malaysia and the Philippines liberalized their telecommunications
markets in the late 1990s. The challenge remains to fully capture the efficiency and quality
gains expected from liberalization, while promoting quality in services within ASEAN.

Performance Index indicator for ‘Competence of service providers’, which is available from
the World Bank’s LPI database with semi-annual observations to 2014.

Progress

ASEAN trade in services data demonstrate a general increase in Intra-ASEAN trade for both
transportation and ICT services over the past 10 years, with a significant increase in
transportation services trade after MPAC implementation, though this may also be applicable
to post-Financial Crisis recovery.

While Intra-ASEAN trade in communications services has grown slowly (with no appreciable
impact since 2011), transportation integration is more pronounced (Figure 64): following a
decrease after the Global Financial Crisis, transport services trade within ASEAN increased
significantly. Further monitoring is needed to determine whether this is a sustained growth
shift or a reversion to a prior growth trend.

Growth in services trade increased more outside of ASEAN than within, however. Shares of
Intra-ASEAN exports in transportation and communications services as portions of world
exports in each sector have fallen slightly since 2005, indicating relatively higher growth in
services exports to regions outside ASEAN.

2012 scores reveal that Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand had median levels
of maritime trade restrictiveness (scores of 50), but much less restrictive air transport sectors.
Conversely, Vietnam and Cambodia were assessed as having median levels of air transport
restrictiveness and low maritime restrictiveness (scores of 15 and 7.5, respectively). Amongst
measured          countries,    Malaysia,           Indonesia,         and             Cambodia    had      less     restrictive
telecommunications industries than Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines.

Transportation Services

As depicted in Figure 67, Intra-ASEAN transportation services exports increased significantly
after the Crisis, though the growth rate of transportation service exports and imports
decreased after 2010 and 2011, respectively. As such additional monitoring is needed to
detect the presence or absence of a growth trend change.

ICT Services

Intra-ASEAN trade in ICT services has also increased over the past ten years, with a notable
increase in the growth rate of exports following 2010, coinciding with MPAC implementation
(Figure 72). Nevertheless, this upswing was followed by a decline in 2013, necessitating
further tracking to determine the path of growth for the latter half of the MPAC period.

  In Summary
       The growth rate of transportation services has been fairly congruent before and after MPAC
       implementation, though some States, namely Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, and
       Myanmar saw increased exports (Intra- and Extra-ASEAN exports).
       Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam have experienced the most notable
       improvements in LPI scores for Quality and Competence of logistics service providers.
       The growth rate of Intra-ASEAN ICT services exports increased during the first year of MPAC
       implementation, but decreased between 2012 and 2013. More recent data is required to
       discern the presence or absence of a trend shift in growth.


                                                                                                        86
Strategy 9. Accelerate opening of ASEAN Member States to investments within
and beyond the region

ASEAN Member States have performed well with respect to attracting foreign direct
investment (FDI) over the past twenty years, and ASEAN Integration has further helped attract
FDI from both outside and within the region. The MPAC recognizes that economic benefits
from ASEAN Connectivity and Integration will be best attained and enhanced by increased
investments from domestic, regional, and extra-ASEAN sources, placing an emphasis on the
need to attract more investment into the region. Efforts to improve the investment climate are
also closely linked to physical and institutional Connectivity initiatives that improve the flow of
goods and services and thus boost profitability, along with AEC efforts to create fair and stable
investment regimes. Indeed, improved ASEAN Connectivity has played a key role in drawing
FDI to the region, though FDI destinations remain highly concentrated in particular areas
(World Bank 2014).

Inflows to ASEAN rose by nearly 7% in 2013 to US$122 billion. The rapid growth of FDI inflows
following the Financial Crisis up to 2012 has slowed, but ASEAN nevertheless remains the
largest recipient of FDI relative to GDP in Asia Pacific. Between 1952 and 2012, Singapore
accounts for more than half of total FDI to the region (52%), followed by Thailand (13%),
Indonesia (11%), Malaysia (10%), Vietnam (8%), and the Philippines (3%) (World Bank 2014).
Despite the importance of FDI to ASEAN economic growth, many Member States restrict
foreign equity, an issue that will continue to require attention and deliberation by Member
States. Experiences in ASEAN indicate that FDI increases when countries relax foreign
ownership restrictions, yielding significant economic benefits.

Indicator and Data Source

The opening of ASEAN Member States to investments from within and outside of the region
is assessed via the growth of and comparison between FDI inflows from Extra- and Intra-
ASEAN sources. Data is drawn from ASEAN Statistics on Intra-ASEAN and Extra-ASEAN FDI
inflows to ASEAN, with annual records from 2000 to 2013.

Progress

Total foreign investments in ASEAN rose from US$41 billion in 2005, to USD$76 billion in
2010 and US$122 billion in 2013. Nevertheless, FDI growth slowed over the early MPAC
implementation period from 28% in 2011, to 17.2% in 2012, and 6.7% in 2013. Growth in Intra-
ASEAN investments has risen steadily since 2009, with growth of 24% in 2011 and 36% in
                                                                                                87
2012, until shrinking to 3% in 2013. The proportion of ASEAN FDI inflows from within the
region to total FDI inflows has also risen since MPAC, from 13.8% in 2009, ranging from 15.6%
to 18.1% following MPAC implementation.

  inflows

The proportion of Intra-ASEAN FDI to other ASEAN countries rose sharply in 2002 and again
in 2008 as Extra-ASEAN investments fell, bringing total inflows downwards. Since MPAC
implementation, however, the proportion of Intra-ASEAN investments within overall inflows
has risen (2010 onwards) even with as Extra-ASEAN inflows have risen, indicating the further
opening of ASEAN Member States to ASEAN investment sources and increased regional
investment liberalization. In other words, the structure of ASEAN FDI has shifted to include an
increasing proportion of FDI flows originating from within ASEAN.

Figure 76 demonstrates that Intra-ASEAN inflows rose steadily since the 2009 Financial
Crisis, but coincidence of MPAC implementation and global economic recovery requires that
additional data be collected and econometric modeling be employed to isolate MPAC’s role in
the growth rate increase between 2009 and 2012.

 experienced the most significant increases in their growth rates of FDI.

Strategy 10. Strengthen institutional capacity within the region and improve
regional-sub-regional coordination of policies, programs, and projects

Measuring institutional capacity and the degree of regional coordination of MPAC policies,
programs, and projects is an inevitably complex task for two reasons. For one, considering
the diverse technical and bureaucratic inputs needed to effectively implement the many
differentiated activities associated with each of the 19 MPAC strategies, it is difficult to define
a set of measurable capacities that are both specific enough to MPAC to be meaningful, but
general enough to apply to the governance and coordination of the MPAC program as a whole.
Second, measuring regional-sub-regional coordination necessitates either activity-level
assessment, which is not within the scope of this evaluation exercise, or MPAC-specific expert
survey data, which is not currently part of the monitoring program.

Existing indicators such as the World Governance Indicators (WGI) measure of Government
Effectiveness confirm that institutions and governance capacities tend to change slowly.
Further, abstraction to the national level does little to describe the formulation, coordination,
implementation, and evaluation capacities as they apply specifically to MPAC activities.

national, sub-regional, and regional Connectivity-related policies, and coordination between
Member States. The ACCC could further take stock of the flow of technical assistance and
training events or collaboration specifically geared to building bureaucratic capacity in relevant
agencies.

  In Summary
        Measuring institutional capacity and coordinating success with respect to MPAC activities
        requires utilization of qualitative data gathered at the project levels.


                                                                                                        90
2.3 People to People Connectivity Performance

The MPAC recognizes Community-building and increased appreciation of the growing
interrelatedness amongst the peoples of ASEAN as integral to physical and institutional
Connectivity and regional integration. MPAC goals for people-to-people Connectivity center
on initiatives that progress the intercultural and social aspects of ASEAN Community-building,
including investments in education and human resources, programs that promote innovation
and entrepreneurship across ASEAN, and tourism and cultural exchange. Priority MPAC
projects include easing visa requirements to promote people mobility across the region,
developing ASEAN education exchanges, strengthening Intra-ASEAN tourism, and
developing skills amongst the peoples of ASEAN.

Strategy 1. Promote deeper intra-ASEAN social and cultural understanding

People-to-people strategy 1 is largely education-oriented and seeks to promote cultural and
social exchange amongst the peoples of ASEAN via ASEAN-focused curricula, educational
exchanges, virtual learning resource centers, ASEAN language programs, and ICT
engagement across ASEAN borders. As such, proxy assessment of promoting deeper social
ties is based on dispersion of students across the ASEAN region.

Indicator and Data Source

The indicator used to proxy deeper intra-ASEAN social and cultural understanding is the
number of students from ASEAN countries enrolled in tertiary education programs in other
ASEAN Member States for each year. Intra-ASEAN international student data comes from the
UNESCO UIS databank, which includes data on international student flows up to 2012. The
indicator, ‘Inbound internationally mobile students’ gives the headcount of students to a
country, by country. Data is available for Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, and
Vietnam. Since records for many countries are only sporadically reported, however, it is
difficult to generalize trends across ASEAN for all years. Moving forward, it would also be
interesting to evaluate patterns in voice calls and data exchanges between ASEAN economic
centers to measure the intensity of communication across the region.

Progress

The number of ASEAN international students studying abroad has increased for all reporting
countries, though Indonesia, Laos, and Malaysia appear to have experienced slight declines



                                                                                           91
in international student participation in 2010 and 2011. Due to data discrepancies and missing
observations, however, these declines may be reflective of reporting problems.

   In Summary
          International student exchange and the matriculation of tertiary students throughout ASEAN
          remains a key and underutilized opportunity for building people-to-people Connectivity. In
          the early years of MPAC implementation, the amount of tertiary international students from
          with ASEAN did not appreciably increase, and in fact decreased in many States.
          Increased data is required to assess student mobility beyond 2012.

                                                                                                                         92
Strategy 2. Encourage greater intra-ASEAN people mobility

In addition to freeing the flow of goods, services, and capital, MPAC envisages and ASEAN
where professional mobility is freed to allocate labor efficiently and promote regional tourism.
Development of Intra-ASEAN tourism links to both ASEAN Community-building efforts as well
as economic development of an important regional industry.

As for labor mobility, while data on bilateral labor flows is currently unavailable for ASEAN,
there has been some noted progress with respect to increasing professional mobility. Member
States have signed eight Mutual Recognition Arrangements for select professions, including
engineering, architecture, accountancy, surveying, nursing, dental and medical practitioners,
and tourism. Further, the ASEAN Agreement on the Movement of Natural Persons was signed
in November 2012 to accelerate the movement of skilled professionals (ASEAN Secretariat
and The World Bank 2013). To track labor mobility, it would be desirable to create an ASEAN
dataset on bilateral labor flows. Example applications are works on social security and ASEAN
migration (Pasadilla 2011) and the World Bank migration dataset (Ratha and Shaw 2007).

  In Summary
       There has been good progress in increasing tourism flows in ASEAN, with the growth rate of
       Intra-ASEAN international passenger arrivals increasing following MPAC implementation from
       previous year-over-year growth of an average 7.2% between 2006-2010, to a post-MPAC
       average of 10.5% between 2011 and 2014.
       More data is required on international skilled and unskilled labor flows to assess this
       dimension of mobility.

PART II: Measuring MPAC Impacts on Connectivity and
Growth



Chapter III. Modeling MPAC Impacts

This evaluation exercise recognizes that numerous demographic, economic, political, natural,
and sociocultural factors can affect levels of physical, institutional, and people-to-people
connectivity in any region. Indeed, regional policy and coordination are important structural
factors determining ASEAN Connectivity, but some of the gains reported herein may be
attributable to drivers outside of MPAC, including the market and other national and sub-
national policies. Similarly, areas of limited gain may have otherwise worsened or stagnated
in the absence of MPAC interventions. In other words, countervailing factors may be at work,
especially related to outcomes such as increased trade or passenger flows.

Econometric and geo-economic modeling allows us to isolate the impacts of MPAC from the
influences of other factors, including economic growth, market size, and geography, in
patterns of economic growth and intra-ASEAN mobility. Additionally, modeling allows the
examination of potential interactions amongst strategies and key actions of MPAC as they
relate to economic growth and intra- and extra-regional trade patterns. The individual
strategies of MPAC have important interactive and complementary effects that should be
examined in tandem to understand both isolated and combined effects of strategies aimed at
increasing Connectivity, trade, and economic growth.

As such, this chapter seeks to isolate and model the effects directly or indirectly attributable
to MPAC strategies on goals of building an ASEAN Community, including those of economic
growth, regional trade integration, and stronger global economic linkages. The models and
results described in this chapter attend to MPAC’s influence on macroeconomic factors such
as trade, GDP, and human development indicators.

3.1 Geographical Simulation: MPAC Impacts on GRDP

In this section, we present evidence that suggests ASEAN and its sub-regions should
experience significant positive GDP impacts in 2025, derivative of key transportation and trade
facilitation actions included in the MPAC. In order to demonstrate the impacts of MPAC on

                                                                                             94
economic growth, Geographical Simulation Models (GSM) attend to macro-level effects of
select MPAC key actions on projected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross Regional
Domestic Product (GRDP). Results show that, while individual strategies may have limited
impacts at the national level, multiple strategies implemented in tandem have far more effect.
In other words, positive interactions and complementarities may be leveraged when key
actions are implemented in combination, with total effects that are significantly higher than the
sum of the impacts of strategies implemented in isolation. Further, while overall ASEAN GDP
impacts of some strategies are limited, the impacts on certain sub-regions are significant,
pointing out important subnational considerations.

The Institute of Developing Economies (IDE-JETRO) has developed a Geographical
Simulation Model (GSM), which expands on a model of new economic geography to
incorporate both geographic and market factors, as well as additional realistic trade features
such as such as multiple industrial sectors with intermediate inputs, a multimodal transport
selection model, and the existence of tariff and non-tariff barriers (See Annex 6 for technical
notes on the GSM model, including assumptions, formulae, and methodology). The IDE-GSM
is one of a very few economic models that may be used to predict economic effects of
transportation and trade integration measures at the sub-national level in East Asia.

The GSM predicts economic impacts of nine scenarios defined by MPAC projects or their
combinations. The economic impacts are comparisons of projected GDP or Gross Regional
Domestic Project (GRDP) between the baseline (minimal infrastructure development after
2010) and interventions based on implementation of MPAC key actions specified below in
2015. If the GRDP of a region under the scenario with specific trade and transport facilitation
measures (TTFMs) is higher (lower) than that under the baseline scenario, this surplus (deficit)
is the positive (negative) economic impact of the TTFM (Figure 81).

Intervention Scenarios

The intervention scenarios include seven MPAC-specific scenarios, as follows:

       1. Upgrading Below Class III roads of the AHN (Myanmar);
       2. Constructing two missing links of the ASEAN Highway Network (Myanmar);
       3. Completing four missing links of the SKRL (Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam);
       4. Implementing border facilitation measures (AFAFGIT, AFAMT, and AFAFIST),
           resulting in 50% reduction of time and cost of border clearance at 34 borders;
       5. Developing roll-on / roll-off (RoRo) shipping routes; 27
       6. Liberalizing air transport (implementation of RIATS, ASEAN Open Sky, ASAM); and
       7. Implementing all of the above in combination.

Additionally, the results from two supplementary interventions are modeled as follows:

       S1. Increased connectivity between clusters (upgrading and constructing AHN missing
           links and improving border facilitation between Bangkok and Yangon);
       S2. Increased connectivity between the Mekong region and India (connecting Dawei to
           Thailand and developing the Dawei deep sea port).

As such, this section compares geographically delimited impacts for physical strategies 1, 2,
4; institutional strategies 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8; and people-to-people strategy 2. The models are
spatially dependent and multi-sectorial, allowing for simulation of impacts on GDP/GRDP,
taking into consideration economic and sectorial factors, the locations of interventions, and
iterative impacts on trade patterns, trade costs, urban agglomeration, and labor movement.



27
     These include seven routes amongst Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, and Thailand.

                                                                                                               96
Geographically delimited impacts are presented for projected impacts on 710 ASEAN regions
at the sub-national level. The administrative unit is one below the national level for Cambodia,
Laos Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, and two levels below national for
Indonesia and Myanmar. Brunei and Singapore are treated as one unit, respectively.

In the figures below, red regions will experience positive impacts, and blue regions negative
impacts. A criterion of “impact density” is applied, derived by dividing a GRDP difference
between the baseline and development scenarios by the region’s land size. The deeper color
a region has, the higher impact one square kilometer of land of the region will experience with
a given scenario.

Scenario 1. All MPAC Projects

The results demonstrate that the MPAC activities implemented in tandem have the most
significant effects, with a positive economic impact greater than the sum of impacts of the six
MPAC strategies implemented in isolation. 28 In the ‘All MPAC Projects’ scenario below,
ASEAN will have a 0.35% increment of GDP in 2025 compared with the baseline scenario
without non-tariff barrier (NTB) reduction, and a 0.80% increment with NTB reduction. Given
that current trend of economic growth is already incorporated in the baseline scenario, a result
of nearly a 1% GDP increment from the baseline scenario is considerable.

Further, while these results may appear meager upon first glance, consideration of the size of
regional GDP and the likely costs of MPAC projects reveals quite a large economic impact.
For example, if ASEAN GDP were to grow at the 5.7% growth rate experienced in 2012 over
the next ten years, a projected 0.80% positive impact in 2025 would be on the scale of an
additional approximately US$38 billion for that year alone. The present value of that difference
would be $22.2 billion – again, for 2025 alone. Summing projected incremental benefits for
the years prior to and following 2025 and comparing these to the costs of MPAC projects
would yield high net present value calculations.




28
     The sum of isolated MPAC impacts is .32%.
                                                                                             97

The following figure illustrates the economic GRDP impacts by percentage. Whereas impacts
measured by impact density demonstrate in which regions absolute impacts are experienced,
the percentage change of each region from the baseline scenario shows which regions will
experience higher economic growth. Results show that remote areas from the capital cities
will generally have higher positive percentage impacts.

In particular, border cities in Myanmar and Laos and some regions in Kalimantan, Sulawesi,
Maluku and North Maluku will experience higher economic growth. This suggests that MPAC
projects will particularly benefit border areas and islands. In contrast to the figure above,
economic impacts on countries outside of ASEAN are negligible as expressed in percentage
changes, implying that the MPAC projects combined mainly contribute to ASEAN growth.

The results for GRDP per capita growth are almost the same, but an interesting point is that
the number of regions with positive per capita GRDP impacts is higher: of the 710 ASEAN
                                                                                                  98

                                                  per capita. For example, Salavan, Laos, which is
                                                  located south of Savarnakhet, will have a -0.22%
                                                  of negative impact on GRDP and 0.15% of positive
                                                  impact on GRDP per capita. This important finding
                                                  demonstrates the importance of examining local
                                                  dynamics and implies that, while some regions
                                                  may experience negative impacts due to outflow of
                                                  firms and households, the households that remain
 Source: JETRO IDE-GSM Simulation Results
                                                  will be better off with improved Connectivity.

The ‘All MPAC Projects’ scenario also suggests that border transactions will intensify
particularly in the Mekong region, with especially high growth in links between Thailand and
Vietnam via Laos. Further, the Borneo Indonesia-Malaysia-Brunei links will experience high
traffic growth.

Scenario 2. Upgrading Below Class III Roads

This section examines the impact of completing AHN upgrading projects not yet completed as
of 2014, with completed projects incorporated in the baseline. This refers to upgrading Below
Class III sections on TTRs in Myanmar, bringing average travel speed to 38.5 km/hr. Results
show that Myanmar is the sole beneficiary, and that Yangon will actually experience some
negative impacts as access to remote areas improves. This will reduce the number of firms
and households moving into the Yangon over time. This does not mean that Yangon will
experience negative growth, but that growth would be lower than the baseline rate.

Scenario 3. Developing Missing Links of AHN

Developing the 60-km AHN-112 link from Lehnya to Khongloy and the 141 km AHN-123
section from Dawei to Maesamee Pass also confers positive effects on Myanmar, with
magnitudes smaller than road upgrading. The results demonstrate some shifts in economic
activities within Myanmar from northern to southern regions due to better connectivity between
Thailand and the Tanintharyi region (including Dawei, Lhnya, and Khongloy). The positive
impacts coming from Tanintharyi region will be offset by some negative impacts in northern
regions.

Scenario 4. Developing Missing Links of Singapore-Kunming Rail Link

This scenario focuses on the development of the SKRL links as follows: Aranyaprathet –
Klongluk (Thailand) (6km) in 2015; Poipet – Sisophon (Cambodia) (48km) in 2015; Phnom
Penh – Loc Ninh (Cambodia) (255km) in 2015; and Loc Ninh – Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam)
(129 km) in 2020.

While magnitudes are modest, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam will have some positive
impacts. It is reasonable that developing specific sections of SKRL will not significantly affect
firms and households in Singapore or Kunming, because most would not use the new sections
developed in Cambodia and Vietnam (i.e., almost no firms in Singapore would use SKRL to
export products to Kunming, even if directly connected by SKRL). In addition, economic gains
of positively affected areas are too small for Singapore or Kunming to substantially increase
the trade volume with the affected areas.

Nevertheless, percentage impacts on GRDP demonstrate some impact on Cambodia.
Northeastern regions of the country will be positively affected, implying that, while minimal,
SKRL may have a positive affect on narrowing development gaps in poorer regions. The
positive impacts in Samut Prakan, Thailand and Osaka, Japan, also suggest that some
economic activities along value chains in the textile and garment industry will be stimulated.

Scenario 5. Border Facilitation

The effects of border facilitation assume that implementation of AFAFGIT, AFAFIST and
AFAMT, will contribute to 50% reductions in the time and costs of transiting across 34 ASEAN
borders. Many ASEAN countries and border regions demonstrate positive impacts. Laos will

be the largest beneficiary, as the landlocked country requires improved Connectivity
surrounding countries. Bangkok and its environs also demonstrate large positive impacts, as
trade facilitation measures will encourage firms in Greater Bangkok area to buy parts and
components from neighboring countries.

It is worth noting that much of Cambodia could experience a negative impact. Border
I




facilitation along the Southern Economic Corridor is predicted to foster a shift of economic
activities from Phnom Penh to regions bordering Thailand and Vietnam, which may reduce
national GDP as agglomeration in Phnom Penh is reduced. Nevertheless, it will also narrow
development gaps within the country.

Further, border facilitation may worsen the economic outlook for automotive and electronics
industries in Cambodia, which will face increasing competition as households can more easily
purchase from Thailand and Vietnam. It is, thus, important for Cambodia to couple better trade
connectivity with increased technological capacity and competitiveness. A strategic
combination of border facilitation, road development (especially National Roads 5 and 1), SEZ
development, and technical improvement is necessary to achieve higher economic growth
and narrower development gaps in Cambodia (ERIA 2014).

Scenario 6. Developing RoRo Routes

The development of RoRo routes will contribute most to North Sumatra, and some parts of
Kalimantan, Sulawesi, southern Philippines and peninsular Malaysia. Northern Philippines
and Java, on the other hand, will experience negative impacts. The results in Indonesia and
the Philippines demonstrate how GDP impacts at the national level may be very different from

                                                                                                   102
local impacts. While Indonesia experiences the most positive overall impact, for instance,
many regions in Java would experience the most negative impacts.

Scenario 7. Air Transport Liberalization

Simulation of air transport liberalization effects assumes 50% reductions in passenger airfares
and per kilometer cargo costs. The impacts on GRDP / GDP show a clear tendency of higher
impacts for capital cities and economic centers, implying better accessibility for firms and
households in urban areas. The economic impacts on national GDP are also the highest, by
a significant amount, of any of the MPAC project impacts simulated individually.

The following two sections report results from supplemental scenarios that simulate

Supplement Scenario 1: Connecting Existing and Emerging Clusters

This scenario examines the importance of connecting existing and emerging clusters, such as
Bangkok and Yangon. It is a subset of the AHN development scenario, more specific to the
land linkages between the two urban agglomerations. There are two variations: in scenario
S1-1, only the 195 km Below Class III section between Thaton and Myawaddy (part of the
Bangkok-Yangon link) is developed, increasing average travel speed to 38.5 km/hr. In
scenario S1-2, the 440 km section between Mae Sot and Yangon is developed, decreasing
travel time between Yangon and the border (increasing average speed to 60 km/hr) and
facilitating improved border transit (reduced time and cost, as in scenario 4 above).

Myanmar would have much larger economic impacts under Scenario S1-2 than Scenario S1-
1, with positive impacts extending to many regions. Samut Prakan and other provinces
surrounding Bangkok would also experience larger positive impacts with better connectivity
with Myanmar, suggesting that improved land transit connectivity along the Bangkok-Yangon
route would benefit both Thailand and Myanmar.

Supplement Scenario 2: Connecting the Mekong Region to India

The second supplemental scenario simulates improved linkages between the Mekong region
and India, also with two variations. Scenario S2-1 improves connectivity between Dawei and
Maesame Pass by developing the AH123 (141 km) missing link as well as a new 211 km link
between Dawei and Kanchanaburi. In S2-2, Kanchanaburi is linked to India via the Dawei
Deep Seaport. This scenario extends the first, including the same upgrades and new road
linking Dawei and Kanchanaburi (211km), with an average speed of 60km/h, as well as


                                                                                           104
developing the Dawei Deep Seaport and SEZ in 2020 and establishing sea routes between
Dawei and Chennai, Kolkata, and Visakhapatnam, India and Colombo, Sri Lanka.

The economic impacts of Scenario S2-2 are very different from that of S2-1. The limited S2-1
scenario contributes to economic activities in southern Myanmar, but impacts are offset by
outflow of firms and households from northern Myanmar. Other countries experience almost
no impacts. On the other hand, connecting Dawei to India and Sri Lanka port by port
development and sea routes will make it possible for firms to transit more directly between
Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to India and Bangladesh, circumventing the Strait of
Malacca. This will have significant economic growth impacts in those regions and also benefits
other countries including China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.

This figure suggests that developing the Dawei port is not alone enough to generate positive
economic impacts for Myanmar. Rather, Myanmar must pursue a more integrated connectivity
program, including domestic connectivity, development of the SEZ, and enhancement of
technical capacity to achieve higher economic growth and narrower development gaps. These
measures are also key to extract the maximized benefit from the Dawei project. As presented
in Isono and Kumagai (2013), Myanmar could benefit significantly from a combination of
regulatory reforms, industrial development in Yangon and Mandalay, development of domestic
economic corridors along major national roads that connect to surrounding countries, and
development of the Dawei Deep Seaport with better integration with Thailand.

Policy Implications of GSM Analysis

The GSM analysis demonstrates that all MPAC Connectivity projects will bring positive
impacts to ASEAN. Regions connected with upgraded roads and new RoRo routes have
positive economic impacts as compared to the baseline scenario, but the geographic
distribution and relative intensity of impacts is differentiated. For example, AHN development
(including upgrading and completion of missing links) benefits limited regions along the route
sections in Myanmar, whereas Yangon would experience some negative impacts, and impacts
on other countries are negligible.

Second, there are important differences in projects’ economic impacts, which present policy
tradeoffs. Some projects contribute to higher national economic growth, whereas others
narrow development gaps by benefiting poorer regions, but without affecting growth for the
country overall. For example, in Scenario 4, improved border facilitation brings positive
impacts to Cambodian provinces near Thailand, while the national impact on GDP is negative.
This supports the strategic combination of projects that generate higher economic growth with
projects that reduce development gaps – a notion supported by the relatively high positive
results of the ‘All MPAC Projects’ scenario. The All-MPAC scenario yields results of a .35-.8%
impact as compared to a .29% impact calculated by summing the six interventions in isolation.

The potential to leverage project complementarities is also supported by comparing
supplemental strategies S1-1 and S1-2. In scenario S1-1, upgrading Below Class III roads
between Myawaddy and Thaton brings a 19.01% positive impact on Myawaddy, while GDP
impact is only 0.07%. With S1-2, on the other hand, upgrading a longer section between
Myawaddy and Yangon would increase the GDP impact to 0.33%, and Myawaddy would enjoy
a 24.53% positive impact.

These examples focus attention on developing multimodal transport (physical Connectivity
Strategy 5) and increasing institutional and coordination capacity across sectors and
governments (institutional Connectivity Strategy 10) to take advantage of complementarities
between projects. Further, they encourage attention to a fuller suite of domestic and sub-
regional transport infrastructure projects and initiatives amenable to synergistic coupling.
Strategic combination of national projects, such as expressway construction between
domestic cities; local projects, such as toll-way construction and provision of mass transit
transport in urban areas; and international trade projects, such as upgrading of gateway ports,
could capture complementary effects.



                                                                                           107
Third, regional impact disparities require that policy makers consider the local experiences of
alternative interventions and engage in policy debate where tradeoffs exist between national
economic growth and equitable development. With each of the interventions, there will
inevitably be some ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ with respect to economic impacts. Again, however,
the negative impacts presented are not equal to negative growth – the outlook of high growth
for ASEAN will only be counteracted in part where negative growth impacts are reported.

Finally, there are critical cluster-to-cluster links that could have large impacts on ASEAN as a
whole. Comparison of scenarios S2-1 and S2-2 suggests, for example, that the Dawei Deep
Seaport project coupled with development of an SEZ and link with Thailand would bring huge
positive impacts to the Mekong region. Simulation results imply that regional funding initiatives
should pursue those critical infrastructure projects, since Japan, China, Korea, and India
would also be beneficiaries of the Dawei project.

Further, key projects to connect ASEAN Member States and surrounding regions should be
considered to complement current MPAC prioritized projects. Referring to Scenario S2-1, the
results show that the isolated economic impact of connecting Kanchanaburi and Dawei by
road brings a 0.01% impact on Myanmar’s GDP and very limited on ASEAN. Conversely,
impacts on Myanmar and ASEAN GDP can be increased to 0.57% and 0.07%, respectively,
if the road project is combined with Dawei Deep Seaport development, Dawei SEZ
development, and border facilitation between Kanchanaburi and Dawei. In other words, he
higher economic impact of Scenario S2-2 on ASEAN depends on better Connectivity with
surrounding countries.

   In Summary
       Interventions, in combination, have greater effects (.80%) than the sum of the impacts when
       modeled in isolation (.32%).
       The introduction of trade facilitation measures that reduce non-tariff barriers brings the all-
       MPAC impact from .35% to.80%.
       The models in isolation suggest, however, that the most impactful interventions on economic
       growth for the region are border facilitation and development of maritime and air transport.
       Economic impacts of the AHN are limited to moderate impact on Myanmar and Brunei,
       whereas SKRL would benefit Cambodia only.
       Patterns of impact are differentiated at the local level, revealing important policy tradeoffs
       between national economic growth and equitable development.

3.2 Gravity Models of Trade and Travel

In this section, we utilize gravity models to examine the impacts of MPAC strategies and
policies on trade and passenger flows amongst ASEAN Member States. Based on Newton’s
law for the gravitational force between two objects, expressed as a function of mass and
distance, gravity models of international trade are similarly useful to explain the volumes of
goods and capital traded between countries. Gravity models are widely used because they
reliably explain much of the trade ‘pull and push’ between countries as functions of (a) size (in
terms of economy, population, or both), (b) distance (geographical and/or cultural), and (c)
trade factors (including laws, infrastructures, etc.). First introduced to model trade flows
(Tinbergen 1962), gravity models have been expanded to include policy, social, and business
factors and applied to analyze immigration (Lewer and Van den Berg 2008, Karemera,
Oguledo, and Davis 2000) and passenger flows (Grosche, Rothlauf, and Heinzl 2007,
Matsumoto 2004). In this section, we discuss the results of gravity model analysis of trade in
goods and air passenger flows within ASEAN. Results demonstrate that MPAC component
policies and strategies are positively significant to increased trade and air travel.

Gravity Model of Trade

Technical notes explaining the gravity model of trade are found in Annex 7. In summary, the
model estimates a function to explain the flow of goods between any two Member States,
based on underlying trade data (imports or exports) and additional trade-related variables,
depending on the context. The basic equation explains the annual flow of exports from one
country to another (US$) as a function of (1) the importer’s and exporter’s GDP and (2) the
economic distance between them. The equation can be expanded, however, to control for a
number of factors from that particular context that may affect the flows, such as shared
language, contiguity (shared border), and institutional or trade-related variables of interest. It
is the latter set of explanatory variables that is the focus of our analysis.

The gravity model equation may be generally expressed as

         lnEij        1lnGDPi     2lnGDPj     3lnDij    4Contigij +   5Continentij +   6TradeFactor1i

                 +   7TradeFactor1j   +…+     r TradeFactorni     s TradeFactor nj


where Eij is the flow of exports from country i to country j                             GDPi is the
log GDP of the exporter i, lnGDPj is the log GDP of the importer j, ln Dij is the log distance
between the two countries’ capital cities, Contigij is a dummy variable for contiguity, and
Continentij is a dummy variable for both partners’ continental locus (i.e, not island states).
                                                                                                 109
The cross-sectional model employs data from 2006 to 2013. The TradeFactor variables
represent a number of policy, institutional, and contextual variables that potentially affect trade
volumes between countries. In our analysis, these are of highest interest, as they represent
importers’ and exporters’ performances with respect to border management and logistics and,
thus, link directly to MPAC strategies. These variables include Logistics Performance Index
scores, Doing Business “Trading Across Borders, Distance to the Frontier” scores, and the
number of days to export/import. By controlling for these factors, we indirectly infer whether
MPAC strategies are significant to trade.

Early modeling employed a binomial MPAC dummy (=0 in 2010 and before, =1 in 2011
onwards), which was not observably significant to trade. This is not surprising, as the broad
dummy variable is too unspecific and captures many other potential factors besides MPAC
implementation, rendering it unusable to isolate the combined effects of MPAC overall. We do
not have sufficient activity-level data to model MPAC’s direct effects on measures of improved
trade facilitation; nevertheless, we can indirectly test MPAC by examining whether component
goals – the policy sub-components that attend to logistics performance and border
management – are, indeed, relevant. The results below confirm their significance and, thus,
validate the trade facilitation and logistics efforts of MPAC.

Results below reveal that, in addition to the significance of economy size, distance, and
contiguity, the number of days to export, trading across borders scores, and Logistics
Performance Index scores are also significant.

The results in Table 11 demonstrate that every reduction of one day in the time required export
goods increases the volume of exports by 2.9%. A one-point improvement in the exporter’s
Doing Business ‘Trading Across Frontiers’ score, on average, increases exports by 3%,
whereas a one-point improvement to the importer’s score increases the volume by 1.2%. The
Logistics Performance Index (LPI) scores also have high estimated impacts on expected trade
volume. By the model’s outputs, an exporter’s one-point improvement on the 5-point scale
would translate, on average, to a 118% increase in export volume, whereas a one-point
importer improvement would translate to an 87% increase. Results should be interpreted
cautiously, however, as correlation amongst variables affects the robustness of the estimates;
nevertheless, the positive significance of logistics performance can be confidently accepted.

Whilst these measures do not directly reflect the role of MPAC on trade, we can use them to
validate the strategies employed by MPAC. Further, we can indirectly observe the influence
of MPAC on trade dynamics through the variable by comparing results pre- and post-MPAC,
particularly related to the variables dtf_exp, dtf_imp, and days_export. Following MPAC, trade
volumes become more sensitive to trading partners’ border management and international
trade scores, implying that increased integration eases the way for geographic substitution of
goods. In other words, the sensitivity of trade volumes to institutional trading factors has
increased. Thus, countries must become increasingly competitive with respect to their trade
regimes.

The increasing coefficient for contig between the two time periods also suggests that improved
land border management has increased the trade volumes between contiguous ASEAN
Member States, and that proximity is increasingly important to volumes as the ease of
transitioning land borders improves. Whereas contiguity would increase trade by 133-139%
                                                                                      111
prior to MPAC, a shared border increases expected trade by 163-183% post-MPAC. This
suggests that border management has improved sufficiently to make a marked difference in
easing trade across borders.

Gravity Model of Air Passenger Flows

One of the richest data sets available, specific to flows between ASEAN Member States, is
the flow of Intra-ASEAN air passengers, drawn from the DiiO Aviation Intelligence database.
We draw on this data set, from the years 2006 to 2013, to determine the influence of air
liberalization policies associated with MPAC, i.e., the ASEAN Single Air Market (ASAM)
measures that grant signatory States certain ‘freedoms of the air’ to operate air services. More
specifically, we examine the influence of the Multilateral Agreement on Air Services (MAAS),
the Multilateral Agreement on the Full Liberalisation of Passenger Air Services (MAFLPAS),
and the granting of third freedom rights via other liberalization agreements (e.g., between
CLMV, Brunei-Thailand-Singapore, and Singapore-Malaysia).

The gravity models of air passenger flows are similar to the model specified above for trade,
but with a dependent variable ln Pij, the log of the bilateral annual flow of air passengers
between two countries i and j. The formula is as follows:

           lnPij           1lnGDPi       2lnGDPj      3lnDij     4Contigij    5AirLib1ij   +…     r AirLibnij


where Pij is the flow of passengers from country i to country j                                        GDPi is
the log GDP of the origin country i, lnGDPj is the log GDP of the destination country j, ln Dij is
the log physical distance between the two countries’ capital cities, and Contigij is a dummy
variable for contiguity. The AirLib variables represent a number of air liberalization agreements
between countries. These variables include three dummy variables: maas, freedom, and
freedom2, described as follows:

 maas              Dummy variable =1 if exporter and importer have both ratified MAAS (=0 for all countries
                   before 2010; =1 for all countries, except Indonesia and Philippines in 2010 and later)
 freedom           Dummy variable =1 if exporter and importer granted 3rd and 4th freedom rights via MAAS
                   or through other bilateral agreements (=0 for all until 2004; =1 for travel amongst Laos,
                   Vietnam, and Myanmar in 2004 and later; =1 for travel amongst Brunei, Thailand, and
                   Singapore in 2005 and later; =1 for travel between Singapore and Malaysia in 2009; =1
                   for travel between all Member States, except Indonesia and Philippines, 2010 and later)
 freedom2          Dummy variable =1, represents Philippines’ adoption of MAFLPAS, partially includes
                   travel between ASEAN and Philippines as with MAAS, as it granted 4 th and 5th freedom
                   rights to fly into Philippines, except Manila (=maas, with addition of =1 for Philippines in
                   2010 and onwards)

The results show that air liberalization, captured by the granting of 3rd and 4th air freedoms
between capital cities (e.g., MAAS and other bilateral and multilateral agreements) or between
                                                                                           112
entire countries (e.g., MAFLPAS), has had a significant and positive effect on the number of
passengers traveling between ASEAN Member States, even controlling for GDP of the origin
and destination states.

The model results demonstrate that air liberalization measures included in the MPAC strategy
on air connectivity have, indeed, increased the number of passengers flying amongst ASEAN
Member States. The coefficients for dummy variables for maas and the granting of 3rd and 4th
freedoms between ASEAN capital cities and states are consistently positive and significant,
with very strong effect. The adoption of MAAS is estimated to have increased passenger
volumes 181%, controlling for GDP, whereas the granting of 3rd and 4th freedoms at any point
is estimated to increase passenger volumes by 78.7%.


    In Summary
           A one-day reduction of ‘Days to Export’ increases and ASEAN exporter’s trade volume (US$)
           by nearly 3% annually, on average.
           Post-MPAC, ASEAN trade volumes are more sensitive to trading partners’ Doing Business
           ‘Trading Across Borders’ scores and Logistics Performance Index scores.
           Contiguity (sharing a border) is more important to trade volume following MPAC
           implementation, demonstrating that the easing of transitions across borders is increasing
           trade volumes between neighboring Member States.
           The number of days required to export (a proxy of economic distance) is also more significant
           to trade volumes following MPAC implementation.
           The granting of 3rd and 4th air freedoms via ASEAN Open Skies has significantly increased intra-
           ASEAN air passenger flows. MAAS implementation increased bilateral flows by an estimated
           70.5%.

3.3 SVAR Analysis of ASEAN Economic Interdependence

In this section, we share results of structural vector auto-regression (SVAR) analysis applied
to ASEAN-8 countries, namely Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Laos and Myanmar are not included in the analysis due to
missing bilateral export data and quarterly GDP data inconsistencies, respectively.

Intuitively, a higher degree of integration (interdependency) would be expected between
ASEAN economies after MPAC implementation. This would mean that positive or negative
variations in one economy should have greater effects on the rest of the ASEAN economies,
particularly on export and import levels. Nevertheless, because of the likelihood that impacts
will lag policy implementation, it is recommended that analysis continue into the future to
capture lagged impacts.

The proposed SVAR analysis estimates the multiplier effects of a 1% GDP growth shock in
one economy on the growth of others (% change to GDP) in following (lagged) periods. These
multiplier effects are estimated by linking 2001-2013 quarterly GDP data for ASEAN-8 and
three control economies (China, India, and OECD) to their 110 bilateral export-share series in
to generate a set of “impulse responses”. These, in turn, are used to calculate multiplier
effects. Data is drawn from the IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics database. Technical notes
on the SVAR model may be found in Annex 8.

The estimated average annual multiplier effects for two separate periods, 2001-2010 and
2011-2013, representing pre- and post-MPAC, respectively, are given in Table 13 and
illustrated, comparatively, in the charts of Figure 95. The multipliers reported for each period
capture the average annual impact of an economic shock in one country (the “growth engine”)
on the GDP growth of another (the “impact economy”) for the following year.

Results suggest that MPAC has contributed positively to intra-regional economic
interdependence (Figure 95). Tables 14 and 15 show that the absolute values of incremental
increases are small; nevertheless, the growth rates of multiplier effects are quite high for some
countries.

For example, Vietnam’s .12 multiplier effect increase on Brunei equates to a 181% increase.
Similarly, Brunei’s and Cambodia’s multiplier effects on each other have increased 200% and
167%, respectively. On average, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam have the
highest multiplier effects on ASEAN, whereas Brunei and Cambodia have the lowest. Post-
MPAC, Singapore’s influence on Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam decreased slightly, as did
its responsiveness to GDP growth in Malaysia and the Philippines.

The effects of ASEAN-8 growth engines on Indonesia and Vietnam are smallest, indicating
their lesser dependence on external engines. Nevertheless, Indonesia’s and Vietnam’s
multiplier effects on other countries, particularly Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, are
appreciable and have increased post-MPAC.

ASEAN multiplier effects on the Philippines are also small. Like Indonesia, the Philippines has
low per capita income and is less dependent on external ASEAN engines for growth. For
Philippines, OECD remains the main driver of growth, while China’s importance has grown
over the years. In fact, the same is true for all ASEAN-8: Figure 96 illustrates China’s
significantly increasing multiplier effect on ASEAN overall, post-MPAC. While this may be
influenced by other factors affecting interdependence, beyond trade connectivity, China’s
increasing importance to ASEAN growth is apparent.

Table 14 summarizes the changes in average one-year multiplier effects between the two
periods. Since SVAR cannot generate standard errors, the negative signs associated with
extremely low changes should not be automatically taken to indicate a decrease. Rather, the
analysis suggests very modest change, aside from China’s growing influence on ASEAN-8
(excluding Indonesia and Vietnam) and OECD’s declining and increasing effects on Malaysia
and Philippines, respectively.

         Pre-MPAC OECD    Post-MPAC OECD
In some cases, China is becoming increasingly influential on growth where other growth
engines are exerting declining effects. In Cambodia, for example, China’s multiplier effects
have increased post-MPAC, whereas OECD’s have decreased (though it remains the
country’s primary growth engine). In Malaysia, while Singapore remains a key driver of growth,
its importance has decreased relative to China.

Within ASEAN, Singapore and Malaysia are most interdependent. Further, within the region,
Singapore is the primary engine of growth, reflected in its relatively high multiplier effects on
the remaining countries. Among Singapore’s main growth engines, the effects of China,
Vietnam and Indonesia have increased, while those of OECD and Malaysia have declined.

Growth multipliers derived in this exercise show that intra-ASEAN growth interdependence
has increased to a limited extent after MPAC implementation, and the ASEAN-8 countries still
rely on OECD as their primary driver of growth, with China gaining importance. While this

                                                                                                            118
suggests that ASEAN-8 growth is limitedly interdependent, it also suggests increasing
integration of ASEAN-8 into the global economy. Nevertheless, these trends indicate that
ASEAN needs to intensify and accelerate the implementation of the MPAC strategies related
to strengthening trade and investment linkages within the group.

Additionally, new policy initiatives may be required to balance the rising dependence on China.
This could include the development of key labor-intensive industries with an eye to encourage
relocation of multinational and East Asian companies currently operating in China to ASEAN
for production for OECD, Japan, and ASEAN markets, with an added focus on developing
trade Connectivity and logistics services required to support integrated production bases for
those particular industries within ASEAN.



   In Summary
       SVAR analysis suggests that ASEAN-8 economies have become more regionally integrated
       post-MPAC, but only moderately so, as measured by increased sensitivity to regional
       economic shocks.
       ASEAN-8 GDP multiplier effects are smallest on Indonesia, Vietnam, and Philippines, indicating
       lesser dependence on external drivers of growth. Nevertheless, Indonesia’s and Vietnam’s
       multiplier effects on other ASEAN-8 countries (particularly Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand)
       are considerable and have increased since MPAC.
       Within ASEAN, Singapore and Malaysia are most interdependent, and Singapore has the
       highest multiplier effects on other ASEAN-8 countries.
       OECD remains the primary engine of growth for ASEAN exports, but China is quickly gaining
       importance to trade volumes and GDP.

Chapter IV. Enhancing ASEAN Connectivity M&E

Whilst the current ‘Enhancing ASEAN Connectivity Monitoring and Evaluation’ project is
undertaken with an eye to draw out recommendations for improved oversight and assessment,
the analysis herein also offers a number of policy implications for consideration by ASEAN
Member States. Over time, improved monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will serve to draw out
finer and more accurate assessments of Member State performance with respect to the MPAC
strategies and component projects, in turn allowing Member States to periodically retool and
recalibrate Connectivity policies based on new information.

4.1 Policy Implications

The locus of analysis for this report is currently at the strategic regional-national level; thus,
the policy implications discussed herein are similarly abstracted. Another important realm of
analysis, however, lies at the local and project levels, where the details of implementation are
experienced and the immediate outcomes of policy realized. Recommendations for project-
specific activities should be based on project-level evaluations, which, while not in the scope
of this analysis, comprise important inputs for policy adjustment. In addition to national and
regional analysis of Connectivity progress, Member States can complement ASEAN
Connectivity M&E with systematic project-level evaluations (see 4.2) to identify specific
opportunities for recalibration.

This analysis, on the other hand, suggests a number of MPAC components most important to
the ASEAN Community, as well as a set of strategies that require increased attention and
deliberation with respect to their roles in the overall Connectivity project. These are the
subjects of Section 4.1. The policy implications emerging from the data and analysis primarily
relate to observed complementarities between strategies, tradeoffs between local and national
growth as well as between economic growth and closing development gaps, and areas of
lagging performance. Additionally, a number of strategies require improved oversight and data
collection in order to identify barriers to progress in physical, institutional, and people-to-
people Connectivity. These are discussed in 4.2.

Complementarity and Intermodality

One key lesson that may be drawn from modeling MPAC impacts on trade and growth is that
important complementarities exist between strategic pillars. These complementarities demand
attention to system-wide coordination, potential policy and process misalignments, and
                                                                                              120
assessment of impacts in combination. While modeling results suggest that regional
coordination is key to attaining Connectivity goals, there are no measurement tools in use to
assess current levels of coordination. As such, this is also an important area of development
with respect to improving M&E.

GSM results, however, clearly confirm complementary effects between physical and
institutional strategies with respect to trade and economic development within the region.
Impacts on GDP growth of MPAC strategies, in combination, are higher than the sum of
individually modeled impacts, suggesting positive network effects of simultaneous
infrastructure development and border facilitation. Available project-level information also
highlights the importance of coordinated development of ports, roads, and airports. For
example, the impact of Dawei Port development on trade and GDP growth is significantly
augmented by the improvement of land routes connecting the port to Thailand and established
sea routes connecting to South Asia.

Another key area of M&E development relates to the mapping of transitions between modes
of transport, aimed at attaining a seamless multi-modal transport system. At present, there is
no body of data available to trace the flow of goods across transport sectors; however, process
mapping and network optimization analysis could be used to identify bottlenecks and key
transition nodes for focused development. This is particularly important as the composition of
traded goods shifts from mainly bulk cargo, typically transported by sea and rail, to lighter high
value components, largely transported by air. While progress on rail and road development is
lagging in many States, the relevance of rail and road transport projects must nevertheless be
considered within the greater context of multi-modal transport networks. Improving rail and
road connections to seemingly more important transport nodes – ports and airports – can have
important benefits for landlocked countries and inland areas.

Lastly, GSM analysis and gravity models suggest that the rules governing trade and
exchange, including liberalization agreements and process standardization, and the general
quality of logistics services have critical implications for the usability and efficiency of existing
infrastructures. Operational, project-level information on the status and effect of institutional
measures that smooth transitions across borders and infrastructure sectors (such as the
ASEAN Single Window and standardization of customs procedures) is required to better
model the influence of specific coordinating rules on trade volumes. The analyses herein,
particularly the GSM and gravity models of trade, demonstrate that border facilitation
measures, the overall quality of logistics in importing and exporting countries, and the rules
that determine time and cost of exporting are significant to trade volumes and growth.
                                                                                                 121
Key Connectivity Policy Levers

The modeling in Chapter III suggests that legal-institutional factors are amongst the most
important to increased trade and mobility within the region. For example, with respect to
people-to-people Connectivity, gravity models of air passenger flows demonstrate that the
granting of 3rd, 4th, and 5th air freedoms via air liberalization agreements has had a significant
and notable positive impact on passenger flows between Member States. The degree of
importance of a 3rd / 4th air freedom agreement is akin to the effect on air travel of a 0.5 - 0.75%
increase in the GDP of the country of origin. This translates to a more striking 78.7 - 128.5%
increase in the number of passengers flying between two countries in a given year.

The Geographic Simulation Models and Gravity Models of Trade also reveal the importance
of institutional factors on trade Connectivity and economic growth. Of the policy and
infrastructural factors simulated in the GSM, the strategies with the largest effects on projected
2025 GDPs are the development of the ASEAN Single Air Market, development of the RoRo
network, and border facilitation and the reduction of non-tariff barriers to trade. The gravity
models support the significance of border management to trade: the number of days to require
to export a basket of goods is negatively related to trade volume, whereas the exporters’ and
importers’ LPI and Trading Across Borders ‘Distance to the Frontier’ scores are positively
significant. These measures are all functions of policies, processes, and capacities that affect
the transfer of goods across borders. Furthermore, results suggest that institutional factors
can effectively stave off the negative effects of lagging physical developments. For example,
despite limited progress in the quality of air transport infrastructure over the MPAC period, air
passenger and cargo flows have increasingly risen following ASAM, suggesting the great
importance of institutional factors to air transit flows.

Another key finding across strategies is that quality and efficiency improvements, as opposed
to new infrastructure developments, can be more important to increased trade in many cases.
For instance, the upgrading of roads to above Class-III status has more effect on trade and
growth in simulation than does the construction of new roads. Similarly, maritime development
must be more carefully focused on improving port efficiency rather than building new ports
and increasing capacity.

The indicator results also suggest that some physical Connectivity initiatives should be
revisited due to their limited progress. Where low performance is due to insufficient policy
attention or resource mobilization challenges, Member States may decide to promote the
strategy and its key actions to a higher priority level in the future. This is likely the case for

                                                                                               122
maritime development (particularly the RoRo network) and inland waterways development,
for example. But in cases where low progress is due to low bankability, insufficient demand,
institutional complications, or low projected impacts, Member States must deliberate their
inclusion in the regional infrastructure development agenda. In addition to lagging maritime
and waterway development, ASEAN must particularly deliberate the future course of the
Singapore-Kunming Rail Link and Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline. In the case of the former, while
analysis does not deem the project valueless, GSM analysis suggests that positive effects of
rail development will be limited to local impacts in Cambodia and the regions surrounding
Yangon in Myanmar and Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam.

Managing Tradeoffs

A third major category of policy implications relates to policy tradeoffs, including those
between economic growth versus equitable development and aggregated national impact
versus local impacts. The analysis points out a number of cases where infrastructure and
trade facilitation measures are expected to have different effects at local, national, and
regional levels. For instance, the GSM shows that overall impacts of developing the RoRo are
quite minimal for Indonesia overall. But a closer look at the local level shows that some
negative impacts on Java are offset by significant positive impacts in Sulawesi, Sumatra, and
Kalimantan. The case is similar for the Philippines. These patterns demonstrate how
developments with important local positive impacts can help close development gaps without
necessarily having significant impacts on national economic development.

Looking forward, tradeoffs will also arise when funding constraints force Member States to
make difficult decisions about which infrastructures and institutional measures should be
pursued immediately, and which may be postponed. For example, funding limits will demand
that governments choose a finite set of Connectivity projects from amongst the set of key
actions. For this reason, governments must establish clear principles upon which tradeoffs will
be based and adopt systematic approaches to prioritizing infrastructure investments.

Lastly, the balance between regional and global economic integration is not a tradeoff, per se,
but warrants consideration, nevertheless. Considering ASEAN’s policy of open integration, the
higher integration of ASEAN Member States with the global economy is acceptable. That said,
more rapidly increasing integration with extra-ASEAN economies suggests that ASEAN must
specifically examine the impacts of China’s increasing integration and identify opportunities to
leverage the benefits of increased integration regionally, and also ramp up efforts to promote
intra-regional trade and investment.
                                                                                            123
4.2 Improving Connectivity Monitoring and Assessment

The Connectivity monitoring and evaluation program has progressed from a qualitative status
update to incorporate more systematic quantitative indicators. With the exception of
institutional Strategy 10, the present M&E system is sufficient to provide a general, albeit
partial, “pulse check” on Connectivity. Where Connectivity developments are lagging,
however, the current evaluation framework falls short of providing the kinds of detailed
information about root causes of performance that would help Member States prioritize certain
Connectivity-related projects, identify critical project-level links to policy outcomes and
impacts, or isolate MPAC policy effects from other drivers of Connectivity development,
Integration, and ASEAN Community-building. As such, there are a number of important ways
to further improve the oversight and impact assessment MPAC initiatives.

These opportunities relate to improving data access, quality, and breadth to more accurately
assess strategic performance and provide valuable contextual information; and expanding the
ACIM to link performance at the project (or key action) output level to Connectivity outcomes
and social and economic impacts. By applying a multi-level evaluation framework, ACIM can
link project-level evaluation to policy outcomes and impacts to better identify key policy levers.
And as data is improved, more advanced analysis of MPAC impacts on Connectivity and
economic growth; flows of people, goods, and information; and patterns of development will
be possible. Since many Connectivity and growth impacts will inevitably lag policy
implementation (and since several initiatives have yet to be deployed), evaluation must
continue well after implementation, justifying efforts to improve the M&E system.

An Expanded M&E Framework: Causality and Levels of Analysis

The impact of MPAC on goals of trade facilitation, Connectivity, and regional integration is
dependent on the accomplishment of MPAC strategies, which in turn rely on the sets of actions
associated with each. In other words, there is a causal chain: inputs go through processes to
become outputs; these outputs have intermediate policy outcomes; and the outcomes, often
in combination, yield policy impacts that are felt more broadly – and only after a period of time
(see Figure 97). Understanding outcomes and impacts is most important to measuring the
success of MPAC. But identifying why a policy is successful or unsuccessful requires
unpacking performance at the output and process levels. Without this information, decision-
makers cannot reliably determine how to correct underperformance.



                                                                                              124
Figure 97. Levels of analysis in evaluation




At present, the ACIM irregularly evaluates immediate outputs, intermediate outcomes, and a
set of greater impacts (e.g., economic growth). This is for two reasons: the construction of the
strategies themselves and data limitations. With respect to the former, some MPAC key
actions and strategies are, in and of themselves, output-oriented, with no explicitly defined
policy outcomes or impacts (though all, naturally, have implicit higher-level goals). For
example, assessing the performance of physical Strategy 1, ‘Complete the ASEAN Highway
Network’, could be limited to an outcome assessment of the percentage of AHN completed.
Similarly, the attainment of institutional Strategy 1, operationalizing Framework Agreements
on transport facilitation, is output-oriented and dependent solely on the ratification and
adoption of a series of trade agreements. These both, however, may be attached to implicit
goals of increased trade by road or reduction of transaction costs in trade, respectively, as
well as ultimate impacts of increased economic growth. Conversely, some strategies are
outcome- or impact-oriented, requiring identification of lower-level effects for monitoring. For
example, people-to-people Strategy 1 calls for MPAC to promote deeper social and cultural
understanding, and institutional Strategy 9 looks to further open Member States to
investments from within and beyond the region. These both rely on a series of outputs and
outcomes for their ultimate attainment.

At present, we report the state of Connectivity by strategy, with indicators selected at one or
more levels, depending on data availability and the strategy itself, including its key actions
(Figure 98). For example, progress on the AHN is reported at the output level, according to
the length of AHN roads built. Its impact on GDP is also projected via modeling (see dashed
line). In the future, however, ACCC could also monitor outcomes such as the volume of
exports by road and transit times between major cities. Maritime development, on the other
hand, is currently monitored at the output (port capacity) and outcome (sea cargo throughout)
levels, with future impacts on GDP projected via modeling. The case is similar for trade
facilitation strategies.




                                                                                            125
Figure 98. Example indicators linked to levels of analysis




With an eye to improve Connectivity M&E, however, we strive to identify a fuller set of linked
output, outcome, and impact indicators to improve the robustness and thoroughness of the
monitoring and evaluation program (see Table 15 below), which drives part of the data-specific
recommendations below. Conscious of the time and effort that monitoring requires, however,
we also prioritize particular indicators, based on the nature of the strategies themselves and
MPAC-prioritized key actions.

Measurement and Context

The second set of recommendations centers on the benefits of coupling quantitative indicator
measurement with qualitative performance assessment (including survey and interview data),
timely project and policy implementation data (including project costs), and risk assessment.
The use of supportive qualitative data provides valuable contextual information and has three
primary purposes, ordered in level of increasing complexity:

    (1) Maintaining updated records on project status and policy implementation / adoption;
    (2) Triangulating quantitative results (confirming apparent trends); and
    (3) Determining underlying root causes of observed outcomes.

First, there is a clear need to collect and maintain updated records on the statuses of MPAC-
related infrastructure projects (e.g., current status of AHN upgrading, port developments, etc.),
as the last publicly available records date to 2012. This recommendation calls back into play
the earliest mode of the ACIM in suggesting the compilation of key action and priority project

                                                                                             126
progress reports. Further, ASEAN should create and maintain an updated log of the status of
Member States’ adoption and implementation of policies and processes attached to MPAC
strategies and key actions. This is particularly salient for institutional Connectivity strategies
that specify the adoption of ASEAN agreements and standardizations and for strategies that
call for the creation of agreements and action plans. At present, for example, there is no
publicly available register of each Member States’ adoption, ratification, and implementation
of key MPAC policies on air liberalization, multi-modal transport, etc. It is also important that
ASEAN collect and maintain updated and consolidated information on projected and actual
project costs and benefits to allow for meaningful cost-benefit comparisons. At present, the
costs of many proposed projects are unknown, not published, our outdated.

In addition to project updates, several strategies are particularly suited to qualitative data and
process evaluation. Most apparently, institutional Strategy 10, which calls for strengthening
institutional capacity, would best be assessed through perception survey data. But strategies
with clear quantitative indicators also benefit from additional qualitative data. For example,
maritime sector development is complex, with many component parts. Contextual, qualitative
information on significant issues, gains, and barriers to network expansion and port
development, coupled with quantitative analysis, can generate useful information sets on
which to base future policy decisions. This information should be generated from targeted
reporting at the project level. Another final contribution of qualitative assessment is expert
assessment of risks associated with the full implementation of MPAC strategies and key
actions. In practice, this can be done by using the existing Connectivity Status Report
framework. Prospective risk assessment, even if only qualitative, would help inform policy re-
calibration and identify cases where excessive risk affects performance. In those cases, efforts
can shift towards managing risks to promote improve sector and strategy performance.

Data Requirements

Identified data needs relate to the multi-level framing issues described above as well as to
technical problems of untimely, incomplete, or un-harmonized data. Due to data limitations,
both the specificity and completeness of indicators and the ability to model impacts of
particular MPAC initiatives on both Connectivity and Community-building is limited. The
current ACIM (in its form herein) makes best use of publicly available data collected by ASEAN
Stats and AJTP and also draws on other sources, including the World Bank, UN ESCAP, and
industry. Nevertheless, much of the data required to assess strategic performance is
incomplete or not collected, requiring use of proxy indicators.

                                                                                              127
With respect to data quality, one concern relates to harmonization. The issue of measurement
and reporting harmonization is pronounced, for example, in the case of energy trade data
(electricity and gas), where large data asymmetries in Intra-ASEAN imports and exports are
observed. This is problematic for two reasons: (1) it limits the ability to compare progress
across Member States or give a dependable account of ASEAN trends in energy trade; and
(2) it renders the data unusable for econometric modeling that might otherwise allow an
assessment of the role MPAC strategies and key projects (e.g., ATP and TAGP) have had on
energy trade flows. The ASEAN Stats office is currently addressing the issue of Member State
data harmonization to promote consistent definition of reported statistics.

Another concern relates to timeliness, regularity, and availability of data. Much of the data on
trade by transport sector (e.g., cargo throughput by river, exports by rail, etc.) is missing,
irregular, or too outdated for use to evaluate Connectivity improvements during the MPAC
period. Many figures are reported only to 2012 or 2013, whilst others are missing entirely.
Improved and timelier submission of AJTP statistics, in particular, would allow better tracking
of physical Connectivity performance. One major shortfall is the lack of baseline statistics with
which to compare progress. Another issue relates to disaggregating network extensions and
expansions from upgrading and reclassification. With respect to AHN development, for
example, the UN ESCAP database reports the length of AHN roads by class, but it is not
known what portion of increases per road class category are attributable to new construction,
upgrading works, or simply the addition of existing roads to the AHN network by re-
classification. As such, existing AHN statistics do not directly and specifically reflect progress
on the stated key actions.

Building infrastructure asset registers and registers that track ratification and implementation
of key agreements could be a helpful solution to these data issues. Asset registers could
incorporate geographic information on the physical and financial attributes of infrastructures
as well as inventories and conditional assessments. National asset registers could be used to
track the extension and improvement of segments of the AHN and SKRL over time, as well as
port capacity and development, inland waterways development projects, and targeted ICT and
energy transmission projects.

Moreover, it is important that ASEAN gather updated information on the projected costs of
Connectivity projects to allow for meaningful comparison of costs and projected benefits. This
is a key weakness in the current system of MPAC monitoring and oversight, and a critical input
to future Connectivity planning.

                                                                                              128
The ongoing monitoring and evaluation of Connectivity should also be aligned with existing
reporting and data collection processes within ASEAN. It is recommended that ASEAN build
upon and coordinate existing organizational structures within various ASEAN bodies to reduce
costs of data collection and increase the likelihood of coherence in official data on various
aspects of Connectivity.

The table below (Table 16) outlines suggestions for improved data collection across the
output, outcome, and impact levels. The indicators in black font are those currently in use in
the ACIM, as it is applied in the 2015 M&E report. Indicators in gray font are those for which
either data is currently unavailable, partial, or significantly outdated.

Additionally, application of econometric models that consider specific key actions as
independent variables and outputs as dependent variables would determine the impact of
MPAC, specifically, on measures of Connectivity as well as on higher-level impacts such as
safety, people mobility, and economic development. For example, time series regression
could be used to demonstrate the impact of MPAC on border facilitation by taking time and
cost to transition over land borders as dependent variables and the imposition of key MPAC
components (e.g., a Single Windows program, bilateral customs harmonization, established
agreements on cross-border inspection, etc.) as independent variables (alongside standard
determinants like economy size). This would require, however, specific records on the timing
of implementation of process and rule changes. Similarly, the dates of implementation of
agreements or process revisions could be used to model the impact of MPAC key actions on
trade, both sector-specifically and generally.

Lastly, the importance of coordination and commitment of Member States to the Connectivity
initiative cannot be underestimated. While there is no data available to assess the degree of
cooperation and harmonization across Member States as it relates to Connectivity, ASEAN
should critically examine its rules, processes, and accountability mechanisms at the
programmatic level to identify opportunities to strengthen commitments to adopted plans,
including those in the realm of infrastructure development and Connectivity. The successful
implementation of plans for ASEAN Connectivity relies, perhaps most importantly, on the
credible commitment and accountability of Member States to ASEAN’s vision for Integration
and improved Connectivity. Given the non-binding nature of the ASEAN organization, sound
information gleaned via the monitoring system is itself an important tool for holding Member
States accountable to agreed plans.

The ACIM has become an increasingly useful tool to objectively assess the attainment of
ASEAN Connectivity measures, particularly via the inclusion of a set of quantitative indicators.
Nevertheless, there is a clear path ahead to improve the M&E program. The table above
summarizes a basic information set needed to track progress at the output and outcome levels
and model MPAC’s contribution to regional economic and social impacts. The analysis also
suggests that, while strategy-level assessment is important to guiding policy, impacts and
opportunities for re-calibration will originate from the project level. These and other
recommendations in this report give guidance as ASEAN embarks on building the monitoring
and evaluation framework for the Post-2015 agenda for ASEAN Connectivity and the ASEAN
Community 2025.

Doing Business                         Doing Business measures the time and cost (excluding tariffs) associated with exporting and importing a standardized cargo
The Wor1d Bank                         of goods by sea transport. The time and cost necessary to complete 4 predefined stages (document preparation; customs
h:HI2:/Iwww.doingbusi ness.org         clearance and inspections; inland transport and handling; and port and terminal handling) for exporting and importing the
                                       goods are recorded; however, the time and cost for sea transport are not included. All documents needed by the trader to
                                       export or import the goods across the border are also recorded. The process of exporting goods ranges from packing the
                                       goods into the container at the warehouse to their departure from the port of exit. The process of importing goods ranges
                                       from the vessel's arrival at the port of entry to the cargo's delivery at the warehouse. For landlocked economies, since the
                                       seaport is located in the transit economy, the time, cost and documents associated with the processes at the inland border
                                       are also included. It is assumed that the payment is made by letter of credit, and the time, cost and documents required for
                                       the issuance or advising of a letter of credit are taken into account.
                                       Local freight forwarders, shipping lines, customs brokers, port officials and banks provide information on required
                                       documents, cost and time to export and import. To make the data comparable across economies, several assumptions
                                       about the business and the traded goods are used.
                                       The indicators applied include:

Liner Shipping Connectivity Index              The Liner Shipping Connectivity Index captures how well countries are connected to global shipping networks. It is computed
The Wortd Bank                                 by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development {UNCTAD) based on five components of the maritime transport
h:t!R:IIdata.wortdbank.orglindicatoriiS.SHP.   sector: number of ships, their container-canying capacity, maximum vessel size, number of services, and number of
GCNW.XQ                                        companies that deploy container ships in a country's ports. For each component a country's value is divided by the maximum
                                               value of each component in 2004, the five components are averaged for each country, and the average is divided by the
                                               maximum average for 2004 and multiplied by 100. The index generates a value of 100 for the country with the highest average
                                               index in 2004. The underlying data come from Containerisation International Online.
Logistics Perfonmance Index                    The logistics performance {LPI) is the weighted average of the country scores on the six key dimensions:

2008-2014                                      partner institutes. The 2009 round included more than 13,000 respondents from 133 countries. Sampling follows a dual
                                               stratification based on company size and the sector of activity. Data are collected online or through in-person interviews.
                                               Responses are aggregated using sector-weighted averaging. The data for the latest year are combined with the data for
                                               the previous year to create a two-year moving average. Scores range from 1 (infrastructure considered extremely

Annex 6. Technical Notes: Geographical Simulation Model

The IDE-GSM 29 analyzes impacts of specific infrastructure projects and transport and trade-
related policy measures on a regional economy at the sub-national level. The model is multi-
regional and multi-sectoral, featuring agriculture, five manufacturing sectors, and the services
sector, with goods tradable across sectors. The model accommodates worker mobility within
countries and between sectors. Although transport of agricultural goods is assumed to be
costless, transport of manufactured goods and services are assumed to be of the iceberg
type. 30 The theoretical foundation follows Puga and Venables (1996), except that, for
agriculture, it explicitly incorporates land size in production and set technology as featuring
constant returns to scale. 31

The simulation model is used to determine twelve values of the following regional variables:
nominal wage rates in three sectors; land rent; regional income; regional expenditure on
manufactured goods; price index of manufactured goods and of services; average real wage

   If one unit of a product is sent from one location to another, only a portion of the unit arrives. Depending on the
lost portion, the supplier sets a higher price. The increase in price compared to the manufacturer’s price is regarded
as the transport cost. Transport costs within the same region are considered to be negligible.

                                                                                                                 151
rates in three sectors; population share of a location in a country; and population shares of a
sector in three industries within one location.

The dynamics of labor are decided by three differential equations. Nominal wage rates in
agriculture sector are derived from cost minimization, subject to the production function of the
agriculture sector

          f A (r )     AA (r ) L A (r ) F (r )1

where AA ( r ) is the efficiency of production at location r; L A ( r ) represents the labor inputs of
the agriculture sector at location r; and F (r ) is the area of arable land at location r. Since the
price of an agricultural good is the same in all locations, nominal wage rates in the agriculture
sector in location r, which is expressed as w A ( r ) , are the value of the marginal product for
labor input as follows:

                                               1
                                    F (r )
          w A (r )     AA ( r )
                                    L A (r )

When used with the production amount, land rents are not used explicitly.

Regional incomes correspond to regional GDPs. Supposing that revenues from land at
location r belong to households at location r, GDP at location r is expressed as follows:

         Y (r )      wM ( r ) L M ( r )   f A (r ) w S (r ) LS (r )

where wM (r ) and wS (r ) are, respectively, nominal wage rates in the manufacturing 32 and

services sectors at location r, and LM (r ) and LS (r ) are labor inputs of the manufacturing

sector and the services sector at location r, respectively.

Regional expenditure on manufactured goods at location r, which is expressed as E ( r ) ,
consists of household purchases as final consumption and manufacturing firms as
intermediary consumption:

                                    1
         E (r )        M   Y (r )          wM ( r ) L M ( r )




32 In the actual model, the manufacturing sector is divided into 5 sub-sectors. So, the subscript M
consists of M1 to M5. For simplicity, these subsectors are represented as a group by the “Manufacturing” sector in
this description
                                                                                                             152
where       M   is the consumption share of expenditures on manufactured goods and                                                          is the
input share of labor in output. Thus, the first term shows expenditure on manufactured goods,
and the last term expresses expenditure on manufactured goods as an intermediary purchase,
since 1               shows the share of intermediary purchases in the output of manufacturing firms.

The price index of manufactured goods at location r is expressed as follows:

                                                                                                                                   1

        M
where Trs stands for the iceberg transport costs from location r to location s for manufactured

goods and             M   is the elasticity of substitution between any two differentiated manufactured
goods.

To derive (2.5), we substitute the price of manufactured goods and the number of varieties
with the minimum cost of purchasing a unit of the manufacturing aggregate. Manufacturing
firms at location r produce using the composite of labor and manufacturing aggregate. The
technology for the composite requirements is the same for all varieties and in all locations and
is expressed as a linear function of production quantity with a fixed input requirement. The
price of manufactured goods is set as:

 p M (r )   wM (r ) GM (r )1 / AM (r )

where wM ( r ) is the nominal wage of the manufacturing sector at location r, and G M ( r ) is the
price index of manufactured goods at location r. Here, the marginal input requirement is
supposed to equal to the price-cost markup. The supply of a variety is decided by the zero-
profit condition. The quantity of supply depends on the size of the fixed input requirement.
Using the supply of manufactured goods and choosing the size of the fixed input requirement
adequately, the number of manufacturing firms at a location is determined by using the relation
between the share of                    labor input and the demand for manufactured goods. As a first step,
the price index of manufactured goods is derived from the expenditure minimization of a
constant-elasticity-of-substitution function.

The price index of services at location r is expressed as follows:
                                                                                         1

        S
where Trs is the iceberg transport costs from location r to location s, for services,                       S   is the

elasticity of substitution between any two differentiated services. We choose the production
units of a firm that equals the inverse of the consumption share of services. Note that the
derivation processes are slightly different. Using only labor, the technology is the same for all
varieties and in all locations is expressed as a linear function of production quantity with a
fixed input requirement. The price of services is set as

 p S (r ) wS (r ) / AS (r )

where wS ( r ) is the nominal wage of the service sector at location r and AS ( r ) is the

production efficiency of the service sector at location r. The number of varieties of services is
decided from the equality of wage payment and the expenditure share of labor at location r.

The nominal wage in the manufacturing sector at location r is expressed as follows:
                                                                                       1

Similarly, nominal wages in the service sector are expressed as follows:
                                                                  1

From (2.1) to (2.8), the variables are decided using a given configuration of labor. Derived
regional GDP, nominal wage rates, and price indexes are used to determine labor’s decision
on a working sector and place. The dynamics for labor to decide on a specific sector within a
location is expressed as follows:



                                       , I       { A, M , S} ,

where      I   (r ) is the change in labor (population) share for a sector within a location,                   I   is a

parameter used to determine the speed of switching jobs in a location,                     I   ( r ) is the real wage

                                                                                                                    154
rate of any sector at location r, and            (r ) is the average real wage rate at location r. The
population share for a sector in a country is expressed as:

                     LI ( r )
 I   ( r)
            LA ( r ) LM ( r ) LS ( r ) .

The dynamics of labor migration between regions is expressed as follows:




where        L   (r ) is the change in the labor (population) share of a location in a country,     L   is the

parameter for determining the speed of migration between locations, and                      L   ( r ) is the
population share of a location in a country.           (r ) shows the real wage rate of a location and
is specified as follows:

            Y (r) /(LA ( r) LM (r) LS ( r))
  ( r)
                     GM ( r ) GS ( r )      ,

where            shows the consumption share of services. Furthermore,            C   shows the average

real wage rate at location r. Notice that labor migration is affected by per capita regional GDP
and price index.

Data

Data for IDE/GSM cover eighteen Asian countries/economies and 66 additional countries
worldwide. The eighteen countries/economies are divided into 1,792 regions, while country
data is used for the rest of the world. In total, we have 1,858 regions in the model. Primarily
based on official statistics, we derive gross regional domestic product (GRDP) for the
agriculture sector, five manufacturing sectors, and the service sector for 2005. The five
manufacturing sectors are automotive, electronics and electric appliances, garment and
textile, food processing, and other manufacturing. Population and area of arable land for each
region are compiled from multiple statistical sources.

The administrative unit adopted in the simulation is one level below the national level for
Cambodia, Japan, Korea, the Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and
Vietnam. For Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Myanmar, the administrative unit is
two levels below the national level. Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong, Macao, and Singapore
are treated as one unit, respectively. The United States and European Union are included as
                                                                                       155
one unit, respectively. In this version of IDE-GSM, we introduce countries other than East
Asia, although most lack geographical dimension—i.e., the capital city represents the
respective country.

Specifically, our data sources include several types of census or surveys conducted in each
country. Some unique data sources are featured. For Cambodia, we use estimates of
provincial income and labor employed in primary, secondary, and tertiary industries based on
Cambodia’s socioeconomic survey conducted between 2003 and 2005. Those estimates are
provided by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Provincial-level figures for the Lao
PDR were obtained from unpublished annual provincial reports concerning implementation of
their socioeconomic plan. For India, manufacturing GRDP for five sectors was compiled from
the value added by industry with the India Annual Survey of Industries. Provincial data for
Myanmar are drawn from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey published by the
Central Statistical Organization. Even with these sources, we cannot obtain separate GRDP
for five manufacturing sectors for some countries. In these cases, sector-level GRDP is
derived by multiplying provincial-level GRDP of the total manufacturing industry by the share
of each sector’s national GDP.

Parameters

Transport cost comprises physical transport costs, time costs, tariff rates, and non-tariff
barriers (TNTBs). Physical transport costs are a function of distance traveled, travel speed per
hour, physical travel cost per kilometer, and holding costs for domestic / international trans-
shipment at border crossings, stations, ports, or airports. Time costs depend on travel
distance, travel speed per hour, time cost per hour, and holding time for domestic /
international transshipment at border crossings, stations, ports, or airports.

Travel speed per hour is provided in the next section. These parameters are derived from the
ASEAN Logistics Network Map 2008 by JETRO and by estimating the model of the firm-level
transport mode choice with the “Establishment Survey on Innovation and Production Network”
(ERIA) for 2008 and 2009, which includes manufacturers in Indonesia, the Philippines,
Thailand, and Vietnam. Based on these parameters, we calculate the sum of physical
transport and time costs for all possible routes between two regions. Employing the Floyd-
Warshall algorithm for determining the optimal route and transport mode for each region and
good, we obtain the sum of physical transport and time costs for each pairing of two regions
by industry (Cormen et al., 2001).

We assume that firms choose a transportation mode from among the following three: air, sea,
and land:

                                                  M                               M

where    M   denotes unobservable mode characteristics, while Abroadji takes unity if regions i
and j belong to different countries and zero otherwise; dji is the geographical distance between
regions i and j. us is industry dummy. When                   M   is independent and follows the identical type I
extreme value distribution across modes, the probability that the firm chooses mode M is given
by:

                                                      eU M
Pr Yi    M | Abroad ji , ln d ji
                                     1 e U Air         eU Truck     e U Sea
for M = Air, Sea, Truck.                       (2.12)

The coefficients are estimated by maximum likelihood procedures. In other words, a
multinomial logit (MNL) model is used to estimate the probability that a firm chooses one of
the three transportation modes: air, sea, and truck. In the following, truck is a base mode.

The geographical distance affects firms’ modal choices through not only a per-unit physical
charge for shipments but also shipping time costs due to the nature of demand for shipments.
Transportation time has a larger influence on the price of products that decay rapidly over
time; for example, time-sensitive products include perishable goods (fresh vegetables), new
information goods (newspapers) and specialized intermediate inputs (parts for Just-In-Time
production). A lengthy shipping time may lead to a complete loss of commercial opportunity
for products and their components, which is more likely to be significant for goods with a rapid
product life cycle and high demand volatility. Given the value of timeliness in selling a product,
time costs are small for timely shipments (short transport time). In other words, time costs will
be the highest for shipping by sea and the lowest for shipping by air. On the other hand, the
physical transport costs will be highest for air and the lowest for sea. Truck transport will have
a medium level of costs comparing air and sea transport. As a result, the coefficient for the
geographical distance represents the (average) difference in the sum of the above two kinds
of transport costs (time and physical transportation) per distance between truck and air/sea.

Furthermore, three points are noteworthy. First, as mentioned above, shipping time costs
obviously differ amongst industries. Such differences are controlled by introducing intercepts
of industry dummy variables (us) with distance variables. Second, the level of port
infrastructure is obviously different among countries. This yields different impacts of the
                                                                                        157
aforementioned two kinds of transport costs among shipping countries. To control such
differences among countries in which reporting firms locate, we introduce country dummy
variables (vk). Last, qualitative differences between intra- and international transactions are
controlled by introducing a binary variable (Abroad), taking unity if transactions are
international ones and zero if otherwise.

Our main data source is the Establishment Survey on Innovation and Production Network for
selected manufacturing firms in four countries in East Asia for 2008 and 2009 (Table 13). The
four countries covered in the survey were Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
The sample population is restricted to select manufacturing hubs in each country
(JABODETABEK area, i.e., Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi, for Indonesia;
CALABARZON area, i.e., Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon, for the Philippines;
Greater Bangkok area for Thailand; and Hanoi area and Ho Chi Minh City for Vietnam). This
dataset includes information on the mode of transport that each firm chooses in supplying its
main product and sourcing its main intermediate inputs. From there, the products’ origin and
destination can be identified. In our analysis, however, the combination of origin and
destination is restricted to one accessible by land transportation.

With respect to firms’ choices of transportation modes, Table 17 reports the combination of
trading partners in our dataset. There are three noteworthy points here. First, as mentioned
above, firms in the Philippines and Indonesia are restricted to those with intra-national
transactions, although most firms in other countries in our dataset are also engaged in intra-
national transactions. Second, a large number of Vietnamese firms trade with China. Third,
Table 17 shows the transportation mode by the location of firms, indicating that most sample

firms tend to choose truck. Intuitively, this may be consistent with the fact that most of firms
trade domestically.

The multinomial logit regression result in Table 19 shows three noteworthy findings. First, in
trading with partners abroad, firms are likely to choose air or sea. Second, the coefficients for
distance are estimated to be significantly positive, indicating that the larger the distance
between trading partners, the more likely firms are to choose air or sea. Specifically, this result
implies that transport costs per distance are lower in air and sea than in truck. Third, the
intercept term of distance in machinery industries has a significantly positive coefficient for air.
This result may indicate the large amount of time costs in the machinery industry.

Lastly, we conduct some simulations to get a more accurate picture of transportation modal
choice. Specifically, employing our estimators, we calculate the distance between trading
partners in which the two transportation modes become indifferent in terms of their probability.
For example, suppose that a firm in the food industry in Bangkok trades with a partner located
                                                                                                               159
in another city. Our calculation reveals how far the city is from Bangkok if the probability of
choosing air/sea is equal to that of choosing truck. In the calculation, we set Abroad to the
value of one, i.e., international transactions. The results are reported in Table 20. In Bangkok,
for example, firms in the machinery industry choose air or sea if their trading partners are
located more than 400 km away. On the other hand, firms in the food industry basically only
use truck.

We estimate some parameters necessary for calculating transport costs. Specifically, we
estimate transportation speed and holding time. Our strategy for estimating those is very
straightforward and simple. We regress the following equation:

TimeijM =    0   +   1 Abroadij
                               M
                                   +    2 Distanceij
                                                    M
                                                        +   ij
                                                                 M
                                                                 .
                        M           M
The coefficients       0 and       1 represent     mode M’s holding time in domestic transportation and
                                                                                                   M
its additional time in international transportation, respectively. The inverse of                 2 indicates   the
average transportation speed in mode M. We use the same data as in the previous section.
However, the estimation in this section does not require us to restrict our sample to firms with
transactions between regions accessible by truck.

The OLS regression results are reported in Table 21. Although some of the holding time
                          M              M
coefficients, i.e.,      0    and       1 ,   are estimated as being insignificant, their magnitude is
reasonable enough. As for the distance coefficient, its magnitude in sea and truck is
reasonable, but that in air is disappointing and too far from the intuitive speed, say, around
800 km/h. One possible reason is that “time” in our dataset always includes the land
transportation time to airport. This will cause the air transportation speed to be understated.

We specify a simple linear transport cost function, which consists of physical transport costs
and time costs. We assume the behavior of the representative firm for each industry as follows:

          A representative firm in the machinery industry will make a choice between
          truck and air transport and choose the mode with the higher probability in (2.12).
          A representative firm in the other industries will make a choice between truck
          and sea transport and choose the mode with the higher probability in (2.12).
Specifically, the transport cost in industry s by mode M between regions i and j is assumed to
be expressed as:

  s ,M

where distij is the travel distance between regions i and j, speedM is travel speed per one hour
by mode M, cdistM is physical travel cost per one kilometer by mode M, and ctimes is time cost
per one hour perceived by firms in industry s. The parameters ttransMDom and ctransMDom are
the holding time and cost, respectively, for domestic transshipment at ports or airports.
Similarly, ttransMIntl and ctransMIntl are the holding time and cost, respectively, for international
transshipment at borders, ports, or airports.

The parameters in the transport function are determined as follows. Firstly, by using the
parameters obtained from the results of estimation and borrowing some parameters from the
ASEAN Logistics Network Map 2008 by JETRO, we set some of the parameters in the

                                                                                                                          161
transport function. Notice that our estimates of SpeedAir and ttransAirIntl in Table 6 went beyond
our expectations. Thus, we set SpeedAir at the usual level (800 km/h) and we made ttransAirIntl
consistent with the ASEAN Logistics Network Map 2008.

Table 22. Parameters from estimation and ASEAN Logistics Network Map 2008               Secondly, after substituting
those parameters for the equation (2.13) under domestic transportation, Cijs,M becomes a
function of distij and ctimes. To meet the above-mentioned assumptions on firms’ behavior, we
add the following conditions:

Notes: Costs are for a 20-foot container. The parameter ctransMDom is assumed to be half of the sum of border costs and
transshipment costs in international transport from Bangkok to Hanoi. The parameter sttransMDom and ctransMDom for sea and air
include one-time loading at the origin and one-time unloading at the destination.


          The transport cost using trucks becomes the lowest among the three modes
          when distij is zero for each industry.
          If the transport cost is depicted as a function of distij, a line is drawn by the
          function where truck intersects with it at only one point for air and sea for the
          machinery industry, and at only one point for the other industries with all non-
          negative distij.

Under the probability equivalent (domestic) distances, the transport cost Cs,Air should be equal
to Cs,Truck in machineries, and Cs,Sea should be equal to Cs,Truck in the other industries. By using
this equality, we calculate ctimes for each industry as in Table 23. The functions meet the
above conditions.

Thirdly, by substituting these parameters again, including ctimes and ctransTruckIntl under
international transportation, Cijs,Truck becomes a function of only distij, and Cijs,M for air and sea
becomes a function of distij and ctransMIntl. Then by using the probability equivalent
(international) distances again, we can calculate ctransAirIntl and ctransSeaIntl for each industry.

                                                                                                                        162
Lastly, ctransSeaIntl is uniquely set as the average among the other industries. The functions
obtained also fulfill the above conditions.

Additionally, ttransDom and speed of railway are estimated by the same dataset and the same
estimating equation. Due to the minimal usage of railways in international transactions in the
dataset, we adopted the same value for the time and cost of international transactions as in
trucks. Finally, we set the cost per km as half the value of road transport. 33

The sum of tariff and non-tariff barriers (TNTB) by countries is estimated by employing the
“log odds ratio approach”, which is initiated by Head and Mayer (2000). Namely, we estimate
the industry-level border barriers for each country (not each subnational region). This
approach looks more appropriate than other approaches because the theoretical model
underlying on this approach is basically same as our GSM. We estimate for the ratio of
“consumption of products from country j in country i (Xij)” to “consumption of products from
country i in country i (Xii)”. For brevity, we omit an industry subscript. Specifically, such a ratio
is given by the following.


                                           =


n, a, t, , and p represent the mass of varieties, a parameter on preference weight, transport
costs, elasticity of substitution across varieties, and product prices, respectively.




33
   The ASEAN Logistics Network Map 2008 offers an example where the cost per km for railway is 0.85 times that of trucks.
However, it is only for the case when we ship a quantity that can be loaded onto a truck. Railway has much larger economies of
scale than trucks in terms of shipping volume so some industries such as coal haulage incur much lower cost per ton kilometer.
Therefore, we need to deduct this from the value in the ASEAN Logistics Network Map 2008.

                                                                                                                        163
To estimate this model with available data, we assume the following. First, the mass of
varieties is assumed to be related to GDP size. Second, we assume that the ratio of preference
parameters is explained by linguistic commonality (Language), colonial relationship (Colony),
and geographical contiguity (Contiguity). These variables are binary. Third, the transport costs
are assumed as the following:

                        ln       =        +      ln                   +       ln

Borderij shows the TNTB while Distanceij is the geographical distance between countries i and
j. The domestic distance, i.e., Distanceii, is computed as the following.

                                                          2
                                                      =
                                                          3

  and Area are circular constant and surface area, respectively. Cost is the sum of physical
transport costs and time costs, of which computation is explained before. Last, product prices
are assumed to be a function of wages, for which GDP per capita is used as a proxy.

Under these assumptions, the above equation can be rewritten as follows.

 ln       =    ln            +             +                  +                    +   ln


                    +   ln       +   ln                           +       +

ui shows fixed effects for country i and, from the theoretical point of view, the log value of
product between Border and (1         ). Therefore, we compute the TNTB by employing the
estimates for these fixed effects and the elasticity of substitution. The estimation is conducted
for agriculture, manufacturing, and services separately. In the case of manufacturing, we
estimate the model by pooling the data for five sectors under controlling for sector fixed effects.

We estimate the above model for the year 2007. The consumption data are obtained from the
GTAP 8 Data Base. The data on GDP and GDP per capita are obtained from World
Development Indicator (World Bank). Those on geographical distance and three dummy
variables on preferences are from CEPII database. With this methodology, we estimate
industry-level fixed effects for 69 countries.

The estimation results by ordinary least square (OLS) method are reported in Table 26. Almost
all variables have the significant coefficients with expected signs though the coefficients for
GDP per capita ratio are positively significant in manufacturing and services. This estimation
                                                                                               164
provides us the estimates on industry-level fixed effects for 69 countries. In order to obtain
those in the other countries, we assume that those in each country are highly correlated with
her GDP per capita and regress (log of) GDP per capita in addition to industry dummy
variables on the estimates of these fixed effects. The estimation results are the following.
                                          17.797 + 1.245 * ln GDP per capita + 1.365 * Food
        + 2.555 * Textile + 2.052 * Electric Machinery + 1.569 * Automobile


The number of observations is 483. The adjusted R-squared is 0.7386. The base for industry
dummy variables is agriculture. Using the estimation results and the data on GDP per capita,
we predict industry-level fixed effects for other 126 countries. As a result, we obtain those for
195 countries in total. Applying the elasticity of substitution to these estimates, we compute
the tariff equivalent of TNTB.

Next, we obtain NTBs by subtracting tariff rates from TNTB. Our data source for tariff rates is
World Integrated Trade Solution, particularly TRAINS (Trade Analysis and Information
System) raw data. For each trading pair, we aggregate the lowest tariff rates among all
available tariff schemes at the tariff-line level into single tariff rates for each industry by taking
a simple average. Available tariff schemes include multilateral free trade agreements (FTAs)
(e.g., ASEAN+1 FTAs) and bilateral FTAs (e.g., China–Singapore FTA) alongside other
schemes such as the Generalized System of Preferences. Moreover, we somewhat take into
account the gradual tariff elimination schedule in six ASEAN + 1 FTAs in addition to AFTA
(ASEAN free trade area). For example, in the case of ASEAN–Japan Comprehensive
Economic Partnership (AJCEP), tariff rates among member countries began to gradually
decline from 2008. Tariff rates in Japan and ASEAN forerunners against members are for
simplicity assumed to linearly decrease to become final rates in 2018, and those for ASEAN
latecomers decrease linearly to final rates in 2026. 34 “Final rates” takes into account the final
rates set in each agreement. Namely, even if tariff rates for a product were not zero in 2009,
they are set to zero in 2026 if they involve preferential products. We obtain information about
whether each product finally attains zero rates in ASEAN + 1 FTAs from the FTA database
developed in ERIA. We set final rates for all products in the case of AFTA at zero due to the
lack of such information. As a result, we obtain separately (bilateral) tariff rates and (importer-
specific) NTBs by industry on a tariff-equivalent basis. Finally, our total transport costs are the
product of the sum of physical transport and time costs and the sum of tariff rates and NTBs.

Another important setting on transport cost is the “cumulation rule” in multilateral FTAs,
particularly ASEAN+1 FTAs and AFTA. There are several types of cumulation rules: bilateral,
diagonal, and full. Some scholarly studies try to quantify the trade creation effect of diagonal
cumulation. Particularly in Hayakawa (2012), which examines Thai exports to Japan, the tariff
equivalent of the diagonal cumulation rule in AJCEP is estimated at 3%. Based on this
estimate, we formalize the effect of diagonal cumulation among ASEAN+1 FTAs as 3% below
NTBs in trading among members, after each FTA’s entry into force.

We adopt the elasticity of substitution for manufacturing sectors from Hummels (1999) and
estimate it for services as 5.1 for FoodProc, 8.4 for Textile, 8.8 for E&E, 7.1 for Auto, 5.3 for
OtherMfg, and 5.0 for services. Estimates for elasticity of services are obtained from the
estimation of the usual gravity equation for services trade, including the independent variables
importer GDP, exporter GDP, importer corporate tax, geographical distance between

countries, a dummy for free trade agreements, a linguistic commonality dummy, and the
colonial dummy. The elasticity for services is obtained from the transformation of a coefficient
for the corporate tax because it changes prices of services directly. For this estimation, we
mainly employ data from OECD Statistics on International Trade in Services.

Parameters , , and        are obtained as follows. The consumption share of consumers by
industry ( ) is uniformly determined for the entire region in the model. It would be more realistic
to change the share by country or region, but we cannot do so because we lack sufficiently
reliable consumption data. Therefore, the consumption share by industry is set to be identical
to the industry’s share of GDP for the entire region as follows: 0.0800 for agriculture, 0.0322
for FoodProc, 0.0243 for Textile, 0.0201 for E&E, 0.0232 for Auto, 0.1729 for OtherMfg, and
                                                                            ) is uniformly applied
for the entire region and the entire time period in the model. Although it may differ among
countries/regions and across years, we use an “average” value, in this case that of Thailand
as a country in the middle-stage of economic development, which is again taken from the
Asian International Input Output Table 2000 by IDE. As a result, the parameter of         is 0.367
for agriculture, 0.204 for FoodProc, 0.346 for Textile, 0.367 for E&E, 0.379 for Auto, 0.267 for
OtherMfg, and 0 for services.

Simulation Procedure

This sub-section explains our simulation procedures, which are depicted in Figure 100. First,
with given distributions of employment and regional GDP by sector and regions, short-run
equilibrium is obtained. The equilibrium nominal wages, price indices, output and GDP by
region are calculated. Observing the achieved equilibrium, workers migrate among regions.
Workers migrate to from the regions with lower real wages to the regions with higher real
wages. Within a region, workers moves from lower wage industries to higher wage industries.
One thing we need to note is that the process of this adjustment is gradual, and the real wages
between regions and industries are not equalized immediately. After the migration process,
we obtain the new distribution of workers and economic activities. With this new distribution
and predicted population growth, the next short-run equilibrium is obtained for a following year,
and we observe the migration process again. These computations are iterated for 15 years
from 2010 to 2025.

To calculate the economic impacts of specific TTFMs, we take the differences of GRDPs
between the baseline scenario and a specific scenario with TTFMs. The baseline scenario
contains minimal additional infrastructure development after 2005. On the other hand, the
alternative scenario contains specific TTFMs in 2015, for example, according to the
information on the future implementation plans of TTFMs.

We compare the RGDPs between two scenarios typically at 2030. If the RGDP of a region
under the scenario with TTFMs is higher (lower) than that under the baseline scenario, we
regard this surplus (deficit) as the positive (negative) economic impacts by the TTFMs.

A notable merit of calculation of the economic impacts by taking difference between scenarios
is the stability of the results. The economic indices forecasted by a simulation depend on
various parameters while the differences of the economic indices are quite stable regardless
of the changes of the parameters.

The following section identifies assumptions defining each simulated scenario.

        National population of each country is assumed to increase at the rate forecast by the
        UN Population Division until year 2030.
        International migration is prohibited.
        TNTBs are changing on the basis of FTA/EPAs currently in effect.
        Each country is assigned different exogenous growth rates based on country-level,
        industry-specific technological productivity parameters. A productivity parameter ‘A’ is
        determined by education / skill level; regional logistics infrastructure; regional

                                                                                            168
       communications infrastructure; electricity and water supply; firm equipment; and the
       utilization ratio / efficiency of infrastructure and equipment.

We exogenously increase A for 18 countries/regions in East Asia, according to the rate that
replicate the actual economic growth in these countries during 2005 and onward. For other
countries, we give different growth rate of A for advanced, middle-income, and low-income
countries. Typically, growth rates for each country group are 1%, 3%, and 5%, respectively.
Note that A contains broader factors than TFP because our model omits capital as an input.

In the baseline scenario, transport settings are unchanged throughout the simulation period
2005–2030, except for some minor updates in 2010 and 2015. For instance, the average
speed of land traffic is set at 38.5 km/h. However, speed on mountainous roads is set to half
(19.25 km/h) and certain roads are set at 60 km/h (specifically, roads in Thailand outside
Bangkok, road from the border of Thailand to Singapore through the west coast of Malaysia,
and roads No. 9 and 13 from Vientiane to Pakse in Laos). The average speed for sea traffic
is set at 14.7 km/h between international class ports and at half that on other routes. Average
air traffic speed is set at 800 km/h between primary airports of each country and at 400 km/h
on other routes. Average railway traffic speed is set at 19.1 km/h.

Trade and Transport Facilitation Measures (TTFMs): We have various trade and transport
costs in the model. By changing these costs, we can replicate TTFMs as follows:

       Upgrading of the road: Increase average speed;
       Customs Facilitation: Reduce time and costs at national borders;
       FTA/RTA: Reduce import tariffs between member countries; and
       Overall improvements of business environments: Reduce NTBs.

SEZ/FTZ: In the model, each industry in each city has a different productivity parameter A. By
increasing this parameter, we can simulate the impacts of setting up SEZ/FTZ for the city. We
can also reduce NTBs for the city to simulate the impacts of SEZ/FTZ.

Natural Disasters: We can reduce the productivity parameter A for select cities to simulate
the impacts of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods.

Annex 7. Technical Notes: Gravity Models of Trade and Air Passenger
Flows

First introduced to model trade flows by Tinbergen (Tinbergen 1962) via simple OLS
regressions with independent variables of economy size and physical distance, the gravity
model of international trade has since been expanded to control for policy, social, and
business factors. It has also been applied extensively to analyze the impacts on immigration
(Lewer and Van den Berg 2008, Karemera, Oguledo, and Davis 2000) and passenger flows
(Grosche, Rothlauf, and Heinzl 2007, Matsumoto 2004).

In its most basic form, the gravity model of trade may be expressed as follows:

       ln Eij         1 lnGDPi   2 lnGDPj     3 ln   Dij

where Eij is the flow of exports from country i to country j                         GDPi is the
log GDP of the exporter i, lnGDPj is the log GDP of the importer j, and ln Dij is the log distance
between the two countries’ capital cities.

The model may be expanded to control for other factors that reduce or increase its “distance”
in non-geographic terms. For example, the sharing of common language or common colonial
ties may reduce the trading distance between partners. For this reason, it is common to
expand the model to the following:

       ln Eij         1 lnGDPi   2 lnGDPj     3 ln   Dij   4 Contigij


where Contigij is a dummy variable for contiguity.

Lastly, the model may control for border management and policy factors that affect trade.
Here, we express a simple further expanded form as:

       ln Eij         1 lnGDPi   2 lnGDPj     3 ln   Dij   4 Contigij   4 TradeFac   5 Policy


where Contigij is a dummy variable for contiguity. TradeFac represents a hypothetical control
variable(s) related to border management or trade facilitation measures, which may be
binomial or continuous. Policy represents a hypothetical dummy variable for the presence or
absence of a particular policy, whose effect is under examination. In the model results
reported in Chapter      TradeFac variables

TradeFac may be one of a set of trade facilitation variables, representing the importer’s and
exporter’s performance with respect to border and customs management and logistics
performance. In the model results below, this may include the Logistics Performance Index

                                                                                                170
scores of the importer and exporter, the Doing Business “Trading Across Borders, Distance
to the Frontier” score for importer and exporter, or the Doing Business “Days to Export/Import”
measures.

Gravity Model of Air Passenger Flows

One of the richest data sets we available, specific to flows between ASEAN Member States,
is the flow of Intra-ASEAN air passengers, drawn from the DiiO Aviation Intelligence database.
We draw on this data set to determine the influence of air liberalization policies coded or
reinforced by MPAC. To model the impacts of MPAC on air passenger flows, we tested the
influence of several key components of ASEAN air liberalization on flows between countries,
based on the granting of air freedoms via ASAM agreements. More specifically, we examine
the influence of the Multilateral Agreement on Air Services (MAAS), the ASEAN Multilateral
Agreement on the Full Liberalisation of Passenger Air Services (MAFLPAS), and the granting
of third freedom rights via other liberalization agreements (e.g., between CLMV, Brunei-
Thailand-Singapore, and Singapore-Malaysia).

The gravity models of air passenger flows are similar to the model specified above for trade,
but with the dependent variable number of annual air passengers between two countries i and
j. In the results table below, the independent variables are coded as follows:

 ln_gdp_exp   Log GDP of exporter (flight / passenger origin country)

 ln_gdp_imp   Log GDP of importer (flight / passenger destination country)

 ln_dist      Log physical distance between country’s capital cities

              Malaysia in 2009; =1 for travel between all ASEAN Member States, except for with Indonesia and

Annex 8. Technical Notes: SVAR Analysis

The SVAR analysis was developed by the Asia Competitiveness Institute, National University
of Singapore. Using data over 2000-2013, the SVAR model links GDP growth rates of 8
economies and 56 bilateral export-share series to generate multiplier effects of a growth shock
in one economy on the growth of others. The 8 economies include ASEAN-5, China, India and
OECD.

Multiplier effects of a growth shock are estimated by capturing the transmission of a growth
shock through both direct and indirect trade channels. The steps to deriving the VAR structure
are as follows:

The first step is to focus on determinants of total output ( Yi ) for an individual country i and

then extend the framework to a system of equations linking all n countries in the sample (with
i 1,2,..., n ). Since we initially focus on only one country, we drop the subscript i to simplify
notation. A country’s output can be written as:

 Y    X      A                                    (1)

where X and A are the export and non-export components of output, respectively. The
country’s total exports can also be expressed as the sum of exports to each of the other n
countries and exports to the rest of the world (ROW):

      n 1
 Y          Xj     A                              (2)
      j 1




Error! Bookmark not defined.where i         j and the index value n 1 indicates ROW. This
condition continues to apply to all of the equations below.

Writing equation (2) in terms of growth rates instead of levels yields:

                   n 1
 dY / Y     1/ Y         dX j   dA                (3)
                   j 1
                                     .

Next, express exports from country i to country j as a reduced-form function of output
(income) of country j :



                                                                                             172

Differentiating (4) yields:

 dX j                  X j / Y j dY j                                             (5)


Next, inserting (5) into (3) and rearranging terms yields:

                                    n 1
 dY / Y                X /Y                    j   X j / X dY j / Y j    dA / Y    (6)
                                    j 1



where             j                X j / Y j Y j / X j is the income elasticity of exports with respect to country j ’s

income. We assume that income elasticities are equal across countries and set                                       j    . Then

adding country and time subscripts and using lower-case letters to indicate growth rates,
equation (6) can be written as:

 y it         i       y itf        u it , i 1,2,..., n                            (7)

in trade linkages.                                   X / Y is assumed to be time-invariant. The omitted variables captured
by u it are likely to be correlated over time as well as across equations. We assume that the

and rewriting (7) in vector format yields:

where A          diag           1   ,       2   ,...,       n      , D L , and D L * are the determinant and adjoint matrices of

D L , respectively, and vt                                          D L * E L et is an n 1 vector. Note that every equation of

(8) has the same autoregressive (AR) polynomial given by D L , while each vit follows a

separate MA process.

Next, we assume that the serial correlation of vit can be captured through an AR structure.

This has the additional benefit of relaxing the constraint that each equation of (8) must follow
the same AR polynomial. Equation (7) can therefore be expressed as an autoregressive
distributed lag model with white noise errors:
                     p                            p

                               wij y jt , i                      j , and wij is the export share from the i th country to country j .
        The entire system of equations is formed by estimating equation (9) for each of the n
        countries in the world. One may consider the similarity of (9) to factor models
        mentioned in Introduction.
Although these n equations appear to take the form of seemingly unrelated regressions
(SUR), they can also be expressed as a structural VAR. This SVAR formulation is useful for
the purpose of estimation, forecasting, and impulse-response analysis. More specifically, if
n 3 and p 1 , then the system of equations can be written as:

Since n is large (14 in our case) the lag length, p 1 , would be sufficient to capture the
dynamics. We use ordinary lease squares (OLS) to estimate the model. Abeysinghe and
Forbes (2005) have experimented with 2SLS and 3SLS and found there was not much gain
over OLS estimates. For a given W , and p 1 the forecasting model can be written as

Data

The complete SVAR model includes 8 GDP series (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, China, India and OECD). For each of these economies we require their
exports to each of the other 7 that makes up a total of 56 bilateral export share series. We
interpolated quarterly GDP series from annual data to fill the missing data in our sample. The
interpolation method, which is adapted from the Chow-Lin technique, entails deriving a
predictive equation by running a regression of annual GDP on annual related series. We used
trade and M1 as the related series. We then use the quarterly figures of the related series to
predict the quarterly GDP figures and adjust them to match the annual aggregates.

GDP data was obtained from the Singapore Centre for Applied and Policy Economics
(http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/ecs/esu/data.html). The bilateral export data in US dollars were
retrieved from the Direction of Trade Statistics, International Monetary Fund (IMF). We
converted the export shares to 12-quarter moving averages to smooth out the movements of
export shares.
