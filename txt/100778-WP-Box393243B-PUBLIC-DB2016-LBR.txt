THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: Low income
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 4,396,873
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:

by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 179
rounded to two decimals. An economy’s distance to
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 180*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        Submit plans to Ministry of Public Works

        The application file should include 2 copies of the site plan; letter
        of request addressed to the Deputy Minister; the land deed; and
        the architectural, structural, and mechanical drawings. These
        documents are passed from one official to another for approval
        at the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) before the building permit
        is issued. Physically all departments are located in different parts
        of the city which may delay the approval.

        The documents are submitted internally at the MPW in the
        following order:
        • Office of the Deputy Minister, Technical Services
        • Office of the Assistant Minister, Technical Services (initial
        recipient)
        • Land-Use Planning and Zoning Division (initial site plan and
        document review). There are no thorough checks with the
        National Archives on the authenticity of the land documents,
   1    ensuring that is the responsibility of the owner of the warehouse.          1 day              no charge
        • Chief of Zoning (physical site approval)
        • Chief of Architecture (design approval)
        • Chief of Electromechanical Engineering (electrical and
        mechanical approval)
        • Chief of Engineering (structural approval and billing)
        • Finance Section (payments)
        • Land-Use Planning and Programming (signature on permit)
        • Office of the Deputy Minister, Technical Services (permit
        attached)

        A temporary building permit can be granted after the second
        step above, when the Land-Use Planning and Zoning Division
        conducts an initial site plan and document review. This
        temporary permit can be obtained within one week. It is granted
        for a maximum of 90 days, but this is an exception rather than
        the rule. In practice, a permit is accorded after all steps
        mentioned above have been completed. As a result of the weak
        enforcement of building regulations, partly a result of the post-

      Division)

      It takes about 3 days for the Zoning Division to process an
      application. The Zoning Division will contact the applicant to
      inform them that they will need an inspection. There are only 4      1 day        no charge

      Obtain payment slip from the Ministry of Public Works

      Once all the technical departments have reviewed the
      application, the Finance Department creates a payment slip.
      BuildCo must pick up the payment slip and then go the Central

      Obtain construction permit from the Ministry of Public
      Works

      BuildCo must return to the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) with
      the payment receipt and the application is then processed for
      final approval. The process at the MPW from submission of plans
      (procedure 1) to approval used to take 3 months, but reforms
      introduced in 2008 reduced the processing time for simple
      building permits to 1 month. The MPW established a 30-day
      statutory time limit for the issuance of building permits. The
      MPW also introduced a checklist to clearly define all of the
      documents required to complete the application. Now all             28 days       no charge

      applications are scrutinized on submission to check for
      completeness and accuracy before being forwarded for
      processing. The reform eliminated the Minister’s signature on
      building permits for simple construction projects. By rule, the
      Minister's consent is only required for projects with a value
      greater than USD 1 million or that involve a foreign government.
      However, in practice the Minister or Deputy Minister still
      approves projects that are less than USD 1 million in value.

      Obtain construction clearance from the City Corporation of
      Monrovia

      After obtaining the design approval from the MPW, BuildCo
      must obtain a separate construction clearance from the Planning
      Department at the City Corporation of Monrovia. The Planning
      Department takes 1 day to review the plans and then prepares a
      payment slip which is usually paid the next day.

      City Corporation of Monrovia as of May 1, 2009 abolished 3% fee
      charge, based on project value, for issuing a building permit and
      replaced it with a fixed fee of USD 0.04 per sq. ft. for new           2 days       USD 560

      commercial and industrial construction projects.

      However, practitioners note that this fee is "negotiable".
      Applicants can pay a less amount, which is official, for a
      clearance that will last for a shorter period of time. There are no
      fee schedules posted at the City Corporation and often, builders
      are asked to pay much higher fees.

      The construction of the warehouse can commence after the
      building permit is obtained. There is no requirement to request
      inspections at any stage of the construction process. However,
      building inspectors and engineers are often dispatched from the
      Ministry of Public Works to inspect construction sites to see to
      what extent the construction conforms with the originally              1 day        no charge

      inspections occur randomly at a rate of every 3 weeks or as often
      as every week. Construction work stops only if the plans have
      not been complied with.

      Obtain water and sewage connection

      Water connections can be made if existing pipelines pass
      through the construction site. If that is the case, then the water
      connection should take 1 -- 2 weeks. The cost for water
      connection includes LRD 250.00 for the connection itself and
      USD 50.00 for the meter. If a water pipeline does not pass
20    through the area, then BuildCo must buy all the necessary            14 days        USD 54
      materials to extend an existing pipeline to the construction site
      before the connection is made. This will inevitably add cost and
      time to the utility connection process.

      Request and obtain occupancy permit

      In the recent year the Ministry of Public Works started more
      rigorously enforcing the regulations of the Zoning Law.

      obtain an occupancy permit before being used. Stricter               10 days       no charge

        This registration of the completed building occurs in two stages.
        First BuildCo must register the building with the Probate Court,
        similar to a notarization procedure. Registration at the Probate
        Court takes 3 days and costs LRD 300.00. The case considered
  22    here assumes that BuildCo does not employ a lawyer (lawyer’s           3 days       LRD 300
        fees would amount to USD 250.00). Registration is not required,
        but companies do so to increase the resale value.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

                    Liberia strengthened its legal framework for secured
                    transactions by adopting a new commercial code that broadens
DB2012              the range of assets that can be used as collateral (including
                    future assets) and extends the security interest to the proceeds
                    of the original asset.
                    Liberia improved access to credit by adopting new laws on
DB2016              secured transactions that establish a modern, unified and
                    notice-based collateral registry.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                 The foreclosure procedure takes approximate 3 years until BizBank is repaid
                                 some or all of the money owed to it. After 60 days as of Mirage's default on
                                   payment, BizBank would initiate foreclosure procedure by filing a written
                                 complaint to the Court with copies served on Mirage. Mirage would then file
                                against the foreclosure. It will take approximate 1.5 years for the Court to hold
                                 hearings, conduct pretrial conference, until a money judgment is issued with

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
