EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This study addresses five research questions about the nature of aquaculture development
in Bangladesh. The questions are designed to test central narratives from the literature on
aquaculture, poverty and food security, and to broaden the scope of debate beyond them. The
questions are as follows:

	   •	   To what extent do the resource-poor participate in aquaculture?
	   •	   What is the relationship between participation in aquaculture and landownership and access?
	   •	   What is the nature and extent of employment associated with different types of aquaculture?
	   •	   How does aquaculture affect local food security?
	   •	   What are the effects of aquaculture development on well-being?

An integrated quantitative-qualitative survey was conducted in six communities with contrasting
patterns of aquaculture development. Data was collected from a representative cross section
of village residents to gain insights into the impacts of aquaculture development at the local
level, using a structured household survey (578 respondents) and in-depth interviews (165
informants). This approach generated many findings that contradict or add nuance to conventional
understandings of aquaculture development. The most important of these are summarized in
terms of poverty, landownership and tenure, employment, food security, well-being, and policy
implications.

Poverty
The wealthier a household, the higher the likelihood of its members practicing aquaculture as
producers. This finding applied to all forms of aquaculture. Nevertheless, participation of resource-
poor households with limited landholdings in some forms of commercial aquaculture was much
higher than anticipated. In fact, in certain villages, more small landowners and resource-poor
farmers practiced commercial aquaculture than semisubsistence forms of aquaculture.

Landownership and access
Shifts from agriculture to commercial aquaculture were accompanied by rapid and pervasive
changes in land use and land tenure arrangements. Although the rise of commercial aquaculture
was accompanied by a decline in the availability of land for paddy cultivation, sharecropping
arrangements were replaced by dynamic rental markets that often facilitated access of small and
medium producers to land.

Employment
Almost all expansion of commercial aquaculture took place on land formerly used for paddy
cultivation, resulting in an inverse relationship between employment in aquaculture and
agriculture. Nevertheless, with the exception of shrimp farming, smallholder-dominated
commercial aquaculture created more employment opportunities than it destroyed by smoothing
seasonal demand for labor, often with employment conditions comparable or preferable to
those in agriculture. In contrast, noncommercial aquaculture created very limited employment
opportunities of any kind.

Food security
Contrary to expectations, commercially oriented smallholder aquaculture producers consumed
larger quantities of fish from their own farms than households operating subsistence-oriented fish
production systems. On average, individuals from households practicing aquaculture consumed
(and produced) more rice, fruits, nonleafy vegetables and fish per capita than those that did not.

                    Well-being
                    The development of smallholder-dominated forms of commercial aquaculture was accompanied
                    by increasing levels of women’s engagement in related work. Women often lost access to and/or
                    control over certain productive resources as part of this development process, but gained access to
                    or control of others, resulting in ambiguous well-being outcomes.

                    In all cases studied, the emergence of commercial forms of aquaculture was accompanied by the
                    “commodification of subsistence,” a process by which producers become more deeply integrated
                    into markets, and more dependent upon them for their means of survival. Nonmarket access to
                    resources, particularly land and food, declined, with the result that some households became more
                    vulnerable and increasingly dependent on selling their own labor. However, levels of material
                    well-being often increased markedly for resource-poor households able to enter commercial
                    aquaculture as producers.

                    Policy implications
                    Smallholder-dominated commercial aquaculture development resulted in diverse social
                    and economic transformations and a complex mix of well-being outcomes. Semisubsistence
                    aquaculture created limited economic and social spillover effects. The risk of negative well-being
                    outcomes resulting from development dominated by large-scale capitalist operations was high.
                    Thus, forms of commercial aquaculture into which entry by small landowners and the resource-
                    poor is possible seem to offer the greatest potential to leverage positive development outcomes,
                    but also engender risks.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




                    In light of these findings, policies and interventions promoting aquaculture in Bangladesh should
                    focus on supporting the development of smallholder-dominated aquaculture clusters, while
                    fostering stronger local governance to regulate outcomes likely to impact well-being negatively.
                    The first of these conditions may be met through primary investments in infrastructure (e.g. roads,
                    electricity and marketplaces) that support cluster formation, along with secondary investments
                    in well-regulated markets for production inputs and the provision of specially tailored services
                    (e.g. credit and extension). The second condition is more challenging, requiring stronger local
                    institutions with the capacity to proactively regulate aquaculture at the community level, to
                    control development with exclusionary outcomes, particularly with respect to land and water,
                    and to protect common-property resources that provide a buffer for the poorest against negative
                    effects of the commodification of subsistence.

Aquaculture is widely considered to have the potential to reduce poverty and enhance food
security (Edwards 1999; Subasinghe et al. 2010). Nowhere is this more evident than Bangladesh,
where for more than 30 years numerous donor- and government-funded initiatives have invested
in aquaculture towards achieving these outcomes.

Historically, aquaculture in Bangladesh was a low-intensity, semisubsistence activity, and most
development interventions promoted “small-scale” forms of aquaculture in the expectation
that adoption of improved management practices by low-income households would increase
production of fish for sale and home consumption, thereby reducing poverty and food insecurity
(Belton and Little 2011). A number of studies have assessed the impact of such projects in
Bangladesh, identifying broadly positive although often modest effects on household income,
farm output and food security (Hallman et al. 2003; Thompson et al. 2006; Jahan et al. 2010; Rand
and Tarp 2010). However, Lewis (1997) and Belton et al. (2012) have both argued that extremely
high levels of landlessness in Bangladesh limit the ability of the most resource-poor households to
participate in small-scale aquaculture as producers.

Commercially oriented forms of semi-intensive and intensive aquaculture have emerged in
Bangladesh over the last 15 years (Belton and Azad 2012). The high capital requirements of such
forms of production have usually been thought to limit the potential for direct involvement by
the resource-poor. However, research suggests that the development of commercial aquaculture
has benefited landless laborers by creating employment opportunities, particularly involving the
provision of supporting goods and services in associated value chains (Belton et al. 2012). Toufique
and Gregory (2008) have also reported that the development of commercial aquaculture resulted
in gains for low- and middle-income households through the creation of new employment
opportunities, although they found that most direct benefits were reaped by better-off
landowners. There is also evidence that commercial forms of aquaculture have improved access
to fish among poor consumers in Bangladesh by increasing supply and reducing relative prices
(Toufique and Belton 2014).

Observations such as these have given rise to debate over whether it is more appropriate to
target development investments towards the types of aquaculture that yield mainly direct income
and consumption benefits for owner-operators, or whether efforts should be directed toward
promoting commercial “quasi-capitalist” or “entrepreneurial” forms of aquaculture with indirect
employment and consumption effects (Belton and Azad 2012).

Rapid growth in export-led production of high-value tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and giant
freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) has taken place in coastal and inland areas of
southwest Bangladesh since the 1980s. Although this production has generated substantial on-
and off-farm employment (USAID 2006), there exists considerable debate over whether production
of these two high-value export commodities has occurred at the expense of local food security,
particularly in the case of shrimp, production of which has often been associated with salinization
of agricultural land and land grabbing (Rahman et al. 2006).

The studies mentioned in the preceding paragraphs have been largely gender blind with respect
to exactly who gains or loses in terms of poverty, employment and food security, irrespective of
the type of aquaculture assessed. This study was designed to address some of these ambiguities
and shortcomings, and to contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationships between
different forms of aquaculture, poverty and food security in Bangladesh. Arthur et al. (2013)
have argued that many studies attempting to draw links between aquaculture and poverty have

    	 The area covered by ponds is probably slightly overrepresented, particularly in Hawli, due to
      double counting of the area under multi-owner ponds, for which it was not possible to correct.

    	 A significant number of households included in the sample population of the household survey
      do not own land in Bilpabla, but lease in and cultivate ghers in the village, living in rudimentary
      accommodation constructed on the gher dikes. These are excluded from our analysis because
      many of them own land in other villages, making their inclusion potentially misleading.

    	 Single-owner ponds, as the name suggests, are owned by a single household. Multi-owner ponds
      are owned by two or more households as a result of the distribution of inherited property among
      siblings.

     	 Bilpabla was a partial exception in this respect, as prawn farming in freshwater ghers was
       integrated with paddy cultivation.

    	 In this instance, the category “aquaculture producer” included all households with access to a
      pond, gher or rice-fish plot, irrespective of whether aquaculture represented a major occupation.

16
     	 Severity of food insecurity was assessed based on responses to a questionnaire module
       designed to measure household food insecurity (Coates et al. 2007).
                                                     63
        17
             	 Households in food insecurity access category 1 were considered food secure. Those with a score
               placing them in category 2 or above were considered food insecure (Coates et al. 2007).

         	 The commodification of subsistence is not a new process. Rice and other “traditional” crops have
        18

           long been produced for both subsistence and commercial purposes in Bangladesh (Crow 2001).
           Reardon et al. (2014, 11) find that, at present, the shares of marketed paddy in Bangladesh are
           57% for marginal farmers and 68% overall. However, it is contended that in each of the cases
           examined here, commodification was accelerated by the emergence of new forms of aquaculture
           production aimed directly at the market.

         	 Paprocki and Cons (2014) report similar sentiments expressed by residents of communities in the
        19

           same polder where this study was conducted.

         	 This trend had begun prior to the advent of commercial aquaculture with the intensification of
        20

           rice production (facilitated in Medila and Hawli by flood control schemes that allowed for the
           production of a crop of boro rice) and was also hastened in Medila by incidents of industrial
           pollution from nearby garment factories.

         	 Prior to this time a market for land existed, as it could, of course, be bought and sold. Such
        21

           transactions were rare, however, apart from the time of independence, when large amounts of
           land were sold in the two predominantly Hindu villages in Khulna.

        22
             	 Similar incidences of shrimp-related land grabs persist in other locations, however, including
               some villages in the same union as Salabunia.

         	 Focus group discussions with women in Bilpabla suggested that the extent of both unpaid
        23

           own farm work and wage work on the farms of others might have been underreported in the
NOTES




           household survey.

         	 Except during peaks in agricultural labor demand around planting and harvesting rice, when
        24

           daily wages were often considerably higher than those in aquaculture.

         	 Most earth cutters came from a community located further from Bhaluka town, where
        25

           aquaculture was less developed and there were fewer employment opportunities. Most
           permanent labor on pangasius farms came from the remote and relatively deprived subdistrict of
           Haluaghat.

         	 The household survey that informs the present study was conducted during a relatively “slack”
        26

           period and thus failed to capture the labor-intensive nature of freshwater gher farming. This is
           confirmed by Jahan (personal communication, 2014), who surveyed labor use in a variety of
           aquaculture systems across an entire year.

         	 This is, in part, a result of the village’s physical geography. A low water table means that ponds
        27

           in the village do not retain water year round. As a result, pangasius growout is only possible in
           enclosed natural water bodies (beels) capable of holding water for 12 months per year. These are
           often several hectares or more in size. The levels of capital investment needed to farm pangasius
           on such a large scale place extremely high barriers on entry.

           this term, and Coulthard et al. (2011) and Weeratunge et al. (2013), who refer to “social well-being.”

Annex 1: Key definitions
Poverty
Although poverty is multidimensional and dynamic (Krishna 2007), it is most commonly
measured in terms of material deprivation, with reference to thresholds in per capita incomes or
expenditures. This approach is also adopted here due to the cross-sectional nature of the survey
and the relatively simple research question about whether resource-poor households participate
in aquaculture. No attempt was made to answer quantitatively the more complex questions of
whether or to what extent aquaculture has been responsible for reducing poverty in the study
communities.

Poverty was defined according to the national upper and lower poverty lines set by the Bangladesh
Bureau of Statistics (BBS) for 2010 (BBS 2011). BBS defines a food and a nonfood poverty line to
delimit the lower and upper poverty lines. There are three steps in the calculation of the food
poverty line: (1) a basic food basket of 11 food items is selected; (2) the quantities in the basket are
scaled according to the nutritional requirement of 2122 kilocalories per person per day; and (3) the
cost of acquiring the basket is calculated. The estimated cost is considered as the food poverty line.
The nonfood poverty line is calculated by estimating the average consumption expenditure on
nonfood items by households close to the food poverty line (BBS 2011).

The upper poverty line is determined by adding together the food and nonfood poverty lines.
“Extreme poor” households are defined as those households whose total expenditures on food and
nonfood combined are equal to or less than the food poverty line. “Moderate poor” households are
those households whose total expenditures are equal to or less than the upper poverty line but




                                                                                                           ANNEX 1
above the food poverty line. Nonpoor households are those households whose total expenditures
are above the upper poverty line (BBS 2011).

Consistent with standard approaches to the analysis of household surveys, expenditure per capita
was used as a proxy for income per capita on the basis that accurate recall of the latter is more
difficult for interviewees (Deaton 1997). Expenditure was constructed using data from the food
and nonfood modules of a household survey questionnaire, with items produced by households
for own consumption valued at local market prices (Deaton and Zaidi 2002; Davis and Baulch
2011). “Lumpy” expenditures (dowries, weddings, funerals; durable goods; health and medical
expenditures; legal costs) were excluded. Household expenditures were deflated to 2010 prices
using the general rural consumer price index.28


Employment
One of the study’s primary concerns was to measure the quantity and quality of employment
associated with different forms of aquaculture and other comparable activities, such as agriculture.
The employment module thus represented a major component of the household survey. The first
section of the module recorded information on the primary and secondary occupations during the
preceding 12 months of all household members above eight years of age, including the length of
time spent working, the value of the cash and/or in-kind income received, and whether any labor
was employed. The module’s second section recorded information on the pay, working hours
and gender of all employees hired by questionnaire respondents’ households. The final section
of the module checked whether any of the occupations listed by respondents in the first section
were predominantly aquaculture related and, if so, recorded the precise nature of the work. Data
obtained from the first part of the module provided a representative picture of all the major
employment activities engaged in by village inhabitants, both inside and outside the village, while
data from the second part of the module provided a picture of the hired labor working in the
village, whether originating from inside or outside the community.
                                                   69
          Land
          Issues of landownership and access are of critical importance in rural Bangladesh: first, because land
          is the basis for all agricultural production; and second, because land inheritance laws that require
          the division of property among offspring, coupled to extremely high population density and rapid
          population growth, have resulted in extremely atomized and fragmented landholding patterns. Fifty-
          nine percent of rural households are considered to be functionally landless (defined as ownership
          of less than 0.2 ha of land—an area insufficient to fulfill basic subsistence needs), and 28% of rural
          households have no cultivable land whatsoever (Hossain and Bayes 2009). Access to land is mediated
          by a variety of arrangements, including sharecropping, mortgaging and leasing. Such arrangements
          are often transformed by new forms of agrarian development, with important implications for those
          who are excluded by these processes (Hall et al. 2011). Our focus on landholdings explored the extent
          to which small landowners were able to engage directly in aquaculture as producers, as well as
          examining the arrangements under which lands utilized for aquaculture were accessed. For analytical
          purposes, BBS’s five-tiered categorization of landholding size was used: less than 0.2 ha (functionally
          landless); 0.2–0.4 ha (marginal); 0.4–1.0 ha (small); 1.0–3.0 ha (medium); more than 3.0 ha (large).


          Food security
          Food and nutrition security exists “when all people at all times have physical, social and economic
          access to food, which is consumed in sufficient quantity and quality to meet their dietary needs
          and food preferences” (CFS 2012). Bangladesh has very high rates of malnutrition resulting from
          poor food and nutrition security, with symptoms including high rates of stunting and wasting,
          women’s anemia, and low birth weight babies (HKI 2014). Although increases in homestead-based
          agricultural production are found to have positive effects on the consumption of nutrient-rich foods
          such as fruits, vegetables, fish and dairy (Masset et al. 2011), there is less consensus as to whether

          production for the market does so (von Braun 1995), particularly if the conversion of agricultural
          land or wetlands to aquaculture excludes other resource users (Toufique and Gregory 2008).

          Food insecurity was measured using a survey instrument developed by the USAID Food
          and Nutritional Technical Assistance project.29 The instrument was developed to allow for
          differentiation between food-secure and food-insecure households in different cultural contexts. It
          uses answers to nine questions on various events relating to access to food over a four-week recall
          period and their frequency of occurrence, in order to assign households and populations along a
          continuum of severity from food secure to severely food insecure (Coates et al. 2007).


          Well-being
          The final research question concerns the effects of commercial aquaculture development on well-
          being.30 Well-being represents a more holistic alternative to the “deficit view” that characterizes
          most conventional frameworks for understanding poverty and vulnerability (Camfield et al. 2009b)
          and has gained increasing currency as a concept in international development over the last decade
          (e.g. Gough et al. 2006), based on the recognition that there is more that matters to people than
          the purely material aspects of their lives (Coulthard et al. 2011).

          Well-being, as visualized by White (2010) and Weeratunge et al. (2013), comprises three
          interdependent dimensions: the material, the subjective and the relational (Figure 15). Material
          dimensions of well-being are at the center of traditional approaches to development, which are
          concerned with welfare indicators such as consumption, income and health, and, often, their
          quantification (White 2010). Relational dimensions concern the quality and dynamics of social
          relationships, whether interpersonal (e.g. between members of a family, or between an employer
          and a worker) or between groups of actors within or beyond the boundaries of a community.
          These relationships may reflect “social divisions and inequalities, and the forms of entitlement and
          domination codified in identities by class, caste, gender, religion, race, ethnicity, age, disability,
          or ritual responsibility” (White 2010, 163). The relational dimension of well-being is particularly
                                                            70
important in Bangladesh because individual constructions of selfhood are deeply embedded in,
and defined in relation to, networks of hierarchical relationships (Camfield et al. 2009a). Subjective
dimensions of well-being are a function of the way in which individuals perceive the material
and relational dimensions of their lived experience, and the degree of satisfaction (or otherwise)
in which this results (White 2010). Expressed differently, individual well-being is achieved when
people’s material needs are met, their valued freedoms are being achieved, and they experience a
good quality of life (Coulthard et al. 2011).

As the concentric circles in Figure 15 indicate, the ways in which individuals experience well-
being can be affected by material conditions and relationships existing or operating at different
scales. Conversely, well-being can also be conceived of as existing at different social scales (the
family, community or nation state, for instance), either as the sum of individual well-being or “as
something that inheres within the community as a collectivity” or as a combination of the two
(White 2010, 168). Camfield et al. (2009b) argue that the conceptually “integrative” nature of well-
being means that it is best studied using mixed quantitative and qualitative methods, as each is
able to provide different “answers” regarding its nature and extent.

Quantification of the material dimensions of well-being is made possible by the types of tools
used in conventional poverty research. Somewhat counterintuitively, the dominant approach to
research on well-being’s subjective dimensions has been quantitative (White 2010), with tools such
as Likert scales used to generate numerical profiles of people’s self-assessed quality of life. A variety
of qualitative approaches are also applicable, however (Camfield et al. 2009b). Few standardized
methods have been developed for capturing well-being’s relational dimensions, but qualitative
research methods have a range of potential applications.

Quantitative data on material aspects of well-being were collected using the structured household

survey that underpins this study. Although not framed in these terms, this provided the basis for
addressing the first four research questions posed. Early attempts were made to integrate several
Likert-style questions into the survey, with the aim of quantifying subjective well-being. These
proved problematic during field testing, however, with the intent of inquiries often seemingly lost in
translation, and they were ultimately omitted from the final survey instrument. The subjective and
relational aspects were addressed primarily through analysis of notes taken during interviews and
focus group discussions. In some cases, interviewees’ responses took the form of direct answers to
questions such as “How has your life changed since you took up aquaculture?” while in others, well-
being implications were inferred from responses to questions regarding a range of other issues.

About the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems
Approximately 500 million people in Africa, Asia and the Pacific depend on aquatic agricultural systems
for their livelihoods; 138 million of these people live in poverty. Occurring along the world’s floodplains,
deltas and coasts, these systems provide multiple opportunities for growing food and generating
income. However, factors like population growth, environmental degradation and climate change are
affecting these systems, threatening the livelihoods and well-being of millions of people.

The CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) seeks to reduce poverty and improve
food security for many small-scale fishers and farmers depending on aquatic agriculture systems by
partnering with local, national and international partners to achieve large-scale development impact.

About the CGIAR Research Program on Livestock and Fish
In developing countries, poor people, especially women and children, consume very little meat, milk and
fish. This contributes to nutrient deficiencies and poor physical and cognitive development for children,
and poor health and livelihood outcomes for adults. Additionally, the productivity of small- and medium-
scale livestock and fish producers and marketing systems in developing countries lags far behind those
in other parts of the world.

The CGIAR Research Program on Livestock and Fish seeks to increase the productivity of small-scale
livestock and fish systems in sustainable ways, making meat, milk and fish more available and affordable
to poor consumers across the developing world.
