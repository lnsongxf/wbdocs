KEY MESSAGES
Armenia has a range of key HIV programs in place. The country could strengthen the
effectiveness of its HIV response through six measures:
1. ART program funding should be increased substantially and considered a top priority for
   the HIV response.
2. OST program funding and coverage should be increased as a high priority.
3. PWID and NSP (needle and syringe exchange program), PMTCT (prevention of mother-to-
   child transmission), and prisoner program funding should be maintained. At the same
   time it should be explored whether coverage, quality, and targeting can be continuously
   improved with available funding.
4. Programs for seasonal migrants should be rigorously evaluated to assess their
   effectiveness and ongoing implementation.
5. HIV testing and counselling program funding will be used most effectively by making
   programs specific to key populations.
6. Additional implementation efficiency analysis is necessary to determine the
   potential to reduce unit costs of all programs.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report summarizes findings from an allocative efficiency (AE) analysis conducted for the
Government of Armenia as part of a Regional initiative on allocative efficiency analysis.

Given its estimated 4,000 people living with HIV (PLHIV) in 2014, Armenia is experiencing a
low-level, concentrated HIV epidemic.1

According to available data, the epidemic is stabilizing in most key populations including
female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM), and people who inject drugs
(PWID).

The AE analysis indicates that, using the same US$3.9 million of annual programmatic HIV
spending recorded in 2013, Armenia could avert an additional 290 new HIV infections and 288
AIDS-related deaths from 2015 to 2020 if these resources were allocated optimally to
minimize both HIV incidence and AIDS-related deaths. These health outcomes could be
achieved by reassigning funding in four ways:

1. The allocation to ART should increase from 17 percent of the total HIV budget (2013) to 24
   percent of all HIV funding.
2. The allocation to opiate substitution therapy (OST) should increase from the 7 percent of
   the HIV budget in 2013 to approximately 10 percent.
3. The FSW and client testing and prevention program also should be scaled up to receive
   approximately 9 percent instead of 7 percent of the allocation, so that coverage can be
   increased.
4. The model analysis indicates that HIV testing and counselling in the general population
   should be defunded.
Cost to achieve national strategy targets

   An investment of US$6 million annually for programs could achieve the national target of a
    50 percent reduction in HIV incidence and AIDS-related deaths by 2020. As noted above,
    ART, OST, and FSW condom and testing programs should be prioritized.
   Should all money necessary to achieve national targets in Armenia be available, this
    funding could avert an additional 641 new infections and 378 AIDS-related deaths during
    2013−20.




1   The lower and upper bounds of the range of HIV estimates were 2,700–5,900 PLHIV (UNAIDS 2015).

      Conclusions and Recommendations
      Ten conclusions and recommendations can be drawn from the AE analysis undertaken in
      Armenia:

      1. The Optima analysis projects a stable epidemic in most population groups until 2020. This
         projection assumes that the 2013 behaviors and coverage of the programs are maintained.
         The results suggest that the past and ongoing efforts have had a substantial impact on
         the course of the epidemic compared to a scenario with no HIV program spending.
         Projections from the model up to 2020 show that the 2013 budget allocations for
         programs would avert more than 40 percent of the cumulative new HIV infections and 59
         percent of AIDS-related deaths compared to a scenario with no spending on HIV programs.
      2. Despite the efforts by the Government of Armenia to control the HIV epidemic and the
         considerable impact that the current budget allocation has, the optimization analysis
         suggests that specific budget reallocations could further improve health impacts of
         the HIV response with the currently available (2013) resources.
      3. The analysis suggests that the ART program should be prioritized and that the ART
         budget should increase by another 40 percent over the current (2013) funding of
         US$650,000 allocated for ART to increase investment in ART to over US$900,000 per year
         on average.
      4. FSW programs will continue being cost-effective interventions because, despite relatively low
         HIV prevalence and population size of female sex workers, their large number of interactions
         with the much larger client population can cause a substantial number of new HIV infections.
         The funding for these programs should be increased moderately to achieve high levels of
         program coverage.
      5. Programs targeting the general population should be defunded. The funding should be
         reallocated to the high-impact programs including ART and prevention for key
         populations.
Executive Summary                                                                                xiii



6. Analysis results suggest that current allocations for OST should be increased by
   approximately one-third. Prevention programs for PWID including needle and syringe
   exchange programs, HIV testing counselling (HTC) and condoms for PWID should
   continue to receive 11 percent of HIV funding―the second largest allocation after ART.
   In addition, whether coverage, quality, and targeting can be continuously improved with
   2013 funding levels should be explored.
7. Programs for seasonal migrant laborers including testing and other prevention services
   were introduced in response to the increasing contribution of seasonal migrant laborers to
   new infections. These programs are new, and their efficacy has yet to be established. Thus,
   it is recommended to implement a pilot program and rigorously evaluate the outcomes
   including uptake of HTC and other HIV services.
8. The MSM epidemic should be monitored carefully, particularly because of the rapidly
   growing HIV epidemic among MSM in neighboring Georgia. MSM programs should be
   sustained with a focus on urban sites that have larger MSM populations and continued
   epidemiological surveillance.
9. This analysis did not focus on identifying technical efficiencies or reviewing unit costs;
   therefore, no specific recommendations can be made regarding them. Given limited
   resources, it is worth conducting additional technical efficiency analyses that focus
   on the programs that absorb the largest proportions of funding: ART, OST, PWID/NSP,
   seasonal migrant HIV services, and management.
The Armenian government’s 2012 spending on health was 7.9 percent of all government
expenditure, which was below the global average of 11.7 percent. By increasing overall
government spending on health, Armenia also could increase domestic HIV financing and
thereby contribute to covering resource gaps in its HIV response.

1.       INTRODUCTION
1.1      Necessity for allocative efficiency
Globally, current HIV programs are faced with the necessities of scaling up prevention and
providing treatment to a larger number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) more than ever
before. In the current environment of increasingly limited resources for HIV responses,
focused design and efficiency in program delivery are essential to ensure that programs can do
more with less.

In the 2011 United Nations Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS, countries agreed to reduce
sexual and injection-related transmission by 50 percent, virtually eliminate mother-to-child-
transmission, initiate 80 percent of eligible people living with HIV on treatment, and end HIV-
related discrimination by 2015 (UNGASS 2011). The 2014 Gap Report illustrated that, to
achieve these targets, substantial additional efforts will be required in most countries (UNAIDS
2014c). Despite the progress made, HIV remained among the unfinished agenda items in the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which need to be transitioned and integrated in the
post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Against this background, UNAIDS globally
defined a Fast-Track strategy to achieve the goal of Ending AIDS by 2030 (UNAIDS 2014b). One
core element of the Fast-Track approach are the 90-90-90 targets, which set out to achieve
that 90 percent of all PLHIV are diagnosed; 90 percent of diagnosed PLHIV are on ART; and 90
percent of PLHIV on ART are virally suppressed (UNAIDS 2014d). The Fast-Track approach
also emphasizes the need to focus on the geographic areas and communities most affected by
HIV. Fast Track recommends that resources be concentrated on the programs that have
demonstrated the greatest impact.

In this context, a shift toward investment thinking in the design of HIV responses is being
promoted by UNAIDS and cosponsors globally to maximize the impact of program investment
and best realize the long-term health and economic benefits of HIV programs. Investment
cases are being developed by a number of countries to understand HIV epidemics as well as to
design, deliver, and sustain effective HIV responses. The investment cases are complemented
with a human-rights-based approach to health care. In support of HIV investment cases, in
2014–15, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Ukraine, and a
number of countries outside the ECA Region carried out allocative efficiency (AE) analyses.2
This report summarizes the results of the analysis for policy makers, program leaders, and
technical experts in Armenia.

The concept of allocative efficiency refers to maximizing health outcomes with the least costly
mix of health interventions.3 HIV AE studies generally try to answer the question, How can HIV
funding be optimally allocated to the combination of HIV response interventions that will yield

2   For published study reports, see, for example, Republic of Tajikistan 2014 and Fraser and others 2014.
3   Technically, maximization can be achieved in two ways: within a fixed budget envelope (maximize impact with
    given amount of money), or within defined impact targets (minimize cost to achieve a given impact).

    the highest impact? Not only is this concept critical for maximizing current and future impact.
    The concept also is an integral element of transition to full domestic financing and
    sustainability of the response because a response that is allocatively and technically efficient
    will be easier to sustain.

    There is wide consensus that better outcomes could be achieved in many settings with a given
    amount of HIV funding, or that given outcomes could be achieved with less HIV funding if
    resources were distributed optimally or were used in the most efficient ways.

    1.2    Objectives of the analysis
    In response to the key strategic information needs in Armenia’s HIV response, the following
    analyses were conducted:
    1. A program optimization analysis to determine the optimal combination of programs to
       minimize HIV incidence and AIDS-related deaths over 2015−20. The main question in this
       analysis was: How are resources best allocated to different HIV programs to
       minimize cumulative HIV incidence and cumulative AIDS-related deaths over 2015–
       20?
    2. The second analysis was based on the first and aimed to identify resource requirements of
       the HIV response under a rights-based approach and for existing country commitments.
       The main purpose of the second analysis was to determine the minimum funding
       requirement to achieve national strategy targets. This analysis also established the gap
       in the funding required to achieve these targets. Two questions were addressed: What is
       the minimal spending required to fully achieve Armenia’s National Strategy impact
       targets? How should such funds be allocated?
2.      ARMENIA’S HEALTH AND HIV FINANCING
        CONTEXT
Between 1990 and 2012, Armenia’s human development index (HDI) rose from 0.628 to
0.729—positioning the country at 87 of 187 countries and territories. Table 2.1 reviews
Armenia’s progress on the HDI indicators. In 22 years (1990–2012), Armenia’s life expectancy
at birth increased by 6.5 years and mean years of schooling by 0.7 years. In 2013 Armenia’s
GDP per capita was US$3,505. Armenia’s economy rebounded after the 2009 economic crisis
from 2.2 percent GDP growth in 2010 to 7.2 percent growth in 2012, but slowed to 3.5 percent
in 2013.

Health care in Armenia is financed from domestic, private, and external sources. In 1998 the
government adopted the Basic Benefit Package (BBP), comprising a basket of public-funded
services, the list of services, and the population groups entitled to them. Since 2000, BBP also
has covered primary health care (PHC); child healthcare; obstetrical and gynecological
services; health care of socially vulnerable groups; control and emergency care of
communicable and noncommunicable diseases; specified specialized treatments such as for
tuberculosis (TB), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), blood diseases, and drug abuse; as
well as psychiatry, narcology, and oncohematology therapy. Overall health expenditure trends
are summarized in Table 2.2.

    From 1995 to 2012, the Armenian government’s health expenditures fluctuated substantially.
    Health accounted for 5.3 percent of total government expenditure in 2000 and 11.3 percent in
    2006 (Figure 2.1). In 2012, health accounted for only 7.9 percent of government expenditure—
    considerably lower than the global average of 11.7 percent.

    Domestic financial sources include state budget allocations, direct contributions of citizens (or
    households (out-of-pocket expenditures), copayments, and health insurance. Public
    expenditure on health accounts for 1.7 percent of GDP. Private spending accounts for nearly 50
    percent of total health expenditures, or 1.8 percent of GDP (Figure 2.2).

Between 2002 and 2009, external assistance to Armenia increased, when it peaked at
approximately US$443 million (Figure 2.3). It then declined to US$314 million in 2012. Health,
population, and HIV/AIDS accounted for a relatively small proportion of external assistance,
remaining just below 7.0 percent of total external aid in 2012. That year, US$15.7 million was
allocated to health and population issues and US$4.6 million to HIV/AIDS.

    External support to the HIV response has been increasing since 2002 with the Global Fund, U.S.
    Government, and Russian government being the major supporters (Figure 2.4). Since 2008, the
    majority of external support has come through the Global Fund.

    The national HIV response strategies are consolidated in the National Program on the
    Response to the HIV Epidemic in the Republic of Armenia for 2013–2016. The activities
    implemented within the framework are funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis
    and Malaria; allocations from the State budget; and financial support from other donors.
    According to the available data, in 2013 total AIDS spending in Armenia was AMD 2.05 billion
    (US$5.0 million). The sum of allocations from the State budget made up 21.4 percent of the
    total AIDS spending (Table 2.3). Moreover, 78.5 percent of Armenia’s HIV response was

externally funded—a considerably larger share of external funding compared to other
countries with a similar HIV epidemic. Although over 50 percent of all of Armenia’s healthcare
costs were financed privately, the contribution of private sources to HIV expenditure was
minimal.

The State’s approximately US$1.1 million spent on HIV in 2013 represented 0.5 percent of its
total spending on health (US$197 million) (Figure 2.5). In other words, the share of
government spending on HIV was below the overall share of HIV spending within total health
expenditure (1.1 percent). Considering that HIV accounted for 1.0 percent of years of life lost
(YLL) and 0.7 percent of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Armenia, the government’s
HIV spending also fell below HIV’s share of the total disease burden.

3.     METHODOLOGY. HOW WILL THIS REPORT
       ANSWER KEY QUESTIONS?
Chapter 3 outlines the main steps taken and the tools applied to carry out the analyses
presented in this report. Additional detail is available in appendixes A, B, and C.

3.1    Optima model
To carry out the analyses, the team used Optima, a mathematical model of HIV transmission
and disease progression integrated with an economic and program analysis framework.
Optima uses HIV epidemic modeling techniques and incorporates evidence on biological
transmission probabilities, detailed infection progression, sexual mixing patterns, and drug
injection behaviors. In consultation with in-country experts, Optima was calibrated to HIV
prevalence data points available from the different subpopulations (including FSW, PWID, and
MSM), as well as to data points on the number of people on ART.

To assess how incremental changes in spending affect HIV epidemics and determine an
optimized funding allocation, the model parameterizes relationships among the cost of HIV
intervention programs, the coverage level attained by these programs, and the resulting
outcomes. These relationships are specific to the country, population, and prevention program
being considered.

Using the relationships among cost, coverage, and outcome in combination with Optima’s
epidemic module, it is possible to calculate how incremental changes in the level of funding
allocated to each program would impact overall epidemic outcomes. Furthermore, by using a
mathematical optimization algorithm, Optima is able to determine an optimized allocation of
funding across different HIV programs. Additional details about Optima are contained in
appendix A.

3.2    Analytical framework
The study was conceptualized by a Regional steering group involving the Global Fund, UNAIDS,
UNDP, and convened by the World Bank. A national technical group convened by UNAIDS in
collaboration with government was formed. Country-specific objectives of the analysis and
parameters were outlined in a Scope of Work document. Epidemiological, program, and cost
data were collected by in-country experts with technical support from international partners
using an adapted MS-Excel-based Optima data entry spreadsheet. In November 2014, a
Regional mathematical modeling workshop was conducted in Yerevan, Armenia. There,
national experts and specialists from international partners including worked together with
mathematical modelers from UNSW to carry out modeling analyses using the Matlab software
package. This Regional process also aimed at data comparison and exchange, quality
assurance, and development of capacities in HIV epidemic and response analysis using

     Note: A comprehensive four-pronged approach to PMTCT includes additional elements such as provision of
     contraception. For the vast majority of women in this concentrated epidemic setting, the primary purpose of
     contraception is not PMTCT but pregnancy prevention. Thus, in this analysis, it was decided not to include cost
     in relation to contraception (apart from the cost for condom promotion for key populations covered in FSW,
     MSM, and PWID programs). The same logic applies to other related services.
Methodology. How will this report answer key questions?                                                                11



Populations include key populations, which are defined around the dominant factor
influencing HIV acquisition; and general populations, which are disaggregated by age and sex.
Programs were divided into two categories. Direct programs have a direct effect on HIV
incidence or deaths so could be included in the mathematical optimization analysis. Indirect
programs are cross-cutting expenses or have indirect or unclear effects on health outcomes so
were not included in the mathematical optimization. Within direct programs some service
packages target specific key populations (FSW, MSM, and PWID), while others (HTC, ART,
PMTCT) cut across all populations including key populations.

Costs per person reached, which were used in this analysis, are presented in Table 3.2. These
costs are not strictly comparable among countries, particularly for prevention programs,
whose packages differ. In other words, a higher unit cost may not necessarily mean lower
technical efficiency but also may mean a more comprehensive package. Costs in Armenia are
within the range of costs in other countries, except for PWID-NSP programs, whose costs in
Armenia appear higher. Additional analysis would be required to determine in which areas
technical efficiencies could be realized.

Note: Table 3.2 shows how costs were categorized by countries for this analysis. It is not based on detailed
matching of classification of inputs, but on how countries classified expenses using the detailed available
guidance for NASA and GARPR reports. Although this guidance is detailed and specific, differences cannot be
ruled out, particularly for cross-cutting costs such as HR. Furthermore, even if costs are classified consistently,
the comprehensiveness of service packages may differ.


3.3      Limitations of analysis
As with any modeling analysis, it is important to understand the key assumptions and the
related limitations:

   For this analysis, standard classification of cost data in line with National AIDS Spending
    Assessments (NASA) was used. However, program packages differ among countries,
    limiting the comparability of findings.
   The analysis used past ratios of expenditure to coverage as a basis for determining
    program cost rather than unit costs from a costing of future programs. This approach of
    using past cost and results has a number of advantages over using projected costs from
    plans and budgets, which ultimately are predictions of future cost. However, the approach
    also has the disadvantage that there may be future increases or decreases in cost in
    relation to new approaches, implementation arrangements, or technologies.
   The modeling approach used to calculate relative cost-effectiveness among programs
    includes assumptions concerning the impact of increases or decreases in funding for
    programs. These assumptions are based on unit costs and observed ecological
    relationships between outcomes of program coverage or risk behavior and the amount of
12                                                                        Optimizing investments in Armenia



            money spent on programs in the past. It also is assumed that increases in spending would
            cause some saturation in the possible effects of programs.
           The analysis did not determine the technical efficiency of programs. Gains in technical
            efficiency would lead to different unit costs and therefore affect resource allocation.
           Modeling the optimization of allocative efficiencies depends critically on the availability of
            evidence-based parameter estimates of the effectiveness of individual interventions.
            Although these estimates were derived from a global systematic literature review,4 they
            may vary in specific countries and populations depending on various factors, particularly
            the levels of adherence to interventions. All programs and spending categories for which
            such parameters cannot be obtained, such as enablers and synergies, could not be included
            in the mathematical optimization. As they still have important functions in the HIV
            response, they have been treated as fixed costs and, in some specific scenarios, adjusted
            with specific justifications.
           Effects outside the HIV endpoints are complex to consider (such as non-health benefits of
            OST, effects of needle exchange on hepatitis, and effects of condoms on contraception and
            sexually transmitted infections or STIs). Given that, for OST, the majority of benefits are
            beyond HIV outcomes, specific consideration was given to the non-HIV benefits of OST
            (appendix A). However, given the complexity of interaction among the interventions and
            their non-HIV benefits, this approach was applied for OST. Along the same lines, the model
            does not seek to quantify human rights, stigma and discrimination, or ethical, legal, or
            psychosocial implications; but acknowledges that these are important aspects to be
            considered.
           Different models may not always produce exactly the same projections as those produced
            by Optima. The analysts used the best possible data; the combined experience from model
            application in over 20 countries; and Regional comparison and validation of inputs through
            comparison among different sources including data from clinical records, surveillance, and
            research.
     There were some country-specific limitations in performing the allocative efficiency analysis in
     Armenia.
           As in most concentrated HIV epidemics, Armenia’s had data gaps, particularly regarding
            the general population. As in other models, estimates of HIV prevalence in the general
            population were derived from data in pregnant women as the proxy. Some of the available
            data also had limitations of nonrandom sampling, which applied to data from both
            integrated bio-behavioral surveillance (IBBS) and service delivery from HTC sites.
           Epidemiological data were scarce for some population groups such as seasonal migrant
            laborers and clients of female sex workers. Given the increasing role of seasonal migrant
            laborers in the epidemic, programs for them potentially are important. However, the
            information on the effectiveness and level of uptake of seasonal migrant laborer programs
            is limited.

4.     RESULTS AND THEIR INTERPRETATIONS
This chapter presents the findings of the analyses. It moves from the epidemic analysis to the
optimization analysis and then to the related cost-effectiveness analysis.

4.1    What is the status of the HIV epidemic in Armenia?
A summary of key national data on the HIV epidemic appears in Table 4.1. It illustrates the
rapid growth of new diagnoses and deaths from 2000 to 2010, the continued growth in
absolute numbers, and the slowing growth rate from 2010 to 2013. HIV prevalence remains
highest among PWID and MSM.

UNAIDS estimates for 2014 suggested that 4,000 persons living with HIV (PLHIV) were living
in Armenia and that the estimated HIV prevalence among people aged 15−49 years was 0.2
percent. In combination with available prevalence data for key populations, these estimates
indicate that Armenia is experiencing a concentrated epidemic. Between 1988 and 2014, 1,953
people in the country were diagnosed with HIV. Of them, 1,350, or 69 percent of diagnosed
PLHIV, were males; 603, or 31 percent, were females; and 38, or 2 percent, were children.

HIV diagnoses were registered in all country administrative divisions. Since the onset of the
epidemic in 1988, 667 HIV new diagnoses were reported for Yerevan, or 34.2 percent of all
HIV registered diagnoses for Armenia during that period.

The increased number of registered HIV diagnoses in recent years is associated with scaling up
laboratory diagnostic capacities, increasing accessibility of HTC due to improved HTC systems,
and increasing the level of HIV-related knowledge among health care providers. The efficiency
of the HIV surveillance system also has been improved. In addition, Armenian citizens with HIV
diagnoses and clinical symptoms have been returning to Armenia from other Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS) countries (more than 90 percent of whom have come from Russia,
the majority being male seasonal migrant laborers).

The main self-reported modes of HIV transmission in Armenia are heterosexual transmission
(63 percent) and injecting drug use (28 percent). There also are registered cases of HIV
transmission through homosexual practices, mother-to-child HIV transmission, and blood
transfusions. Almost all the individuals infected via injecting drug use were men. Almost all
HIV-positive women (97 percent) report having been infected through sexual contact.

      Analysis of the HIV diagnoses registered in Armenia during 2004–14 reveals that, in recent
      years, the percentage ratio of 2 of the main modes of HIV transmission has shifted. The
      proportion of (self-reported) transmission through injecting drug use dropped 5-fold––from
      approximately 67 percent to 13 percent. In contrast, the proportion of cases infected through
      heterosexual contact more than doubled from approximately 31 percent to 79 percent (Figure
      4.1).

Armenia’s HIV epidemic. Recent data on new HIV diagnoses show that more than 50 percent of
the PLHIV registered within the last 4 years probably were infected outside Armenia. Fifty-
nine percent of the new HIV diagnoses registered during 2012–14 were infected abroad, with
heterosexual transmission reported as the most common cause. Fourteen percent of registered
cases were sexual partners of seasonal migrant laborers. Thus, nearly 75 percent of cases
newly registered during 2012–14 were associated with migration.

Assuming that current conditions (behaviors and program coverage) remain stable, the six
main findings of the Optima epidemic modeling analysis for Armenia are:
1. Armenia is experiencing a low-level concentrated HIV epidemic. The number of PLHIV
   is projected to remain relatively stable until 2020 if current (2013) spending is maintained
   (Figure 4.10.)
16                                                                       Optimizing investments in Armenia



     2. An estimated 300 people will become infected, predominantly through sexual
        transmission and drug injections and 150 HIV-related deaths will occur in 2020
        according to model projections (Figure 4.3).
     3. The epidemic in most population groups is stabilizing. For instance, the model suggests
        that HIV prevalence in FSW will stabilize slightly above 1 percent.
     4. HIV prevalence among PWID and prisoners is projected to decline.
     5. In contrast, a slight increase in HIV prevalence in coming years is projected among
        seasonal migrant laborers.
     6. A slight increase in HIV prevalence also is projected in males in the general population
        and MSM.
     The trends in HIV prevalence in all subpopulations are presented in appendix B.

     4.2 Optimized allocations to minimize HIV incidence and
     AIDS-related deaths
     Optimization analyses were carried out for different levels of funding and different policy
     questions in line with the objectives of the analyses (section 1.2). Section 4.2 presents the
     analysis to determine optimal allocations for minimizing both new HIV infections and AIDS-
     related deaths, which makes this analysis particularly policy relevant. As explained in chapter
     3, all management costs and costs for related health services were kept stable and were not
     included in the mathematical optimization.

     4.2.1. Optimized allocations with stable HIV funding at 2013 levels of spending
     Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5 summarize the main outcomes of the optimal allocation analysis. The
     5 main findings are:
     a.   With the same US$3.9 million of programmatic spending as in 2013, Armenia could avert
          an additional 300 new infections and 300 AIDS-related deaths during 2015–20 if these
          resources were allocated optimally for both health outcomes. Optimal allocation would
          correspond to a 17 percent deeper reduction in new infections and 29 percent deeper
          reduction in cumulative deaths compared to current spending allocations.
     b. These health outcomes could be achieved by prioritizing resource allocation to 3 programs
        (Figure 4.4):
Results and their interpretation                                                                                 17



     i    ART funding should be increased to 24 percent of all HIV funding from 17 percent in
          2013.
     ii   OST funding should be increased to 10 percent of the total HIV budget from 7 percent
          in 2013.
     iii The FSW and client testing and prevention program should be allocated 9 percent of
         the total HIV budget instead of 7 percent as in 2013.
c.   The model indicates that HIV testing and counselling in the general population should be
     defunded.
d. Based on the available inputs, the model suggested that the budget allocated to MSM
   programs should be reduced to 2 percent of the total HIV budget (Figure 4.4). As
   mentioned above, this finding likely would change with reduced unit cost of MSM
   programs. In addition, given the increasing epidemic among MSM in neighboring Georgia,
   the HIV epidemic among MSM could grow faster than projected here because the model
   does not take into account international interactions. If HIV prevalence among MSM or the
   number of MSM does increase, MSM programs likely would have a larger epidemiologic
   effect and funding may need to be increased rather than decreased.5
e.   The cost per new infection and AIDS-related death averted would be US$12,700 and
     US$21,000, respectively.

      million allocated in 2013. Should more funding be available, additional reductions in new
      infections and deaths could be obtained, but the impact would be rather small.

      When comparing optimal allocations for different funding levels, three observations can be
      made:
       a.   For any investment between 100 percent and 200 percent of the 2013 spending,
            optimization suggests that investment should be focused on 4 programs: ART, PWID, OST,
            and prevention among FSW.
       b. If only 60 percent of 2013 spending were available, optimization suggests that investment
          should be focused primarily on ART and PWID programs. The results also highlight a
          considerable increase in new HIV infections or AIDS-related deaths if the budget were
          reduced by more than 30 percent despite an optimal allocation of the resources.
      c.    General population programs are not part of any of the optimal allocations.

      4.3       Cost to achieve targets
      4.3.1. Cost to achieve national strategy targets
      From 2000–05, Armenia’s HIV epidemic was mostly concentrated among PWID, but, after
      2005, new infections have been growing in other populations and overall. In this context,
      reversing the epidemic and achieving national targets by 2020 is projected to require an
      increase in annual spending. Using Optima, the team calculated that the minimal spending
      required to achieve Armenia’s moderate objectives would be twice as large as the current
      (2013) spending (Figure 4.6). To achieve the moderate objectives efficiently, scale-up,
      especially of ART but also of OST and of the FSW and client testing and prevention program, is
      required (Figure 4.6).

      Optimizing allocations to meet national targets is projected to achieve 7 results:
       a.   Approximately US$6 million annually for programs would achieve the national targets of a
            50 percent reduction in HIV incidence and AIDS-related deaths.
       b. Incidence would be reduced to fewer than 200 new infections per year by 2020 (Figure
          4.7).
       c.   HIV-related deaths would be reduced to fewer than 100 per year by 2020 (Figure 4.7).
Results and their interpretation                                                                    19



d. ART, OST, PWID programs, and the FSW and client condom and testing program should be
   prioritized.
e.   MSM programs also would be required to achieve national targets. The size of the MSM
     population is smaller than that of the combined SW/client population, and HIV prevalence
     among MSM is still lower than among PWID. For these reasons, the estimated numbers of
     PLHIV and new infections among MSM in Armenia are lower than the numbers among
     FSW/clients and PWID. These lower numbers also led to the model allocating a lower
     proportion of funding to MSM programs.
f.   The $6 million necessary to achieve national targets in Armenia (point a. above) could
     avert an additional 600 new infections and 400 AIDS-related deaths over 2015–20.
g.   Assuming the budget required to achieve the national targets, the cost per infection and
     AIDS-related death averted in Armenia would be US$18,900 and US$34,700, respectively.

When Armenian national targets are achieved, sexual transmission of HIV will be reduced by
almost 50 percent, and transmission by contaminated syringes will be reduced by almost 65
percent (Figure 4.7).

     Figure 4.8–Figure 4.10 show trends in new infections and deaths under 4 different scenarios:
     a.   Zero spending means no investment in HIV programs and would be equivalent to
          discontinuing all programs.
     b. Maintaining 2013 spending would imply stable coverage levels of programs.
     c.   Minimal spending to achieve national targets is the level required to achieve at least a
          50 percent reduction in new infections and deaths (Figure 4.6).
     d. Minimal spending to achieve ambitious targets refers to the vision of Getting to Zero,
        defined as 85 percent reduction in HIV incidence and deaths.

Table 4.2 provides the annual allocations from 2015 20 for 2 different optimization results
presented in the previous and in this section––optimized allocations of 2013 spending (Figure
4.4) and minimal spending to achieve national targets (Figure 4.6). The 2013 spending
allocations are included as a reference for comparison because they served as the baseline
scenario (maintaining 2013 spending). Table 4.3 summarizes the levels of program coverage
corresponding to the same allocations, including the baseline scenario and the 2 optimized

     4.4     Implications of different spending scenarios on ART
     As mentioned, the optimization analyses suggest that the ART program should be prioritized
     and, in all analyses conducted, that ART coverage should increase to minimize both new HIV
     infections and AIDS-related deaths. Compared to current spending allocations, the required
     increase in coverage to achieve national targets translates to approximately 700 additional
     individuals on first-line treatment, and approximately 300 more individuals on subsequent
     treatment (Table 4.5).

5.      DISCUSSION ON MODEL RESULTS AND
        POLICY IMPLICATIONS
5.1     Epidemic spread and potential
Armenia has a concentrated epidemic, with an estimated adult HIV prevalence of 0.2
percent in the population aged 15−49 years. In the past, as with most countries in the ECA
Region, the transmission burden was concentrated primarily in key populations and was
driven predominantly by people who inject drugs. However, over recent years, the dynamic of
the epidemic in the country has changed: heterosexual transmission has become the dominant
mode of transmission.

FSW and their clients, particularly seasonal migrant laborers and their sexual partners,
account for a larger proportion of new infections. Short-term labor migration is common in
the Region. Individuals move to neighboring countries mostly for work purposes. Seasonal
migrant laborers may be separated from spouses or may not have long-term partners, which
may increase the rate of partner change. New infections also may be due to the countries of
destination, some of which, such as Russia, have substantially higher HIV prevalence than does
Armenia.

Assuming that the current budget allocations for the various intervention programs are
maintained, the analysis projected a stable epidemic in most of the population groups
until 2020. Although, in previous years, the epidemic in the FSW population was growing, the
model projects that this epidemic has started to level off and will plateau in the near future.
Moreover, and concordant with previous estimates, the Optima model also predicts a declining
epidemic in the PWID population, with the epidemic remaining low in the general male and
female population.

The Optima model suggests that the national strategy to respond to the HIV epidemic in
Armenia has had substantial impacts on the course of the epidemic compared with a
zero-spending scenario in which no programs are implemented. The model’s projections
suggest that the current budget allocation and programs implemented would avert more than
40 percent of the cumulative new HIV infections and 59 percent of AIDS-related deaths up to
2020. The current programs include ART and other programs that target the high-risk
population groups including FSW, PWID, seasonal migrant laborers, and MSM.

Policy recommendations:
    In Armenia’s concentrated HIV epidemic, there is continued need to focus analysis,
     planning, and implementation on key populations, particularly FSW and their clients,
     and seasonal migrant laborers and their sexual partners.
    Projections from the model to 2020 show that, compared to a scenario with no spending
     on HIV programs, the current budget allocations for programs would avert more than 40
     percent of the cumulative new HIV infections and 59 percent of AIDS-related deaths.

     5.2 Optimal HIV resource allocation for impact and
     sustainability
     The government of Armenia has conducted notable efforts to control the HIV epidemic, and the
     current budget allocation to various intervention programs could have considerable impact on
     the course of the epidemic. Nevertheless, the optimization analysis suggests that, to achieve
     maximum health impacts with the currently available resources, some budget reallocations are
     necessary.

     The analysis suggests that the ART program should be prioritized and that the HIV
     budget should increase by approximately 40 percent of the current funding allocated to
     this program. Along with the ART program, the optimization analysis suggests that FSW
     programs also could benefit, thus reducing both HIV incidence and AIDS-related deaths.
     Therefore, the budget for the FSW program area also should increase by approximately 33
     percent, and 9 percent of the total budget should be allocated to FSW programs. Finally,
     maximum efficiency of the available budget would be achieved if the OST program funding also
     were increased by over 33 percent and 10 percent of the total budget were allocated to this
     program.

     Funding for programs such as HIV testing and counselling for the general population
     should be reduced substantially. Funding for these programs could be reallocated to the
     programs previously mentioned. The results highlight that the country has accurately
     allocated resources for programs such as PWID, NSP, and seasonal migrant testing and
     prevention.

     Seasonal migrant laborers have become a vulnerable population at high risk of HIV
     infection in Armenia. Therefore, the Government of the Republic of Armenia recently
     implemented a timely and effective testing and prevention program that targets this group.
     Despite the potentially important role that this population group could play in the country’s
     HIV epidemic, the optimization analysis does not recommend increasing the assigned funding
     for this program. A number of factors including unit cost, coverage, and program effects will
     influence the future cost-effectiveness and role of the seasonal migrant laborer program in the
     HIV response.

     Sensitivity analysis of the seasonal migrant laborer program suggests the existence of a
     cost-effectiveness threshold for this program. The program would be cost effective to fund
     only if high coverage levels could be reached at relatively low costs compared to other
     programs. Furthermore, because this migrant labor program was implemented only over the
     past few years, its epidemiological impact is still undetermined. As a result of this limitation, to
     completely estimate the impact and understand the effectiveness of this program, the analysts
     made several important assumptions regarding its effectiveness. More data need to be
     collected in coming years to strengthen the analysis.

     Policy recommendations:
        Despite the government’s efforts to control the HIV epidemic and the considerable impact
         that the current budget allocation could have, the optimization analysis suggests that
         some budget reallocations could further improve the health impact of the HIV
         response using available resources.
        The analysis suggests that the ART program should be prioritized and that the budget
         should increase by another 40 percent the current funding allocated for this program,
         taking the investment in ART to over US$900,000 per year on average. This amount would
Appendixes                                                                                       25



    represent an increase of approximately 18 percent in coverage that would reach almost 86
    percent of the total population eligible for treatment by 2020.
   OST and FSW programs will continue to be cost-effective interventions. Their funding also
    should be increased by approximately 33 percent.
   Conversely, programs targeting the general population should be defunded. Funding for
    general population programs should be reallocated to the above-mentioned high-
    impact programs including ART and prevention for key populations.
   The results suggest that current allocations for prevention programs for PWID including
    needle and syringe exchange programs, HTC, and condoms for PWID, should be
    sustained. Meanwhile, analysts should explore whether coverage, quality, and targeting
    can continue to improve continuously with existing levels of funding.
   Programs for seasonal migrant laborers including testing and other prevention services
    were introduced in response to the increasing contribution of seasonal migrant laborers to
    new infections. Since these programs are new and their efficacy has yet to be established,
    the recommendation is to implement a pilot program and rigorously evaluate the
    outcomes, including uptake of HTC and other HIV services.
   Although the model suggests a moderate reduction in investment in the MSM programs,
    the MSM epidemic should be monitored carefully, particularly considering that an HIV
    epidemic has been growing rapidly among MSM in neighboring Georgia. Thus, MSM
    programs should be sustained, with a focus on urban sites that have larger MSM
    populations and continued epidemiological surveillance.

5.3    Funding for health and HIV interventions
To reach the impact goals of Armenia’s National Strategic Plan would require increasing
the current total budget by 60 percent––or reducing the cost per person reached by
nearly 40 percent for all programs. Each option individually may be unrealistic, but
combining resource mobilization and technical efficiency gains could achieve national targets.
An extra US$2.5 million on top of the 2013 budget of US$3.9 million (or corresponding cost
reductions) would avert 1,800 new infections compared to zero spending; and avert 700 new
infections by 2020 compared to the current spending without optimization. Optimized
allocation of US$3.9 million would still avert an estimated 1,500 new infections compared to
zero spending; or 300 new infections compared to maintaining 2013 budgets without
optimization. As discussed, optimization analysis recommends prioritizing the scale-up of the
ART program. The funding reallocated from the current programs, along with an addition of
over US$100,000, would be sufficient to achieve the ART coverage targets proposed in the
National Strategic Plan.

Most of the additional funding necessary to achieve the national strategic targets of
reducing new HIV infections and AIDS-related mortality by 50 percent should be
allocated in programs that target FSW and PWID populations. Approximately US$2 million
should be allocated to programs including OST, PWID prevention and needle-syringe program,
and FSW and client testing and prevention programs. To fully achieve national targets, funding
allocated for seasonal migrant laborer programs should be increased by over 100 percent of
the current funding from nearly US$140,000 to roughly US$340,000.

Policy recommendations:
   This analysis did not focus on identifying technical efficiencies or reviewing unit costs;
    thus, no specific recommendations can be made about them. Making a big-picture
26                                                     Optimizing investments in Moldova’s HIV Response



         comparison to other countries––which has a number of limitations––revealed that costs in
         Armenia were approximately average and were the median cost for some of the programs.
         However, costs for PWID and OST programs were above average, which could have been
         caused by a range of reasons including economies of scale or differences in program
         packages. Given the limited resources, it would be worthwhile to conduct additional
         technical efficiency analyses focusing on the programs that absorb the largest
         proportion of funding (ART, OST, PWID/NSP, seasonal migrant laborer programs, and
         management).
        The Armenian government’s 2012 spending on health was 7.9 percent of all government
         expenditure, which was below the global average of 11.7 percent. By increasing overall
         government spending on health, Armenia could increase domestic HIV financing to help
         cover resource gaps in the response, particularly the gap in ART coverage and programs for
         key and vulnerable populations including PWID, FSW, MSM, and seasonal migrant laborers.
APPENDIXES
APPENDIX A.              TECHNICAL SUMMARY OF OPTIMA
Appendix A provides a brief technical overview of Optima. A more detailed summary of the
model and methods is provided elsewhere (Kerr and others 2015). Optima is based on a
dynamic, population-based HIV model. Figure A.1a summarizes the populations and mixing
patterns used in Optima. Figure A.1b shows the disease progression implemented in the
model. Optima tracks the entire population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) across 5 stages
of CD4 count. These CD4 count stages are aligned with the progression of the World Health
Organization (WHO) treatment guidelines, namely, acute HIV infection, >500, 350–500, 200–
350, 50–200, and 50 cells per microliter. Key aspects of the antiretroviral therapy (ART)
service delivery cascade are included: from infection to diagnosis, ART initiation on first-line

     Note: Each compartment represents a single population group with the specified health state. Each arrow
     represents the movement of numbers of individuals among health states. All compartments except for
     “susceptible” represent individuals living with HIV. Death includes all causes of death.

     The model uses a linked system of ordinary differential equations to track the movement of
     PLHIV among HIV health states. The full set of equations is provided in the supplementary
     material to a summary paper on the Optima model. The overall population is partitioned in
     two ways: by population group and by HIV health state. Individuals are assigned to a given
     population group based on their dominant risk.6 HIV infections occur through the interactions
     among different populations by regular, casual, or commercial (including transactional) sexual
     partnerships; through sharing of injecting equipment; or through mother-to-child
     transmission. The force-of-infection is the rate at which uninfected individuals become
     infected. The rate depends on the number and type of risk events to which individuals are
     exposed in a given period (either within their population groups or through interaction with
     other population groups) and the infection probability of each event. Mathematically, the force
     of- infection has the general form:



     where λ is the force-of-infection, β is the transmission probability of each event, and n is the
     effective number of at-risk events (that is, n gives the average number of interaction events
     with HIV-infected people through which HIV transmission may occur). The value of the
     transmission probability β varies across CD4 count compartments (indirectly reflecting the
     high viral load at early and late stages of infection); differs for different modes of transmission
     (intravenous drug injection with a contaminated needle-syringe, penile-vaginal or penile-anal
     intercourse, and mother-to-child); and may be reduced by behavioral interventions (for
     example, condom use), biological interventions (for example, male circumcision), or ART.

     There is one force-of-infection term for each type of interaction, for example, casual sexual
     relationships between male sex workers and female sex workers (FSW). The force-of-infection


     6   However, to capture important cross-modal types of transmission, relevant behavioral parameters can be set to
         non-zero values (for example, males who inject drugs may engage in commercial sex; some MSM may have
         female sexual partners).
Appendix A                                                                                                              29



for a given population will be the sum of all interaction types.7 In addition to the force-of-
infection rate, which is the number of individuals who become infected with HIV per year,
there are seven other ways by which individuals can change health states.8 The change in the
number of people in each compartment is determined by the sum over the relevant rates
described above multiplied by the population size of the compartments on which they act.9




7   For sexual transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
       HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in partner populations
       Average number of casual, regular, and commercial homosexual and heterosexual acts per person per year
       Proportion of these acts in which condoms are used
       Proportion of men who are circumcised
       Prevalence of sexually transmissible infections (which can increase HIV transmission probability)
       Proportion of acts that are covered by pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis
       Proportion of partners on antiretroviral treatment (art)
       Efficacies of condoms, male circumcision, post-exposure prophylaxis, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and art at
        preventing HIV transmission.
    For injecting-related transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
       HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in populations of people who use a syringe and then share it
       Number of injections per person per year
       Proportion of injections made with shared equipment
       Fraction of people who inject drugs on opioid substitution therapy and its efficacy in reducing injecting
        behavior.
    For mother-to-child transmission, the number of-infections is determined by:
       Birth rate among women living with HIV
       Proportion of women with HIV who breastfeed
       Probability of perinatal HIV transmission in the absence of intervention
       Proportion of women receiving prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), including ART.
8   First, individuals may die, either because of an average background death rate for that population (which is
    greater for older populations or for people who inject drugs) or because of HIV/AIDS (which depends on CD4
    count). Second, in the absence of treatment, individuals progress from higher to lower CD4 counts. Third,
    individuals can move from undiagnosed to diagnosed states based on their HIV testing rate, which depends on
    CD4 count (for example, people with AIDS symptoms or primary HIV infection may have a higher testing rate)
    and population type (for example, FSW may test more frequently than males in the general population). Fourth,
    diagnosed individuals may commence ART at a rate depending on CD4 count. Fifth, individuals may experience
    treatment failure due to lack of adherence to therapy or development of drug resistance. Sixth, people may
    initiate second and subsequent lines of treatment after treatment failure. Finally, while on successful first- or
    second-line treatment (that is, effective viral suppressive therapy), individuals may progress from lower to
    higher CD4 counts.
9   For example, the change in the number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–350
    cells per microliter is:




    where UFSW2002350 is the current number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–
    350 cells per microliter; UFSW3502500 is the same population but with higher CD4 count (350–500 cells/mL); t
    is the disease progression rate for the given CD4 count (where 1/t is the average time to lose 150 CD4 cells/mL);
    m is the death rate; and h is the HIV testing rate. (Note: This example does not consider movement among
    populations, such as FSW returning to the general female population and vice versa—something which is
    included in Optima.)

     Each compartment (Figure A.1b, boxes) corresponds to a single differential equation in the
     model, and each rate (Figure A.1b, arrows) corresponds to a single term in that equation. Table
     A.1 lists the parameters used in Optima; most of these are used to calculate the force of
     infection. The analysts interpret empirical estimates for model parameter values in Bayesian
     terms as previous distributions. The model then must be calibrated: finding posterior
     distributions of the model parameter values so+ that the model generates accurate estimates
     of HIV prevalence, the number of people on treatment, and any other epidemiological data that
     are available (such as HIV-related deaths). The calibration can be performed automatically,
     manually, or a combination. Model calibration and validation normally should be performed in
     consultation with governments in the countries in which the model is being applied.

     HIV Resource Optimization and Program Coverage Targets
     A novel component of Optima is its ability to calculate allocations of resources that optimally
     address one or more HIV-related objectives (for example, impact-level targets in a country’s
     HIV national strategic plan). Because this model also calculates the coverage levels required to
     achieve these targets, Optima can be used to inform HIV strategic planning and the
     determination of program coverage levels. The key assumptions of resource optimization are
     the relationships among (1) the cost of HIV programs for specific target populations, (2) the
     resulting coverage levels of targeted populations with these HIV programs, and (3) how these
     coverage levels of HIV programs for targeted populations influence behavioral and clinical
     outcomes. Such relationships are required to understand how incremental changes in
Appendix A                                                                                                               31



spending (marginal costs) affect HIV epidemics.10 Logistic functions can incorporate initial
start-up costs and enable changes in behavior to saturate at high spending levels, thus better
reflecting program reality. The logistic function has the form:




where L(x) relates spending to coverage; x is the amount of funding for the program; A is the
lower asymptote value (adjusted to match the value of L when there is no spending on a
program); B is the upper asymptote value (for very high spending); C is the midpoint; and D is
the steepness of the transition from A to B. For its fits, the team typically chose saturation
values of the coverage to match behavioral data in countries with heavily funded HIV
responses.11 To perform the optimization, Optima uses a global parameter search algorithm
called Bayesian adaptive locally linear stochastic descent (BALLSD). BALLSD is similar to
simulated annealing in that it makes stochastic downhill steps in parameter space from an
initial starting point. However, unlike simulated annealing, BALLSD chooses future step sizes
and directions based on the outcome of previous steps. For certain classes of optimization
problems, the team has shown that BALLSD can determine optimized solutions with fewer
function evaluations than traditional optimization methods, including gradient descent and
simulated annealing.

While all HIV interventions have some direct or indirect non-HIV benefits, some programs
including opiate substitution therapy (OST) or conditional cash transfers, have multiple
substantial proven benefits across different sectors. Such additional benefits were reflected by
using the approach of a cross-sectoral financing model to effectively distribute the costs in
accordance with the benefits. By adapting standard techniques from welfare economics to
attribute the benefits of OST programs across the benefiting sectors, it was estimated that
average HIV-related benefits are approximately only 10 percent of the overall health and social
benefits of OST. Therefore, only 10 percent of the OST cost was included in the optimization
analysis.

Uncertainty Analyses
Optima uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for performing automatic
calibration and for computing uncertainties in the model fit to epidemiological data. With this
algorithm, the model is run many times (typically, 1,000–10,000) to generate a range of
epidemic projections. Their differences represent uncertainty in the expected epidemiological
trajectories. The most important assumptions in the optimization analysis are associated with
the cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves. To incorporate uncertainty in these curves,




10   A traditional approach is to apply unit cost values to inform a linear relationship between money spent and
     coverage attained. This assumption is reasonable for programs such as an established ART program that no
     longer incurs start-up or initiation costs. However, the assumption is less appropriate for condom promotion and
     behavior change communication programs. Most HIV programs typically have initial setup costs, followed by a
     more effective scale-up with increased funding. However, very high coverage levels have saturation effects
     because these high levels require increased incremental costs due to generating demand and related activities for
     the most difficult-to-reach groups. Optima uses a logistic function fitted to available input data to model cost–
     coverage curves (Appendix 2).
11   Program coverage for zero spending, or behavioral outcomes for zero coverage of formal programs, is inferred
     using data from early on in the epidemic or just before significant investment in HIV programs. Practically, the
     team also discussed the zero and high spending cases with local experts, who could advise on private sector HIV
     service delivery outside the governments’ expenditure tracking systems. For each HIV program, the team derived
     one set of logistic curves that related funding to program coverage levels and another set of curves (generally,
     linear relationships) that related coverage levels to clinical or behavioral outcomes (the impacts that HIV
     strategies aim to achieve).
32                                                                   Optimizing investments in Moldova’s HIV Response



     users define upper and lower limits for both coverage and behavior for no spending and for
     very high spending.12




     12   All available historical spending data and achieved outcomes of spending, data from comparable settings,
          experience, and extensive discussion with stakeholders in the country of application can be used to inform these
          ranges. All logistic curves within these ranges then are allowable and are incorporated in Optima uncertainty
          analyses. These cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves thus are reconciled with the epidemiological,
          behavioral, and biological data in a Bayesian optimal way, thereby enabling the calculation of unified uncertainty
          estimates.

Calibration was performed using Armenia’s HIV data for 2000–15 including all available
demographic, epidemiological, behavioral, and clinical data. These calibrations were produced
in collaboration with Armenian government representatives and experts.

APPENDIX C.            COST-COVERAGE-OUTCOME CURVES
Following the calibration of HIV prevalence and treatment data, cost-outcome curves were
developed for the nine programs included in the optimization. These curves define the
relationship between program expenditure and respective outcomes (such as HIV testing rate,
condom use per population, or number of people on ART) and are critical for the optimization
analysis.

Appendix C contains the full set of cost-outcome curves introduced in chapter 3.

A cost-coverage curve represents the level of output (that is, the level of service coverage to a
given population) that can be achieved given a certain amount of spending. An example would
be how many female sex workers would be provided with a standard package of services with
an investment of US$0–US$1,000,000. The association between coverage levels and outcome is
determined in a separate relationship. This relationship describes the proportion of people
who will adopt a specific behavior (such as condom use or consistent use of antiretroviral
therapy leading to viral suppression). The cost-coverage and coverage-outcome relations then
are aggregated into cost-outcome relationships, which directly link money spent to outcome in
form of behavior such as condom use or HIV testing. All of these relationships were produced
in collaboration with national experts for Armenia. Figure C.1 includes the actual cost-outcome
curves for various behaviors and populations.

These cost-coverage curves then are used in the mathematical optimization provided by the
Optima model, which is the analytical step to determine the “best” allocation. In this process,
different objectives (such as minimizing HIV incidence or HIV costs) will yield different
optimal allocations of resources or spending. The model determines the resource allocation
required that best meets the objective.

                        solutions. Doing so requires improving planning, designing service delivery
                        models, and assessing and addressing service delivery “roadblocks.”

                        can reduce the effort required to manipulate these factors and present the
                        results in an accessible format.
Opioid substitution     Medical procedure of replacing an illegal opioid, such as heroin, with a
therapy (OST)           longer acting but less euphoric opioid. Methadone or buprenorphine
                        typically are used, and the drug is taken under medical supervision.

     Opportunistic infection   Treatment given to PLHIV to prevent either a first episode of an OI
     under medical             (primary prophylaxis) or the recurrence of infection (secondary
     (OI prophylaxis)          prophylaxis).
     Pre-exposure              Method for people who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk of
     prophylaxis (PrEP)        acquiring it to prevent HIV infection by taking an antiretroviral drug.
     Program effectiveness     Program effectiveness incorporates evaluations to establish what works
                               and impacts disease and/or transmission intensity, disseminating
                               proven practice, and improving the public health results of programs.
     Program sustainability    Ability to maintain the institutions, management, human resources,
                               service delivery, and demand generation components of a national
                               response until impact goals have been achieved and maintained over
                               time as intended by the strategy.
     Return on investments     Performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment
     (ROI)                     or to compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. To
                               calculate ROI, the benefit (return) of an investment is divided by the cost
                               of the investment; the result is expressed as a percentage or a ratio.
     Saturation                Maximum level of coverage that a program can achieve.
     Technical efficiency      Delivery of a (health) service in a way that produces maximum output at
                               the lowest possible unit cost while according with operational quality
                               standards.
     Top-down costing          Costing method that divides total expenditure (quantum of funding
                               available) for a given area or policy by total units of activity (such as
                               patients served) to derive a unit cost.
     Universal health          Universal health coverage (UC), is defined as ensuring that all people
     coverage (UC)             have access to the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and
                               palliative health services that they need, of sufficient quality to be
                               effective, while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose
                               the user to financial hardship.
