2   Global Road Safety Facility
Foreword
    As we enter the third year of the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety,
    there is widespread recognition that road traffic crashes and injuries represent an
    unacceptable, and underfunded, public health crisis. According to the Global Status
    Report on Road Safety, 1.24 million people are killed on the world’s roads each year and
    90 percent of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with
    an economic cost that can exceed total overseas aid flowing in. Road traffic injuries are
    already the leading cause of death among youths and young adults between 15-24
    years, ahead of malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis. However, while the Global Fund to fight
    AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has approved funding of over $23.7 billion, current
    committed funding for road safety is far below this.


    Meeting the international goals on road safety thus presents a tough challenge to the
    global community. The World Bank is committed to supporting the Decade of Action for
    Road Safety and the Global Road Safety Facility (GRSF) is an essential part of this effort.
    In 2006, to help address the growing road safety crisis, the Bank established GRSF with
    support from the FIA Foundation for the Automobile and Society, the Government of
    the Netherlands, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, and the
    Australian Agency for International Development. In 2011 and 2013, the Bloomberg
    Philanthropies and the UK Department for International Development became the
    newest contributors to GRSF.


    Since its inception, GRSF has helped the Bank move from a piecemeal approach to road
    safety to a more comprehensive, systematic Safe System approach in its operations.
    In 2008, the Bank made road safety a pillar of its strategy for the transport sector: Safe,
    Clean and Affordable Transport for Development. GRSF contributed to the launch of
    the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety on May 11, 2011 and leads the
    Bank’s participation in the UN Road Safety Collaboration (UNRSC). The MDB Road Safety
    Initiative, which was launched by the World Bank and the Inter- American Development
    Bank in April 2011, is also animated by GRSF.


    This Strategic Plan for 2013-2020 reaffirms the Facility’s mission and sets out how it will
    contribute to the Decade of Action, leveraging the global expertise of the World Bank,
    and working in close collaboration with donors and UNRSC partners. The momentum
    provided by the launch of the Decade of Action with its associated Global Plan and the
    joint MDB initiative offers a timely opportunity to review and re-align the Facility goals
    with the attainment of the associated milestones.


    A sustained commitment by the international development community and substantial
    increase in donor commitments will be needed to meet the Decade goals. We call
    upon our bilateral partners, philanthropies, and the private sector to continue their
    collaboration with GRSF to achieve success during the Decade.

                A Decade of Action
    With the launch of the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, the debate on road safety as a development
    and public health priority for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been laid to rest. The Decade aims to stabilize and
    reduce the number of deaths and seriously injured, saving 5 million lives and avoiding 50 million serious injuries between 2011 and
    2020. The Global Plan of Action for the Decade created under the auspices of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration (UNRSC)
    defines five “Pillars” of road safety:

    •	 Pillar 1: Road Safety Management
    •	 Pillar 2: Safer Roads and Mobility
    •	 Pillar 3: Safer Vehicles
    •	 Pillar 4: Safer Road Users
    •	 Pillar 5: Post-Crash Response
    Indicators have been developed to measure country progress across each of the Pillars. A recent status report 1 covering 182
    countries found alarming gaps in how road safety is managed: while 89% of the countries surveyed reported having established
    a lead agency for road safety, fewer than 20% of them have enacted legislation across the major traffic injury risk factors. These
    figures serve as a baseline for the Decade of Action and provide vital context to country and thematic programs

             The Global Road
             Safety Facility
    The Global Road Safety Facility (GRSF), a global partnership program
    administered by the World Bank, was established in 2006 with a mission to
    help address the growing crisis of road traffic deaths and injuries in low-
    and middle-income countries (LMICs). GRSF provides funding, knowledge,
    and technical assistance designed to leverage road safety investments in
    existing transport operations and scale-up the efforts of LMICs to build
    their scientific, technological and managerial capacities.

    Over the past six years, GRSF has grown into a globally recognized
    institution for funding road safety activities related to lead agency
    development, road infrastructure improvement, monitoring and
    evaluation, and technical assistance in LMICs. GRSF funding has been
    channeled to more than 30 countries spread across all World Bank regions
    and resulted in over US$500 million specifically committed to road safety
    investments.

    The complexity of delivering effective road safety solutions has led GRSF
    to support the shift away from fragmented, one-off interventions (often
    referred to as the “first generation approach”) to a more systematic,
    results-focused approach that recognizes the multi-sectoral nature of
    road safety (called the “second generation” or “Safe System” approach).
    GRSF-supported interventions are aimed at creating an environment
    for countries to sustain safety results across sectors, reinforcing the
    linkages between improved health, economic growth, poverty reduction,
    and community development. In particular, GRSF encourages an
    active dialogue between the transport and health sectors in devising
    interventions that support capacity strengthening, improve data
    collection, and reform post-crash medical care.




            From Advocacy to Implementation
    Since its inception in 2006, the Global Road Safety Facility has been committed to elevating road safety to new levels of
    attention through advocacy and by building partnerships with a range of institutional and civil society actors. As one of
    the primary sponsors of the first Global Ministerial Meeting for Road Safety hosted by the Russian Federation on November
    20, 2009, the Facility played an important role in the launch of the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety and remains
    committed to working with actors of the UN Road Safety Collaboration. GRSF also recognizes the role of NGOS as key
    partners of change and has pledged support to the Global Alliance of NGOs for Road Safety, helping over 140 country-
    based NGOs convince their local authorities of the need to act.


    Going forward, GRSF will increase its support to programs that address the unique challenges of mixed traffic environments
    in a variety of investment settings through technical assistance and knowledge transfer activities across all five Pillars of the
    Global Plan of Action. These trends are reflected in the Facility’s projected disbursements in FY13-15.

      Country Programs
With 90 percent of road traffic fatalities and injuries occurring in LMICs, the World Bank’s clients bear the greatest impact of
this global epidemic. East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia will be particularly hard hit over the next 10 years, accounting
for nearly 62 percent of projected fatalities. Rapidly motorizing and urbanizing Sub-Saharan Africa will also see a substantial
increase in fatalities. The countries in these regions are facing the dual challenge of increased motorization and rapid
infrastructure development and, in a ‘do nothing’ scenario, deaths and injuries are set to spiral unacceptably upwards.
They have the opportunity to bypass this steep learning curve due to the availability of well documented road safety
management practices which can now be applied to effectively implement change. Continued engagement by the Global
Road Safety Facility within each of these regions can prove instrumental in raising the level of political attention and scaling
up commitment to road safety investments.

             GRSF Goals
    GRSF’s mission is to support the Decade of
    Action for Road Safety and the associated
    Global Plan of Action to stabilize and reduce
    road traffic deaths and injuries by 2020.




    GRSF is a catalytic fund designed to help countries achieve
    their Decade of Action goals by targeting investment in
    a manner which can be scaled up to generate substantial
    allocation of national government, development bank,
    and private sector funding towards road safety. GRSF
    measures both the short term outputs of its interventions,
    as well their longer term outcomes. In measuring progress
    towards these objectives and adjusting its workplan
    accordingly, GRSF relies on a variety of sources, including
                                                                              The World Bank honored Zenani Mandela and all the victims of road traffic crashes

                  measurable results that serve as an incentive to client countries to generate additional funding to expand and replicate
                  these activities.

            3.	 Accelerate road safety knowledge transfer - Through twinning programs, peer-to-peer exchanges, research and other
                  capacity-building efforts, the Facility supports the rapid development of client capacity to analyse the causes of road
                  traffic injuries and design effective road safety solutions.

            4.	 Develop client capacity to target high risk roads and apply engineering measures in mixed-traffic, mixed-speed
                  road environments - The Facility encourages the introduction of innovative and country-appropriate infrastructure
                  solutions that recognize the unique traffic mix in these countries and contribute to protecting vulnerable road users.

                How GRSF Works
     GRSF allocates funding in a manner which seeks to maximize road safety impact by country governments and partner
     organizations. Where existing or upcoming investment in road safety can be leveraged, GRSF endeavors to ensure the best
     possible conditions are in place for the activity to be sustainable over time.

     To achieve this leveraging effect, Facility resources are frequently mobilized in the early stages of development projects. GRSF
     monitors the World Bank’s portfolio of active and “pipeline” projects, providing early-stage input and support in the design of road
     safety components that meet the requirements of Safe System projects.

     Requests for support to activities are received on a rolling basis and evaluated against the Facility’s goals as well as their ability
     to affect road safety outcomes at country or regional level. Written government endorsement for activities is preferred, as this
     guarantees stronger country ownership and an outcome-driven focus for our clients.

     A Shared Approach to Managing Road Safety
     November 2009


     Joint Statement by the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
     European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank and the World Bank.

     Global call for action

      1. We acknowledge the scale of the public health crisis arising from deaths and injuries on the roads of developing and emerging
         countries, the recommendations of the World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention[2], the global call for action from World
         Health Assembly Resolution WHA57.10 (Road safety and health) and UN General Assembly Resolutions 56/289, 60/5 and 62/244
         (Improving global road safety).

     Systematic, multisectoral response

      2. We recognize that a systematic, multisectoral response is required to address this global crisis including interventions that
         improve the safety of road infrastructure, vehicles, road user behavior and post-crash services, and we support the principles
         of the Safe System approach[3] aiming at (i) developing road transport systems prevention, reduction and accommodation of
         human error; (ii) taking into account social costs and impacts of road trauma in the development and selection of investment
         program; (iii) establishing shared responsibility for road safety among all stakeholders; (iv) creating effective and comprehensive
         management and communications structures for road safety; and (v) aligning safety management decision making with
         broader societal decision making to meet economic, human and environmental goals, and to create an environment that
         generates demand for safe road transport products and services. We recognize the relevance of this approach to all countries
         irrespective of their economic or road safety performance. More specifically, we note that a significant and sustained
         contribution to fatality reduction will come from road infrastructure safety improvements.

     Shared approach

      3. We also recognize that our respective organizations expect to remain significantly engaged in the provision of road
         infrastructure in developing and emerging countries over the coming decade, and beyond, and we commit to share our
         organizational practices and knowledge to support (i) the strengthening of road safety management capacity of our clients;
         (ii) the implementation of safety approaches in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of road infrastructure
         projects, particularly to improve safe access and protection for vulnerable road users who represent a significant proportion of
         the people served by the projects we finance; (iii) the improvement of safety performance measures; and (iv) the mobilization
         of resources for road safety.

      4. To achieve this approach we will share the complementary skills and practices we each develop in our respective operations in
         the areas of:

         (i) Strengthening road safety management capacity
              •	 Help establish country-specific mechanisms for improving road safety management functions and safety practices
                    aiming at achieving the sustainable, effective, and cost-efficient reduction of road casualties.
              •	 Create awareness for safety in order to achieve informed decisions by countries on the planning, design, construction,
                    operation and maintenance of road infrastructure assets and networks.
              •	 Improve communications, cooperation, and collaboration among global, regional and country institutions in the area of
                    road safety and facilitate the dissemination of up-to-date safety-related information.
              •	 Provide our staff development and training to facilitate the successful implementation of shared procedures, guidelines
                    and related tools.

   •	 Contribute to the training of transportation safety professionals in developing and emerging countries by financing
        efforts such as the development of road safety education programs, manuals and training materials promoting good
        practices related to road safety, to facilitate the implementation of improved road safety practices and procedures.
(ii) Implementation of safety approaches in the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of road
    infrastructure projects
   •	   Develop shared procedures, guidelines and related tools to implement a safety approach to the planning, design,
        construction, operation and maintenance of road infrastructure projects.
   •	 Ensure that safety is integrated in all phases of planning, design, construction, appraisal, operation and maintenance
        of road infrastructure.
   •	 Promote the adoption of good practice, proactive approaches to improve the safety of road infrastructure including
        the use of road safety audits, road safety inspections, and road safety impact assessments.
   •	 Develop specific approaches to address the safety requirements of vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists and
        motorcyclists), including a special focus on urban areas where a high proportion of trauma occurs.
(iii) Improvement of safety performance measures
   •	 Promote the establishment of sustainable management systems for road crash data collection, entry, verification,
        storage, retrieving and analysis, including GIS-based applications.
   •	 Promote the use of good practice quantitative and qualitative indicators to measure safety results.
   •	 Promote the development, piloting, and objective validation of innovative safety indicators, such as the safety rating
        of roads.
(iv) Mobilization of resources for road safety
   •	 Transfer road safety knowledge and experience across and within our organizations, and to our global, regional and
        country partners.
   •	 Support the mobilization of additional domestic and external resources for road safety.
   •	 Support the mission and goals of the Global Road Safety Facility in its promotion of innovative solutions to road safety
        issues.
   •	 Establish as needed an expert technical group comprising staff from our respective organizations and international
        specialists to assist in the development of shared approaches to road safety.
   •	 Identify, and pursue opportunities for scaling up road safety in countries strategies.
