                                             Overview

As of January 4, 2015 Liberia has reported over 8,000 cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), and nearly
3,500 deaths. In recent weeks, however, the crisis has shown signs of being brought under control, with
daily confirmed cases down from twenty-five in November 2014 to ten in early December 2014. In
addition, a number of health and travel restrictions have been lifted, and most closed markets
reopened.

The World Bank Group, with the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services and the
Gallup Organization, has continued to monitor the socio-economic impacts of EVD on households
through a series of mobile-phone surveys conducted in October, November, and December 2014.
Though the crisis has abated to some degree in Liberia, the negative impacts of EVD remain evident
across all sectors of employment, as well as in the agricultural sector and on food security.

Even with improvements in the health situation, the economy continues to shed jobs faster than they
are replaced. Nearly half of Liberian household heads remain out of work despite response-related jobs
being created in the construction and health fields. The job losses seen in the most recent round of data
collection were predominantly among wage workers in urban areas. As most public sector workers have
not been working since the crisis began, the new losses come from the private and non-governmental
sectors. And while public sector employees are still receiving salaries, the newly unemployed represent
lost income for households. Women are particularly vulnerable as the labor market stagnates, since they
work disproportionately in hard-hit non-farm self-employment sector. Of those working at the baseline,
by December, 60 percent of the women surveyed were not currently working, compared with 40
percent of men; and, across all three rounds, women were consistently more likely to be out of work
compared with men.

In the agricultural sector, there are new concerns about farmers’ ability to organize work teams given
Ebola fears, reducing harvests. Among the households surveyed that had finished their harvest, over 80
percent reported that their harvest was smaller this year than last, and the main reason cited was an
inability to work in groups due to the Ebola virus. This was also the main reason cited by those with
crops still in the field as to why the harvest had not been completed. With the large pool of
unemployed, it is not clear if the shortages are greater this year than in years past, and if they are
caused by mobility difficulties, fear of infection, or other unknown reasons.

As in the previous rounds of data collection, food insecurity persists across the country and
households continue to lack the money needed to purchase rice, regardless of price. About three-
quarters of households indicated that they were worried at some point in the previous week that they
would not have enough to eat. Around two-thirds of households responded that they were not able to
purchase enough rice to meet their needs in the previous two weeks, and nearly 80 percent of those
cited a lack of money as the main reason.




                                                                                                       3
Households across Liberia have undertaken various mechanisms to cope with Ebola’s socio-economic
effects. Eighty percent of those surveyed had either sold assets, sold or slaughtered livestock, borrowed
money, sent their children to live elsewhere, spent savings, or delayed investments since the start of the
Ebola crisis— all of which can have negative long-term effects on their welfare. Those in the south-
easternmost counties, historically the poorest region of the country, were the most likely to undertake
these coping strategies, even though they are among the least directly affected by EVD.

Data collection will continue monthly for the foreseeable future, to continue a timely and robust
monitoring of how Ebola is affecting the Liberian economy and Liberian households in particular. As in
the previous rounds, it is clear that EVD has extensive impacts, and that relief efforts need to look at not
just the most affected areas, but also the poorest and most vulnerable for whom the economic side
effects of the disease may have the most far-reaching consequences.

Objective
The Economic Impact of Ebola survey is a high frequency cell phone survey designed to monitor the
socio-economic impacts of the ongoing Ebola crisis in Liberia. The survey has been conducted in three
rounds from October to December 2014. The sample is based on the nationally representative
Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) implemented from February to August 2014 by the
Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS). This effort was designed to provide
rapid indicators of well-being from households across the country at a time when conducting a
traditional face-to-face survey is extremely challenging. The survey was conducted by phone, and
attempted to contact all households that participated in the HIES and for which cell phone numbers
were recorded. As in the previous two rounds, low response rates hinder the representativeness of the
survey.

The report begins with an update of the situation in Liberia with regards to the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)
crisis and response at the time of the third round of data collection (December 2 – 8, 2014). This is
followed by updates on employment, prices, food security, and migration. This report is meant as a
stand-alone document based on the round 3 data, but further context and methodological information
on data collection and weight calculations can be found in the previous report covering rounds 1 and 2.


Background
The EVD health crisis continued to abate through November and early December with new infections
gradually slowing, prompting a lifting of some of the health restrictions which had been in place. By
early December, around ten new cases were being confirmed each day, compared with around 25
confirmed new cases daily in early November, when the previous survey round was conducted, and
peaks approaching 100 in mid-September. As shown in figure 1, the total number of deaths per week
has also declined substantially. Montserrado county, which contains the capital Monrovia, has seen the
number of new deaths almost halved compared to the previous round, though there have been spikes in
infection in some areas which had previously been thought to be under control. In addition, the
President modified the state of emergency restrictions on November 13, reducing curfew hours,
reopening most closed markets, and relaxing some domestic travel restrictions. Most government
employees have not yet returned to work, however, and schools remain closed.

Employment
Despite the improving health situation and increased humanitarian assistance, there has not been a
rebound in employment. Overall there was a small increase in the percentage of household heads that
are not currently working, which is mainly concentrated in wage employment in urban areas, although
the change is not statistically significant. Neither wage nor non-agricultural self-employment has
increased as a result of the normalizing health situation. Since public sector workers have not been
working in all three rounds, the declines in the urban wage sector indicate that the private sector
continues to shed jobs. See figure 2 on the following page for further detail.

About 20 percent of total wage workers are in the public sector and therefore continue to receive
their salary. Since public sector workers continue to be paid, the welfare impacts of the loss of wage
employment are smaller than implied by the decline in employment. According to the HIES baseline
data, approximately 20 percent of wage workers are in the public sector. More than half of wage
employees work in the private sector, and the remaining quarter work for NGOs, cooperatives, religious
organizations, international organizations, and political parties; these workers are unlikely to be still
receiving a salary if not currently working. Also, those wage workers outside the public sector may have
seen decreases in the number of hours worked or salary received, which would have a negative impact
on household income even for those that continue to work.

Source : Results from HIES baseline survey (January – August 2014) and three rounds of high frequency phone
survey (October – December 2014)
Note: Approximately five percent of respondents have switched sectors between baseline and round 3. Due to the
method used to present the above findings, it is difficult to show these changes on the graph and therefore those
that have switched are presented as still part of their original sector. Because the high frequency survey attempts
to contact all potential respondents in every round of the survey, the composition of respondents varies in each
round. To compare estimates across rounds, the share of the original baseline population that is working at the
time of each round is estimated for each sector. This percentage is then applied to the baseline share of that
sector. For example, 60 percent (weighted) of baseline wage workers were still working by round 1. Wage
workers represented 44 percent (weighted) of all workers at baseline. Therefore, 26 percent is reported as the
share of baseline workers who are wage workers in Round 1.

                                                                                                                 8
The main constraints for the non-agriculture self-employed appear to have changed since earlier
rounds. Since only respondents that are newly not working in a specific round are asked why they are
no longer working, the sample size is limited for this analysis and therefore should be interpreted with
caution. In the first round, about half of those who were no longer working in self-employment cited
closure of their usual place of business as the primary reason, with the second most cited reason being
travel restrictions. In the second round, nearly all respondents who had recently stopped their self-
employment activities cited the closure of the usual place of business. By the third round, the most
common reasons are a lack of operating capital and a lack of customers. Also in round 3, those self-
employed who were still operating their businesses were asked about the main challenge to improving
this business. The two most common responses were again a lack of capital and few customers.

This finding raises concerns that many of the self-employed may have been forced to use their working
capital for consumption during the period when markets were closed. Now, as the situation begins to
normalize, they lack the resources to restart their business, and may also be hesitant to do so until they
perceive a rebound in demand. Even for those still operating their business, a lack of working capital to
return to previous levels of operation and a lack of customers due to the general economic contraction
would lower incomes and negatively impact household welfare. In contrast, for those involved in wage
employment, there has been no change over the three rounds. The main reason for not working has
consistently been that the business or government office was closed.

The economy has shed jobs faster than they can be replaced. With the continuing expansion of the aid
response, the economy has added jobs in recent weeks mainly in the construction and health fields.
These jobs, however, have not been sufficient to offset the overall decline due to the general economic
slowdown. Figure 3 shows the employment transitions between the baseline and round 3. Most job
losses were recorded between the baseline and the first round. As the baseline was conducted over a
number of months, it is difficult to separate the seasonal effects from job losses occurring since the start
of the EVD crisis. Between rounds 1 and 3, however, there were further net job losses in a period which
corresponds to the harvest / post-harvest months when employment usually rises. A small percentage
of workers switched sectors by the third round. The changes shown in the graph correspond to only
four observations in the dataset, for which two switched from paid employment to non-agricultural self-
farm, one from non-farm self-employment to agriculture, and one from agriculture to non-farm self-
employment.

Women are particularly vulnerable to employment loss as they are disproportionately working in non-
farm self-employment. In round 3 of the cell phone survey, 60 percent of women were not currently
working, compared with 40 percent of men. In the panel component of the sample, about 10 percent of
women reported working in all three rounds, compared with more than 40 percent of men, and more
than half of women have not been working in all three rounds. Prior to the EVD crisis, self-employment
was dominated by women, with 63 percent of working women generally, and 42 percent of working
female household heads, employed in this sector. This placed women in employment that has been
more vulnerable to the economic impact of the crisis.

Agriculture
The latest survey suggests increased concern for the agricultural sector due to shortages of available
labor. Although the number of observations for rural areas is limited due to low response rates, round 3
data shows that of the just over half of agricultural households that indicate the main harvest of food
crops has been completed, more than 80 percent reported a smaller harvest this year than last. Though
a diverse set of reasons were cited, the most frequent reason was the inability to work in groups
because of the Ebola virus. Similarly, for those with crops still in the field, the main reason cited for the
harvest not being completed was the inability to work in groups. These findings point to difficulties in
accessing the necessary labor for agricultural activities despite the recent substantial losses in
employment nationally. Because no comparable baseline exists, it is not clear how much of the
shortage is due to mobility difficulties, fear of infection, or other reasons, or how much of the shortage
would have existed even in the absence of EVD.

Cash crops, in particular rubber cultivation, may also have been affected. Rubber is a continuously
harvested cash crop and an important source of household income, and more than half of the
agricultural households indicated that they cultivated rubber in the previous year. Of these households,
however, just over half indicated that they have been able to harvest rubber since the start of the Ebola
crisis, though substantial recent declines in rubber prices have likely also contributed to the reduction.
Similarly to rubber, about half of agricultural households indicated that they cultivated cocoa in the
previous year. Of these, about three-quarters have harvested cocoa this year, though the harvest

                                                                                                          10
period is still ongoing. It should be noted that these conclusions are based on an extremely small
sample size, about 65 observations for each rubber and cocoa, and should therefore be interpreted with
considerable caution.


Prices
Rice prices remain above the seasonal average. The limited historical data available indicates that
there is usually a decline in prices beginning in November with the harvest to a low in January. Prices in
2014, however, have remained elevated into December, despite an eight-percent appreciation in the
exchange rate since May 15, 2014, which would be expected to decrease the cost for imported rice. The
overall price increase remains about 40 percent over the January baseline. The delayed end to the
annual rains and labor shortages noted above have postponed the completion of the harvest in some
areas, which will likely decrease prices in the coming weeks, as will the continued distribution of food
aid. Future rounds of the survey will continue to monitor prices. Figure 4 shows the estimated price
change by month for a 50 kg bag of rice from a January baseline in 2014 as well as the combined
average for 2012 and 2013.1

  In the HIES the question refers specifically to imported rice while in the first two rounds of high frequency phone
survey, the question was more general. The third round questionnaire now specifically refers to imported rice. As
local rice is generally less expensive than imported rice any bias in the measure would understate levels in October
and November. This impact, however, is likely to be small due to the large percentage (estimated by FAO to be up
to 80 percent) of Liberia rice which is imported.


                                                                                                                  11
A lack of money, rather than availability or high prices, continues to be the main problem with
meeting rice needs. As in rounds 1 and 2, about 65 percent of households in round 3 indicated that
they were not able to purchase enough rice to meet their needs as some point in the previous two
weeks. The main reason continues also to be that the household did not have enough money, rather
than the price being too high or rice being unavailable. This indicates that households believe it is a lack
of income rather than the high prices contributing to food insecurity, and that a decline in prices without
a rebound in employment may not alleviate the problem. The percentage citing a lack of money has
increased from 66 percent in round 1 to 76 percent in round 2 to 80 percent in round 3, a statistically
significant difference between the first and third rounds.

continue into the third round and overall levels       10%
of food insecurity remain high. Among the               0%

percent cited food insecurity in at least one of Source: Cross sectional estimates from cell phone survey
the rounds. About half expressed these
concerns in all three rounds. A number of factors likely contribute to food insecurity, including a loss of
household income, high prices for rice, transportation issues, and border closures, but it is not possible
from these data to assess their relative contributions to the overall total.

However, there is no correlation between county-level food insecurity and incidence of EVD. There is
no correlation between the total number of deaths in a county and the incidence of food insecurity.
This is consistent with the earlier finding on employment that the negative effects of EVD are national.
Specifically with regard to food security, it is likely that feeding centers established in conjunction with
treatment units have offset some of the negative impacts in highly-affected areas.

Coping strategies for food insecurity have not changed between rounds. Among those households
with food security concerns, generally there have not been any significant changes in the frequency or
type of coping strategies employed over rounds, with the exception of a significant reduction in the

                                                                                                         12

Other widespread economic coping strategies could harm long-term household well-being. If
households are forced to sell or consume productive assets, they are less likely to be able maintain or
improve their welfare levels in the future. Eighty percent of respondents indicated having taken one or
more of the following actions since the Ebola crisis began: sell assets, such as tools, furniture, machines,
jewelry, etc.; sell or slaughter livestock; borrow money from others; send children to live with other
relatives; spend savings; delay investments. The most common were borrowing money, spending
savings, and delaying investments, which approximately 40 percent of respondents indicating each since
the start of the EVD crisis. The need to undertake these strategies did not vary over urban and rural
areas, though residents of the south-easternmost counties (Grand Kru, River Gee, and Maryland) were
more likely to do so. These counties have been among the least directly affected by EVD, but are
historically among the poorest areas of the country. Since there is no other comparable data for non-
crisis years, it is not possible to investigate if these coping strategies are regular necessities or driven by
the EVD crisis.


Migration
Migration has been increasing. In round 1, approximately seven percent of households indicated that a
regular household member had left the household. By the second and third rounds, the percentages
were 13 percent and 18 percent, respectively. In all three rounds, migrants were most likely to remain
within their original county, with the second more common destination being Monrovia. In addition,
the third round included a question about returning household members. The source for returnees
mirrored the destination for departures. This lack of systematic movement from one area to another,
from highly-affected to less-affected areas for example, indicates the migration is likely more similar to
standard migration patterns than related to the EVD crisis, with an magnitude accompanying the
reduction in travel restrictions.

Conclusion
There have been reductions in the infection rate for Ebola Virus Disease in Liberia, and an accompanying
lessening of some restrictions related to economic activity. The employment situation, however, has
been slow to rebound. Though the overall number of Liberians not working has not substantially
changed since November 2014, there has been a further contraction of the non-governmental wage
sector in urban areas. This is significant because unlike the public sector, the newly unemployed are
unlikely to continue to be paid. Also, while the non-farm self-employment sector has not seen further
losses in terms of jobs, the main constraints have shifted from closed markets and travel restrictions to a
lack of customers and operating capital. Female-headed households have been negatively impacted as
they are disproportionately involved in self-employment activities. New evidence also suggests possible
issues in the agricultural sector, particularly in relation to the labor needed to harvest food crops. There
are also some initial indications of declines in rubber harvesting, an important cash crop for many
households. Across all three main sectors of employment, the crisis continues to impact household
incomes, through lost jobs or reduced hours in wage employment, closed or contracted businesses in
self-employment, and loss of income from cash crops in agriculture.

High levels of reported food insecurity persist, despite the continuation of the harvest period. There has
been no change in rural areas between rounds 2 and 3, following a modest improvement between
rounds 1 and 2. Rice prices also remain elevated. Coping strategies for food insecurity have not
changed between rounds, but new information on wider economic coping mechanisms have raised
concerns about EVD’s long term impact on households’ ability to maintain or improve welfare. Eighty
percent of respondents have reported either selling or consuming productive assets or delaying
investments since the start of the EVD crisis. The incidence of these actions was highest in the southeast
of the country, an area with low levels of Ebola infections but high poverty and vulnerability, though
there is no comparable baseline data to estimate the impact of EVD compared to non-crisis years.
Overall there is little evidence that the negative economic consequences of Ebola have been
concentrated in highly-affected counties. Impacts on employment, food security, and prices are found
across Liberia. This supports previous findings that the crisis has been national in scope and that many
in need may be outside of the areas directly affected by Ebola.
